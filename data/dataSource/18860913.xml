                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the General Registry Office for Shipping, at the Custom House—the official record of transactions, and the ownership of shares in ships are kept there—the registers of vessels are kept at the port of registry—I produce the transactions in reference to the <hi rend="italic">Charles Howard</hi> for the year 1885—the last transaction in 1884 was the registration of a bill of sale for one share from Mr. Lycett to Mr. Wright on 6th December—that left Mr. Lycett without any shares in the ship—on 16th January, 1885, an application was made by the prisoner for liberty to search the chip's register—he also applied for a</p>

               <p>copy of the last transaction, and on 17th January, the copy having been made, would be handed over to Mr. Lycett in the ordinary course—on that paper there was a copy of the last transaction, and a copy of the names of the shareholders—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an official copy of the documents that would be handed out to the person in pursuance of such an application—there are numerous clerks in the office. (<hi rend="italic">This document showed the number of shareholders to be</hi> 64, <hi rend="italic">and that on</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th February</hi>, 1885, <hi rend="italic">two shares were held by the prisoner jointly with his sister.</hi>) The shares are numbered consecutively—the bill of sale of Lycett to Wright is registered as No. 77—on 6th February, 1885, I find that a bill of sale transaction No. 78 is registered as two shares transferred by Herbert Edwin Lycett and sister, as joint owners, to Forest Lycett—that left the prisoner the registered owner of two shares, and he remained so down to 21st February, 1885, when there was a bill of sale from the prisoner to Mr. Rains, dated 21st February, 1885, transferring one share—that left the prisoner the registered owner of one share—on 4th March, 1885, there is registered a transaction, No. 80, of a transfer to Burrows by the pri<lb/>soner on a bill of sale registered March 4th—on 12th May there is a bill of sale registered of a transfer by the prisoner to Nicholls of the share No. 84—there is next a transaction No. 95 one share, date of registry 19th November, 1885, transferor the prisoner, transferee Ayres, bill of sale, dated 3rd December, 1884—that left the prisoner without any share.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The documents do not show the prices at which the shares were transferred—these are peculiar documents, under the Mer<lb/>chant Shipping Act—the history of these transactions extends from No. 1 to 104. (<hi rend="italic">The witness read in detail the transactions.</hi>) The ship is regis<lb/>tered as 844 tons net, or 1304 gross, 120 horse-power, 249 feet long and 30 broad; she was built in 1866—I do not know what the amount of the insurance on her was at that time—I do not know that bills of sale often come in for registration where there are no shares to answer for them—the bill of sale to Mr. Skeels is dated 11th February, 1885—from that date to the 21st that bill of sale could have lean registered if in order, and Mr. Skeels would then have been the owner of those two shares—I cannot say whether any attempt had been made to register between 11th and 21st February—that would be done at the port of registry.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and carry on business with my brother at 14, West India Dock Road—in June, 1883, I purchased from the prisoner two shares in the ship <hi rend="italic">Charles Howard</hi>—at the time I pur<lb/>chased those shares there was an arrangement between us—I said it was not convenient to register the shares, and that I wished to keep the bill of sale unregistered, and I explained to him the reason, that being in business, and having no influence to give work to people in connection with this ship, persons for whom I worked might come and ask me to use my influence with the managing owner of the ship to give them work, and not being able to do so, that might influence them prejudi<lb/>cially against me—I received this letter from the prisoner on 7th or 8th June, 1883, enclosing hill of sale for the two shares—I was to let him</p>

               <p>know when I registered it; I was to hold it over—up to the beginning of last year I had a large number of bills of sale which I had not regis<lb/>tered—I think it is not uncommon for persons to hold them up to the time of registering; you are not then liable to calls on the ship—from June, 1883, to January, 1885, dividends were paid to me on the two shares by the prisoner—in January, 1885, I sent my bill of sale to Sunderland with the declaration of ownership for the purpose of having it registered—it was not registered—I received it back—I produce a letter from the prisoner dated 4th February, 1885, addressed to my brother Thomas requesting to see me—I was out of town at the time—I did not receive a telegram from the prisoner—I received this letter of February 5th, requesting me to call—I produce a letter of 6th February from the pri<lb/>soner to my brother Thomas while I was still away. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed certain alleged false statements issued to the shareholders by Mr. Suart, and requested witness to send one share to be registered, that he might be able to take the chair at a meeting of shareholders at Cannon Street next day.</hi>) I did not send up my bill of sale to be registered at that time, I sent it up in January—I placed the matter in the hands of my solicitors, and they wrote to the prisoner applying for the amount I had paid for the shares—this letter of 20th February, 1885, is in the prisoner's handwriting—it was after<lb/>wards shown to me by Messrs. Keen and Co., my solicitors—this letter of 25th February to Messrs. Keen and Co. is also the prisoner's writing; also this letter of 4th March.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not hear-till after the first meeting that I was requested to register the shares and to be chairman—I don't know where the steamer was then, I think she was in the Surrey Commercial Dock—I don't remember whether my last dividend was paid in November, 1883, or whether the vessel earned anything after that date—I gave 458<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the two shares in June, 1883—the trading of steamers has been very disastrous for the last 18 months—none of the steamers that I am interested in have made calls on the owners, although they have not paid dividends—I am interested in many steamers; with the exception of two or three they have not paid dividends—these engines were eight years old—it was not proposed at the meeting that there should be an outlay for new engines—I know there was a proposal for new boilers; she had been under repair at Lisbon, I don't know to what extent—I never did register my shares, I tried to do so; I should have done so if I had known I was going to be done out of them—I would have registered in January, notwithstanding the debt at Lisbon—it was for my own con<lb/>venience that I did not register—I did not inquire as to what would be the probable contribution I should have to pay if I had registered—I sent my bill of sale in, I can't say at what date exactly, I think it was the 21st January; it came back.</p>

               <p>he did not say he wanted the money for disbursements for the ship, he did not mention the ship; I think I knew he was managing owner, but he did not tell me what the money was for—I did not know that he had been trained to a seafaring life and had a mate's certificate; I believe I knew that he had commanded a vessel—I did not know that he had speculated in buying this ship from Mr. Briggs, I did not know how he had got it—I did not know he had been managing owner of this ship from 1882; at the time he came to me I knew he was so—he said he only required the money for a short time, and he would give me 6 per cent—he gave me an I O U, and in return I gave him the cheque—I was to call at his office the following day for the bill of exchange; I left a note, and the bill of exchange came on the Tuesday—it is utterly false that nothing was said about the shares in the ship until he had the cheque in his pocket—I knew he had not got the shares with him—the bill of sale came to me on Wednesday morning, 21st February, before 11 o'clock—I never made any attempt to register—I did not see the prisoner on the Monday morning about 11 o'clock before the meeting took place—I did not go to the meeting—I knew afterwards that he was removed from the office of managing owner; I do not think I knew it till July, when I placed the matter in my solicitor's hands—I talked over his affairs with his sister, but I believe she did not know it—I was not shown any cheques of his which he had paid for the purposes of the ship—I understood that the bulk of the money had been used for the ship—he did not tell me about an arbitration; he told me he had a lawsuit; he said he expected 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or some, such sum, as soon as the case was settled, and he thought it would be settled soon—it was not with, my knowledge that Mrs. Lycett endeavoured to arrange this matter; I did not know anything that she was going to do; in fact, I always kept her from the knowledge of it as much as possible—I know that the prisoner is respectably connected, that was partly the reason I lent him the money, I believed he was a man of substance—I knew that his wife was entitled to money in her own right—I did not know that it was proposed that she should out of her private fortune replace this money; that offer has not been made—an offer was made by the defendant's solicitors that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be paid down and the rest should be extended over a number of years on the security of his wife, but I was advised that that was no security; that offer was made about two months ago; that was after the Cannon Street meeting—I attended that meeting—my solicitor did not suggest that instead of being registered as a shareholder I should have a mortgage, he said that was the proper security I should have had—it was not proposed that I should also have his wife's indemnity; that could not have been, because he refused to let his wife do anything in the matter—before the September meeting at Cannon Street I had employed Messrs. Miller, Wiggins, and Naylor for the purpose of corresponding on the subject and to keep me informed of what was going on—by my instruction they wrote this letter of 24th November, 1885—on 23rd July, 1885,1 received this letter from the prisoner, pro<lb/>posing a payment of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of the bill of exchange, leaving a balance of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I handed that to my solicitors to answer, which they did on the 24th.

               <p>him to call next day between 12 and 1 o'clock—there was a meeting at Cannon Street Hotel in September, I cannot say the date—I did not know of the meeting except through the defendant's sister; I knew it was going to take place—I went there alone—I found the defendant there, and his wife and her mother, and one of the trustees of his wife's marriage settlement—on that occasion, when I told him he had only one share, he did not say, "Very well, if I have not I will have a share there at once for you," I do not remember a word about it—I did not say I would not have the shares, I may have said I was advised that they were worthless and that I ought not to register them—I did not insist on having a mortgage and not a bill of sale; I did not say a word about a mortgage—it was not proposed in my presence that the wife or her trustee should guarantee the payment of the instalments; the only thing said on the subject was by the prisoner, who said, "I won't allow anybody to be security or do anything"—at that meeting I alleged that he had been guilty of a crime—he appeared to be very angry—he said unless I withdrew the charge he would not allow his wife or any one to be security—it was under consideration that his wife should be security—I went there at the request of the defendant's sister to see what they would propose—on first entering the room they asked me what I proposed—I said, "I have nothing to propose"—I told the wife's mother the circumstances of the loan; I thought perhaps they did not know the whole facts of his coming down and allowing the money to be advanced—it was after that I said he was guilty of false pretences—I took to January, 1886, before taking out a summons—I went first to the Mansion House, but it was not in their jurisdiction, and I went to a County Bench and got a summons at the end of January or the beginning of February—it was in the July Session that I was to give evidence—I have had communication with Mr. Suart; it is some months since I saw him—I have heard that he is now managing owner of the ship, and that the ship is trading, but I know nothing about it—I went to Miller and Co. to get their advice what I should do—it was my intention to get the money or security for it.</p>

I am managing clerk to Mr. Suart, ship and insurance broker, at 29, Great St. Helena—the defendent prior to 9th Feb., 1885, was the managing owner of the screw steamer <hi rend="italic">Charles Howard</hi>, and he also carried on the business of ship and insurance broker at 29, Great St. Helens—prior to February, 1885, Mr. Suart and Mr. Lycett had had transactions together, and on 4th February Mr. Suart sent out this circular to the shareholders of the <hi rend="italic">Charles Howard</hi>—I believe the insurances had not been renewed, or some had expired—I was present at the meeting of 9th February at the Cannon Street Hotel—the defendant was there—shares were freely offered there at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a senior clerk in the Confidential Inquiry Branch of the General Post-office—in consequence of numerous complaints of loss of letters after delivery, in the neighbourhood of Oxford Street and Regent Street, I was instructed to investigate the matter—on 20th July I made up a letter and enclosed in it a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., drawn on the Chancery Lane branch of the Union Bank of London, and payable to Samuel Nelson or order, and signed J. R, James—that was done by arrangement—I placed that in the letter in an envelope addressed to Mr. Samuel Wilson, 13, Hanover Street, Hanover Square, London, W., and securely fastened it and handed it to. Mr. Settle, a clerk in my office, about 5 p.m., with instructions what to do with it—on the next morning, the 21st, I went to the Chancery Lane branch of the Union Bank with Police-constable Bick of the Post-office about 9 o'clock, when the bank opens—about a quarter-past 10 I saw the pri<lb/>soner come in—I watched him—he went to Mr. Whittle, one of the cashiers—I went to the door of the bank, and stepped back and stood by the side of the prisoner and saw Mr. Whittle paying him some money—Mr. Whittle then handed me the cheque, and I examined the endorsement—the prisoner was standing on my right—I don't know whether he noticed I had the cheque in my hand, as he was taking up the money—as soon as he had done that, and was about to put the cash</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188609130010"/>
               <p>in his pocket I stopped him, and holding up the cheque said "Where did you get this from it? belongs to me, and has been stolen from a letter"—he replied A man in the street gave it to me, and asked me to pet it cashed; I am to meet him outside at the corner of the street"—Bick then took the money from his hands, and we all went out of the bank—Bick walked with the prisoner to the corner of Cursitor Street, and after some few minutes we all returned to the bank—I then said to him "We belong to the Post-office; you will have to go with us there"—before doing so I asked him to write his name and address upon this piece of paper, and he wrote this: "Henry Bond, Macclesfield Cham<lb/>bers"—I then went with Bick and the prisoner and the cheque which Mr. Whittle handed me to the General Post-office—I then said to the prisoner "In consequence of complaints of so many letters being lost containing cheques I enclosed this one," showing him the cheque, "in a letter addressed to Mr. Nelson, of 13, Hanover Street, Hanover Square, and it should have been delivered last night; I have ascertained this morn<lb/>ing from Mr. Nelson that he has not received it; where did you get the cheque from?"—ho then made this statement, which I took down in writing in his presence and read over to him, to which he did not object: "A gentleman gave me the cheque this morning; I met him in the Strand. He said did I wish to earn half-a-crown. I said what was I to do for it. He took me into a public-house at the bottom of Wych Street and showed me a cheque, and asked me to present it at the Union Bank, Chancery Lane. He came with me and showed me the bank and said 'I will wait here at the corner of Cursitor Street. He told me if I was asked to endorse the cheque I was to endorse it 'Henry Hardman,' which I did in front of the cashier." I then showed him this cheque, dated May 3rd, 1881, for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., payable to bearer, with "Mr. Holland" written on the back, not an endorsement—I pointed that out to him, and said "This writing is like yours; this is a cheque we have had com<lb/>plaints of"—he said "I admit the 'H' is a little like my writing, but it is not mine"—there is another cheque also drawn on Messrs. Hoare in favour of Mrs. Nelson for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and dated 21st April, 1886—that had also been stolen, and I told the prisoner so—I then showed him two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cancelled Bank of England notes, and said "These are two of the notes which were paid for the 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, and the writing on the back is also like yours"—the writing on one is "Jackman, Camden Road, Nothing Hill," and on the other is "Jackson, 59, Clarendon Road"—he looked on them and said "I admit the writing is like mine, but it is not my writing on the notes"—I then gave him these names on this paper for him to copy, "C. Simpson, Charles Street, Hammersmith; J. Lambton, Clarendon Street; J. Jackson, 17, John Street," and said "Perhaps you will write these name on this piece of paper and see if you know any<lb/>thing of them or their names"—he said he knew nothing about them—I did not remain in the room all the time he wrote this, but Bick was there, and when I came in again he had written it—I have had some considerable experience in comparing handwriting in cases of this sort—I have carefully compared the various writings produced in Court with the bank notes and the cheques and the writing which he wrote at my request, and I have no hesitation in saying they are all written by the same person.</p>

I am a watchman in the service of Phillips and Graves at Smith's wharf—on Friday, 6th August, I received this barge Severn from the last witness, when she arrived loaded—the barge lay at the South Wharf all Friday, and I saw her on Saturday morning at 4 o'clock; the barge was then all safe and the tarpaulins undisturbed—after 5 o'clock in the morning I heard some shouting from Southwark Bridge—I went to Queenhithe Dock and saw some tarpaulins had been disturbed on the Severn, exposing the cargo.</p>

About a quarter to 2 on the morning of 10th June I was on duty in Great Garden Street, Mile End New Town; that is about 300 yards from where Weir was assaulted—the prisoner passed me; I had a good look at his features, and am con<lb/>fident about him—he was walking in a hurried manner, very fast, from the direction of Pelham Street, and going in the direction of Whitechapel Road—he passed quite close to mo—about 20 minutes to 3 that same morning I went to the piece of waste ground opposite Mrs. Woodland's, and there found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—on 17th August I was at Arbour Square Police-station, and there saw the prisoner among several others; I could not tell how many—I went and looked along them till I came to him, and I tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

Osborne, pro postmaster"—the number 4373 corresponds on the order and advice, and both bear the stamp of the Stratford office, but my writing has been removed from the order—some time after, I went to Bow Street and picked the prisoner out from other men—I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>

Is it a bad one?" Aldridge gave it back to the prisoner, who pulled out a handful of silver and threw down a good half-crown—I said "Would you mind me just having a look at it?"—the prisoner tried the bad half-crown in his teeth, and threw it down, and said "Oh, I will leave it to you"—I said "This is the way to test it," and I turned round to bend it in the engine and the prisoner went away up the street—I identify this as the coin; I gave it back to Aldridge.</p>

I am manager at the Leicester public-house—on Friday evening, 6th August, the prisoner came in for some ale, and tendered a bad shilling, which I broke in two in front of him—I asked him if he had any more money—he said "No"—he said he should not have come in if he had thought the money was bad—he was by himself—on the following Saturday Wells brought me a bad half-crown about 10 o'clock, and I went to the bar, but the prisoner was not there, and I could see nothing of him—an hour later, at 11 o'clock, I saw the pri<lb/>soner and two or three other men in the bar again; they were the same men who had been there at 10 o'clock—I said to Wells in the prisoner' presence" Here is the man that was here on Friday night, and that tendered you the bad half-crown"—the prisoner's companions said "Go," and he went outside—I jumped over the counter, and caught him in Sidney Alley—I sent for a constable, and gave him into custody on the charge of passing the half-crown—this is the half-crown—I gave it to the constable.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 43). I have been eighteen years in the force—about half-past 2 on the morning of 10th June I was on duty in New Castle Street near Mr. Goldschmidt's shop; I was in uniform; I heard the smashing of glass in the distance which I now know was Mr. Goldschmidt's shop—I was about 300 yards away; I went in that direction and saw the prisoner approaching me from Castle Place, from the direction of the shop, with a bundle in his arm, he was walking very fast—the bundle was roughly done up, and he had got hold of the corners of the cloth—I stopped him and asked him what he had got, he said "I have got some clothing"—I asked him where he had it from—he said "I brought it from my house out of New Castle Street"—I asked him where he was going to take it to—he said "A house in the lane"—at that time I had taken hold of his arm—he said "Leave go of my arm"—I said "I shall not"—he said "God blind you, you will"—he then dropped the bundle on the footway and became very violent, and we both fell to the ground on three different occasions—he struggled to get away and I tried to hold him—on the third occasion while I was on the ground I received a blow on the back of the head just behind the ear—I had not drawn my truncheon then—I could not see who gave me the blow—I didn't see any one else there—I then saw the prisoner over me with my truncheon in his hand, and he dealt me seven or eight blows on my head—I was then lying on my right side—while he was doing this I heard him say "God blind me I will kill you"—the effect of these blows on my head was that I could not see for blood, and my hands were nearly smashed in trying to protect my head—I was very severely injured, and about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards I became insensible—the prisoner then went away taking my truncheon with him—some time afterwards I blew my whistle and assistance came—I then found that my truncheon and the bundle had been carried off—I was taken to the police-station and was attended to by Mr. Phillips' assistant and afterwards by Mr. Phillips himself—I have been off duty from that time and am pretty well deaf with the right ear—it took the doctor two hours and a half to dress the wounds, and after that, about half past 5, I think, I gave this description of the man to Inspector Bavington, which he took down at the time. (<hi rend="italic">Reading:</hi> "Description of man wanted; age 35; height, 5 feet 10; complexion, sallow; moustaches, dark, and side whiskers slight; dress, grey suit; black hard felt hat; can be identified")—he read that out to me and asked me if it was right—I knew nothing about Weir at this time, I was very ill—on 2nd July I was taken down to Birmingham and there saw the prisoner and a number of men in plain clothes, and I recognised him again—there were nine men besides the prisoner—as soon as I got inside the door I saw him, and deliberately walked up to him and picked him out—the light was enough on this night for me to see his features; I had him under a gas lamp for about two minutes before the struggle commenced—he had a grey overcoat on then, and he was wearing the same at Birmingham and at Arbour Square Police-court—I am perfectly</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 62). I was on duty in the neighbour<lb/>hood of Whitechapel Road this night, about half-past 2 o'clock I heard a crash; I was some distance away; I ran to the place, towards Mr. Goldschmidt's shop, and saw the two men Chandler and Gravitt—other men were there also—Chandler gave me a description, which I wrote down at the time—I then took it to Leman Street Station, and saw</p>

               <p>it entered in the "Occurrence book" by the inspector, and then I destroyed the paper. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Age 35, height 5 feet 10, no whiskers; dress, light suit, brown felt hat; can be identified by Henry Gravitt and Alfred Chandler, who saw him break into the shop window,") Chandler did not come to the station—I went to the station at once, so that the description might be circulated—Gravitt and several other people were standing together when the description was given.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector H</hi>). On the 21st July I, with Ockwell and several other officers, went down to Birmingham Gaol, where we saw about 10 men in plain clothes—they each went and saw these men, one by one—Ockwell was the first; he walked straight up to the prisoner, touched him, and said "That is the man," or words to that effect—the prisoner made no remark—he was then brought to London to Arbour Square, and on the 17th August he was put with 9 or 10 persons—the persons waiting to identify him could not see him come from the cab to the Court, because I had previously arranged that they should be put into a room so that they could not see anybody in the street or pass into the station—Gravitt looked along the rank, the prisoner was nearly in the centre, and on coming to him he looked very straight at him and said "I think that is the man"—he then passed out into another room and Chandler came in; almost as soon as he got into the room he pointed to a man, the third or fourth down the rank, about the same height as the prisoner, and said "I think that is him," or some<lb/>thing to that effect—we found he had made a mistake, and he was told to pass away—the men had been brought from the street—I knew a description had been entered in the Occurrence book, but I did not know who had given it—on the 10th August, when I found this case was likely to come on, I asked Gravitt to come to my office, and then said to him "We have a description here which Chandler gave," and asked him about how old the man was; he said "Oh, about 35"—I then said "About how tall was he?" he said "About 5 feet 10"—I then looked at the description Chandler had given to the constable at the time, and said "That is what we have here"—I did not go any farther than that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Gravitt went in the opposite end to where you were standing—you stood about the centre; he came right to you and looked to right and left of you, and then pointed to you and said "I think that is the man"—Chandler had to come round the edge of a table and then he passed in front of you, and after he had said "I think this is the man" he went wandering on down to the end of the table, thinking he could get out at the other end—I told him to come back, and he did so—the man he picked out was almost opposite the door; he must have seen all the other men—the man was dressed in shabby dark clothes, and was about your age; he was not a small-featured man I should say he was broad-featured—Chandler was not at the police-court on the second day because he did not pick you out—you were suspected of this offence from inquiries of myself and other officers, and we came to that conclusion within a day or two of the assault on Ockwell, and we were all looking for you, and the next thing we heard of you was at Birmingham.</p>

Prisoner's Defence. The order I have pleaded guilty to was not written in the ordinary way. I had a number of letters of Mr. Potter's, and I' took the words which constitute the order and pasted them on a piece of glass and traced the letters, and the expert swears positively that he traces my writing. Bond was present at no interview with Caton. He did not know what it was for, and he wished I had not brought him into it, and by my solicitor's advice he refrained from going to the solicitor for the prosecution and making a statement. It is not likely I could get another man to present the cheque. The expert is mistaken, for I never wrote the cheque. In March they had any amount of my writing in Mr. Potter's office. I am very sorry for consenting to aid in forging the order in July.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Three Tuns public-house in Fann Street—about 11.30 p.m. on 18th August the prisoner came in the bar for a pint and a half of beer, price 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and put down a half-crown—I gave her the change and put the half-crown in the till—I had cleared the till out five or ten minutes before, and I know there were only two shillings and three or four sixpences in it—about two minutes after the prisoner had gone out I discovered the half-crown was bad, and I then put it in my pocket, where there was no silver; this is it—on 23rd August I was called downstairs by Grace Smith, the prisoner was there, and a bad shilling was on the counter—I said "Why, you gave me a bad half-crown on Wednesday night"—I understood her to say she had not been in and she did not know it, or something of that sort—I broke it in the tester, and gave her into custody with the shilling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Ours is a long bar, divided into four compartments; there is one tester to each till—the tills are not patent ones, but pull out—the prisoner was in a compartment nearly opposite me as I came down-stairs; she saw me take the shilling up and test it, and did not attempt to leave the house—I can't say if she drank her beer—there are three pairs of folding doors to the house—I know it was the 18th because I made a note of the date—Miss Smith was the only person serving at that time, but on the 18th she had gone to bed, and I was the only person serving—I should take change for a half-crown from the till—half-past 11 was not at all a busy time; the prisoner came in at a slack time—I was just shutting up, and had given instructions for the gas to be turned down—no customer had come in that bar for ten minutes—I should go to the nearest till—I have seen the prisoner before, she has come in once or twice a week for about two months—I put the half-crown in my desk when I shut up that night—I carry my money in a purse in my left-hand pocket, and I put this in my right; I had no half-crown there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chairman of the Board of Directors of Alexander Gordon and Co., refreshment contractors, of Cheapside—the defendant has been in our service since 1882; he became manager at the Queen Anne Restaurant in Cheapside in 1884—he was provided with 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. change, and it was his duty to receive from the cashiers of the various rooms the amounts of the takings and the account each day—a printed form was provided, upon which he had to make out the daily account from each department, showing the total of the day's takings—it was his duty to hand the cash to the cashier next morning, always retaining 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188609130054"/>
               <p>for change—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his petty-cash book—he was provided with certain sums from time to time, which were entered on the debit side, and when he made disbursements he took credit for them on the other side—the amounts are numbered, and the vouchers would be marked in a similar manner and filed—the petty cash is kept in a cash-box with a lock, and that was kept on the premises, in the prisoner's charge—when he required petty cash he wrote the amount on a small printed form, which was sent to the cashier's office as a requisition for money; the cashier would then report to me as chairman, and if I authorised it he would pay it—I should not refer to the books—I am usually on the premises every day—on 24th July I saw Mr. Steine, a baker, who supplied the Cheapside Restaurant—he made a communication to me, and I requested an interview with the defendant on 26th July, at which Mr. Turner, the bookkeeper, was present part of the time—I pointed out certain irregularities in the petty cash-book, and said "On 19th May you have an entry, 'Steine, 18.16,' that amount does not appear to have been paid; what explanation have you to give?"—he said "There must be some mistake—I then drew his attention to an entry on 22nd May, "Steine, 14.13," and showed him the voucher for it and said "There are other irregularities, but I need not go into particulars; the nature of these entries is so exceedingly irregular and out of order that you will be dismissed," and told him to attend me at the restaurant, this being in the general office—we went there—Mr. Turner was there for the purpose of taking over the cash; he went through it in my presence—the change was correct—I then asked the defendant to produce his petty cash balance—he produced the box and counted it up, and entered the amounts on a piece of paper, which I have here. (<hi rend="italic">This showed a cash deficiency of</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.) He said "There must be some mistake about it"—it is "Gold, 15/.;" he produced that, "Note, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," he produced that; "I O U 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" he produced a document containing amounts which he alleged had been lent to the customers—this is it—I said that it was very irregular for him to do so, and contrary to regulations, but we gave him credit for it—he should have had a balance of 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but he only accounted for 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I find in the book four entries, "Apollinaris Company, June 10th, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Howard, July 19th, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Meredith, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and Adams, for ice, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—these are all in his writing—I told him that what further steps we took was a matter for the decision of the Board, and asked him specially if that was all the cash he had belonging to the Company—ho did not act as manager after 26th August—on the last day of the month, which was the following Wednesday, there was a meeting of the Board; we investigated these four matters of Meredith, Adams, the Apollinaris Company, and Howard, and on 6th August a warrant was applied for at the Mansion House, and he was apprehended a fort<lb/>night afterwards.</p>

               <p>director who attended at the Queen Anne Restaurant was myself; the secretary would not be there all day—Mr. Turner was in charge of the chief office, he would be there all day—he was in our service from May 26th, 1882, at the Royal Forest Hotel, before it was turned into a Company—up to February, 1883, he performed his duties to my entire satisfaction, and I gave him a character to that effect—I never had any doubt as to his integrity; he was in a fiduciary position—after he left I never had any doubt as to his integrity—I will give any particulars, if required—I did not ask him to return in 1884, but he left the City Arms where he went—he was for many years with Messrs. Clifford and Ritter before he came to me—I have not been to Mr. Bitter or Mr. Clifford since I was before the Alderman to beg them not to come and give him a character here—Miss Lewis was cashier at the Queen Anne Restaurant considerably more than six months—Miss Linnett was the previous cashier—I think Miss Lewis was there when Sherwill was engaged as manager—I saw Miss Linnett in the crowd at the Mansion House when this case was being investigated; she was then in my brother-in-law's employment at pimm's, and is so still—I have not threatened that if Miss Linnett gives evidence in the prisoner's favour she will be discharged; neither directly nor indirectly have I exercised any influence either verbally or through any one else; I saw her every day—entries were not always made in the cash-book before the payments were made—requisitions for money come to the chief office from the different places—I have mentioned there were large contracts at times; there was a large agricultural show at Brentwood which we catered for; the defendant managed that, but he had very few payments, he had not to bring them into the petty cash, the payments were separately treated; there might be a few little items, a cab or something, which I do not know of—he made a requisition on 6th April; on 3rd April 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was supplied to him, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 6th April; there was very good reason for that—the money is given out to him on the dates of his requisitions, and in that quarter his requisitions were, I think, for 710<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had 695<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no note of a requisition of 19th June—his books show on 27th March that he received 516<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he had paid out 560<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is if you take the cast of the look up to the 27th, but on 9th March he received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was not entered till the 21st—he does not sign any receipts—the entries are in his own writing—it is not a fact that 516<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been received on 27th March when he had paid out 560<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he had paid 518<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in rough numbers—he had not received this 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from petty cash on 31st March, he received it afterwards to balance the account—it was not owing to him, because there was an entry which he had not paid, "Figgins, 29th March, 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," which receipt can be produced—it was put into the petty cash, and taking that into account he had to receive 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but not having paid it till 7th April he did not want it; it was done to balance the book—it has never happened that the chief office has been unable to meet the requisitions of the managers, and has never borrowed money from the managers, nor have they given a voucher to go into the petty cash box, but on certain occasions, I believe, cash has been drawn from some of the houses; money has been taken from the managers' possession, and a voucher given, which would be issued as cash, but that had nothing to do with petty cash; he would issue the ticket as a cheque—I should say that it has not happened that a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188609130056"/>
               <p>requisition for cash has come down and been unfulfilled; some of the managers may have to wait a clay or two for their requisition—at the end of the quarter the secretary of the Company would count the cash in hand; he would not have the vouchers of the payments out, he would not audit the vouchers, that is done in another department—a voucher is put on a file, which is cleared at regular intervals; I have ascertained now that it has gone over three months—on its being cleared it is some one's duty to compare the vouchers with the entries in the books—I do not know whether they are ticked off, but there are ticks in the book—the numbers all, go consecutively, there are no distinctive letters—vouchers are not, marked "Steine 1, Steine 2," they simply come as if the lines in the book had been numbered—I formerly went through the vouchers regularly, but have not done so for two years—that was not done for the purpose of seeing that the entries in the cash-book were correct; it was for the purpose of keeping a check on the expenditure—Mr. Turner took my place two years ago, and it was his duty to take the vouchers off the file every three months—I never had any knowledge of a practice of writing into the cash-book the names and amounts of persons to whom money was due prior to requisition being made payable—on 26th July I went there about 7 p.m.—I did not begin to speak to him at 10 minutes to 7, nor was I gone at 7 o'clock—I think it was after 8 o'clock when I left—the inter<lb/>view lasted more than an hour—the first part of it was in my private room, for half an hour, before we went down and counted the tills—I cannot say that the change money (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. instead of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not believe it was, but I did not count it, Mr. Turner did, and the change was accepted as correct; he counted it with the prisoner—the change money was mixed with the takings to a certain extent—the bulk of the money is taken on a bill, by the waitress, and she gives change, and at the end of the day she has to see that her cash in hand is correct; the cash should be equivalent to the takings, and the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is to start with next day—I have heard nothing of a voucher to his credit for a payment to Starling, of Erith, of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that day for wine—I do not know of a loan to Miss McAudle during her illness, which was to be returned—I know no one of that name—there is Miss Cutler, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he has had credit for that—Mr. Doyle Gordon is my brother; I do not know that he borrowed money that day amounting to a sovereign, this is the first I have heard of it; the defendant may have lent him a sovereign—the preceding manager lent money on I O U to customers, to encourage the business—I found the I O U there, and in consequence of that a printed and a verbal notice was given that no money was to be lent, and special instructions were given to the prisoner—some of these people were his boon companions, and as long as loans were out of his own pocket it did not matter—he was instructed that he was on no account to lend money belonging to the Company—I did not mention to him the Apol<lb/>linaris Company, or Adams, Howard, or Meredith, on 26th July—although I could find no vouchers I thought it just possible that they might have been paid, and I put myself in communication with the people—we are only charging him with these sums upon which we are clear and distinct—in some instances the Company allow managers a commission quarterly besides their remuneration, that was so at Milk Street; it is on a sliding scale—all our managers do not have commission,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188609130057"/>
               <p>but the defendant had; it was calculated on a sliding scale; if the profits were so much he would receive 5 per cent, if they were more 10 per cent, and if more 15 per cent—we made it up upon the year—the takings had increased from the March quarter, because in former times we had no spirit licence—I do not think we have had one more than three yards—I can't say whether the takings in 1883, 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., had increased to 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was settled with for his commission once a year, that is on October 1st—our financial year ends on September 30th, but no commission was owing—commission is not paid if a servant is dismissed for irregular conduct, the same as we forfeit salary—there was no salary due to the prisoner when he was dismissed—when a servant is dismissed for dis<lb/>honest conduct he has no right to his salary-his wife is manageress of a coffee-house at Chingford—I was served with notice of action in the Mayor's Court on the 9th or 10th of August, three days after the warrant was taken out—I received no complaint from him, and no explanation of his conduct—I told him not to come to the restaurant, but there was nothing to prevent his coming to see me—we have a contract for our meat with one of our directors, who is a member of the firm-no one has made a list of the vouchers on the file, at the time of the supposed 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., deficiency—I did not take them off the file—Mr. Turner was instructed to so through them—when I thought there was any irregularity I sent for the vouchers and the cash-book-Mr. Turner took possession of the vouchers, they were kept on the file-the entry 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is by Miss Lewis, and the prisoner also adds the words "To end of April"—I did not ask Miss Lewis why the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was omitted; it was not her duty, the prisoner was responsible for that, she only made the entries from his dictation—the whole of these entries are most irregular and misleading—the defendant had no right to make an entry in this book until he had made the pay<lb/>ment—I believe these amounts were entered as if paid on December 31st when in truth they were not paid till the allowing year—I do not know that the secretary has passed them without vouchers, or that that was done to keep the accounts square—it was not necessary, because There are always a number of items for goods which have been pur<lb/>chased and which will have to be paid for and brought into the profits and loss accounts, but they have nothing to do with this book—two of the items were not paid till April 7th—this account is irregular and it was not discovered after march 31st—the secretary had nothing to do with the prisoner or the petty cash except to examine the balance of cash n hand-if the defendant put down 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one side and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the to her the secretary would expect him to produce the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Turner would vouch the payments by the prisoner—I wish to say that this page was not cast, and it was an after thought—the total came to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then on January 1st he commenced with <hi rend="italic">nil</hi>—after April 27th the vouchers would be there—I was not served with a subpoena to pro<lb/>duce the agenda and minute books of the firm here—I was at the Mansion House; the solicitor did not tell me to bring them here—our secretary had notice yesterday to produce vouchers, but not the minute-book, but it can be got in 20 minutes—the prisoner's wife was dismissed after the warrant was taken out-the prisoner hid himself at the coffee-house at Chingford; he slept there the night the summons was issued, and it did not seem right that we should provide a place for him to hide away from the warrant of the Magistrate, and we did not think</p>

               <p>Reynolds made a statement to me, in consequence of which I went to Mr. Notcutt's, a chemist in Mile End—I was shown the tea-cup produced and five bottles—I left them there—I then went to the Lucas Arms—I saw the prisoner behind the bar; he came outside—I spoke to him—I took hold of his wrist and said "I am a police officer, I shall apprehend you for attempting to poison your wife," or "kill" I think was the word—he replied "I do not know what you mean;" I said "You are accused of putting Milestone into a cup in which was spruce and pepper<lb/>mint;" he replied "I do not know what bluestone is"—I left him with Williamson, a constable, in the bar-parlour—I made inquiries, and in the result went to a bedroom with Stapleton, a fellow-barman—a chest of drawers was in the room—Stapleton put some clothes together—in the second drawer from the top, when the clothes had been removed, I saw some money, and something blue in a broken piece of paper—the drawer was then shut—no clothes were left in the drawer—I came downstairs with Stapleton and with Mr. Price, the landlord—I said to the prisoner "I have got the whole of your things and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money; "he said "There is 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the drawer"—I said "Very well, come and fetch it"—he went upstairs with me—I said "Which is your drawer?" and he pointed to the one where I had seen the money and the paper—I said "If the money is there take it"—he took out about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a half-sovereign I think and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—he was about to close the drawer, and I said "Stop, what is that in the corner?" and he replied "I do not know"—I took the parcel out and said "This is the very stuff you are accused of attempting to poison your wife with."

                  </hi>. I am a chemist at 32, Alderney Road, Mile End—I am an Associate under the Apothecaries Act and an Associate of the Pharmaceutical Society—on 19th August Mrs. Reynolds came to me about 9.30 a.m.; she brought this tea-cup—she made a state<lb/>ment—in the tea-cup was about two tablespoonfuls of thick liquid, two spoonfuls of sugar, and one blue crystal adhering to the side—the liquid was straw colour—she left it with me—crystals of sugar were sticking to the sides of the cup—I left the piece of blue, it was too small to try—I tasted the contents; it was very metallic, and made my tongue rough—I afterwards took some of the stuff out of the cup and divided it into three portions—some was still left in the cup, which I put into a bottle and sealed it—I tested the three portions by three separate tests—the mixture was composed of sugar, water, and sulphate of copper—I could not distinguish any particular smell—I did not analyse it to as cer<lb/>tain the strength of the sulphate of copper—I gave up the tea-cup and various bottles to Inspector Reid; a sealed bottle containing the contents of the cup; the bottle the spruce and peppermint was fetched in; the remains of what was in the bottle, and the bottles containing the three tests—sulphate of copper is commonly called bluestone; it is sold at grocers' and oilshops—it is a poison; it acts as an emetic.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is a very speedy emetic; it acts very shortly after it is taken—sulphate of iron forms crystals but not of a bluish colour—it is a bluish-green tint but of a very different colour to this; it is not the same class of crystal, they could not be identified—the residue of what was divided was more than a teaspoonful; I should think a tablespoonful was in the bottle—I tested for copper—my tests satisfied me there was copper in the fluid; there was sulphate of copper—the first test is com<lb/>monly known as the sugar test; I labelled that bottle "Sugar test"—there are a great many more than three tests—the tests are not supposed to be delivered up, only Mr. Reid wanted to have them, so I let him—the first test is to show the presence of copper—it is made by boiling the solution, providing the solution contains grape sugar—you add a solution of grape sugar—the result is a sort of orange precipitate—that proves there is copper in the solution; not necessarily sulphate of copper—the second test is the ferro-cyanide test—that is made by adding a solution of ferro-cyanide to any solution of copper—the result is a claret precipitate;</p>

               <p>that shows there is copper in solution, not necessarily sulphate—the third test is the ammonia test, by adding ammonia to a solution of copper—in this case by putting ammonia into a third of a tablespoonful the result first of all is a light-blue precipitate and afterwards a dark-blue solution; that shows there is copper in the compound or sulphate, because it makes, with ammonia, sulphate of copper—the precipitate is dissolved by adding an excess of the original, when it produces a dark<lb/>blue solution—you cannot estimate precipitate in solution—I cannot say the quantity was large, because there was only a small quantity tested with the crystal, and that test is sufficient to enable me to pledge myself there was sulphate of copper in the original compound—the result of that test, considering the quantity of precipitate and the quantity of solution, enables me to say that—it is not a popular medicine; it is used occa<lb/>sionally for stimulating ulcers—it is an astringent, but it is so powerful it can only be used in few cases—it dissolves freely in water; more freely in warm than cold—if a piece of bluestone was left in a breakfast cup not quite full of water from half-past nine to half-past eleven a good portion of it would be dissolved I should think—a lump rather bigger than that blue spot on the cup would have been dissolved in cold water in that time—in warm water if there is much in solution it crystallises out when cold—sulphate of copper in solution would have a very strong taste so as to attract the attention of the person drinking it—it would act at once to clear the system of itself partly, but the effects would remain.</p>

I am a lecturer on chemistry and on medical jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital, and a Fellow of the College of Physicians—I have had large experience in making analyses—on 13th of September I received from Inspector Reid this cup with its dried up con<lb/>tents—the blue crystal is sulphate of copper, bluestone—I have tested it, I have no doubt of it—the dried contents are a sugary substance—the piece of paper with "Bluestone, poison" on it contains some blue crystals—that was shown to me by Reid; it contained 143 grains when I received it and nearly that amount when I returned the paper—the crystals would be the same as these in the cup only larger—I have analysed the contents of the sealed medicine bottle, about an ounce and a half of stuff—it consisted of a sugary liquid, apparently spruce, with sulphate of copper the same as this crystal, only in solution—it was about six-tenths of a grain in 1 1/2 oz.—these cups hold about ten ounces when ordinarily full—there would be about six grains to the five ounces, half full, in solution, besides what is undissolved—there was a mere fraction of a grain undissolved—the undissolved part would be included—I saw no more than that—there was none undissolved in what I examined—that solution would act as an emetic; it would be a suitable dose for an emetic I have not personally known 
death result from taking sulphate of copper—there have been many such within my experience—the smallest fatal dose is not known, but it always has been large, usually above half an ounce, 240 grains to an ounce—it dissolves very readily in hot or warm water—the smell of peppermint would go off from exposure—the smallest dose causing death in this country was under one ounce, but a dose of 60 grains has produced very serious results—the fullest dose for an emetic would be ten grains, or at the outside 15 grains; five to ten</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188609130067"/>
               <p>grains usually—it is used externally for lotions and internally occasionally as a tonic, and An astringent, in small doses of less than two grains—it is properly described as a poison—three bottles were handed to me by Reid containing three separate tests referred to by Mr. Notcutt: the ammonia test, the ferro-cyanide test, and a similar test—these tests were used to ascertain if there was copper—I could not see that any test had been applied for sulphate alone—there was no copper in the bottles, one was spruce and the other peppermint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had great experience in tests—one drop is sufficient to determine the existence of copper—the ferro-cyanide test and the ammonia test are applied for copper, and the electric test (that is, the depositing it on platinum) for detaining the metal and weighing it—the barium test is applied for sulphates, to get white precipitates and see whether it is in strong or dilute doses—that test was applied to about two drops—that is a conclusive test of there being a sulphate—mistakes may be made in testing fluids—I scarcely recollect any mistakes from some of the elements, in the case of copper and sulphuric acid, in the tests I use—I heard that Reintch's test has failed in Smetharst's case—I use clean vessels, the best appliances, and take precautions to make the test a perfect one—I am sure it is accurate—sulphate of copper is used to stimulate indolent sores, ulcers, and things of that kind, for external use, especially in veterinary medicines, less frequently in human beings—it is a very great astringent—its dissolution would depend upon the size of the crystals and their hardness—six grains in half a teacup would soon dissolve in hot or cold water—it dissolves in less than three parts in cold water, and less than half in hot water—six grains in the half cup would not necessarily take from half-past 9 to half-past 11 to be entirely dissolved, but just as sugar may not all dissolve which is dissoluble, so some may not dissolve—sugar needs less stirring, it is more soluble—the taste of a solution of copper is extremely nasty, like a penny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no doubt this was sulphate of copper—the crystal on the cup is the same—the bluestone getting among the sulphate of copper would not interfere materially with its dissolving. (<hi rend="italic">The witness was directed to put a quantity representing six grains on a piece of paper.</hi>) I should think that would fairly represent it, perhaps rather under than over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am father of the last witness, and reside at 7, St. James's Square, Notting Hill—the prisoner was my porter four years ago—I engaged him in Switzerland to carry my photographic apparatus—I set my son up in business from time to time; helped him with money—the business is his, and all profits go to him—I have seen the prisoner from time to time pay money to him which he has received from his customers—I bank with the Union Bank, and nay son having no banker, passed his cheques through my bank—I have received cheques for my son from the prisoner, and have given him cheques for them—the prisoner has never signed postal orders in my son's name—on my return from Switzerland in 1885 the prisoner handed me some cheques which had come in in my absence; they could not have paid them into my bank</p>

D. England's private affairs; I wrote the letter by direction of Mr. J. D. England"—he was afterwards charged.</p>

Address R., 2, Lans<lb/>downe Place, Brunswick Square"—I wrote there, got an answer, went there early in July, and saw Davis—I showed him the advertisement and asked if he was prepared to lend me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "Yes"—I told him what security I had—he said he was perfectly satisfied, and referred me to Foster, of Argyle Street, his surveyor—I went there the same day and saw Ruck, I know him as Foster—I took him a letter from Davis; he said "We will send my surveyor down next Monday, but you will have to pay 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for preliminary expenses"—I said "Very well," but did not pay it then—Jackson came down to my house the following Wednesday, and produced this card: "Please pay my surveyor three guineas agreed upon in putting the matter before our client, Mr. Davis.—<hi rend="smallCaps">T. FOSTER</hi>"—Jackson did not survey the house, but I went to town next day, or the day after, and gave Foster a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said that the matter was all right and the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was drawn out—I began to have a suspicion, and went and stopped my cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then had a letter asking me to come up and bring two bill stamps for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I did next day, and saw Foster—he drew out an agreement, and put the stamps on it, and said, "Well, my fee?"—I said, "Here is the money"—he then wanted me to give something to the people in the office, but I could not see that—Foster, Jackson, and I then went to Davis's house, who said that he was satisfied with the security, and signed a cheque for the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave Foster and Jackson cheques for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—altogether I parted with 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid the cheque for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into my bank next day, and on the Monday it was returned to me dishonoured—before I got it I gave this bill for the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then went to Lansdowne Place and found nobody there; I could not find Davis—I went to Argyll Street and asked Foster if Davis was not at Eastbourne; he said "Yes"—I said that the cheque had been returned, and asked him the reason—he said that Davis had lost his pocket-book on the Saturday with my bill in it, but if I would give another bill for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I could have the money immediately—I said that I had been swindled—he said, "Nothing can be done till Mr. Davis returns; it will be all right; he is going to have 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid into the bank presently, and it will be all square"—I went every day that week, and found papers on the door saying, "Return in half an hour," which very often exceeded four hours, for I watched very closely—I eventually took proceedings—I gave the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque to Jackson for the surveyor, but I may say this of Jackson, he never asked me for anything—Ruck was the leading man in the whole affair and the medium, and Davis was the gentleman with capital—when I parted with my money I believed they were in a position to lend me the money.</p>

               <p>about my furniture—I have a bill of sale on my furniture now—I believe Jackson went down three times—he did not say that he had made inquiries and found that I had a bill of sale—I paid Buck and Jackson instead of their principal, because Davis wrote and said that nothing could be done till his surveyor had his expenses paid—I was simply and solely giving a bill for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Davis was to discount it—Davis did not tell me that ho had torn his signature off because the bill was drawn by Buck incorrectly and was no security at all, but when I was telling them a bit of my mind Buck brought me out a torn paper and said, "There is your bill, if you like;" I said "No"—I was not told that before any advance could be made a fresh bill must be drawn—they said, "We want your security, will you sign other papers?"—I said "No"—that was the day before they were arrested—they were all three there, and I said, "There are three alternatives: pay me back the whole of my fees, or draw out a cheque and let me have it in hard cash, or take the consequences"—they said, "Give us some more security, and we will see it all right"—I said, "I will give you no more security"—it was not agreed between me and Davis that my bill was to be discounted before the cheque for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given—Foster drew up this agreement, which I signed: "16th July, 1886. Dear Sir,—<hi rend="italic">Re</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. mortgage.

                  </hi>. I live with my husband at 4, Margaret Terrace, Chelsea—I have been for some years owner of two French Rentes, one for 500 and the other 200 francs—they have coupons attached to them, which are payable every three months—the two bonds were renewed in 1881, through Mr. Bernhardt—in June, 1886, I went to Mr. Baum's shop, 207a, Piccadilly; it is like a money-changer's, and has "Baum Brothers" up outside—I had allowed them to cash the last coupon of the old bonds in April and June; June was the last coupon—he was then to send them to Paris and get new ones, and send them back to me, which he said would take him one, two, or three weeks—he gave mo this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received this letter from him: "Dear Madam,—he good enough to call upon us as early as possible on receipt of this. London, July 29th"—I wont and saw him directly; there were three or four other people in the shop, he was very busy, and then said to me "I have been robbed"—I said "Where are my bonds?"—he said "The large one for 600 francs is in the City, it is not lost"—I said "Where did you put it in the City?"—we spoke together in French, he took me to his solicitors, and said "I have pledged it for 10,000 francs"—I asked if he would give me any security, I was almost distracted—he said "Oh, if you make a noise you shall have nothing; give me time, don't say anything, and you will have your money; we are going to take a great establishment"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188609130088"/>
               <p>—I made an appointment with him for next day, but he did not come—I then went to the French Consul and asked for a French solicitor—the prisoner wrote this letter in my solicitor's office and presence and gave it to me when I found I could not get my bond back—I sent my French advocate with it to Mr. Kuhl—it was given to me on 29th August and is dated 27th August. (<hi rend="italic">This stated:</hi> "We hereby request you to hold at the disposal of Madame Louisa Tressolat the bonds you have in advance of the payment made by us to you on security of the said bonds.") My advocate then saw Mr. Kuhl—the prisoner said the smaller bond had been lost, it was robbed—I said "Give me the large one"—he said "It is in the City"—I went again next day; he seemed very indifferent at seeing me, and said "You can do what you like"—I then received this letter from him: "I shall call and see you to-morrow afternoon; please be patient, I am doing my utmost to keep the business going, everything depends on that; the police have hopes of tracing the thieves. I am, madam, yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">BAUM</hi>"—on the 7th he called on me and said he had come like an honest man to bring me a few pounds, but never said what—I said "No, I have seen a French advocate, and am going to tell him to proceed"—he never showed me any money—he never had any authority to pledge this bond of mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The coupon is payable on 1st October; it was of no use to me before that—the changer who sent my bonds to Paris before this did not take two months in getting them back—he had them some months because I gave thorn to him to keep for me, as I knew they were as well with him as anybody else—I had never had any transac<lb/>tions with Mr. Renard before April—when I went in answer to the letter I found him in a great state of agitation about the robbery—they offered me a promissory note, but I do not understand them, and would not accept one—I don't recollect his saying he was anxious to carry on the business, and would find my money in time if allowed—Monsieur Paul Lock was my advocate—it went on for three weeks—I thought at the time he had no intention of robbing me, and I said so before the Magis<lb/>trate, but when he didn't pay me I began to fee' that, and on 12th August I went to the police.</p>

I am a foreign banker, trading under the name of Kuhl and Co., at 16, Cornhill—on 19th July I received this French bond (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), just as it is now, with this letter—the coupons begin in October 1886, and then go on for four or five years—the bonds pass from hand to hand. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read:</hi> "July 19th. A. Kuhl and Co. Dear Sirs,—Enclosed we beg to hand you a bond, French 6 per Cent., 98975, value about 560<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., against which we require a loan of 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one month.") I gave him our receipt; 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was deducted for a month's interest—he was bound to repay us on 1st August—I have not seen my receipt, he says it is stolen—the documents of 27th July came to my office through a French advocate—I have not had any of the money back, and consequently I hold the bond.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector C</hi>). On 27th July, shortly after 9 a.m., Baum made a complaint to the police of loss of property—I went to the shop and found an iron shutter to the door, but none to the window, so that the gas left burning showed into the place—there were no marks of an entry, and no marks on the shop door—in the shop I found an iron safe, which was in full view of the shop window; there was an inner safe inside that—there were two locks to the outer safe, which required separate keys, and two keys to the inner one; they were all different—the prisoner showed me six keys on a bunch—he said he had lost money from the inner safe, but I found no marks of violence on the outside—he gave me a list of the property stolen, but no mention was made at that time of either the 500-franc or the 200-frano bonds—the first I heard of them was when he was in custody, and Madame Tressolat came to the station—I got the numbers of the notes he got from the bank from the manager, and some of them have been traced, but some have not yet gone in—those I have traced are not included in the list of property stolen—I did not add in writing "To furnish bonds" at the end of the list at the prisoner's request, but at the prosecutor's request—I took the prisoner on a warrant; I read it to him, and he said, "soon after the robbery happened I sent off the office lad with a letter to Madame Tressolat, asking her to call upon me; she came, and I told her the circumstances of the robbery; I took her round to my solicitor, Mr. Robertson, and again explained the matter to her; I promised if the money stolen from me were not recovered I would work for her till it was paid"—after he was charged he said, "I have committed no fraud upon anybody, I have not got a farthing of the money, it was all stolen by the thieves who robbed my place"—I was in communication with him daily up to the time he was taken—I said that there was some chance that I could trace the thieves—I still have hopes of tracing them—he gave me no expla<lb/>nation of the thieves getting possession of the keys, but from what he said I thought it likely they had got into dishonest hands; he had been careless with them in laying them about, and trusted them to a lad in the office—the police pass this shop in Piccadilly, I think, every five minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I and the sergeant first had notice of this robbery, and we have had the matter in our hands ever since—I know of one robbery in the neighbourhood similar to this—I have no doubt whatever</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188609130090"/>
               <p>that this was a genuine robbery, and we still have hopes of tracing the thieves; it is being inquired into now—where there is a sham robbery there is invariably something to show that it is not a genuine robbery—it was possible for anybody to be in the shop without being seen—this list was supposed to be a list of the securities in the safe, but it came in two or three different pieces—this second coupon was not mentioned until after he was in custody; one of his assistants told me of it then—he was robbed of property to the amount of between 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as far as I could trace the notes, they left the place of business before 27th July, and then got into circulation—I am at Vine Street Station; I have not been there a great while I was at Scotland Yard before that—Sergeant Bowden can tell you more about the reputation of the money-dealers than I can—all I have heard is in favour of Mr. Baum's respectability.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After dusk a person might be concealed, and operate on the safe, and a person knowing the shop well would be better able to do that—I know of a similar robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hardware manufacturer, and live at 232, St. John Street—on 24th August, a little after 3 o'clock, I was near Turnstile, at the north-west corner of Lincolns Inn Fields, going towards Holborn—I had a watch in my waistcoat-pocket, with a chain, which was visible—just as I was crossing the top of Little Queen Street six or seven young fellows came from a court or small street and crossed to where I was—they were jumping and larking, I thought they had been drinking—I tried to get out of their way, but the more I tried the more I got in their way; they surrounded me, back and front, and took my watch out of my pocket—Philps took it; he stood right on me, so that I could not move—I saw his face, his is the only face I could recognise—there was no more violence beyond hustling me—after the watch was taken they all ran away down Little Queen Street—I did not follow them, I called out to three gentlemen who were on the other side of Queen Street, and showed them my watch-chain, and said "Those men have taken my watch"—one of them ran after them; I stood still, I was thoroughly paralysed—I have not seen that gentleman since—the witness Treacher came up after the police came, but I did not notice him at the time—the police took me to the station—next day I was taken to the station and there saw a number of men together—I had a presentiment that the three prisoners were three of the seven, but I could not swear to them—I picked them out as three of the men—I am quite satisfied now that Philps is the man that took my watch—when I saw his full face I did not recognise him, but at Bow Street I was sitting behind him when</p>

I am now out of work, and living at homo at Barnet—at the time this occurred I was a warehouseman at 174, Drury Lane, and lived in the house—I left a fortnight last Saturday—on Tuesday 24th August, I left our place about a quarter-past 3, it must have been close on half-past—I was going with some things to High Holborn—I went up Parker Street, which leads into Little Queen Street—as I was just turning the corner into Parker Street I met eight or nine men running; they were all calling out "Fire!"—one of them nearly knocked me over; I was carrying a heavy basket on my back—that man was Knight—I had seen him before lots of times—I also know Magrath—I only knew them by sight by loitering about, I never spoke to them—I have seen them nearly every day, sometimes in company, sometimes by themselves, sometimes with a lot more—after they turned the corner I met the prosecutor; he showed me his chain—there was no policeman ear—next night" about half-past 11 o'clock, I went with E 97 to a house in Neale Street, turning off Seven Dials—he told me to go inside, and directly I got in I recognised Knight, and the constable came in and took hint into custody—I told him that was the man that knocked against me—on Thursday I went to the police-station and picked out Magrath from nine or ten—I could not recognise Philps.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 22, Grove Hill Road, Denmark Park, and am a clerk to William Robinson and Co., of 18, Charterhouse Square, solicitors to the St. Sepulchre's Vestry—William Howard Robinson, one of the firm, is vestry clerk of the Middlesex portion of the parish; there is a City portion as well—there is St. Sepulchre's Without and St. Sepul<lb/>chre's Within—we have in the Middlesex part two churchwardens, a senior and a junior, and the other side have three—the senior church<lb/>warden manages the money matters, and also receives sums of money for the expenses of the church from the treasurer, Mr. Henry Munday Clark—he is appointed by the Vestry; I can't answer whether that is under an Act of Parliament, I should think it is by old usage; he has been treasurer 16 years, to my knowledge—I have the Vestry minute-book here, and I find under date of 19th April, 1881, that Mr. Price, the defendant, was elected senior churchwarden of the parish of St. Sepulchre, Middlesex side—he was duly sworn in in my presence—I also find Mr. Price was elected for the years 1882-3-4, and 1885, and on 27th April, 1886, Mr. John Hayes was elected in his stead—before 1881, preceding Mr. Price's election, Mr. John Larkin was churchwarden—I have a resolution here, passed on 27th March, 1883, appointing Mr. Price trustee of a fund called Roberts's Fund. (<hi rend="italic">This was headed Roberts's Gift, and stated that Mr. Price and Mr. Dunn were appointed trustees of the fund, and ordering the same to be transferred to their names.</hi>) I have the attend<lb/>ance-book of the Vestry here, and I find Mr. Price was present at that meeting; it is signed by him—the gentlemen present put their names down—it was necessary to transfer the fund to the names of the new trustees; I attended to that and had it done, Mr. Price was one of them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188609130099"/>
               <p>—I have the deed of gift before me which originated Roberts's Trust—it is dated 13th October, 1795; it comes from the keeping of the church<lb/>wardens, in the archives of the Vestry—it is entitled "Deed of Joseph Roberts to the Vicar and Churchwardens of the Parish of St. Sepulchre's, Middlesex," and is between William Thomas Roberts, of the one part, and the Rev. Richard Dickinson Shackleford, the vicar, and Peter Dunkley and Joseph Wood, churchwardens, of the other part, and gives 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be invested in Government securities in the purchase of Three per Cent. Government annuities, for the use of the poor residing in the parish of St. Sepulchre—the dividends are to be collected and laid out in coal for the poor—I find that that sum was afterwards added for by Mr. Roberts's family upon the same trust—the present trust of 639<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. includes that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was the churchwarden's duty to keep an account of the money he expended, and Mr. Price had a special book for that purpose—he orders the coal, and I think it is paid for out of the parish funds—I did not attend the audit; the minute-book does not show when the last audit was—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Price's book; it begins in July, 1881, the year he was elected churchwarden—it was audited on 29th March, 1883, but not since, to my knowledge—I have written him several letters with reference to that, and before that I had a conversation with him with reference to the accounts; he attended once and could not make up his accounts, and ultimately he asked me to do them for him—for the purpose of doing so I got some documents from him, and amongst them were some vouchers—this is a written statement and voucher in his other book—from them I made up this account—I began from 30th June on the receipt side—the accounts brought forward on 30th June, 1882, are 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that is not taking into account 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which it is said he received from Mr. John Larkin—I find that down to 20th June, 1884, the prisoner received sums amounting to 642<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the pay<lb/>ments out down to 30th June, 1884, were 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the receipts to the end of June were 661<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the balance on 20th November, 1885, was 261<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I find from his book that since that date he has drawn six cheques, one on 21st October, 1884, for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; one on 20th December, 1884, for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; another for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 2nd February, 1885; one on 19th March, 1885, for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; another on 23rd March for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and another one on 23rd May for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I find also that on 25th August he received his balance of tithes, 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on 11th January, 1885, he received two dividends on Roberts's fund, one for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they are entered in his writing in his book, "Roberts's Gift, coals"—I got the date of 11th January from his statement—the auditors had no vouchers, so they would not pass the accounts, but I treated it as if he had paid it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Cross-examination continued</hi>). I have before me the papers referred to yesterday, and am prepared to say that Mr. Price received 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 24th August—I had his permission to prepare his accounts—I have seen the vouchers and seen the cheques—I do not know whether I have seen that cheque—I have seen the receipt—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the voucher I saw, signed by Mr. Price—I can't say that I have seen any cheque for that amount—I can't say whether it was paid in one sum or a dozen—I think I can say that it does not include items prior to 24th August—the tithes are received by Mr. Clark, the treasurer—I think he usually pays that over by cheque—this receipt was produced to me when I made up the accounts, not by Mr. Price, by Mr. Clark, not during the police-court proceedings, before, while I was making up Mr. Price's accounts—this is the receipt: "August 24, 1885. Received of H. M. Clark, treasurer of tithes, 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., balance of tithes as per vote at Easter Vestry.

That is debited to Mr. Price—I think that is in his handwriting—there is no date in Mr. Price's book—I have not guessed at these dates—I have here a copy on a fly sheet where he says: "June 20th, 1884, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." I suppose that was where I got the date from; that is in his own handwriting—the greater part of this account is made up from his own information—on February 18th, 1884, there is an entry of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. debit—that is an amount that Mr. Collier received—Mr. Price authorised me to make out his account, and I got information from Mr. Clark, who told me that on February 18th he gave Mr. Collier 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never saw a cheque representing that amount endorsed by the prisoner—that entry is made up from a statement by a third party—on 18th April, 1883, there is entered on the debit side 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Clark—in Mr. Price's book it is under date of March 7th, 1884, but in his fly leaf it is under date of 1883 for tithes—I did not test that through Mr. Clark; I saw no cheque of his—that is put down from information from a third party—the Vestry appoint three auditors yearly in the Middlesex portion of the parish—they are appointed for the purpose of auditing these very accounts—there has only been one audit since Mr. Price was appointed churchwarden—that was on 27th and 28th March, 1883—the auditors are always members of the Vestry, but they are generally nominated from out of the Vestry—I have never seen an audit carried out; it was no part of my duty to be there—some litigation arose between the two parishes as to matters connected with the church, and it went into several Courts; there was considerable heat between the two sides, Mr. Price taking a prominent part on one side, and some other gentlemen on the other—the litigation was between the inner churchwarden and the outer churchwarden—the two sides of the church were fighting one another—it was about the architecture of the church—it was an infringe<lb/>ment of a faculty, I think, before Dr. Tristram—in some cases Mr. Price was plaintiff and in other cases he was defendant; there were several points discussed—Mr. Price's side lost in some instances—I don't know</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 38, Burton Crescent, and am a German—on Saturday evening, 21st August, about nine or half-past nine, I was in the neighbourhood of Euston Square—I passed the public-house at the corner of Seymour Street and Euston Square; I saw three or four men playing with money on the ground—I passed slowly and three men.(who according to my conviction are the prisoners, but I did not recognise the men as they rushed at me) rushed backwards at me together; I could not see their faces—they put their hands on me and pushed me inside the urinal and kept me there—I thought at first it was an accident their tumbling over one another—I struggled to get rid of them and I saw a hand coming at me and it snatched my watch away—my coat was open so that my chain was visible; it hung from a button hole—according to my conviction Ansdell ran away with my watch—when my watch was snatched they left hold of me; all ran away—I ran after Ansdell; he crossed the road and went into a beershop and disappeared behind the partition—I did not follow him in because I was surrounded by twenty or thirty and I lost sight of him in the beerhouse—I next saw him on 23rd August, the following</p>

               <p>Monday, standing in the same beershop, and I went in—he was very uneasy at my appearance, looked towards me and turned round and went out—I left the beershop directly and he was standing at the corner out<lb/>side; he said, "Good night, sir"—I went for the police and went back to the beershop again—Ansdell was inside, he was more uneasy than before and turned very quickly and went out—I afterwards went out and found him in custody of the police—my watch, a silver one, has not been found.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at 32, Henry Street, Pentonville—on Saturday evening, 21st August, I was standing opposite the Plasterers' Arms, Seymour Street, Euston Square—I saw the three prisoners playing pitch-and-toss at the corner of the Mews, just in front of the urinal, close to the pavement—shortly after I heard a cry "That man has stolen my watch," and Ansdell ran down past me with the silver watch in his hand—I saw it—he ran into the public-house at the bottom of Little Wellesley Street, through it and into Church Pathway, at the back of the public-house, and there I lost sight of him—I next saw him on Monday night, 23rd August, when I was with Delfman, and went with him into the public-house—we saw Ansdell there; I at once recognised him—he looked at us and cast his eyes down and walked out of the house—I and the prosecutor went for a constable, and went back to the public-house again—Ansdell was there; he walked out again directly—he was given into custody—on Tuesday, 24th August, I was sent for by the police to Albany Street Station, where I identified Murphy from among six others as the man who had held the prosecutor by the arms at his back at the urinal—I was standing on the opposite side of the street at the corner of Little Wellesley Street, and saw there was a scuffle—on Wednesday, 25th August, I was sent for again by the police, and identified Vick at the station from seven others, I believe, as the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MOYSES</hi>. I have given evidence at the police-court in another matter—the prosecutor was coming out of one of the public-house entrances at the time with his hands in his trousers pockets, and the prisoner ran back against him—I took no notice till I heard the cry—his frock coat was undone, and the next I saw of him was that Murphy had hold of the prosecutor's arms, and then I heard the cry "That man has my watch—Murphy was right at the back of him—only the three prisoners were there from first to last; the prosecutor could not see their faces—I was from 10 to 15 yards off—I knew they were attempting to rob him, and made my way across the road, and then Ansdell ran down the road close past me, and I pursued him—there are several courts off Church Pathway—Murphy was at the prosecutor's back, Vick had his arm under the prosecutor's chin, and Ansdell was at the back of Vick—they were just in the mouth of the urinal—I swear I saw all this going on—there is a very large lamp with six branches just out<lb/>side the public-house; I don't know if there is a light over the urinal—the prosecutor ran to the bottom of the street and said he was afraid of being knifed if he followed the prisoner, and that he was afraid to go into the public-house—I did not stop in conversation with him, but gave chase—I did not see the prosecutor again till Monday night, I recognised him then in the Euston Road—as I was communicating with a constable the prosecutor came up and stood a short distance away—I hardly knew he was the prosecutor, but I recognised him afterwards—the constable did not introduce me to him—the prosecutor was not with the constable on Monday night—I told the constable I had come to give him informa<lb/>tion, and I told him—I did not speak to the constable on Saturday night—I had a glass of ale with the prosecutor about half-past 9 on the Monday—the urinal was by the side entrance of the public-house—the prisoners ran down a short street 400 to 600 yards off—it was not the pub<lb/>lic-house with the light I spoke of that I went to with the prosecutor—we went to have a drink there by chance, and to see whether Ansdell or the other men were in the public-house; it was by my suggestion we went, in—he walked out; we remained two seconds and went out to fetch a constable, and came back in a quarter of an hour; he was there then, as we expected—I gave the police a description of the other men when Ansdell was taken, and they sent for me on Tuesday and Wednesday—the case I was in before was a highway robbery in the country.</p>

I am a widow, living at 1, Trio Villas, Earlham Grove, Forest Gate—on 22nd July I left my house a few minutes before 12 to go on a visit, leaving the doors and windows all fastened—there are three doors, one in the front, and two at the side; one of those leads into the passage, and the other into the washhouse—that last was locked only, the others were locked and bolted—I gave the key to Mrs. Beck, a neighbour—I returned on Saturday, 24th, after receiving a telegram early on the morning of that day—I found a policeman in charge; the door had been broken open—I missed nothing.</p>

I am the wife of John Morris, and live at Earl House, Earlham Grove—on this day, about a quarter to six, I was by my sitting room window, which commands a view of this door of Mrs. Maid<lb/>ment's—I noticed the two prisoners walk down the grove on the left hand side coming from Forest Gate Station; they crossed over and read a board stating some plots were to be sold—then they opened and walked through the gate of the forecourt and a second gate that leads in the garden of Trio Villas, where Mrs. Maidment and Mrs. Beck live—they went to the side door which was afterwards broken open; I could not see what they did—then they came out and crossed over to our side of the road—Allen went along under the black fence which divides our gardens from the grove; Collins crossed over and went through the two gates again and opened the second door of No. 1, Trio Villas, with an instrument about nine inches long, which he used as a carpenter would do in putting a lock on—he went into the house about a yard by the door that leads into the kitchen—as soon as I saw that I opened my front door and crossed the road to Norfolk House, Mr. Earner's, about 50 feet off from me and next to Mrs. Maidment's, from which it is divided by three plots of land—I called out to Mr. Rainer, "There is something wrong at Mrs. Maid<lb/>ment's"—Allen heard it and gave a yell, and Collins walked out of the two gates, not very fast—Mr. Stephens then came along and said (the prisoners must have heard), "What is the matter?"—I said, "Burglars, burglars," and put my hand out in the direction of the two prisoners—Mr. Stephens said, "Take my umbrella and parcel while I catch them," and he ran and gave them chase—the prisoners ran away very fast—I after wards went to the door of 1, Trio Villas; the box of the lock was broken away.</p>

I keep a coffee house in Gloucester Street, Norwood—at the time in question I saw the deceased going up the hill just by our house; she seemed all right—I saw the prisoner run after her; I heard him swear and I went to my door and saw him running after her—I went across the road to see if he caught her, and as he was going up the hill he struck her across the head; he came back again—I said to him, "I should have thought you would have got over your temper by the time you got there;" he made no answer—the deceased afterwards came down the hill crying; I gave her a cup of tea—she stayed about ten minutes and appeared to be quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at Norwood—on Sunday afternoon, the 8th August, I went to see the deceased—she was suffering from concussion of the brain, and was unconscious—I examined her head, but found no external mark—I saw her again at about 9 o'clock, when she had recovered consciousness—I saw her again the next day when she was perfectly conscious; also on Tuesday—she kept her bed, but was much better, and had recovered from the effects of the con<lb/>cussion, and was going on very well—my next visit would be Thursday, but she came early in the morning before I started—she mentioned her intention of going to work—I ordered her not to at any rate that week—on the following Monday she came again for another bottle of medicine—she was very well then—on Wednesday evening I was again called to her house, when I found her lying down in a weak state—there were no very definite symptoms except debility and slight pain in the head—then practically the case passed out of my hands, and I saw her no more till I was ordered to make a post-mortem—she died on Sunday, I think—the parish doctor took charge of her after me—I attended the post-mortem at her own house on Friday, the 23rd, with Mr. Adams, a sur<lb/>geon—I found no external marks—the internal part of the scalp was bruised and congested, and the covering of the bone, also over the same spot, was congested—the outer covering of the brain in the same situa<lb/>tion was congested, and beneath the outer and inner membrane there was a quantity of clotted blood which had been slowly oozing, and which, in my opinion, was the cause of death—she really suffered from two distinct causes from the effects of the blow, viz., from primary con<lb/>cussion, from which she recovered, and the same blow no doubt broke a vessel of the brain, which slowly oozed, giving no sign until after<lb/>wards—I think a blow with the soft part of the fist would account for the primary concussion, and for the state in which I saw her on Sunday, supposing it had been done in the morning, and the other symptoms,</p>

I live at 4, Willow brook Grove, next door to where the deceased and his wife lived—I knew Mr. and Mrs. White and the prisoner as the baker's man who was in the habit of calling for orders and to bring bread—my attention was called to him on Monday, 16th August—on 17th from the noise I heard at the back I went to the front between two and three—it was like scuffling and tumbling over the furniture and screaming—I saw the man outside; I heard more noise; I went into No. 3, I saw Mrs. White and spoke to her—I went into the kitchen—between the washhouse and the kitchen I saw Payne and Mr. White struggling together on the floor—White was underneath and Payne was on the top—White's head was hanging half sideways from the washhouse step and he was bleeding from the nose—Payne was over him with their legs and arms linked like wrestling together, their chests together—the struggle lasted a few minutes—I said "Do not lie and fight but get up and fight like men"—I laid hold of White's arm and pulled him, and Mrs. White laid hold of Payne's arm and pulled him—then I went away—Payne made his way through my kitchen, he asked me if he could go there—I said "Anywhere to get out of this dreadful row," and he went through and drove off—White went after the van with his arms in the air like hammers and screaming out and swearing, then he went back to his house and began breaking up the things—I did not go into his ho se, but I heard the crashing of glass—I saw the front window smashed—after that a policeman brought him into my house, and I did all I could to calm him, he was in dreadful excitement—I got a towel and washed him; he was crying bitterly—during the struggle they seemed as if they were thoroughly <hi rend="italic">winded</hi> and exhausted with fighting—White had had some drink, but was not drunk; I do not think he had had more than he ought to have had—when I had given him his tea he and his brother went away together—he tried to get back but they prevented him—he</p>

               <p>was quiet when he left my house, but when he went to the door he seemed to get excited again—I did not see him go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> White was rather short and stout, a heavier built and sturdier man than the prisoner—his arms were bleeding when he came in—he had hit the windows with his fist straight from the shoulder—he acted like a madman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 212). On 17th August I was called to this house about 2.30 p.m.—I saw White outside the house bleeding from the nose and smashing the windows with his fists and saying, "Let me get at him, he seduced my wife"—he was drunk—he afterwards went in and cut the children's clothes—the brother was there 20 yards before me—the prisoner came from an adjoining house, got up in his van and drove away—I heard smashing inside the house—I saw White throw a saucepan at his wife in the passage and hang; up the children's clothes upon the door, and with a large butcher's knife cut them to pieces—I took the knife from him—he made a statement about his wife—after a time he went into No. 4—the wife was very excited and had a black eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told White to go to the Magistrate—he said, "What is the use of that? I struck the first blow"—I described him as staggering drunk—it was a three-pints saucepan—he took it up and deliberately threw it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman PR</hi>). I followed Godfrey—I saw the deceased taking things out of a drawer, and when the knife was taken from him he jumped upon the drawer—he fell forward against the chest of drawers and on to the ground behind the kitchen door—he then threw a piece of soap at his wife—I never saw a man so mad drunk—I arrested the prisoner on the 23rd; I said I should take him to the station for assaulting a man named White on the 17th—he said, "All right, I sup<lb/>pose you will let me put my horse and van away and do my booking," which I allowed him to do—on the way to the station he said, "Well, what I done was in self-defence; when he came in he was fairly mad and struck me in the eye in the passage before I knew where I was, and of course I hit him back and was glad to get out of his way. I came through the next house. His wife asked me to come in to see what he had done to her home. As for being there for any unlawful purpose which he said I was, I will take my oath I was not any more than you"—he was taken to the station; the charge was read over to him, he made no reply.</p>

After I heard of the death of white I arrested Mrs. White—she was taken before the Magistrate and discharged—I examined the room where the struggle took place—the chest of drawers had been removed; I saw them—I took this knob (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) off the drawers; it was an old-fashioned 3ft. 6 in. high chest, and the knob would be about eight inches from the top—there was a 5-8th of an inch beading round the top.</p>

I am a registered medical man practising at 145, Battersea Park Road—I was called to the deceased on Wednesday night at 12—I saw him in the back kitchen downstairs in bed—on one side of the sternum was an irregular oval bruise, a little over two inches one way and one and a half-inches another—I saw it by the light of a</p>

I am house surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—the deceased was admitted on the morning of 20th August by myself; I examined him—he had a large sized bruise on the side of his chest, and several bruises and scratches about his chest—he died at nine o'clock on the 23rd—I was present at the post-mortem examination—the sternum was fractured; it was a transverse fracture of the first and second portions of the bone—the cause of death was pyeemia or blood poisoning from the fracture—it might have been done by a man's fist if the man had stood up and another man had punched him with all his force—it might possibly have been caused by falling on the knob of the chest of drawers—I should have thought that falling against some blunter object would have caused it—kneeling on him violently might have caused it—he was a stoutly built man.</p>

I am a waterside labourer—I live at 80, Sultan Street, Camberwell—on Saturday, 31st July, I was in the Royal George between 4 and 5—there were about six customers in the bar, and Charles Grant and his wife—Grant was standing with his back towards the counter, and I was standing to the left of him—his wife came in, and they appeared to have had words in their own place—she said "Oh, you are here, Charles Grant?"—he said "Yes"—she said "I mean to do you some bodily harm"—he stood and took no notice—she called for a pint of beer for her friend and herself, and sat down—when they had drunk it she went out, threatening him that she would do him some harm—she returned shortly after—she called for half a pint of four ale, and sat on the seat again—she put her hands in her pockets on each side—I thought I heard the screw of a cork—I gave her husband the offer to move as he had been threatened—she took a bottle out of her pocket like a soda water bottle, and said "That is vitriol, you <hi rend="italic">sod</hi>, and that will blind you"—she threw it from her right hand, holding the big part of the bottle low down—the husband got most of it; it ran down one side of his face and down his guernsey and waistcoat—he knocked her down and kicked her, and went from the house—I saw his neck-handkerchief burning—he went to the doctor, and knowing his wife was in charge, he said no one had a better right to give her in charge than he had—it came out like white blotches all over his face, like blisters—I got one spot on my hat—I saw more on others; it put the clothes all in holes.</p>

                  </hi>. On 29th and 30th July I was taking care of the house of Mr. William Budd, of 9, Crown Villas, the Oval, Kennington—on the night of the 29th I went to bed about 11 o'clock, after fastening up the house—about 5.30 I was awoke by a noise in the house—I went down into the front drawing-room on the first floor, and saw the prisoner there looking over a drawer which he had taken from the sideboard—I said, "What is your game here? what are you after?"—he did not say anything; he went into the back room, took up the poker from the fireplace, and hit me on the head—I closed with him the best I could; I fell on my knees from the blow—he broke from me and went down-stairs—I called out "Stop thief"—I saw him leave by the back door, and I afterwards saw him in the street; he was stopped and given into custody—I afterwards examined the premises, and found things generally turned over—one of the panels of the back door had been taken out and the door opened; it had been bolted the previous night—a pane of glass had been taken out of the door leading to the passage, so that the bolt could be reached and the door opened—a hole had been made in the bottom panel by means of a gimlet, and in the passage I found this chisel.</p>

I am attendant at some baths in Kennigton—on the morning of 30th July, about 10 minutes to 6, I was passing by Crown Villas, and saw the prisoner run out of No. 1—I heard the last witness call out "Stop thief" in a very low tone of voice—I ran after the prisoner about 50 yards, caught him and brought him back, and ho was given in custody.</p>

I examined these premises I compared this chisel with the marks on the back door, they corresponded exactly—I also examined the door leading from the kitchen to the passage; I found this round piece of wood had been taken out of it; there were some marks on it, and also some on the door, evidently made by the gimlet—an arm could be put through the hole and reach the bottom bolt, but not the top one; a small garden hoe had been brought in from the garden, and by putting that through the top bolt could be reached.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Thetford Place, Rotherhithe, and am the wife of Richard Carter, a labourer—the prisoner's wife is my husband's sister—they have three children; the eldest is 10, and the other 7, and the baby, Charles Parr, 2 1/2—I saw the prisoner and his wife frequently—they lived in the same house with me for two years, and went backwards and forwards through the same room that I lived in—I saw this child sometimes once a day, sometimes oftener—the prisoner worked at the gas works, on and off, as a labourer; he was not a constant man—this child had been ailing, on and off, for this last year—I said once I thought it was looking very bad, and asked him why he did not go and get a doctor's order for it, and he told me to mind my own business—I thought he ought to have gone to a doctor with it—I said, "How bad your baby looks"—he said, "It does"—I said, why not send his wife with it to a doctor, and she said she could not as she had nothing to go out in—that was a fact; sometimes she used to sit in her chemise sleeves and an old petticoat and an apron round her shoulders—I spoke about the child's state till I was tired, and he has told me to mind my own business—it used to get a little sop, more often made with sugar and water than milk—the prisoner used to come home regularly, and he used to drink very much when he could get it—he has given his wife sometimes half-a-crown, according to what he has been doing, sometimes 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sometimes 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I do not know out of what sum that was—I have heard her say to him, "Charley, why don't you give me some money to buy an old skirt, to take the child to get some medicine?" and he has said, "That is all I have got"—he used to have his meals at home, and have the same as the others—he used to drink on Friday and Saturday—his wages were paid on Friday usually, and if he worked on Sunday they were paid on Monday morning between 8 o'clock and half-past—he used to get drunk every week if he was in work—I took the child on Saturday, 31st July, to Guy's Hospital, and left it there—it had been suffering from diarrhoea and bronchitis for two or three months before, and was very bad—the prisoner stopped out all that night with 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and came home on Sunday morning about half-past 8 or 9—I was in the room at the time taking up some tea and bread-and-butter for his children, and he gave his wife 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she said, "Charley, wherever have you been?"—he said, "I know where I have been, what has it to do with you?"—she said "I will know," but</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S., M.B. I was acting as house physician at Guy's Hospital on 31st July—I saw the child Charles Parr when it was brought in, in the middle of the day; I examined it—it was very thin and collapsed, and was very dirty, and covered with vermin; it was almost dying, its face was blue—it whined, but it was too weak to cry out like a healthy child—in my judgment it was suffering from starvation produced by want of food or by some wasting disease—I attended to it, and it remained under my treatment until its death on 7th August—I did not anticipate its recovery, it was too far gone—it revived and rallied for a few hours under treatment and care at the hospital—it died from exhaustion produced by neglect and want of food; there was a little bronchitis, but that was not the cause of death, a healthy child would probably have recovered from the treatment it received—it suffered from diarrhoea; it was not stopped by the treat<lb/>ment, it went on; that is one of the symptoms of starvation—from the state in which I saw the child its condition must certainly have been coming on gradually for some weeks, probably longer—another surgeon, Mr. Goodall, also saw it—I was not present at the post-mortem—if the child had had proper food and care none of the diseases from which it was suffering would have produced that state in the child; there are diseases which would produce such appearances, but this was brought about by starvation—it revived by food and warmth—it took stimulants at first, and afterwards it took a little food, but then it was very sick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the house physicians at Guy's Hospital—I saw this child on the 31st when it was admitted—it was in a very collapsed condition, and very dirty and emaciated—I thought that condition was brought about either by not having sufficient food or it might have some internal disease which could not be discovered by external examination—I saw it afterwards lying in the cot—I was present at the post-mortem—previous to that the child was weighed, and weighed 9 1/2 lbs—a child of two and a half years old should weigh 18 or 20 pounds—that is the average weight of an ordinary child—I should describe it as a puny child certainly—I found on the post-mortem evidence of bronchitis in both lungs, but only involving part of each lung; there was also a very small ulcer in the stomach, but the rest of the intestines were healthy—there was no fat—there was the merest trace of any in the body internally—I thought that the immediate cause of death was the bronchitis, but I do not think that in a healthy properly fed child that would have been enough to cause death—if it had had proper food and warmth I am of opinion that life would have been prolonged—I thought the ulcer was secondary to the emaciation, and quite recent—there was nothing in the condition of the body to account for the emaciation except want of food—the child must have been gradually getting into that state, and to a person of ordinary intelligence it must have been apparent that it was getting weaker and weaker.</p>

I am a clothier, and live at 1, Longville Road; it is my mother's house—on the night of 20th August I went out between ten and half-past; I closed the street door after me and locked the door of my private room, where I carry on a business of my own—the street door I closed by the latch—I returned between half-past 12 and one, and stood talking there for half an hour to a friend opposite our house—I saw two men loitering outside, Richards was one of them I am sure; I recognised the other man but he was not taken, he was an old lodger at our house—when I went home I found the street door open; I met my mother in the passage; Richards had gone away then—I went over the house with my mother, and on the top floor found Clark in custody of a lodger who was then living in the house—I then went out for a constable and on my return with him I saw Richards—I told the constable to stop them both; there was another man with Richards, the same I had seen before—they both ran away; the constable followed Richards and he was stopped by 141 L—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the key of our street door that was given specially to the old lodger for his use; it fits our door—it was found on Clark.</p>

I was on the right hand side of Dante Road when my attention was first called to this matter; the prosecutor came to me from Longfield Road—I then walked towards Longfield Road and saw the two men standing about eight yards away near the dead wall and within a few yards of Longfield Road—there is a turning both right and left—when you go up Longfield Road towards Churchyard Road on the right is David Passage and on the left, right at the bottom, is a short turning that runs into the end of Brook Street—the two men did not start to run in the same direction; they separated at once—Lewis, who was not caught, ran to the left up Dante Road into Newington Butts—Richards went to the right up Elliott Road, a narrow turning, and crossed Brook Street into a narrow street which I don't know the name of—there is a colour printer's at the top—at the corner of this is Hale Street, a very short turning of five houses; he went into that and then turned sharp to his left and ran up what I think is Elliott Row, which brought him into St. George's Road; he then went across the road and turned to the left, which brought him to Burnham Street, which is on the right going from the Elephant and Castle, where he was stopped by the other constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife; he is an architect and architect's draughtsman, and has been in the service of the Great Eastern Railway Company for ten years—he was at work on a set of plans and tracings for Dr. Swallow's house; most of the work was done in June, 1885; they were delivered on Juno 19th to Mr. Cole, together with this bill—these are the drawings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), so much as relates to them in the bill comes to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my husband had to have assistance during the last fortnight, and he worked himself as well on them—when I delivered the plans to the prisoner he looked them all through, and said he was well pleased with the drawings, and quite satisfied with the bill—I gave him this receipt on the back of it—I remember my husband being at work on the Workmen's Dwellings plan—this telegram came, and my husband took them to Waterloo Station. (<hi rend="italic">The telegram was dated Septem<lb/>ber</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th, and was from the prisoner, asking the prosecutor to meet him with the plans and tracings at Waterloo.</hi>) On 29th October my husband handed to Mr. Cole at our house these plans of the Oddfellows' Hall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My husband does not carry on the business of an architect, but does drawings in his leisure hours—the telegram of Septem<lb/>ber 5th relates to the Workmen's Dwellings—I saw my husband and the assistant working on the Clapham plans for Dr. Swallow—they were kept at our house—I fix the date on which they were delivered to the prisoner by the bill dated June 19th, which I delivered with them—this is the original bill; we had a copy of it—the receipt was on the bill when I delivered it to the prisoner—I think there is a little doubt of that date, the 30th, being in my husband's handwriting.

               <p>Dr. Swallow's house at Clapham, I made these drawings for him for that house—while they were in progress they were taken away to show Dr. Swallow, who suggested alterations; the prisoner brought them back to be altered and they were completed and ready to go out with all additions and alterations just before 19th June; they were left with my wife to be delivered to the prisoner in a complete state—he never objected to the prices I charged—I made some drawings and tracings for him which were delivered about 1st September, for the Workmen's Dwellings, he sent me this telegram and I delivered them to him at Waterloo Station on September 5th—6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was a reasonable charge for those plans according to my usual charge—11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was a reasonable and fair charge for the Clapham plans—in October I did some drawings of the Oddfellows' Hall at Working, I delivered them to the prisoner on 29th October, at my own house, I charged 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I told Mr. Cole they would come to that, and it was arranged between us that was to be about the sum—when the Workmen's Dwellings drawings were finished Cole said "What will they be?"—I said "6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I have done other work for the prisoner before 3rd June for which I have not been paid—when I delivered these sets of plans to him he did not tell me he was an undis<lb/>charged bankrupt, I did not know it of my own knowledge—work done before his bankruptcy for other drawings came to about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this exhibit "B" represents the correct amount of money due to me on Decem<lb/>ber 29th, 1885; I delivered that account to the prisoner; it came to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., cash received 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., leaving a balance of 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had several conversations with him with reference to it, he never objected to the charge of the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on April 14th—the receipt is dated June 30th because I did not give him the receipt at the time, he said "Never mind now, I am in a hurry," and I gave it to him on 30th June—on November 14th I received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This regretted he had not been able to send any cash, but promised to do so next week, and stated that the plans of the Hall were very much liked and that he should have another job for him in a week or two.</hi>) That refers to the Odd<lb/>fellows' Hall—the prisoner said at his solicitors' office that he had received about 785<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Dr. Swallow for the Clapham job, he did not say what part of that he was paid for the plans—these plans occupied me for over three months at night work, and my assistant, whom I had to pay, was at work with me a portion of the time—the prisoner asked me to get assis<lb/>tance, and I did so, in order to get the work done in time.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated April</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd</hi>, 1885, <hi rend="italic">and regretted that he should not be able to finish the drawings of stables and shops before Monday morning.</hi>) Those were the tracings referred to in the former letter. I expect—I cannot say that those drawings I could not finish referred to those charged in my bill—I cannot say if I did any other drawings than those referred to in my bill for April and May—Cole said he did not wish me to go on with this job till the ground was conveyed to Swallow, and the drawings were not completed till after June—the drawings referred to in the letter of 15th May were delivered complete on June 18th or 19th to Cole—the drawings in respect of the last job, the Oddfellows' Hall, were delivered in October—they were not returned for alterations, they were perfectly satisfactory—after his discharge Cole came to me and asked me to make alterations—I asked him if he would promise me some money, and he said he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday if I did it—I made the tracing, but got no money—I knew he was a bankrupt at that</p>

I swear—I suppose I gave the prisoner this receipt for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 30th June because he asked me for it—I will swear the prisoner came to me after he had paid the money and asked for a receipt—I did not give him receipts at the time—I reckoned the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he gave me on 17th July would come off the commencement of my ac<lb/>count, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which was partly done before the bankruptcy; I thought it was right to take it off the commencement of my account—I had no authority for applying the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the first items of the old account—I did not charge per hour; I arrived at my charges by the time it took me and by the value of the work when it was finished; I charged no more than was correct—I charged no percentage on the amount of the contractor's job—I authorised my solicitors to write to the prisoner on 1st March asking for an explanation as to payment for work and labour done—on 8th March I received this from the prisoner.

(<hi rend="italic">This stated that if he wished to take proceedings he could do so; that he disputed his account and would pay him at his option.</hi>) I had no knowledge of his bankruptcy until 8th March when he wrote me this letter—I am not aware my wife said she knew it in January—I did not know all through 1885 that he was in difficulties—he did not tell me he had been obliged to call a private meeting of his creditors, nor that he should be obliged to present his petition—whenever I went to him for money he told me he had to sum<lb/>mons parties for whom he had done work—he owed me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time of his bankruptcy, and I was never apprised of it by the Bankruptcy Court—my solicitor, by my authority, applied to the Bankruptcy Court to pro<lb/>secute; I wanted to save the expense of it—the order was refused by the Court because I was not a proved creditor—I left the matter to my solicitor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">argued first, that to convict the defendant there must be an "intent to defraud." The words "intent to defraud" occurring in the Debtors Act</hi>, 1869 (32 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 33 <hi rend="italic">Vict. c.</hi> 62), <hi rend="italic">were incorporated in section</hi> 31 <hi rend="italic">of the Bankruptcy Act</hi>, 1883 (46 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 47 <hi rend="italic">Vict. c.</hi> 52), <hi rend="italic">although they were omitted from the Indictment. He urged, secondly, that credit began to run as soon as the consideration passed, and, there being different pieces of work for which orders were given at different times, credit began to run at different times in respect of each; and, thirdly, he stated it was his intention to call witnesses for the defendant to show that the charges for the plans were excessive.

I am an architect and surveyor, of 7A, Laurence Pountney Hill, and I am architect and Surveyor to the trustees of Bowney Street Estate, on which Dr. Swallow has a small property—in most cases plans of alterations and dwellings on that estate have to be submitted to me—this application in writing was made by the prisoner on 24th April, 1885, with regard to some alterations to Dr. Swallow's property—I answered it—I believe the prisoner left these plans with me on 6th May, and I gave him a receipt on that day for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he paid as my fee—as far as I can remember these plans are in the same condition as when I had them on 6th May—I have no note that I ever received the tracings.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I practise in the Clapham Road—I am subpoenaed here to-day—I instructed the prisoner at the end of April, 1885 to act for me in making certain alterations td my house at Clapham—I saw these plans in the early part of May—on 26th May I finally agreed with him to carry out the proposed alterations, and about a week before that he brought me the entire set of drawings and tracings and specifications; that would be about the 18th—he took them away with him to alter the specification, to bring it within the amount I wished to spend—on 26th May he brought back the plans, and then struck out with his pencil certain parts of the proposed alterations—no alteration was made on the plan itself, but only on the tracing—I did not see the plan again till the early part of June at the building itself; he began building quite at the early part of June—I paid the prisoner 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 26th May, having previously given him two smaller cheques to carry on the earlier negotiations—these tracings were first brought to me about a week before 26th May and were taken away with the plans, and were brought back on 26th May—between those dates a bedroom was taken out and a lead flat put in in these tracings—the tracings were used for the purposes of the work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Nothing had been done to the house on 26th May—I have not seen another set of tracings being used—I did not know of all the plans—the pulling down commenced early in June—there was no discussion with the prisoner about omissions and alterations in the complete set of plans after 3rd June—I saw him and spoke to him after that date—the breakfast and bedroom had all been settled before 26th May—I remember seeing a drawing representing the lead flat, in June probably—Gower may have furnished the prisoner with other tracings in addition to these—the prisoner did not finish this work for me—I paid him the stipulated sum, 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; then the work was not nearly finished, and then I agreed in July to pay him a further sum of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these plans applied to the whole of that—he made no specific charge for drawings and tracings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Jury here interposed, and stated that they had come to the conclusion that the Clapham plans were delivered by</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th May, and that by deducting the charge for those, the amount for which credit was obtained after the prisoner's adjudication as a bankrupt would fall below</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
