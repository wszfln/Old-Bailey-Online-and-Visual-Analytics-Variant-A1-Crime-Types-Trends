               <p>Q. Was she your servant on the 1st of this month - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of that day what time did you leave your house - A. I think it was five minutes past nine. Previous to that time I had been extremly ill, and confined to the house. On that evening I went out accompanied by a friend; I went to the play at Covent Garden; I had locked the doors of the upper rooms, the bed room door, the dressing-room door; four doors I had locked, a cupboard and a closet; the closet and the cupboard were in the bed-room. There is one door leading into the bed-room and one door into the dressing-room. I requested the servant not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150005"/>to leave the house, and to put up the chain when I went out. I returned a little after twelve and found some of the officers at the door; I was very much alarmed. The officers were at the door waiting for me, and some female friends. I did not go up stairs immediately, I was so much terrified. When I went up the officers went with me, I found the dressing-room door broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way had it been fastened - A. It was locked, and the key inside. I went out of that room into the bed-room, bolted that door, and went out of the door that leads into the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into your dressing-room did you find every thing in the same state that you left it - A. No, I found the toilet had been very much pulled about, and my bed had been moved from its place, and the bottom valants pulled off, and I believe one of the side ones; the vallants appeared as if they had been forced off. On going into my bed-room the door leading into my bed-room was open, I believe it was forced open.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us all you observed in the dressing-room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Your bed was not in the dressing-room - A. No. In my dressing-room I only observed my toilet had been moved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. You told me before there was a door that separated the dressing-room from the bed-room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that any thing had been done to that door - A. I cannot say, I was so much alarmed whether it was broken open, or how I got into it. It must have been broken open, or else I could not have got into it; I had bolted it before I went out: the bold was on the bed-room side. I have told you what was the state of the bed. In the room where I kept my trinket box, which was every thing that I had got in it; it was in a small closet on the right hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out had you left that closet locked - A. Locked, and I had the key myself in my drawer, where I always kept it. I found that door broken open; that lock had been forced open, and the screws out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into the closet in what state did you find it - A. I found the trunk safe, and the trinket box in the large closet safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether any force had been used to open the box - A. It appeared to have been a little forced; I went then to the closet where I formerly kept the trinket box, but I had moved it some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left that closet locked or open when you went out - A. Locked: I took the key out and put in my drawer. I found all the shelves broken to pieces, and the bottom part of the cupboard torn up, and the hinges forced off; the hinges were separated from the wood. At the inside of the cupboard was a canvas and a paper on it, it seemed as if there had been a knife through it, to see if it was hollow. The outer bed-room door was locked in the state as I left it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Clayton by himself, or was any man with him - A. He was by himself. There were two men on the other side of the way, I do not know whether they belonged to him or not. Clayton said he had a letter for Mrs. Martin; that was the name my mistress went by. He went away.</p>

               <p>Q. You heard things in the area - A. Yes. My mistress sent me out with a message, and then I saw Clayton; he asked me to take something to drink; I said no, I would rather not; he insisted upon me having something; we went and had something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return to your mistress's house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about his coming into the house - A. Oh dear no, nothing at all; I saw him a night or two afterwards, when I went for things for my mistress; I saw him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to drink any thing - A. No, not that time. He did not return with me to my mistress's house; he was then alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him frequently after that - A. Yes, he spoke to me in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever come to the door after that - A. Not till the last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the first time when the letter was delivered to the last time did you ever see the other prisoner Jenkins - A. No; I never saw him until the 1st of January.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the 1st of January we understand your mistress went to the play - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after your mistress went to the play on the 1st of January did you go out of your mistress's house - A. It wanted ten minutes to ten. When I went out of the house I double locked the door.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw him immediately you went out - A. Yes; I was going to get some sprats for my supper; I immediately when I saw him returned back to the door to get something that I wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the door had you got when Clayton accosted you - A. As far as the corner of King-street. about four doors. When Clayton came up to me he said, I saw your mistress go out; I said, yes, my mistress was gone out; he immediately returned with me to the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you to talk then about your mistress, had you before any conversation about your mistress - A. No. We both returned back to the door, and Clayton said, let me go down stairs for about half an hour; he said he would go against she came home from the play; I told him my mistress suffered no men to come after the maid-servant, and the door was open he immediately rushed in.</p>
               <p>Q. The door was open during the time you had that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150006"/>conversation - A. Yes, I had it a jar, and he desired to go down stairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Had you a lamp burning in the passage - A. Yes. I and Clayton went down stairs, he sat down: there was a stone bottle on the dresser, he said give me the bottle, I will go and get a quartern of rum: he went away with the stone bottle, I remained in the house. He returned in about five minutes. While he was gone I went into the parlour to stir the fire up. The street door was shut during his absence.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned back how did he gain admittance - A. He knocked at the door, and Jenkins came in after him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they come in - A. Clayton came in first and when the other man came in he said it is all right. Clayton shut the door. I denied Jenkins coming in, and told him I dare not have two, if I asked one I could not ask two; I said it out loud: Clayton made answer and said, it is all bloody stuff; they said no further; then they went down stairs, I went after them. When they got down stairs they drank a glass each, and left a glass on the table for me to take.</p>
               <p>Q. After that what was done - A. Clayton said, I insist upon you to go up stairs; he caught hold of me and insisted upon my shewing him where my mistress's purse of guineas were; I made answer, I never saw my mistress only with one while I was with her, and she said she would sell it.</p>
               <p>COURT. One what - A. One guinea, sir. They then dragged me up stairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Who dragged you up stairs - A. Clayton, the other man went with the candle. Clayton went up first, I was second, and Jenkins was behind with a candle, they were dragging me up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. In your way up the kitchen stairs was any thing said by either of them to you - A. Jenkins said it was all bloody stuff, for I knew where the guineas were; I said, Lord have mercy upon me, pray, for God's sake do not touch my mistress's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you got upon the top of the kitchen stairs what passed then - A. It was then I said Lord have mercy upon me; I spoke it loud, the persons by must have heard; I dare say the gentleman at the door heard me.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up the first flight of stairs the same as you did the kitchen stairs - A. Yes, I went up that flight of stairs by force. He immediately broke the dressing-room door open. The candle went out on first stairs, Jenkins went down stairs and lit it, and returned with the light. Clayton told Jenkins to go and get a light. Then we went up the second flight of stairs to my mistress's dressing-room door; Clayton bursted the door open: he put his back against the garret stair-case, and his footagainst the door, and pushed it open.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the door was forced open where was Jenkins - A. He was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do anything - A. Not then. I said, pray for God's sake do not; Clayton answered it was all stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you got to the dressing-room did you see any pistol - A. Yes, Jenkins had it in his right-hand pocket, he produced it, and gave it to Clayton, Clayton put it to my head and told me if I made the least alarm he would blow my brains out. He held the pistol in his hand, and put it to the side of my head, and with the other hand he had hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been making any noise - A. All the way up stairs I cried out, the kitchen stairs and all.</p>
               <p>Q. The door being broken open you all three, I suppose went into the room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was then done - A. They opened the bedroom door, they undid the handle, it was not bolted, he took hold of the handle and opened it.</p>
               <p>COURT. There was a bolt was not there - A. It was not bolted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. When you got into the bed-room what did they proceed to do - A. Clayton went to the closet, he pulled the paper off the key-hole, the keyhole was pasted over; I never saw the cupboard opened before. Jenkins then pulled out a case of little things, screw drivers, picklock keys, and several things, and put them on my mistress's bed; he took the screw driver, or the picklock key for the purpose of undoing the cupboard door; he did not open it; he sent Jenkins down for the kitchen poker.</p>
               <p>COURT. What door - A. The cupboard door on the side of my mistress's bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Who was the man that tried to open the door with the instrument - A. Clayton. He was not able to open the door with the instrument, he sent Jenkins down for the kitchen poker; he went down and returned with the kitchen poker, and Clayton opened the door with the kitchen poker; he put the poker underneath the door, and bursted the cupboard door open; he then bursted the bottom part of the cupboard open; Clayton said the guineas were there; the cupboard was empty, there was nothing in it; he put a pen-knife all over the paper. There then was the cupboard on the other side of the fire place, Clayton forced that open; there was a trunk there that had my mistress's property, Clayton forced that open with a screw driver. They tried to open the trunk, I told them it was of no use, my mistress's property was down stairs, they did not open it. At the time that the attempt was made to open the trunk I heard a noise below; I said immediately the property was down stairs. I thought of getting lower down, they had hold of me; we all came down together and there was a knock at the street-door; I went to the door and opened it, and the officers rushed in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Are the Bow-street officers here - A. They are here.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Clayton came at first with a letter - A. Yes. He was a perfect stranger to me, I never saw him with my eyes before.</p>
               <p>Q. You had something to drink with him - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. You said this night you were going out on some errand of your own - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not wish him to come down stairs with you - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. But yet you neglected your own business - A. I did not neglect my own business; the woman had sold all her sprats, and was gone; she sat at the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the bottle was standing at the dresser<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150007"/>dy - A. Not ready for him; it always stood there.</p>
               <p>Q. He went for a quartern of rum, you went to stir the parlour fire you opened the door, and in they came - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to the public house this night and ask for Clayton - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you knew the pistol was not loaded - A. I did not. He put it to my head and said he would blow my brains out.</p>

            , and Townsend were watching the house with me. Under the direction of the office we watched the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect on what night you went to watch the house first - A. On the 23d of December we watched the house; the first and the second night we got into a house right facing of it, so as to be able to see every thing that came to the door; I saw Clayton one night in the street; I saw him speaking to the servant, the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was that - A. Not exactly at the door, but a little of one side of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him do any thing to the house, or come to the house - A. No. We continued watching the house until the 1st. On the evening of the 1st between ten and eleven o'clock, I was at the public-house and the other four were watching; Read, the two Limbricks, and Townsend were watching opposite; I received an information that the two prisoners were gone in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where is the public-house, how near - A. At the corner of the street, just by. When they informed me I went to them and we all stood about the door; I peeped down, and looked into the area, there is an iron railing goes over; I there heard some loud talk, and I saw a man's hat lay on the dresser, and presently I heard some people coming up the kitchen stairs, I heard the voice of a woman screaming; then they all went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a noise upon their going up stairs - A. I did, and after they went up stairs I heard a great noise, such as bursting and breaking open of doors, as I supposed it was. I continued at the door a great while untill all was silent, I could hear nothing at all, and then I thought they might be doing the servant some injury; I then got a crow in order to break the door open; in doing that I made such a noise as any person in the house must have heard me, and by that noise they all came down stsirs; me and the other officers rushed in. The door opened, I cannot say who opened it. I and Townsend took Jenkins, and the other officers took the other. We took him to a public-house opposite. I searched him and found this pistol on him, it was not loaded. The other prisoner was taken at the same time all in the passage. After searching the prisoner Jenkins I returned back to the house of the prosecutrix. In the passage these things were picked up, it is a case of small chissels, screw drivers, &amp;c.; it was picked up and given me by somebody there; I did not see it picked up. I went up stairs to see what they had done.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went did you find the house in the state that the girl has described it - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mary Wakelin. You spoke of a case that was put on the bed by Jenkins - A. Yes, this was the same one.</p>

               <p>Q. You were one of the persons that were set to watch the house - A. I was the person that received the information; I first went there on Monday the 23d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the 23d of December and the 1st of January had you seen either of the prisoners about there - A. I had seen Clayton standing at Mrs. Martin's door; I saw him there three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the 1st of January tell me what you saw - A. About nine o'clock the servant girl went out, she returned in about ten minutes with a hackney coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Clayton before that time - A. Not that night.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact when the coach came the mistress went away - A. Yes. In about ten minutes the girl came out and shut the door after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Clayton between the time of the coach going away and the girl going out - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Clayton - A. In about five minutes after the girl went out Clayton and the girl returned arm in arm together to Mrs. Martin's door.</p>

               <p>Q. When they got to the door were you near enough to hear any thing that was said by either of them - A. No. They talked at the door ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before they went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at that time the person of Clayton - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see Clayton again - A. In about a quarter of an hour Clayton came out.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did he return - A. In about five minutes with another man with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time know who the other man was - A. I did not. Clayton knocked at the door, the servant opened it, Clayton went in, and the other forced himself in; Clayton paused at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe in what manner the other man forced himself in - A. It appeared that Clayton held the door until the other man came round by the shutters and forced himself in.</p>
               <p>Q. So that till the other man came in the servant girl who opened the door could not see him - A. No: he came round by the shutters and forced himself in, and we heard the door bang to. I gave information to Perry, and then we came to the prosecutrix's door we crossed over the way; I looked down the area, I saw a man's hat lay on the table, they all of them seemed to be talking loud.</p>
               <p>COURT. Who was talking loud - A. I heard the men's voices taking very loud.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Were you able to hear any thing that was said by either of them - A. No. I heard the girl cry out, Lord have mercy upon me, what shall I do; she continued the cry all up stairs, she appeared to cry very much; then I heard a great noise as if doors were being broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear anything more than what Perry has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150008"/>told us - A. Nothing more, until they came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When the door was opened which of the men did you take in custody - A. Clayton, and I took him over to the wine vaults and searched him; upon him I found this knife and a dollar; I then took him to the office, and he was committed. This is the knife I found upon Clayton, it appeared bent, as if it had been pushed against places.</p>

               <p>Q. When you got to the door what did you observe - A. I kneeled down and peeped through the keyhole to see what was passing through the passage; there was a lamp burning in the passage; the first I saw was Clayton and Jenkins and the servant between them both going up stairs; I heard the girl say, do not, my mistress will be ruined, and I shall be ruined myself; I think them are the words; she said it loud, so that I could hear it, and people that were standing outside as well. They went up stairs, and in about three or four minutes afterwards I saw one of the prisoners, which I cannot take upon me to say, come down and light a candle from the lamp; he returned up stairs with the light. I heard a great knocking up stairs for about the space of five minutes; I then saw Jenkins coming down stairs with the candle in his hand alight; I expected he was coming out of the street door, but he went down the kitchen stairs; I saw him return up stairs with the poker in his hand; he went up stairs, and we heard a knocking up stairs, and in the course of about two minutes I did not hear the servant speak at all; I said I am afraid they are doing something to the servant we had better break in; I saw no more than what the other witnesses have told, except after the prisoners were taken we secured them; at the moment I lit a candle and went up stairs; I found this skeleton key laying in the passage; it is a picklock. This picklock fits the case that has been produced; I found it where the prisoners were apprehended.</p>

            . Q. I do not know whether you know any more than what the others have deposed to - A. No more than I saw Clayton go in; I saw him several nights before; the other prisoner I had not. The time that Clayton went in was between nine and ten o'clock, he staid in some time, and when he came out and returned and brought Jenkins with him it was gone ten. Here is the staple of the dressing-room door, which they forced out, and here is some of the paper that covered the key-hole of the cupboard, and here are the screws that came out of the cupboard, which were concealed under the paper.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of October do you recollect the prisoner receiving any order from Wood and Cunningham in Bath - A. I recollect he had an order, I cannot say when it was.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of receiving that order did the prisoner give you any order respecting packing them up - A. I assisted in packing them up, he told me how I was to do them; I cannot recollect exactly what he said. Upon the bottles that he had filled with medicine I was to put on the stamps.</p>
               <p>Q. What directions did he give you for putting the stamp on - A. I was to cut out the center part with Jones, Bristol on them; I was to paste them on, and the sealing wax was to fill up the part where Jones and Bristol had been on it.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was the sealing wax to perform - A. To fill up the part where the words had been cut out, and the remaining part of the stamp was to be pasted on each side of the bottle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Look at that stamp and tell me whether it was stamps of that description that you put on the bottles - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how many in number you were to put on - A. No, I cannot; there were many of different kind of medicines.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150009"/>Q. Were they all bottle medicines - A. Some of them were lozenges, and Jones Bristol were cut out of the stamp, put on the boxes, and a label was put on the vacancy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the manner in which it was done - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other medicines besides the bottle medicines, and the box medicines - A. No, I do not recollect any other.</p>
               <p>Q. After you put on the stamp by the prisoners directions what became of the medicines - A. They were packed up in a square deal box.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you saw any invoice that was made out by the prisoner - A. That is the invoice that was made out to accompany the box; I did not see it made out; it was put in the box, and the box was sent by the boy to go to some inn to go to Bath; I cannot say what inn. It was given to Joseph, a boy that lives in the house, for the purpose of being taken to the waggon. The prisoner was in the back parlour at the time, and he lifted it on the boy's shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to this time when the box of medicines were packed up had he given you any information of the stamps whether they were genuine or not - A. I left Mr. Collicott nn the 17th of September, I returned about the 21st of October, he produced to me some stamps of this description.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was that the first time that you had seen stamps of that description - A. The first time I had seen some of that description.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. At the time he shewed you the stamps did he make any observation respecting them - A. He said he intended to use them instead of the real stamp.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was that the expression - A. It might not be the exact words, it is as near as I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time or any subsequent time give you any instructions how you were to use them - A. He did not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of November last do you recollect the officer coming there accompanied with Mr. France - A. Not in November; about the 6th of December I recollect Mr. France coming to master's house accompanied by some officer.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time the prisoner was absent was the house searched - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any stamps found - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see produce them - A. Mr. Vickery.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the stamps found in your presence - A. No. I was up stairs at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to tell me whether the stamps that Vickrey produced were the stamps that were in your apron - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they in your apron - A. I put them there. I put the stamps in my apron after the officers came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know for what purpose the officers came there - A. Afterwards I did.</p>
               <p>Q. After the stamps were produced were these the stamps that were in Mr. Collicot's house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where did you take them from - A. From a back closet.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any thing said by any other person respecting these stamps - A. Not by any person. I heard Mrs. Collicott request him not to use them; she requested him several times not to use them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. These things you call stamps, they never had the coronet of a crown affixed upon them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Around the stamp there is a circle, and in the circle of a genuine stamp a crown is placed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now these that are called stamps had not the crown, nor the sum payable as the duty - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Before you put this label upon the boxes, and upon the bottles, where did you get them - A. I took them out of the back shop closet where Mr. Collicott kept them; he directed me where to get them, and after I saw them they were always kept there.</p>

Mr. Collicott informs Messrs. Wood and Co. he recently purchased some stamps, which have since turned out to be not correct, and not knowing whether any of them were used sent to Mr. W., should be obliged for him to remove every thing used by a stamp, and to be sent to London, they shall be returned free. If it happens that two or three respectable men call upon you shall be obliged by your telling them you are out of the article, but you expect a supply. Your obliged humble servant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, Q. to Mr. Wood. Did you receive this by post - A. Yes. In consequence of that letter I directed it to be done, and I believe it was done, and in two or three days after Mr. France from the stamp-office came to me, and I delivered up to Mr. France the box of medicines.</p>

            . Q. You I believe are a police officer - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the 6th of December go with Mr. France to apprehend the prisoner - A. I did. I searched the house, I found a quantity of paper resembling stamps, with some bottles with stamps on them. I found the loose stamps in an apron tied up together, and put into a coal-hole under the front area.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went into the house did you see the young woman that has been examined of the name of King - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw her had she an apron on - A. She had.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were up stairs did she quit the place where you and Mr. France was - A. She did, for the purpose of getting us a light, and when she returned she had not any apron on.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you searched and found the stamps in the coal-hole - A. I did; they have been locked up by me ever since. These small bottles I found in the apron with the stamps upon them. I after that went to a place called Pell, below Bristol, on the 8th of December, that was two days after I had searched the house, I apprehended him there, and brought him up to London.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of his apprehension did you find any more bottles - A. I did, in a bundle that he produced from his bed-room; there are also stamps upon them two large bottles; there is the impression of a seal of T C upon the top of the bottle, the other is plain; both the bottles have stamps upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did you arrive in town - A. On the 10th I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. I will thank you to shew me the impression of the stamp for medicines of the value of above a shilling, and not exceeding two shillings and sixpence, used in pursuance of the act of parliament, the 44th of his present majesty - A. These are them.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Marchant I believe is the engraver at the Stamp office - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Look at that, is that at the sides of it like it or different - A. It is not like it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Mention what the difference is - A. They are of no comparison to the stamp office labels.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is a genuine stamp, is it not - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the ornament about these words, though not so well done, is it or is it not done so as to appear in imitation - A. In imitation of the genuine stamp, so that I might buy it myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is, you might take it for the genuine stamp - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Take that bottle in your hand, do you mean the imitation is such that any purchaser without an accurate observation might take it for the genuine stamp - A. I might buy them myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in your judgment, sir, these are not genuine stamps - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Linley. Have you looked over all these in the box - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Just take some out, are they genuine or not - A. They are not the stamps of the stamp office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they are not genuine stamps - A. No. Dalby's Carminative, that is not the stamp-office stamp.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Does not the stamp-office allow venders of medicines to-use stamps of their own form - A. Only of their own name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You allow persons who take a certain quantity from you to have their name on the stamp - A. They apply to the board to have their own name on; it is made by our own engraver, and it is kept in my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of those which you have examined, the Dalby's carminative, is that a stamp ever authorised by the commissioners of the stamps - A. It is not.</p>

               <p>COURT, Q. to Mr. Wood. What was the nature of your dealing with the prisoner Collicott in the sale of these medicines did you sell them on his account to receive a commission for such as you sold and to return them unsold to him, or were they charged to you and you debitted with them - A. I sold them on my account, and not on any commission; I paid the carriage down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                        targets="t18120115-4-defend99 t18120115-4-deflabel24"/> - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe sir, in the course of the last summer you made a purchase or a contract of a large estate - A. I did, in the month of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in the month of August apprise Mr. Walsh of your having made that purchase - A. I did, I told him that I had made the contract for the purchase of the estate, which I expected to be completed on the ensuing Michaelmas, and then to be called upon for the payment of it, for which it would be necessary to make provision by the sale of stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you advise him that the amount of stock would be large - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consult with Mr. Walsh of selling the stock then, or deferring the sale until the time that you made the payment - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time in August what advice did Mr. Walsh give you - A. To postpone the sale of the stock saying that the prospect was that the stocks would considerably rise, that it would recover from the oppression it had suffered gradually, therefore the longer it was postponed the better.</p>
               <p>Q. The contract is not yet completed. Did you in the hourse of that morning tell him the execution of the contract was not completed - A. I am not sure whether I communicated that to him, but in the middle of the month of November Mr. Walsh urged me strongly to sell the stock, and at that time I certainly told him that the contract was not completed and that at present I had no occasion for the money, and it was quite uncertain when I should; I believe I said that it was probable it would not be completed before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Walsh give you any other reason for selling the stock - A. At an early period, for the want of money he told me it was his opinion that the stock would fall considerably; he urged the advice repeatedly.</p>
               <p>Q. By repeatedly do you mean different days - A. Different days, and at one of these times I very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150012"/>well remember he stated to me to be the opinion of intelligent persons at the stock exchange that the 3 per cent. stocks would be low as 50.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time I believe sir they were about 62 or 63 - A. I believe so. He came to my chambers at Lincolns Inn for the purpose of repeating the advice, and he wrote notes (I have looked for them, they are lost, I cannot find them) for the purpose of immediate sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, sir, in consequence of this advice, on the 28th of November, give Mr. Walsh any advice to sell the stock - A. I wrote a note for that purpose on the 28th of November; I have not got that note now.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of stock did you authorise Mr. Walsh to sell - A. I think it was thirteen thousand in the 4 per cents. and eighteen thousand six hundred three per cents. reduced.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that was on the Thursday - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Friday morning did you go into the city to Mr. Walsh's office - A. I did. I saw him, he told me that he had made a contract for the sale of that sum, and asked me whether I could come for the transfer of it on the Wednesday or Thursday following, saying it would be necessary to give notice before on what day I should come for the purpose, in order that the purchaser might have notice, and be prepared with his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he assign any reason why you were not to deliver the stock that day, or any other day - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you gone there for the purpose of selling that stock if he had done it that day - A. That was the only reason for which I went, and to purchase exchecquer bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that day had any thing passed between you and Mr. Walsh - A. I had consulted with him what was to be done when it was sold, until I paid for the estate what would be the best way of disposing of or placing the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Mr. Walsh told you would be the best way of disposing of your money - A. In exchecquer bills, the advice which he repeated to me on Friday the 29th. I believe I should mention that before I authorised Mr. Walsh to sell out the stock I had mentioned my intention to a commercial gentleman, who gave the same advice to sell the stock.</p>
               <p>COURT. To sell the stock and to place it in any thing of exchecquer bills - A. No. But certainly the idea of selling the stock at all premature was entirely oweing to Mr. Walsh, without which probably I should not have sold it to this hour, as I had no occasion for the money for any other purpose than paying for that estate.</p>
               <p>Q. After your return home did you find a letter from Mr. Walsh - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the letter - A. It is the letter, I believe it to be the hand-writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>(The letter read.)</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday or Tuesday did you write a note to Mr. Walsh for your going into the city to transfer the stock - A. I did, either on Monday the 2d, or Tuesday the 3d. I have not got the note. I appointed Wednesday to be the day to tranfer the stock.</p>
               <p>Q. On Wednesday did you attend accordingly and transfer the stock with Mr. Walsh your broker - A. I did. I went into the city for the purpose of completeing the whole business, to transfer the stock, and to purchase exchecquer bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Walsh furnish you with exchecquer bills on that day - A. He did not, he told me it was too late to get exchecqur bills that day.</p>
               <p>Q. What was to be done with the money for the sale of your stock - A. I left him to receive it, and to pay it into my bankers, which he said he should do.</p>
               <p>Q. Your bankers are Messrs. Gosling and Sharpe, in Fleet-street - A. Yes. He told me he should call on me at my chambers in Lincolns Inn for the purpose of receiving a check upon my bankers for the money, in order that it might be laid out in exchecquer bills on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning did he wait on you at Lincolns Inn for that purpose - A. He did, soon after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him a check on your bankers - A. I did, I gave him a check on my bankers for twenty-two thousand two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. That exceeded by some hundreds what you sold - A. It did. The produce of the stock sold was twenty-one thousand seven hundred pounds, I made it up twenty-two thousand two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you give that check on your bankers of twenty-two thousand two hundred pounds - A. For the purpose of being laid out in exchecquer bills, and for no other purpose; and he promised to lay out the money in that manner, and to bring the exchecquer bills to my bankers or myself at four o'clock that day. This was Thursday the 5th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you on the afternoon of that day - A. He came to me about half past four or a quarter before five at Lincoln's Inn, he appeared a little out of breath; he came up stairs and complained of an asthma; he said he had the disease of which his father had died. I persuaded him to sit down and not to converse until he had recovered. After a little pause he produced a paper to me; that is the paper he produced to me, giving me the account of what he had done for me that day. This is the accompt of the stock sold, and the exchecquer bills that he had purchased.</p>
               <p>(The paper read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Walsh furnish you with the accompt of whom you had bought these exchecquer bills for fifteen thousand pounds - A. He did; the fifteen thousand pounds exchecquer bills of Mr. Coutts's broker. I think he mentioned Mr. Trotter, but I am not certain. He stated that they could not be delivered on that day because they were locked up in a drawer, but they were to be delivered at half an hour after three o'clock on Saturday the 7th, the next day but one, and that he should call on me that day at three o'clock to receive a check upon my bankers for the money to pay for the exchecquer bills, he having, as he stated, paid into the bankers that money, the fifteen thousand pounds into the bankers, Messrs. Gosling and Sharpe, he produced a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. They were your bankers for the exchecquer bills - A. Yes. Mr. Walsh left me in a short time;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150013"/>after enquiring after my family he left my chambers.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Walsh was gone did you find there was no receipt at your bankers for the fifteen thousand five hundred pounds - A. I perceived there was no receipt for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which I believe you went down to your bankers and made some enquiry - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning I believe you went to Mr. Walsh's office - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe you found he was gone - A. I did not see him. I never saw him afterwards untill I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that he made an appointment for the money to pay Mr. Coutts's broker that money on that Saturday, did you receive this note - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this his hand-writing, and by whom was it brought to you - A. It is his hand-writing. Two persons called, one of them is Mr. Anstry, his clerk, the other is a professional gentleman, Mr. Titsell.</p>
               <p>Q. By this time it was quite discoverable that you were after Mr. Walsh - A. It was. (The letter read addressed to the Solicitor General.)</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that letter, in that the hand-writing of Mr. Walsh - A. I believe it is. (The letter read, dated December 6, 1811, addressed B. Walsh, Esq. M. P. London.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are these several papers the hand-writing of Mr. Walsh - A. I believe that to be; the second paper, the third paper, the fourth paper, the fifth, the sixth, seventh, and eighth; I believe them all to be the hand-writing of Mr. Walsh.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scarlet. I believe Sir Thomas you placed a very implicit confidence in the prisoner - A. I did, and I have done so for a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a stock-broker by trade - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether the purchase of exchecquer bills came from you originally or whether it came from him - A. I am sure I cannot be positive; very likely it might be my own; I certainly communicated to him that I did not want the money only for the purchase of an estate when it was fixed, and certainly something must be done with the money, and I remember asking him whether it was worth while to invest it in exchequer bills, and he said it certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when the money was received whether he paid any money into the bankers, or by a draft - A. I do not know of my own knowledge, but I believe he paid it by a draft; I have understood there were two checks to the amount of one thousand pounds, and another check of his own not quite the whole amount; the whole amount was not paid in, he paid it short two hundred and seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you, sir, whether the whole purchase, the sale of stock and the purchase of exchequer bills are in the trade of a stock broker - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Your whole object was in laying out twenty-two thousand two hundred pounds in exchequer bills - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I will now ask you, sir, whether it was left to his discretion to pay it in your own bankers - A. I gave him the check in the usual mode.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had paid the check itself to the person himself whom he bought, formed no part of the contract, or if he had paid the check into the bankers - A. I certainly expected he was going to pay the check into my bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether that formed any part of the contract - A. Certainly not. He had told me that he should pay it into my bankers, and that he should call upon my bankers to receive a check for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. It was no part of your contract that he should take the check from you and receive bank notes - A. It was no part of the contract; I expected he would. He told me that he paid it into the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was his practice to take the check to his bankers, or to pay it into yours antecedent - A. Yes; generally he used to lay out his money first, in former transactions, and then called upon me for a check upon my bankers to reimburse him what he had laid out. Sometimes I delivered him the money. (A letter read, dated December 5, 1811, and others dated December 6, 1811, December 7th, and 8th, 1811.</p>

            . Q. I believe you are an agent for the sale and purchase of American stock - A. I am. I am in partnership with Mr. Dearman and Bell, under the firm of Debirt, Dearman and Bell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Walsh - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of November had he any conversation with you respecting the purchase of American stock - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he made any enquiry of you respecting American stock - A. He had; whether there was a good many in the market, and whether the sum of ten or eleven thousand pounds sterling money could be purchased. I told him that American stock was scarce, but I believe in a few days it might be accomplished; I would enquire and let him know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you respecting the sort of American stock - A. It did. I suggested it was necessary to know whether the purchaser meant to send it out as a remittance to America, or as a capitalist to keep it here.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say that was necessary to be known - A. Because there is some sort of stock that is best calculated for America, and others for those who reside here; Mr. Walsh said he thought it would be wanted for America.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect how long this was before the 29th of November - A. Two or three interviews had taken place previous to the 29th of November nothing more past than reporting what stock was to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. You had reported to him the condition of the market - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 29th of November had Mr. Walsh called at your office - A. I think he did; I think about twelve o'clock, and I afterwards went to him at his office; I then told him I found the stock could be purchased, and for so large a sum I would request him to give me a written order with the price for my government; he gave me this written order signed B. Walsh, November 29, 1811, Debirt and Co. please to purchase eleven thousand pounds in America 3 per cents or bank shares preference to be given to the latter; the price not to exceed to be paid for an Wednesday.</p>

               <p>Q. That Wednesday was the 4th of December on that Wednesday did Mr. Walsh call upon you - A. He did; he said that it was not convenient to pay for it on that day but he would pay for it on the morrow at twelve o'clock, if I would call upon him. On Thursday the 5th I called upon him soon after twelve at his office in Angel-court, he said here are eleven thousand bank notes, count them; I did; he gave me eleven bank notes of one thousand pound each; he said you need not hurry yourself in the delivery of the stock, make it convenient any time this morning. I delivered it that day I believe about a quarter after three with the accompt. I have that accompt with me, this is it. (The accompt read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Ten thousand eighteen pound ten shillings and sixpence was the sum that he had paid to you, for which he gave you eleven thousand pounds in bank notes - A. Yes, and the balance I gave to him by a draft on the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at this, are they American certificates of bank shares of American stock - A. Those I examined in Bow-street were the same; I examined them correctly there, and that is the identical stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass between you and Mr. Walsh - A. Upon Mr. Walsh locking up the stock in his iron safe, as he was locking it up; I said, Mr. Walsh if this stock is to go to America, shall I bring our notary to prepare it is usual. He then said I do- not know that it is going to America, but I am going out of town for two or three days, and you may call, or I will see you in the beginning of the week.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person take these things to America will they be of use to him there without a notary - A. If they are lost the record, the entery in the book is like a policy of insurance.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150015"/>Q. If a person has them in his pocket it does not want to be registered - A. But then if lost it cannot be recovered. I immediately took the notes to the office that I received of Mr. Walsh; I think I delivered them to Mr. Dearman; my clerk, Ellison, was present.</p>
               <p>MR. JENKINS. Q. Did you see the last witness, Mr. Debirt, carefully examine these papers at Bow-street - A. I did. They are the same papers, they have been sealed up ever since. I am certain they are the same and in the same state.</p>

I had been making repeated applications to him for payment from time to time, and having bought the lease of a house in Lothbury, for which I expected to be called upon for payment; I had been for some time particular urgent upon him. In consequence of which he said, I think about a week previous to the 5th of December that if I would make out the accompt he would compare it and settle; I think to the best of my recollection that I sent him the account on Monday the 2d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the 5th did he make you any payment - A. Upon the Monday he said he was in hopes that he should be able to settle it on the Tuesday.

About half past twelve, at his office; he called upon me about twelve o'clock at the Temple, and then afterwards walked with me into the city.

               <p>Q. On Saturday the 4th of January at what time on that day were you last in these wine vaults - A. About six o'clock in the evening; I believe I was the last person there. I saw two men examine the locks, the patrol was there; I told him to keep a sharp look out; I examined the place, and the locks of the door were on a patent lock and a padlock. In consequence of information on Sunday morning I went again to the cellar about eight o'clock; Mr. Smith and Lucas came to me when I came to the cellar door the bar was broken off, and the lock was gone; I went into the cellar; in the inner cellar there were eighteen bottles standing empty, they contained port wine before. The corks were then wet with wine. I examined the corks, our names were upon them from the impression of a seal which I have in my pocket, they were close to the bin. I examined the bin, there were six hundred and twenty-seven in the bin, and the mark outside was six hundred and forty-five, exactly eighteen deficient. The first bin was as if something fresh had been taken from it, by the sawdust; that was another bin, there was a deficiency of fifteen in that bin.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you look round your cellar and find anything there - A. We found a bladder by the bin where the eighteen bottles had been taken; this is the bladder. I went to Mr. Betts', Mr. Lucas produced some bottles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. When you returned on the Sunday morning did you find any lock there - A. No, the hasp was broken off, no lock could be affixed to it.</p>

            . I keep a cook's shop, 15, Miles's-lane, Cannon-street.</p>
               <p>Q. In the beginning of this month did either of the prisoners come to your house - A. Goulding and Robinson came to my house about ten o'clock on the 4th of this month, they asked meif I would buy any wine, they said they were going to work in the evening, they should either get some wine or spirits, if they could get it at the shop they had picked out it would be port wine; if not, they could not tell what it would be. I was to give them ten shillings a gallon for port wine, rum thirteen shillings, brandy one pound. They went away saying that they should be back early in the evening, before the watch came on; they said they were going to meet Price. As soon as they were gone I went to Mr. Lucas, I communicated to him all that had taken place; I made an appointment to meet them at Mr. Betts's house at the bottom of Miles's-lane at five o'clock in the the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Now before this appointment did you go any where that afternoon - A. I went to the sign of the Crocked Billet, Rosemary-lane, where I knew these men used to resort: I first met Goulding there, Robinson<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150019"/>and Price came there a little afterwards; they then told me to make haste home, or else they should be gone, and have committed the robbery, and be at my house before I was ready for it. I immediately went to Mr. Betts and acquainted him, and then I went home to my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did either of the prisoners come to yon - A. About seven. Then Goulding, Price, and Robinson came saying that they had been to try the shop, but the patrol and people were so much about they could not get in. They asked me if I would let them leave the tools till the next morning; I consented; two iron crows, a small lanthorn, a padlock and key, and various bladders. They said they should come for their tools in the morning, as soon as the watchmen went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the tools down to Mr. Betts - A. I did, on the over night, and he took them up stairs; I received them back from Mr. Betts, and took them home I was desired to put them in the same place again. This was Saturday the 4th; on the next morning about six o'clock, just as the watchmen went off, Robinson, Goulding, and Price came for their tools; they said, we are very near to our time, are not we; I said, yes, you are exactly. I particularly observed Goulding putting the crow up his coat sleeve with the other part in his hand; when they went away they said they should be back in half an hour or rather better. When they were gone I informed Mr. Betts.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see either of the prisoners - A. About twenty minutes before seven o'clock all four prisoners came in loaded. I had not seen Priestly before. They all came in. I had left the door a-jar, it was shut, but not locked or latched. They gave a knock, and shoved it right in. They said, we have not been long about the business; no, said I, you have been very quick indeed. Robinson had a long bladder full; he put it down in the middle of the floor, and then turned out of my house to go back again; Price, Goulding, and Priestly were in the shop having bottles with them; I said, take them down in the cellar; they were just beginning to take them down stairs when somebody knocked at the door. They took the bottles down in the cellar and began to break them as fast as they could. I opened the door, in came Mr. Smith, and I believe Mr. Drinkall, they had got Robinson with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Smith and Drinkall brought Robinson in your house in custody - A. They did, Robinson sat down in a chair; he began to unload himself of bladders, and different things, and he flung a cork in the fire. I saw no more, I was kept as a prisoner in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms have you in the house - A. Four rooms and a cellar. I have two men and their wives lodge in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What way of life are you in - A. I keep a cook's shop, and I have an income from the army.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not applied to be a police officer - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath have not you applied to be a police officer - A. I might have applied for such a thing, but I did not get it.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope you never will. How long have you been acquainted with these men - A. I might have seen them most likely three or four years. I have seen them driving carts.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have not you been intimate and well known by them for the last four years - A. Most likely I have seen them and talked with them; I never drank with them until these two months.</p>
               <p>Q. But two months you have known them well - A. They have come and offered me things to sell that I would not accept of.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a strange thing these two men strangers to you should come to you and tell you they were going to commit a robbery - A. They were not strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You had only known them intimately two months - A. If you will give me leave I can speak as well as you. These men used the Crooked Billet in Johnson's change, Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the house I was coming to. They asked you where they could sell things that were stolen - A. I suppose so, that is a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you took them in custody A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been accused of having some deals - A. Never in my life, nor for any thing out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that these men told you their story and they left with you them wicked implements - A. Yes. I thought it was my duty to expose them.</p>
               <p>Q. Certainly, it is the duty of an honest man. Who proposed to leave the door a-jar - A. The men proposed to me to leave it ready for them, and therefore I left it a-jar.</p>
               <p>Q. These goods were found in your premises - A. Yes, and they were meant to be so.</p>

             my foreman, and another person; we were there on Saturday the 4th of January, at five o'clock in the evening; we waited there some time, and then Mr. Betts produced a blue and white handkerchief containing two house-breakers crows, a dark lanthorn, a padlock and key, and a number of empty bladders: after myself and the gentlemen that were with me looked at them they were returned to Mr. Betts, and took them away; a part of us staid all night, and the rest that retreated came there at four o'clock on the Sunday morning, I went there between three and four on the Sunday morning. I then agreed with the gentlemen there, to station a person at the top of Miles's-lane, Connon-street; Mr. Smith was stationed at the end of Crooked-lane, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150020"/>is connected with Miles's-lane; after I had stationed them there, I stationed myself between Thompson's house and Mr. Betts's house, in Lower Thames-street, a few yards of it; our object was to notice the persons we suspected going to Thompsons' house in the morning. I waited thereabouts till near six o'clock in the morning, I then heard some men talking loud, and on getting nearer to them they were coming from Lower Thames-street into Upper Thames-street. I walked on the opposite side of the of the way, rather behind them untill they turned up Miles's-lane; I observed them go to Thompson's house, as near as possible six o'clock the Bridge-ward watchmen were crying past six o'clock, five or six of them. These men passed through talking loud, I drew back from Miles's-lane a few yards, expecting that when they came out of Miles's-lane they would come out towards Lower Thames-street; I waited a minute or two, and returned to Miles's-lane, and concluded from the appearance of Thompson's house that the men had left it, I instantly went to Mr. Betts, there I saw Thompson, and ascertained that the men had got their tools and had gone to work.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men did you observe go to Thompson's - A. Three men went to the door, and I believe they all went in; we called in the two men that were stationed; after they had left Miles's-lane I found that they had gone westward and seperated ourselves into two parties and determined to search all the vaults or cellers west of Miles's Lane, under the apprehension of detecting the parties, I was not successful in the pursuit; I went to Mr. Betts's, and when I went to Miles-lane, I there found the other party at Thompson's house with 
               <persName id="t18120115-6-person165">Robinson</persName>
             the prisoner in custody waiting for our assistance to search the house. I immediately entered the house with the two men I had with me; and proceeded to search it; we had been informed that they had been smashing wine in the celler, we proceeded there, I found a quantity of bottles of wine that appeared to be recently broken, part of them in the blue and white handkerchief that I had seen at Mr. Betts the evening before; the wine running from the bottles in a puddle, I found this crow near the bottles, which I recollected to be one of the crows I had seen the evening before. I found a dark lanthorn with a wax candle in it, which is the one I had seen before, the candle had been burnt down to about an inch and a half; we found one whole bottle of wine and six broken bottles with the corks intire sealed; we only found seven bottles there, we then went up stairs into the one pair of stairs bed room over the shop, it is a single house, only one room on a floor. There was a man there nearly undressed and his wife likewise, he appeared very much alarmed, we found no other person there; then we went into the two pair of stairs, there we saw Mrs. Hill and her husband and some person covered up under the bed clothes that turned out to be Priestly, I knew him again; Priestly was desired to dress himself; the man and his wife were up half dressed and half undressed. Priestly dressed himself, his shoes were wet with fresh mud, his coat did not appear to be wet; Priestly went out and was taken by the person at the door. I heard the cry of stop thief, I ran down stairs and saw him brought back, he was the same man I saw in bed. We then went up into the upper room, and there was Goulding and Price, they were completely undressed in bed, they had got handkerchiefs tied round their heads instead of night-caps; they rubbed their eyes and pretended not to know what was the matter. Mr. Smith who was with me they knew; one of them said Oh, Mr. Smith, what is the matter? and rubbed his eyes as if just awake; from that circumstance I began to doubt whether they were really the men that we were looking after, but on finding there were no other bed in the room, and a woman's apparel on the bed, and understanding that was the bed of Thomson and wife we told them to dress themselves; when they had dressed themselves I searched Price, and found a bladder in his pocket: their clothes were wet and drops of rain on their hats, I thought Price's hands smelt of port wine. They was taken down stairs; we sent the four prisoners off to the Compter with part of our party. I immediately found from the seals on the bottles that the wine stolen must belong to Messrs. Ingall and Mann, I knew that Mr. Mann resided at the Three Cranes wharf: we found out a vault belonging to him under a meeting in Union-court, Queen-street; we having assertainted that that vault was broken open, the lock was broken off. I desired my man to wait there untill I went with Mr. Smith to Mr. Mann's house, and desire him to come or send his cellar man to see if that vault was in the state that they left it in on the Saturday night; these are the bottles that I took with me; I mentioned that Priestly's coat was dry. After Priestly was brought back Mr. Hill gave me this coat, it was very wet and an oil skin was there of his hat, under the chair. Thompson told me Robinson throwed a cock in the fire, we took it out and throwed it in water, it was so hot.</p>

               <p>Mr. Mann. The impression on the bottles is the impression of the seal I have in my pocket now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lucas. There were six bottles found up stairs.</p>
               <p>MR. SKIPPER. Q. You are one of the common council-men of Tower-ward - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About a quarter before seven were you one of the party who were in Miles's-lane - A. I was. The first of my seeing the parties was in Thames-street, four in number; I heard a talking; I saw four men drawing towards Miles's-lane; I concluded that they must be men that we were in search of; I immediately crossed the street with my friends; I believe I was nearer to him than any of the party that were following them, and I saw four men distinctly go into the house of Thompson. Robinson, the moment he was inside of the door, he came out again immediately; I said to Mr. Drinkall, that is one of them, lay hold of him, he was seized immediately by Drinkall; I immediately went to the door, but the door was shut; we knocked at the door, after a moments pause Thompson opened the door; these men that were in doors, hearing so much noise outside, we heard a great noise inside, they were rushing about to get out of the way; I said, one mind the door and another the cellar, and just as I was watching the cellar Priestly I believe rushed up at the cellar; I said immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150021"/>if you come there again I will run the sword into you. He rushed at the bars of the cellar like a mad cat; he heard what I said, and went back. The other party not coming up so soon as we expected we agreed to remain at the door untill they came. When they came Mr. Lucas and several of the gentlemen went in to search; Mr. Drinkall said, here is a pistol here, (he saw it on the chimney-piece), and said, take that out of the way; he called me to take it away; while I was in that situation I heard a noise in the passage, I turned round and saw Priestly going out of the door; I immediately followed him and told Mr. Betts to cut him down; I ran after him and never lost sight of him, only at the turnings of several streets; I brought him back; I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any bladder of wine - A. When Mr. Drinkall called to me to take the pistol he said he might as well search Robinson; I saw Robinson remove a bladder under the seat, and I saw a large bladder full of wine in the shop, and seven bottles of wine in the shop; the bottles were full and whole and corked.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the lanthorn and the crow the night before at Mr. Betts's - A. I did, and I have no doubt they are the same by the appearance of them; I had them in my hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mann. Them seven bottles are mine also.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any things produced by him to you - A. I saw the implements of housebreaking, a lock and key, and a bladder, with the two crows in a blue and white handkerchief; I took notice of this small crow so as to be able to recollect it at this moment; I saw the same crow found in Thompson's cellar; I knew it to be the same I had seen before.</p>
               <p>MR. DRINKALL. Q. You had heard the evidence of the other gentlemen - A. I have, I have nothing to add. These are the two bladders I found under Robinson, and several corks; I took this knife and cork screw out of Robinson's pocket, and one upon Goulding.</p>
               <p>MR. BETTS. Q. Did you receive on Saturday the 4th the implements of housebreaking from Thompson return them to him after you had shewed them - A. I did.</p>
               <p>- HILL. I am a printer. I lodged at Thompson's. On Sunday the 5th of January I was alarmed by a noise in the room between six and seven o'clock, Priestly knocked at the door, and begged to be admitted said he was a friend of Mr. Thompson's. My wife opened the door, he came in, and set himself down in a chair, two more came in immediately, which I supposed to be two of the gentlemen that came to take him; I catched hold of Priestly, I said, here is one; he begged of me, for God's sake, to let him go to bed, which I refused; he said, if he was taken it would cost him his life. I immediately said, get a light; Priestly undressed himself and got into bed, the other two left the room, and went to Thompson's room; Priestly went into bed, he was the man that was afterwards taken. That great coat I found behind one of the chairs after they were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose great coat was that - A. It was not in my room when I went to bed. It did not belong to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner a great coat on when he came into the room - A. It was not light enough for me to observe.</p>

He then took out two two-pound notes, and said that was all that he had got; Mr. Jones took him up stairs and searched his box; he said you may as well give me the notes and go about your business, are all these the notes that you took: he said, no, there are more in the pocket; they are in this paper. These are the two two-pound notes, I put them in the till that morning, not an hour before they were missed. There is the lady's name on them. They are the two two-pound notes that I took of that lady, here is the one pound note that perhaps had been taken the same morning about three hours previous. They were taken out of the till, and the prisoner gave them out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150022"/>Mr. Alley. For aught you know, the prisoner might have given change for them out of his pocket, and the other man is not here - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Mr. Jones. Where did you get these notes - A. The prisoner gave them out of his pocket to me, when I missed these notes, I took him up stairs and insisted upon searching his box. I took out all his clothes, I found this pocket-book, it contained five pound odd in silver, I said I was certain he had the notes, he had better give them up; he put his hand in his pocket and gave them out before the other witness; they were loose in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you find upon him - A. Forty-seven pounds. He was my porter, he lived in the house and had twenty guineas a year; he lived with me between thirteen and fourteen months.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Was the other man that is not here a shopman - A. Yes, he is not here; he is in my service now.</p>
               <p>COURT. What parish is your house in - A. St. Peter's Cornhill.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partners - A. None, at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the shop part of your dwelling-house - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Shephard. I know nothing of the robbery, the property was given to me, fifty-two pound in bank notes and five pound in cash.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. You told us you heard a whizzing, was that the case - A. I heard a noise; two squares of glass were broke, one had a round hole in it, and the other a hole, and it was cracked; I am sure the hole was not there before.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any quarrel with this man, had you - A. No, I never spoke to him; I once spoke to his wife concerning the firing.</p>
               <p>Q. How far does he live from you - A. Sixteen yards. I have measured it since; the back of his house comes to mine; he is a housekeeper in the neighbourhood.</p>

            . I live opposite of Mrs. Earle. On the 10th of September, after I heard the pistol go off, Mrs. Earle came in, I went over and saw the windows broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner do anything - A. No. I heard him say afterwards that he was glad he had done no more injury.</p>
               <p>- WOOD. I am an officer. It was half past ten when I went to the prisoner's house, I knocked at the door, the prisoner's wife opened the door; I told her I wanted to speak to Mr. Dixon; she said he was in bed. I broke the door open and found Dixon undressing himself, he told me he would blow my brains out; I told him to fire away. I apprehended him; I took him to Mrs. Earle's house; I shewed the prisoner the window and the situation in which Mrs. Earle stood; he said he was sorry, and was very glad no more harm was done, or else his life must have suffered for it. I produce the window. This is a round hole, and there was another round hole in another pane of glass; it must have been done by the shot or the wadding. I found the pistol in his own house, loaded; I drawed the wadding the next day, there was an ounce and three quarters of small shot, and paper wadding, it was rolled up hard at the time; it might have made the hole with the wadding.</p>

               <p>Q. Would the wadding have done any injury - A. It might, if it was close to Mrs. Earle, if she was so close as she says she was to the window, if it had struck upon the head or the body not covered it might have done hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. I need not ask you whether small shot would make such a hole as that it must be either ball or wadding - A. Yes, it must.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 12th of December, about four in the afternoon, I went in company with the prosecutor and his man to this house. I saw the woman prisoner, Mead, sitting by the fire; her father was in the room. I asked her if she had any box or parcel left there. She said no I asked her if she had not been offering any candles for sale. She said no. I then asked her if she had no parcel of candles in the house. She said no. I searched, and on a table in the room where she was, near at the back of where she sat, were these candles in this basket, as they are now wrapped over with this blue apron. They have been in Smith's possession ever since. I then left Smith (the man that works for Mr. Pritchard) in the room - told him not to leave it, and, if any body came, not to let them go. I then went to Kimbling's mother's house with the prosecutor. I did not find him. I returned to the house where the candles was, and found Kimbling in Mead's place.</p>

             asked him if he had seen his brother Bill. She cried. Kimbling told her not to cry - he did not care any thing about it. When Armstrong came in he took hold of Kimbling, and searched him. He asked him how he came by these candles; he said he was coming home about half past nine last night - he picked them up in Red Lion Passage, and put them into his apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the candles then in the room. - A. Yes, and the basket as they are now. Armstrong then took Sarah Mead and Kimbling to Worship-street Office.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a pocket-book, with some bank-notes, about three months ago. - A. Yes. I had a ten-pound bank of England note, and three ones, that I am positive of. I believe the precise time was the 23d of July. I have recollected some circumstances since, and I am sure to the time. I had some money to pay away. I put it in my book before I went out. It happened so I did not pay it away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had put these notes in your pocketbook, what did you do with your pocket-book. - A. I put it in my pocket. I did not pay it to the person I intended. I kept it in my pocket. I came home about a little after four. When I came home, I deposited the book in the parlour on the table. I left it there, I did not see it again for two days, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your parlour door open these two days. - A. I cannot answer that question. I do not know. I left it laying on the parlour table, and the notes in it.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150026"/>When I had occasion to look into my pocket-book, I found the ten-pound note was missing, and the ones were left.</p>
               <p>Q. The ten-pound note was gone - how many ones remained. - A. Three ones.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of. - A. Myself and wife and three children.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the age of the eldest. - A. She is turned of 21 that is at home, the youngest is turned of 17. - When I examined the pocket-book, and missed the ten-pound note, I was very much confused, and did not know what to do; and knowing that the prisoner had robbed me many times before, suspicion fell on him.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not talk of what happened before, only this time. Did the prisoner live in your family then. - A. Yes, he is my apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other apprentice who lives in your family. - A. No, I have mentioned the whole of my family living at home. I challenged the prisoner with it - he denied it. I have never seen the note since. I searched the prisoner. I found nothing of the note upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the note if you were to see it again. - A. Yes, I could swear to it, if I saw the note.</p>

On the 1st of August he brought me a ten-pound note, and said it was come from his aunt; he asked me to take care of it.

               <p>Q. Did you pay any more money by direction of the prisoner - A. Another pound to another young man, on the 8th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. What has become of the rest of the money. - A. The prisoner had three shillings for his pocket; he asked me for it to spend; eighteen pence more he had for the repairing his watch.</p>

            . Mr. Gould informed me that he had lost a ten-pound note. I spoke to the boy about it. I promised him no favour, nor threatened him. He said he took the ten pound note out of his master's pocket-book; he gave it to Mr. Carron - that he had some trifle out of it - that he had a watch, it stopped, and he gave it back to Mr. Carron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, I hope you will consider my unfortunate case; I was drawed into it by Mr. Carron, and one of the witnesses against me; that man took the ten-pound note. I had no more than two shillings of it, and he has got 9 l. 18 s. of it, which is the property of my unfortunate master. He bought me a watch, it stopped, I returned it to him. I have never seen it since. The witness Carron keeps a room to harbour boys and girls in, and encouraged me into my offence. I hope your lordship will let me go to sea, and serve his Majesty, that I might get rid of all my bad connections.</p>

            . I am a wholesale linen warehouseman, I was between nine and ten o'clock at the auction, I had not been long in the room before the prisoner came in, a gold ring was put up which he purchased and paid for, soon after another was put up which he bought likewise, he said he would leave the second until the sale was over. A rocking horse was then offered for sale, the greater part of the people's attention was taken with the rocking-horse; I saw him endeavouring to put something into his left hand pocket, it must have been something of magnitude by my seeing it. I afterwards saw him take an inkstand and put into his right hand pocket. The prisoner left the room and went down stairs, I followed him to the bottom of the stairs, and said stop, I want to speak to you. Before I had told him what he had got in his pocket, he said what a fool you are, I am employed by the auctioneer to help him off with his goods. I told him he had been robbing him, and must go back into the room. I then, with assistance, led him up stairs, as soon as I had got him up stairs, I told him he had got an inkstand in his pocket, which he took out, I marked it; we sent for an officer, he came and examined his pockets, in his left hand pocket he found a dressing case.</p>

On Saturday morning my warehouseman informed me that a piece of goods was bid in the coal cellar, I went down, in the cellar I found a bundle placed in a hole in the coals. I took it up and untied it, it was tied up in the prisoner's apron, and inclosed in it were two pieces of white, and one of grey calico, I tied the bundle up again, and it was replaced again in the coals. I got two officers, it was agreed that they should be in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150028"/>passage of the adjoining premises to ours. At a quarter after four they were in waiting, I called the prisoner up to shut up the warehouse, I saw this done, and at half past four I left as usual, as if to go to my dinner, I turned into the passage to the officers, and there waited with them his coming out. About five o'clock he came out, he was directly siezed by Drinkwater with the bundle upon him; I accompanied them with him to the Poultry compter, he was searched, the officers took his keys, we then went to his lodgings, the officers searched his box in my presence, they found in one of his boxes 102 l. in bank notes, and on Monday morning they found two pound more, for his having part of the money, there appears a satisfactory account from a memorandum found in his book, there is an accompt of his having sold some lands for ninety pound, and among these notes there were 65 l. marked as received on the 9th of March. therefore, I suppose that is part of the money; here is an accompt found among his papers, which is a sale of goods, which exactly correspond with our goods in his hand writing.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how it was taken. - A. I cannot say. I heard no tidings of the coat until the 24th of December. I was passing down Fleet-street, and recognised the coat on a gentleman's back, I accosted the gentleman, and asked him how he came by it, he told me he purchased the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that gentleman here - A. No, he is not, he went with me to the shop, he bought the coat in Hare street, Piccadilly. My brother attended there with an officer Mr. Hornbuck, who bought the coat, myself and brother, with the officer, went to Bow-street. The prisoner is a workman that worked with us at the time that the coat was missing, he left our employ on the 16th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the coat. - A. It is here.</p>
               <p>Mr Gurney. Had you seen the coat before you had lost it. - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you had seen it. - A. I cannot say to a day, the last time I saw it was on the 13th or 14th of November, in our shop in Fleet street, it was a finished coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear positively to that being the coat.</p>
               <p>A. I can, by the particular manner in which it is made, we had the fellow coat made in the same manner, I cut the coat out myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You found this coat on the back of an officer. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that officer is not here himself. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This is your dwelling-house Mr. Croft. - A. It is, my brother lives in the house adjoining, there is a communication from one house to another, but not so as to make it one house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this coat in your house, or your brothers. - A In my house.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not venture to swear that whoever took the great coat that you lost they took it from your house, and not from your brother's - A. Yes, I could. They are never taken into my brother's house - his house is a private house.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Hornbuck, a dealer in second-hand clothes, 13, Hare street, Piccadilly. The prisoner at the bar brought a coat to me, and I brought it for my employer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner. - A. I am, the prisoner is the person I bought the coat of, and the coat is the coat I bought of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you bought it of him - A. I cannot say precisely the day, it was the 19th or 20th of November, some time thereabouts, about three o'clock in the afternoon. I gave two guineas and a half for it, he asked me three guineas for it, I believe it never had been worn at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Somebody brought this coat, and asked three guineas, and you beat him down to two guineas and a half. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The coat is worth about 10 l. - is it not. - A. It is. I can swear the coat is the coat I bought of the prisoner, by the mark I put on it.</p>
               <p>Q. You mark other coats the same. - A. Yes, but we never had such a coat before.</p>
               <p>Q. When the officer went with the coat to Bow-street, they had the cruelty to take you there. - A. They did take us there.</p>
               <p>Q. They called you a receiver, that you had bought goods at a quarter of the value - A. They did say that.</p>
               <p>Q. To find out the thief, at last you fixed upon this person. - A. I fixed upon the person that I bought it of.</p>
               <p>Q. That we have on your word as an honest man, who bought the coat at two guineas and a half, and the coat worth ten pounds. - A. I did not know the value of it.</p>

From the description that I gave to Mr. Croft, he said he suspected that man, and it proved to be the man I bought the coat of.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went into the inn yard. The report was that Snow had lost his coat. I went into the tap-room, where the prisoner was eating his supper. I told him suspicion fell upon him: such a one had seen him in the yard, having the coat on his arm; he denied it, and laughed. I told him he might be made to laugh on the other side. I took him into the parlour, and searched him. I found these three gloves in the crown of his hat. I said I am sure these are Snow's gloves; he denied it at first; at last he acknowledged that he had taken the coat, and had run and left it at the Bull's Head, in Wood-street. I went there, and saw the coat. I then took the prisoner to the Compter. This is the coat.</p>

            . I am a boot and shoe-maker, 7, Wilson street, Finsbury square. On the 17th of December, the prisoner brought the boot legs to sell, he asked six shillings a pair, I informed Mr. Duncan of them in Fore street, he brought Mr. Curtis to my house, and he owned them. I did not pay any money for them; I told him to come the next day for the money, he came the next day in the evening and was taken. The prisoner fixed eight, he did not come untill half past; I then told him if he would go into Fore-street with me, I would get a ten pound bill and pay him. He went along with me as far as the Fountain public-house in Red-cross-street, I took him into the house and called for something to drink, and left him with my friend, I went over and told Mr.

               <p>Mr. Alley. You did not know the prisoner I believe until you received information from the last witness. - A. No; a servant of mine lodged with him.</p>
               <p>Q. And that servant might have stolen them and carried them to his house; you had him taken up and examined before the Lord Mayor. - A. I never saw the prisoner at my house, he is a stranger to me, my servant might have stolen them, they are in an unfinished state, they are always blacked before they are sold to the shoe-makers.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

We asked him for what reason he could take the brass dust away, he said the devil must be in him.

            . Q. You are the wife of the last witness. - A. Yes, the prisoner was my servant, she came on the 9th of September, and staid with me until the 2nd of December. In consequence of missing the property, I asked the prisoner where they might be, she said they were in St Martins-lane, those were her words. She denied absolutely every thing else to me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to her character.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you last seen these mantles. - A. About a quarter of an hour before I missed them they were laying on the counter. On the 23d of December the prisoner, in company with another woman, came into the shop and enquired the price of a mantle hanging at the door. The other woman fixed upon having a coat, and paid me a shilling in part; she was to call on Saturday, and pay me the remainder; and while the woman was giving me the shilling, the prisoner went out. On the other woman going away, I returned to the counter, and examined the things. I missed a child's mantle; I immediately went after the prisoner, and overtook her. I charged her with taking the mantle; she put a mantle in my hand, and was going to run away; I followed her into Bedford-court. We had not walked above five minutes before another mantle dropped; it was taken up, and given to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the mantle drop. - A. No. I gave her in charge of Creswell, the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not the prisoner tell you that the other woman had given her the bundle, and she was gone into the garden to buy things. - A. There was something of that sort. I did not go and look for the other woman. These are the mantles, they are my master's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was a servant. I went down into the country for three months to see my friends. On this day I met Mrs. Robinson; she gave me a glass of peppermint; she said she wanted to buy something for her children; she took me into this shop with her, I saw her bargaining for something, I took no notice, and went out; she came to me, and gave me the bundle, and told me to go on, she was going into the market to buy potatoes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

             came in laughing. and underneath her cloak she had a basket, and in the basket I perceived a bundle done up in a coarse cloth. I not thinking it was mine, it went out of my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your bundle that was on the mangle was done up in a coarse cloth too. - A. Yes. I did not see them take the bundle, nor did I suspect that was my bundle. They all went out, and some time after I perceived my bundle was gone. I had seen it on the mangle five minutes before the prisoners came in. I lost all the articles mentioned in the indictment. The prisoners came the next night to sell some more old shoes.

I missed a bundle last night, and nobody I suspect but you. I insist to know what you have done with the bundle. I sent for the watchman - they were taken to the watch-house.</p>

I took her to the watch house. The cotton was given to the constable at the watch-house; he traced where the property belonged to.</p>

            . I reside in Gray's Inn-lane. I live with my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of observing any person near Mr. Butt's house, and when. - A. On Tuesday, December the 6th, about six o'clock in the evening. It was just turned six. I was passing down Gray's Inn-lane. I crossed Liquorpond-street, and just as I got to the Talbot public-house I saw three men stand by Mr. Butt's window.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Wandsor. - A. Yes, by sight I seeing these three men, and knowing the house to have been robbed before, created a suspicion. I saw the prisoner stand between two men - one was taller than the prisoner or the other one - the tall man put his hand to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. A sash window. - A. Yes, and forced it up, and at the same time shoved open the blinds of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. That you could see distinctly, could you. - A. Yes, I stopped by the Talbot light, and just at that instant the other two were in the act of assisting the prisoner at the bar into the window, and before he was in the act of getting in, by the lamp I could see his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Just in the act of getting in. - A. Yes, his hands on the lower part of the sill of the window, and the other two men were assisting him in the window, and part of his person in, I seeing him in that situation, I thought by the time that I got up to the window, he would be got in; but I was too quick - and the other two men assisted by pulling him down, and that was the cause of their dispersing.</p>
               <p>Q. They fled, did they. - A. Yes, they ran off.</p>
               <p>Q. The window was got up, and part of his person in. - A. Yes. I knocked at the door of Mr. Butt's house, and told the servant that the house had been attempted to be robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any of the three persons say any thing. - A. No. I told the servant I would go and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150032"/>look after them. Upon that consideration I went over the way, and stood in a dark place of the new building belonging to Gray's Inn. I heard a whistle, and I saw the three men come together again. I saw them coming, and I walked on. They were coming towards me, and expressed the words, that is, the bugger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any particular reason they had for pulling the prisoner out. - A. The other two men might see me.</p>
               <p>Q. That was your opinion - was any thing said or done. - A. No. I thought it proper to cross over the way. I crossed over the way, and they crossed after me, and went before me. I then met a gentleman unknown to me I claimed his assistance in taking the three men, and told him they had been attempting to rob a house above. He said he was in a hurry, but he would assist me as much as he could. We walked on as far as Portpool-lane, and there I told him, as soon as I laid hold of the prisoner at the bar, that he was to assist in taking the others. As soon as I laid hold of the prisoner, I lifted up my umbrella, and told him, if he made any resistance, I would knock him down. He immediately fetched me a blow on the right side of my head. The other two men were standing on the other side of the way, and as soon as the other gentleman saw the prisoner strike me, the other gentleman ran away. I then recovered myself and fetched the prisoner a blow on the head with my umbrella. I pursued him down the lane, and between that and a wheelwright's shop, he turned round, and gave me a blow. I then attempted to take him again, when he slipped under my arm; he hit me two blows, both on my right side and on my left, and escaped from me. I immediately cried out</p>
               <p>"stop thief" as loud as I could holloa, and pursued him to a place called Sparrow's-Rents, that leads into Liquorpond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him at last. - A. I took him at Meux's brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure as to the person of the prisoner. - A. Yes, I had seen him many times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the other men before. - A. I think I should know them. I know him perfectly. I have seen him on several other different affairs of picking pockets, and such like.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was six o'clock at the time. - A. Yes, there was no light of day at all. The cause of my seeing his face, there is a chandler's shop next door to Mr. Butt's that had a light, and the light of the lamps I saw his face perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. This was an early hour in the evening. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons passing. - A. Not any one at all; between Liquorpond-street and the Bull, I did not see any person coming. I then took him to Mr. Butt's house, and gave him in charge of an officer, and from thence to Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. The servant to whom you communicated this is a female servant. - A. Yes, a maid servant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman says he know my person well - I wish to know where he knew me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaughan. I have seen him in Holborn with another person who picked a gentleman's pocket.</p>

No, I did not, I went out in the street, when the young man said, did I know that the house had been attempted to be robbed; I said, no He told me to go in doors and shut the door. I went in, and then I thought there might be somebody in the house. I went out in the street, and saw one of the parlour windows wide open.</p>

               <p>Q. How many - A. There were about six men and women, they seemed to be wrangling and disputing one with another under the lamps which belong to the Albion Fire-office, they were near the pastry-cook's which is near the Albion Fire-office, they took the whole width of the pavement. The prisoner was walking half a yard before the others, he was in conversation with them, I went up to give them leave to pass me, and on my drawing up to the shop the prisoner at the bar made a spring at me and knocked me down; with my falling I called the watch; I found that he had got my watch at the same time that I had the blow. As soon as he got the watch he gave it a spring, the outside case fell off from the watch, and the remainder hustled in of a heap to pick up the case of the watch; with his knocking me down I fell to the left of him, he had then an opportunity of running away from me a little to the right; he run over to Fleet-market, down the side of the market of the Fleet prison; he left the curb-stones, and kept at the back of the shambies, I running after him calling stop thief; a watchman was standing at the gate of the prison, he turned upon me, and I laid hold of him; I gave him into the charge of the watchman, saying, that he had robbed me of my watch; I never lost sight of him. I was without my hat. I was determined to make an example of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not argue. Are you positive that he is the man that struck you and took your watch - A. He is the very man that struck me and took my watch at the same instant. There was a second man, when I cried out he ran over to me and struck me. I was upon my knees and hands when the prisoner knocked me down, I did not think it right to rise; I kept my eye upon him until the watchman was coming, then I got up and ran after him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of the parish of St. Bride's. On the 19th of December, between twelve and one o'clock, I heard the cry of watch as I stood at the bottom of Bride's-lane; I ran to the spot, I saw the prisoner running along the front of Fleet-market, the prosecutor was close after him. The lamps shined very bright. He cried out stop thief. I ran over, and about a yard before I got to him the prosecutor had got hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run down Fleet-market - A. He went down there, but seeing a watchman there he turned and ran towards me; I had my lanthorn behind me. I was standing at Mr. Temple's door, the prosecutor ran after him and catched him by the collar; I asked the prosecutor what he had done, he said he had knocked him down and robbed him of his watch; he desired me to take charge of him, he said he would go back and look for his hat. He had lost his hat. While I was holding him by the collar two men and two women came up to me, they seemed to be cursing and swearing, and I thought they had a mind to take him away from me, I thought it was the safest way to take him to the watchhouse; I did, and told the constable of the night what he had done. On my going along with him to the Compter I said, you had better tell me who they were; he said, d - n your bloody eyes, if it had not been for the last half-quartern of gin you would not have had me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of him - A. I see a great many about that quarter; I cannot say I know any thing of him.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. At the watchhouse I asked him how he came to rob the man of his watch; he said he came from Westminster, and then he said he came from Thames-street, and after that he said he came from the Old Bailey.</p>

            . I am an assistant-elder in that warehouse in Cutler-street. When the prisoner had leave to go out he came down to be rubbed down in the accompting-house, one of the labourers followed him down, and said he had property about him; I said, I hope it is not true; the prisoner said, it is too true, he had got it in his hat. I took it out of his hat, there was two pounds, it is worth three shillings and sixpence a pound. There are some thousands of indigo in that warehouse.</p>

               <p>COURT, Q. to Ireland. Did all this conversation pass - A. I do not know from whom I took it; the prisoner was a customer, consequently I could not say otherwise. He described a person to me which turned out not to be the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street office. On Wednesday the 8th of January I had been down the Green-lane, I came to the top of Islington by the Angel; I saw the two prisoners go into Goswell-street, Fowler had a bundle under his arm; the other prisoner was with him; Frost and I went up to them and stopped them; I asked Fowler what he had got in the bundle; he told me that he had got linen, that he had brought it from his washerwoman; I asked him again, he repeated that he had got linen the second time; I asked Scott whether he knew what linen it was; Scott said it was sheets and shirts that he had brought from his washerwoman. Not being satisfied with that answer I took the prisoners into a corn chandler's shop and examined the bundle; when I opened the bundle I found it contained silk stockings and gloves; going along I asked the prisoner Fowler where he brought them from; he said his master's, 47, Fish-street-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the fact where Mr. Barlow does live - A. Yes. After that Fowler told me he would rather give me fifty pounds than I should have taken him in custody; I told him I did not do business in that way. I then took them both to Covent Garden watchhouse, where they were lodged for that night. I went the next morning to Mr. Barlow, and informed him what had taken place; Mr. Barlow came to Bow-street; they were fully committed for trial. I omitted saying, I asked Fowler as we were going along what he was going to do with this property, he said he was going to take it to one West, a hawker. I could not learn where West lived. I asked him what he was to have for it; he said he had made no particular bargain, but West was in the habit of buying guineas, or any thing that came in his way, and he expected to have met West that night at the Angel but he had disappointed him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it when you took him up - A. It was near upon ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The conversation was between you and Fowler, are you sure that he had the bundle his arm or on his shoulder - A. Under his arm I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. He has sent me word that you are not taken in saying that he had the goods from his master - A. I am not; he said so, I am sure. This is the bundle, I have had it in my custody ever since. Frost was in company with me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What part of the property can you speak to - A. This dozen of silk stockings I have sworn to, and I swear to them now, they are worth about six pounds. There are other things that I could make oath to in the bulk.</p>
               <p>- BROWN. I am shopman to Mr. Barlow. By the paper on some of the stockings I know them to be my master's property, and there is a piece of paper on some of the gloves of my hand-writing, by which I know them. There are one hundred and two pair of silk hose, and one hundred and six pair of gloves.</p>
               <p>Fowler's Defence. I most humbly beg permission to state that the prisoner Scott knew not the contents of the bundle, nor how I obtained it; I bought them of a sailor, whom I never saw before, nor since.</p>
               <p>Scott was not put put on his defence.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 4th of this month I was going down Honduras-street, Old-street, I met the prisoner at Mr. Harrison's warehouse door, I went back and put my light out on purpose to see what they were after; there were two of them; I saw one of the two get over into Mr. Harrison's premises and hand out four bundles; I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or the other that went over the premises. After they had handed four bundles over the gate that one come over again, each of them took up two bundles and came into Baltic-street. I stopped the prisoner and asked him what he had got there; he said some rope, it belonged to his father; I told him if Mr. Harrison would say his father bought it it was all well; I took him to Mr. Harrison's door, and the other man ran away, leaving the property behind him. I knocked at Mr. Harrison's door, and asked him if that was his property; he said it was. I then took the prisoner to the watch-house. This is the rope.</p>

            . Q. I believe you were apprehended about the middle of December last on suspicion of having had dollars - A. Yes; I had in my possession when I was taken eighty-six and two more that the constable did not find at the time, and those two I have now. These are the two.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get this money - A. From the prisoner. The constable took the eighty-six. I got part of them on the 5th of December, and part on the 16th. On the 5th I got fifty-six from the prisoner's wife, and on the 16th I received fifty-four at the prisoner's house, I went there between ten and eleven in the morning, the prisoner and his wife were in bed. They got up. I told him what I came for, I asked him if he had any dollars ready, he answered he had; he took out a paper and told me it contained forty; I took him at his word, I did not count them: I gave him eighteen pence a piece for them. I breakfasted with him; I said I was going to Sheerness; he said I had better have a few more, it was too little to go a journey with; I told him I had no more money; he said he would trust me until I came back; he went out of the room and fetched fourteen more, they were of the colour of a penny-piece; he coloured them in my presence: he gave me some of the same stuff that he rubbed them with in case people should rub them. He gave me a cork, he told me to rub it on with a cork, and not to touch it with my fingers, it would burn them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he made them - A. He told me he cast them in sand and rotten stone, that he made a great quantity; he could supply me in any quantity I wanted; he sold some weeks four or five hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. The dollars that you had with you in the country were taken from you - A. Yes, except these two they were too bad, I thought, to offer; I put them bye; one is marked G B; I got these on the 16th, both of the prisoner; they were in the paper of forty.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the house that you received the dollars at - A. No. 6, Somers-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a very honest fellow, you were so fortunate as to get them at eighteen pence a piece - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up, and you thought you had better convict somebody else than yourself - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Let this be a warning to you, do not carry on this any longer - A. No, the game is stopped, I believe.</p>
               <p>- Q. You are a constable - A. Yes; I apprehended the last witness; Mr. Foy the officer has got the dollars.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the dollars that Foy has got the dollars that you received from the last witness - A. Yes, there is eighty-six of them.</p>

I did, on the 31st of December, it is in the county of Middlesex; the prisoner was not at home; on my going into the house I enquired if O'Conner was at home; I was told he was not; I saw a woman and two children.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that woman - A. He acknowledged her as his wife, and that room was their habitation. I searched the woman and found nothing on her. In one of the drawers of that room I found twelve pieces of copper with the impression of dollars upon them. and not coloured. On the floor of the same room I found an eighteen-penny token, coloured, and resembling the eighteen-penny token; I found a counterfeit dollar on the mantle-piece ready for circulation. On the floor I found three files; the files had copper metal in their teeth. I searched the back room, on the floor I found a coat there, the prisoner claimed it as his; on searching the pocket of that coat I found six good dollars. These are the six good dollars. In the cupboard of the same room I found a counterfeit dollar ready for circulation. In a hat-box I found a counterfeit seven shilling piece, it was coloured of the gold colour, ready for circulation. On the floor five files and two pair of sheers, one has been used, the other I believe is new. I went up to the top of the house, on the stairs were corks, gloves, rags, drying<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150037"/>sand, and sand wetted in two pans, wetted with strong acid, and seventy old penny pieces; these implements, corks, gloves, and rags, were wet, and had been used shortly before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these things used in the manufactory of counterfeit coin - A. The are; it is necessary they should have such sort of things. I tried the garret door and found it locked; I went down for the key, but did not get it; I broke the door open; I found a furnace fixed in the garret, a quantity of coke and charcoal for the fire of the furnace, five crucibles, all having been used, some having metal in them; a pair of furnace tongs, casting sand; on my examining that sand particularly I found part of the sand impressed with the impression of a dollar; I have some of it here, it still bears the impression; there are several pieces marked with various parts of a dollar, not whole; here is another bit of sand, it has been crushed to pieces, it contains some part of the head and the letters; I have no doubt it was part of the mould that had been used for casting dollars; I found two phials, one I believe contained aquafortis, that is a liquid used to give them the colour. I suppose upward of an hundred blanks for sixpences, a cutting instrument to cut round blanks, a working jacket, it had been used and very much burnt. I found various gloves and rags in the room that appear to have been used in rubbing metal; four iron frames for moulds, that had been frames that the sand is put into with boards to put between them, and a screw to screw them together; the boards were very much burnt, and a pair of nippers to hold the coin in; two pair of shears, two sives holding sand, one finer than the other; four punches with letters on them, such as are used in marking money; a quantity of sand-paper, some of it new, and some of it having been used in rubbing metal; five files that had been used upon copper metal; I found a broken gallipot with a white mixture in it, nearly dry. I tried a little of the composition and rubbed it on a halfpenny, it produced the colour of silver, and I found some on paper, all of which produced the colour of silver on being rubbed on copper. I then came to the lower part of the house, in the passage under the stairs, there I found a paper of cream of tartar, and in the front parlour a dish with some greasy dirty stuff, and a rag that is used to take off the brigtness, to make it look as if it had been in circulation; in the parlour, on the same floor, there was a good quantity of coke and charcoal.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other family in the house but the prisoner, his wife, and family - A. No other but an old woman, whom they said was the chairwoman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards when the prisoner came home - A. I did not see the prisoner come home. I left somebody to wait for him. He was brought to the house I was waiting at. About seven o'clock he came home and was taken in custody; he was brought to the Crown public-house in Clerkenwell by

             told me in his presence that he had found twelve uncoloured dollars; I then asked him how he came possessed of these that I found on him, and those I found in the drawer; he said a girl had found them and brought them to him in the morning. I understood he meant the girl in the house, his daughter. That is all that he said then. The next morning he said that he had found them himself in the yard at the back of his house, and these six were along with them; he had put these in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. What six - A. The six genuine dollars that were found in his coat pocket that hung up in the back room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now look at these six, and see whether there is any mark or defect - A. Two of them have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say there was no other person in the house, except an old woman - A. There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that there was a man left it of the name of O'Hara, in consequence of some misfortune with a child - A. He did not mention the name, he said he said he had not the key of the room, the lodger who had lived there had gone away. I found afterwards that the key of his wife's door unlocked the garret door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It so opened it that if O'Hara had taken the key away there was another key that opened it - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time did the other Foy go away - A. About half after five or six, leaving me in the house with this woman, the girl, and the old woman. The prisoner came home at a quarter past seven; the moment he came in I called him by the name of Conner, I said, how do you do Mr. Conner; he answered me, very well. I took him by the arm and proceeded to search him. I found in his coat pocket that he had on twelve counterfeit dollars uncoloured, and one good dollar in his side coat pocket; a good sixpence, and one bad one; I enquired where he got them; he said the girl had found them. The next day he said he found them. I asked him then how long he had kept the house, he said about three months; I then took him over to the Crown public house.</p>

               <p>Q. Now look at them six, and tell me whether there appears to be any of the dollars made from any one of them dollars. These are the dollars found in his coat pocket, the coat that was hanging up - A. From the observance of these dollars there appears a mark upon the head part, there is a kind of a dent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150038"/>which many of the counterfeits resemble, being taken from the impression of this. There is a mark upon the counterfeit dollars, it perfectly satisfies my mind that they have been made from that.</p>

               <p>Q. And those found in the house, how many are there in a state fit to be circulated - A. Two of them fit for circulation; these are quite complete, besides those that are in a state of preparation.</p>

When I saw him heaving the box from the bottom of the waggon I attacked him at the time that he had fast hold of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you loaded the waggon - A. Yes, and he had completely removed it from the bottom where I had packed it; he removed it edgeways; there was a parcel on this side, and that which kept it tight.</p>
               <p>Q. Now had he only moved it that any part of the trunk remained on the bottom of the waggon - A. No, it did not, it rested upon the other trusses, it was jammed in between the two. I do not think any part of the trunk touched the bottom of the waggon. I seized the prisoner, and held him untill I called my fellow servant; he got an officer, and then I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the country had this come from - A. From Glasgow in Scotland; I was then on the delivery of it.</p>

            . I apprehended Norton on the 14th of December, I had been looking after him five or six weeks; I found him in a one pair of stairs room in a court in Hoxton Town; I got into the room by means of a picklock key, and found him concealed behind the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Norton's Defence. One night this lad Jones was standing opposite the London Docks, Mr. Cole asked him which was the Play-house, this lad shewed him; Mr. Cole asked him if he would go a little further with him; Mr. Cole laid hold of him and led him across Wellclose-square, and pushed him down Pell-street; Mr. Cole was indecent and ran away; I halloaed stop thief after him; Mills stopped Mr. Cole, and this lad and me gave charge of him; we took him to the watchhouse, he immediately fell on his knees at the watchhouse, and said he would give us any sum of money if we would discharge him. Mr. Cole gave Lancaster the beadle five pounds; Jones and me had a pound each of it.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. I was indicted here last sessions, and tried.</p>
               <p>COURT. Mr. Cole, you have heard what these persons said - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what day these persons speak of when they talk of your being taken to the watchhouse - A. On the 8th of May. I never saw them till that night. About nine at night I was coming from Shadwell market, the Three Compasses, the lease was to be disposed of; I had four glasses of brandy and water there; I then came out with the intention of going home; I proceeded up Ratcliffe Highway. When I was walking I perceived myself overcome with the liquor I drank; I got into the entrance of Castle-street, on the left hand side of which there is a dead wall belonging to the London Docks; I saw Jones as I was proceeding on; Jones was standing against the wall; when I went close to him he turned round and made water across the pavement; I called him a dirty fellow, and asked him what he did it for: he said if my sister was there he would give her a good swishing; I said, pray how old may you be to talk about such things; he said, sixteen, and he had come from the West Indies, where he had seen plenty of such business. I said, which is my way to Well-street, conceiving that when I got there I should know my way; he said, come, and I will shew you the way; he took me up a street which I have since found to be Neptune-street; he took me round Wellclose-square into North-East passage. When I said, this is not my way home, he said come along, and took me into Pell-street. When we got there he gave a whistle, which alarmed me, and I set off running down the street. I heard two or three following of me, and voices singing stop thief; I had got one third of the way down Pell-street when a man stopped me and asked me what was the matter, these two lads came up and stated to him that I wanted to commit an unnatural crime; I asserted my innocence to the man, Mills, who said he was a watchman. I was taken to the watchhouse; he related to Lancaster the beadle what these lads had informed him, and these lads said to Lancaster that I had wanted to commit an unnatural crime; I asserted my innocence at the watch-house. Upon the oath I have taken I never went down on my knees at the watchhouse, and beg forgiveness of them. Lancaster told me it was a sad thing, that he must take the charge; he put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took some silver out of one pocket, and a pencil case out of the other pocket. I begged him not to search me, I would shew him what I had got; I took out of my left hand breeches pocket a five pound note, and three one's, I gave them into Lancaster's hands; he said, I find you are well lined. I told him I was a man of some little property, and my abode, and my wife and family, and declared my innocence, and if he could make it up with the lads I would wish him so to do. Lancaster took the lads out one at a time; he came in the watch-house, he returned to me the three one pound notes, and said he had settled it with the lads.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the five pound note - A. They divided that among themselves as I have been since<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150040"/>informed. Lancaster said I might remain in the watchhouse a few minutes until they were gone out of the way. In a few minutes afterward I left the watchhouse, I had not proceeded more than ten or twelve yards from the watchhouse when I was again accosted by the two lads, who said that they had only one pound each out of the five pounds. They demanded the three pounds that Mr. Lancaster had returned to me, or they would come down to my house and see farther into the business; when I, through fear gave them the three pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any of your family what had happened - A. Not at the time. The 18th of October was the first time that I mentioned it to any of my friends.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. I will now ask you, sir, whether, at the former trial you did not say that you parted with the money on the 8th of May through fear of exposure in your own neighbourhood, and no other cause - A. I considered my character as dear as my life at the time, that is the reason I assigned for parting with my money at that time.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Forsyth. On the 14th of January the prisoner came into the shop, she asked to look at some narrow ribbon, I shewed her a drawer of ribbons, she told me to cut her three quarters of a yard of this ribbon, it came to three-pence; I cut it off. She then told me that she wanted some narrow short ribbon; I had to turn my back to get that drawer. I produced the narrow short ribbon, she looked at the second drawer sometime, and told me there was none narrow enough. I put the second drawer away, that occasioned me again to turn my back upon her. Upon my coming back to the counter she then looked over the first drawer again, she then told me she would have a yard and a half off a piece in the second drawer; I turned my back again to get the piece of ribbon out, and while I was measuring it

            . When I came from dinner into the shop the lad was serving the prisoner; there was another customer in the shop which I was serving with black thread; I saw the prisoner take up a piece of grey sarcenet ribbon and put it into her apron; I asked her what she was going to do with it; she said she was only going to look at it. I took hold of her apron and there were five other pieces of ribbon in it, the boy took them out. When I looked at her I am sure she took only the grey ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. to Aslett. You took the ribbons out of her apron - A. Yes, they were plain ribbons that I had shewn her in the first drawer.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence; called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

I obtained an officer after I missed my money, I went to the prisoners room, I accused her of taking money, she denied it, and fainted; I promised her that if she would acknowledge where the money was I would not hurt her: she confessed, and the money was found on the landing of the two pair of stairs; the money was not in the bag. I promised her forgiveness, and I wish to fulfil my promise.</p>

            . I am a pewterer; I live in Castle-court, Marybone. On Saturday the 4th of January in the evening I was passing by Mr. Sizer's house, I saw the prisoner and another man; I watched them. They passed to and from Mr. Sizer's shop window near a dozen times before I observed any confusion in the shop; I then went over to the shop, a square of glass was broken in the shop window; I said to Mr. Brown, here are the two men that broke the window, follow me. I followed the men, Mr. Brown went for assistance. Robinson and Brown secured the prisoner, I secured the other man for the little time I could hold him, two men came up, and by their assistance he got away.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street office. On the 9th of December last Frost and me were on duty in Old-street, we saw the prisoner with a bundle before seven; we crossed over to him and by that time he got into Sycamore-row; I went up to him and asked him what he had got there; he said, bedding; I asked him if it was his own property; he said, yes; I then said, where are you going to; he said, to No. 6 in St. John-street; he said, you alarm me; I said, you have no occasion to be alarmed if it is your own property. I took him over to the Pitt's Head, the corner of Old-street; I untied the bundle; I found the blankets and sheets, and a bunch of matches tumbled out; I found in his coat pocket a black petticoat; I said, if they are yours I will go with you to No. 6, St. John-street to see whether they are your property or no. We came out with him; I asked him where he had brought them from, he said, the sign of the Hare, Hackney. We walked about one hundred and fifty yards, he then said if you walk with me all night I will not tell you where I am going to take them to; I said as that is the case I will take you in custody immediately. I took him into custody. We walked a few yards, and then he said I will not go any further until I have something to drink; there came a great mob of people; I took him into the next public-house, the sign I do not know; when we got him there he began to be troublesome; I searched him further, I found two bundles of matches in one breeches pocket, and a bottle of phosphorus in the other breeches pocket; I asked him what he called this; he said, a smelling bottle. We tied his hands and took him to Bow-street. The next day I found the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am a shopkeeper, No. 1, Camden-place. On Thursday morning the 16th of this month about nine o'clock, a woman came into my shop and said, Mr. Hawkins do you know whether Mrs. Blogg is gone to market; I said, I did not know, she generally left the key with me; she said there was a strange man in her house, she did not like<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150042"/>the looks of him; I ran to Mrs. Blogg's house, I saw the young man in her shop, I asked him if Mrs. Blogg was at home, he answered no, but he had seen her, and she would be at home presently. I asked the prisoner what he had got in his apron, he said he had got something for Mrs. Blogg; I told him I was very sorry of accusing him wrongfully, but I was afraid from his being in the house without any body with him it did not look so well, and as there was so many people coming about the house I said, young man, you and I had better go over to the public-house and stop untill Mrs. Blogg comes home, and if it be your own property that you have got in your lap, it will be more to your credit. After a little while I said there will be no harm in seeing what you have got; he took it out, and a little girl saw it, she said that is Mrs. Blogg's gown. A constable was sent for, he was searched, four keys were found on him and two knives.</p>

I produce a gown, I took it out of the prisoner's apron; I searched him and found these four keys on him, and here are two keys that were found in the house by somebody else, they are skeleton keys.

             put his hand round; I am pretty clear it must be him, and then he knocked me down. Not a word was said to me until I asked what they were doing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to save your watch - A. No. I was not. I had a pint of beer in one hand, and my stick in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. They knocking you down I suppose prevented you from saving the watch - A. They ran away while I was down on the ground, the blow brought me to the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you tell me the prisoner was the man that knocked you down - A. Yes, I had seen him many times before.</p>
               <p>Q Before any thing was done did you observe the person of the prisoner - A. I turned myself round; I had an opportunity of seeing him before I was down on the ground</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in front of you at the time the watch was taken from your person - A. No, rather behind my left shoulder. I saw him as I was turning round, I was quite sure it was him that knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known his person before - A. I believe nigh three quarters of a year, at times I had seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had recovered yourself did you tell any body of this - A Many of the neighbours came out and assisted me up.</p>

               <p>Q Besides knowing the man's person did you know his name he went by - A. Yes, they used to call him Joe the Marine; I mentioned as soon as the people came to my assistance that it was

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner's person before by the name of Joe the Marine - A. Yes, I had known him a twelvemonth before; I had served him with goods. I sell oysters by the side of Fleet market when I am not out at work. I jumped off the step at the moment and catched hold of him by the jacket; he wrenched himself out of my hands,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150043"/>and the other men ran off.

I saw him on the 11th of November and spoke to him about my husband's watch; he said he had not got it; he smacked my face and ran up Eagle and Child-alley into Shoe-lane, and made his escape. He was taken upon another robbery; I was not bye when he was taken.</p>

On the 6th of January, between two and three in the afternoon, the prisoner came into Mr. Lamming's shop, she bought a small quantity of flannel and callico, altogether to the amount of seven shillings and a penny; she staid in the shop near ten minutes after she had paid me; at that time I was serving another customer; she came close to the counter and desired me to give her threepence to get a pint of beer; she smelled strong of liquor, but did not appear to be tipsey; I told her it was not our manner of doing business, neither would I give her any thing. I then had occasion to go to a different part of the shop, when leaving that place she had hold of a green print, she was still standing by the counter, and on my return the prisoner had left the shop, and the green piece of print was gone also.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons at the counter besides the prisoner - A. Probably there might be a dozen in the shop, and four or five at that counter. I went out in pursuit of the prisoner, I catched sight of her about forty yards from the door, on the same side of the way as Fleet Market; I stopped her and asked to look in her apron; in her apron I found three pieces of print.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the other pieces of print was there the green piece of print - A. There was. I charged her with having stolen them, she said she had got nothing but what she paid me for, and she would not go back with me; I insisted upon her going back, and then she went with me; I kept hold of her arm. When we had got halfway she tumbled one piece of print out of her apron, which I took up and carried in my hand. She then went quietly with me into the shop. I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon examining these three pieces were you able to say they belonged to your master - A. I am; they are his property. There was nobody serving at that counter at the time but me. I had not sold them to her, nor did she ask for any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of yards did they contain - A. Near seventy yards; they cost my master, I suppose, between four and five pounds; they all contained the private mark.</p>

On the 14th he did not come to work again, for which I went to the office of the sitting magistrate at Guildhall, the first person that I recognised was the prisoner at the bar, he was in custody; he told me the officer had seized his trunk; I then went to an adjoing room, I there saw the trunk; I looked into the trunk, in it was cloves, ginger, nutmegs, bees-wax, Spanish juice, rbubarb, and two bags, one of them I believe had been in my warehouse; that bag had been invoiced under that mark into my house; I was convinced the articles belonged to me, and in examining the bottom of the box I found two pieces of rhubarb, they are split with an axe for the customer to see the quality; I have two pieces that match them in grain and quality. I value the rhubard at one shilling and sixpence and the bag at three shillings.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday the 14th of this month at the house where he lodged in Charlotte-court in Redcross-street; I asked him whose trunk that was; the prisoner said it was his: he produced the key and opened it; there was no wearing apparel in it; it contained a bag with a quantity of ginger, bees-wax, juice, nutmegs, and two small parcels of mace; he told me that he bought them of a man, he gave three pounds sixteen shillings for them; he said the man was gone for a soldier, and that the man had brought them from Lambeth, and put them in the trunk himself.</p>

On the 14th of January, in the morning before seven o'clock, I stationed my son in Philpot-lane, and myself at the corner of Rood-lane. At half past seven my son informed me that he had watched the prisoner into the White Horse, Rood-lane. Upon going in I found the prisoner and a woman there; I asked him what he was doing there; he said he came to have some gin; I asked him where the property was that he had robbed me of, and placed my back against the door to prevent him going off; he got up with the intent to lay hold of me to push me from the door; I told him he should not go out of that room untill I got an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your property there - A. A loaf of sugar was found under the woman after the officer came; he and the woman only were in that box. The woman said she bought the sugar of a man. I took the woman in custody, she said she was his wife.</p>

            . On the morning of the 16th of January I stationed myself in a court in Philpot-lane, at half past seven the prisoner passed by it; I traced him into the White Horse in Rood-lane, he appeared to have something concealed under his apron. I fetched my father immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the White Horse did you find him in - A. In a small room on the right hand side of the passage. There was no one in the room but the prisoner and a woman. My father asked him where the property was that he had taken; my father was standing in the room with his back to the door to keep persons from going out; the prisoner said he had none, he came to take a glass of gin. A constable was sent for, and immediately the prisoner made a bolt at the door and tried to remove my father. The loaf of sugar was found under the woman, where she was sitting.</p>

On Thursday the 16th of January I went to my work as asual about seven o'clock I opened the shop and went to get some refreshment I had a pain in my bowels; my master followed me and asked me what I had got, I said, nothing; the officer searched me and found nothing. My wife, who was acquainted with the landlord, was in there, which was the occasion of a loaf of sugar being discovered On the night before she had been to a house at Downe's warf, and on her return from that house she passed two sailors, one of them gave her a punch on the shoulder; she found he was a person who had been formerly a lodger of her's. He entered into conversation with her, and told her that he had been twice cast away; that he was in possession only of one sixpence; he asked her to lend him some money; she said she had none. She knowing him some time went to her son's master and borrowed him twelve shillings; he waited for her return in Burr-street. He requested that she would go the next morning to his ship; she went and received of him a loaf of sugar. I declare I do not know of any felony respecting the loaf of sugar in question. I am bound to believe my wife's description of the loaf of sugar to be true.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's lodgings, his wife and children were there; I found this iron behind the water-butt, wrapped up in a cloth; this piece was taken from an old iron shop in Whitecross-street. The prisoner said it was distress that made him do it.</p>

Yes, and I shewed the prisoner some other articles that were laying near them, in order to ascertain whether they appeared guilty of having taken any thing before, they appeared very much confounded at my looking very hard at them, and the ticks that I had been shewing them they said they would not do, and requested me to reach one that was rather too high for me to get without getting upon something; I kept my eye upon them, and I saw the prisoner, Hannon, endeavouring to replace a piece of print that she had taken, I immediately returned to the counter, and observed the prisoner Ryan take from under her great loose coat, another piece of print; the other woman had a shawl on. I charged them with having committed the theft.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Jeremy. On the 19th of December the prisoners came into the shop and desired to look at a gown, I shewed them a great variety; they wished to look at more. I went to get more, and when I returned, observed Ryan with her hands behind her, she appeared confused, she ordered a gown to be cut off, and wanted to leave the shop in a great hurry. What she bought came to twelve shillings and eight-pence, she gave me a two pound note to pay for it; I went into the adjoining parlour to Mrs. Jeremy, to get change for it. I told her I thought the prisoners had taken some print; she said I had better tell Mr. Smith, he was turning his back upon them. I returned from the parlour and gave them the change; I kept a pound back by way of detaining them. I then went into the parlour again, and as I was returning I observed the prisoner Ryan take a piece of twenty yards of print from under her coat, she was going to put it on the counter, Mr. Smith took it out of her hands.</p>

I gave him a two pound note, he brought me the wrong change; the master said that Mrs. Ryan took a piece of print from under her coat, he said he would transport us, as he had done a good many.</p>

On Monday morning, the 23d of December, I went out of my house about half after eight, I saw three youths lurking about, I knew their persons, I am positive to Tonathy and Clark, and another person with them, which I believe to be Linton, but am not positive. I returned in less than half an hour, the neighbours said I had been robbed, and the thieves had gone towards Great Pulteney street, I saw two men bringing Clark with a carpet, which carpet is my property, this is it, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that carpet in your house before you lost it. - A. I saw it the same morning, before I went out. I desired the men in custody of Clark, to take care of him; I went in pursuit of Mrs. Bailey, she was knocked down, I accompanied my wife home, and in a few minutes Tonathy was brought to my door; I believe the other carpet is here. They were taken to Marlborough street office. On Wednesday I took Linton at the Newcastle-upon-Tyne public house, the corner of Broad street, I went to a room at the top of the house, the door was fastened; I wished it to be opened. I was answered, that whoever attempted to come into that room, they would blow their brains out, and when the door was opened, a woman struck me; I found the prisoner in the room.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take notice sufficient of the person that took the carpet off the table, so as to say one of them were one of the two persons that were brought back. - A. No, Tonathy and Clark were two of the men, Linton I cannot speak to.</p>
               <p>Q. But you cannot say whether either of them is the man that took the carpet, or only were standing bye. - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of seeing them take the carpets, you do not know the carpets again, do you. - A. Yes, I had seen the carpets, and noticed the carpets, before they were taken away, these are the same carpets, they had lain there, exposed to sale, some time, not long.</p>

Three or four fellow-labourers that were discharged at the same time, we went to drink together. In the evening I left them to go home. In Whitechapel road, going home, three or four men met me. One says to the other, I'll be damn'd if I do not know that man; he lives in Dog-row. I turned round and said, you are damn'd - I do not live there, though I did live there ten years. They made answer, that I dealt in oysters, and that I opened some for them. I then found they knew me, though I did not know them. I got into conversation with them, and they mentioned two or three people's names that did live in Dog-row. With persuasion I went into the Angel and Crown, opposite Whitechapel church, to drink with them. They called for a pot of beer and half a pint of liquor, and paid for it; we drank the liquor, and came out of the house together; there were four of them. I bid them good night, and in my way home, just before I got to <placeName id="t18120115-55-crimeloc320">Great Garden-street</placeName>

I got up and halloed out watch; the patrol came up; I told him I had lost my watch and money; I told him two went up Great Garden-street, and the other two went up the road; I went with him to the watch-house, and the constable of the night went with me to the public-house to know whether these lads used the house or no. We could not learn any thing of them; there I was wandering about for a little while. I laid hold of this prisoner somewhere near Whitechapel church, I called the watchmen, and gave him in charge, the officer of the night did not take my charge, they seemed to think that I had not lost a watch, being a poor man. I would not leave the prisoner then, I followed him, thinking somebody might be coming by that would hear my case. By Osborne street, the prisoner knocked me down, a watchman was leaning over his box, when I got up I said, you see how I am served, this is one of the party that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the watchman take him. - A. No. He knocked me down the second time, and the watchman never came out of his box; I got up, and made the best of my way home. This was on the Saturday night. On the Wednesday morning I saw the prisoner at Worship street, and as soon as I saw him, I said he was one of the four that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said two held your hands back, while the other two rifled you, what did they take from you. - A. A silver watch, two dollars, and a three-shilling token, I have never seen them since. The prisoner was searched at the watch house, nothing was found on him.</p>

A little before two he brought this man in, he then said that he had lost his watch, two dollars, and two three shilling pieces, he was very much in liquor and varied his account, that is the reason the officer did not take the charge.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Aylwin. On the 5th of December, a little before six in the evening I was desired to pursue a man that had taken a tub of batter out of Mr. Aylwin's cart. The cart was standing at the warehouse door, I went down Friday Street, I met the prisoner with the tub on his shoulder, I told him he had got my master's property, I took hold of the prisoner with the tub fell off his shoulder, I scuffled with him and throwed him down on his back on the stones, he then begged in God's name I would let him go, I told him no. With assistance I took him to my master's warehouse. This is the tub, I am sure it is my master's property,</p>

            . I am carman to Messrs. Aylwin. I loaded sixteen of these tubs at Downes and Holly's wharf, East Smithfield, on Thursday night, December the 5th, and coming down the Old Change a little before six the cart was all safe; and on crossing Watling Street to my master's warehouse, the rope which I tied the cart in with was cut, the tub was missing from the cart When I stopped at the warehouse door I rang the bell, and there I had assistance to seek for the tub of butter. The porter went in pursuit of the prisoner. I am certain that is the tub.</p>
               <p>Q. Then between Watling Street and your master's warehouse it was taken away, was it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is mine, the butter is worth six pounds.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to search the prisoner's house, I found the man's wife at home, she denied having any thing that I asked for. These things were found, which the prosecutor identified by the marks, here is callico, this is part of a piece of printed cotton, eight pieces of linen wrapper, and eight bits of carpet. The prisoner's wife had a gown on her back the pattern of this printed cotton.</p>
               <p>Alport. The whole is my master's property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe the prisoner has lived a year and a half in the service of the prosecutors - A. I believe he has; until the preceding day I never had the least suspicion of him, and he came from a place where he had lived seven years, with a particular good character.</p>
               <p>Leadbetter. The prisoner took a key that opened a large chest up stairs, he seemed to be anxious to get at a little drawer, I there found three rolls of bank notes, one containing sixteen pound, another thirty-five pound, and another roll containing twenty-nine pound, and some stock receipts, amounting in the whole to seven hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I request my property that is taken away for my wife and child.</p>

No. When the other woman, who had bought two handkerchiefs, left the shop, I followed her into Great Newport Street, at the bottom of Newport Market she was joined by the prisoner, I ran and overtook them both, I asked them to step back with me. They went willingly until we got to the middle of Newport Market, where the other woman said she must return and buy a joint of meat, I turned to see where the other woman went to, the prisoner ran off. I followed the prisoner and overtook her, the other woman made her escape. I took the prisoner into our accompting-house, she produced five pieces of silk handkerchiefs from under her coat.

The prisoner came to my shop on the 11th of January, between twelve and one o'clock, I was behind the counter going in at the street and while the prisoner was being served at the right hand counter I observed that she had a piece of white cloth or muslin in her hand, and I saw her put it into the drawer. I saw her take it out again as if she had something concealed in the handkerchief, to put it into her pocket, I waited till she had gone out of the shop. She had bought three yards of galloon. I went to the drawer, there were five pieces of galloon missing, I went out and overtook the prisoner in Bedford Row, I brought her back, I told her that I suspected that she had been stealing something out of the drawer, she took these five pieces out of her pocket and begged for mercy.</p>

She then asked to look at some gloves; I told her we did not deal in gloves. She reached over to the drawer, and then walked towards the door, and I saw the end of a tippet hanging out of her handkerchief as she was going out; I took hold of her and told her that she had got a tippet of mine; she said she had not, and flung it out of the handkerchief, on the side of the shop window; she tore herself from me and ran out of the door as fast as she could; I ran after her, she was stopped and brought back.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. I know nothing of Spittigue. Richardson, when he worked with me, called his name Lamb; he used to take care of my team. I have lost fowls many times before. On Saturday night, the 28th of December, about eight o'clock, I heard clearly that some person was in the yard; we have a large dog in the yard; we wondered the dog did not open, but he being so conversant with Richardson it is not to be wondered at. I understood on Sunday evening that there were two persons apprehended for stealing of fowls. On Monday I found that I had lost more than six fowls; two of these fowls, a cock, and a black and white pullet I knew. On Monday I went to Bow-street, the two prisoners were in custody; these six fowls were produced, they were all dead. I described two of them, and have no doubt but they all came from one place. Two of them I was able to ascertain when they were produced: one a cropper crown cock, the other was a pullet, black and white; I have no doubt in the world of their being mine. They are worth nine shillings the whole of them.</p>

On the 29th of December, about two o'clock in the morning, I was going the Fulham-road from town, the prisoners were coming towards town; I met them coming towards London, they were both together; Richardson had a bag on his back, I asked him what he had got there; he did not answer me directly; Spittigue said it was tools they had fetched from Richmond; it was brushes and colour; I told them it was an aukward hour of the night to be carrying tools about; I felt at them and was not satisfied; I told them we were Bow-street officers. We examined the bag, in it were six fowls, and no brushes nor colours. They were dead. The fowls were warm at the time, they had not long been dead. We took one to Knightsbridge watchhouse, and the other to St. Martin's watchhouse. On Monday morning we took them to Bow-street, Mr. Biggs saw the fowls there, he believed them all to be his; he pitched particularly upon the cock. Richardson told me on Monday morning that he got the fowls from Mr. Biggs.</p>

               <p>Q. You have heard the account the other witness has given - A. Yes, his account is correct. On the next morning Spittigue stated that he had called upon Richardson, Richardson asked him to take a walk a little way, that he had left his tools at his late master's; I asked him where he brought the fowls from; he said he stood on this side of Putney bridge while the other went and got them from his late master. In the afternoon when I called upon him he said that Richardson took the fowls from Mr. Biggs of Barnes, he had often took some before: he then said that he stood outside of the gate while Richardson was getting them. The clock struck twelve while he was getting them. He said he had spoken erroneous in the morning, he would state the truth.</p>

On the 12th of last December the prisoner came to work about half past eight in the morning: the box containing the gold filings were in the shop under the charge of my apprentice, placed on one of the work boards; the apprentice was then called out of the shop, and the prisoner was left alone. Shortly after that another man came to work, and was followed close up stairs by the apprentice; the box then containing the filings was taken away by the apprentice. I shortly after weighed them, and found it to be deficient sixteen pennweights. There was some missing on the morning before. It was weighed on the 11th at night, the last thing, in the presence of my apprentice. About twelve o'clock I sent to Bow-street for an officer; he came and asked the prisoner if he had any gold about him; the prisoner answered, no; he searched him and found in his breeches pocket a small grain; he searched his fob and found a paper, he asked the prisoner what it contained; he said, gold. The officer found another paper, he asked what it contained; he said, gold. It was weighed in the presence of the prisoner and the officer, I found the weight that we missed out of the box.</p>

            , SEN. Q. You are the owner of the barge Union - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For whom had you lightered this cargo of deals - A. For Messrs. Bolton and Baker.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the cargo - A. Ninety-nine pounds was the parchase if they came out right by the barge note.</p>
               <p>Q. Having known by your son that the barge was missed did you go about to the deal yards - A. I did and on Thursday after I went to Mr. Houghton's premises in the Borough road; he sells old building materials; I saw no new there but my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any deals there that you thought were your own - A. I did, thirty-five in number; thirty-two eight-feet, and three twelve-feet. I marked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150052"/>them before they came to the office. I recognised them by the ship's mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Having examined them did you proceed to Union Hall to obtain a warrant - A. I did. I went back with an officer, and took possession of the deals.</p>
               <p>Q. While you and the officer were there did Houghton come in - A. He did; I asked him how he came by them deals; he said he had bought them of a man of the name of Chapman, who lived in Dover-street; that is a cross street near the Magdalen; he said he bought two hundred and a half, he gave thirty-five pounds a hundred for them; I asked him what become of the rest of the deals; he told me that his wife and he had retailed them out at two or three at a time, and to whom he did not know. I told him it was a serious loss to me, if he could tell me it would help me; he said it was using him ill to ask him. I went to him again in the evening. There was an hundred deals at the Royal Mortar in the London-road, Mr. Inman, he lived next door but one, he claimed them.</p>

               <p>Q. After you had found them did you tell Houghton that you had found them - A. On the next day I told the magistrate before him. In counting over the two hundred I found nine that did not belong to me. In the thirty-five that I found at Houghton's they all belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you find these deals at Inman's premises to his - A. About two or three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I believe Houghton, who is now indicted pointed out to you where to apprehend Chapman - A. He did, I believe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The deals were a small part of the ship's cargo - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did King and Culliver come to you on the evening of Thursday the 19th of December - A. Yes, they came to my own house; they said they wanted to speak to me. We went over to the Dover Castle public-house, they asked me if I wanted to buy any deals, they said they had got about an hundred; I said I did not want any, I am out of business, I have got nothing to do; I said, I knew a person that did; I would let them know the next evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any price mentioned - A. Not then. We had two or three pots of beer together. We met again the next evening. On Friday I went to Mr. Houghton's, I asked him if he wanted to buy any deals; he said yes, he would buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any price agreed upon - A. Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew King was a lighterman - A. Yes. I never saw Culliver before Thursday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Houghton ask who was to supply the deals - A. I told him they were lightermen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between Houghton and you how the deals were to be brought - A. He told me to provide carts to bring them to his house the next morning, and he would go down with me in the morning, and I went to see Culliver and King that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. That evening did King and Culliver come to you again - A. Yes; I informed them what had passed between Houghton and me; King told me he would call me up in the morning about half after five. The deals were to be at the Anchor wharf, Wapping Old-stairs, Mr. Johnson's wharf; he told me that they would be there at high water in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that, that evening, did you go to bespeak waggons - A. I did, that evening, to Mr. Briant's, East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday morning did King call you up - A. He did, about half after five; I went with him over Blackfriars-bridge, and from there to the Anchor wharf; the barge was there; the name of the barge was the Union, she was laden with deals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any oars in her - A. Yes, one pair, they were in the barge, and King, in about half an hour fetched the oars from the barge and put them on the wharf, and afterwards he took them away.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was this - A. About half after six, or nearly seven.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were there did Culliver come - A. Culliver came in about twenty minutes with an empty barge, he moored that barge outside of the Union; the Union laid close to the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the use of mooring that empty barge close to the Union - A. To cover her; she was empty, and laid higher in the water. Culliver came to us at the public-house, there we had something to drink. We stopped there some time; I went out and met one of the waggons coming to the wharf; I directed the waggons to be loaded at the Anchorwharf. Culliver, King, and me went as far as Tower Hill together; then I went over the water to Mr. Houghton, I told him the deals were come to the Anchor wharf, one waggon was loading, and the other waggon was coming; I got a man to unload the barge. I breakfasted at Houghton's, and then Houghton and I came to the Anchor wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got there did you find the waggons loaded - A. One waggon was loaded and gone out of the yard; Mr. Houghton gave them a card where to go to; they asked for money to pay turnpikes, Houghton gave each of the men a shilling; he paid the wharfinger and the man I employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the waggons were sent off - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Houghton to his own yard - A. Yes. In going over we overtook one of the waggons.</p>
               <p>Q. At last did the waggons arrive at his yard with the deals - A. They did; he and I assisted to unload them. All the deals came. On Monday we counted them over; I cannot exactly say the number, I think two hundred and seventy-three, short hundreds; I asked him thirty-two pounds a hundred; I said the men would not be satisfied without thirty, that was to be the lowest; Houghton said he could not afford to give so much money for them; he said, you know I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150053"/>run a hazard, he agreed to give twenty-five pound, he gave me a pound note, earnest of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Culliver call upon you. - A. He had called upon me on the Saturday night, to know if I was paid. On Monday night Culliver and King came together, and Houghton came to my house; we all went over to the Dover Castle, I went home to Houghton's house with him, he gave me twenty-nine pounds, making up with the one pound, thirty pounds; I went to the Dover Castle, and gave it King, Culliver was in the tap-room, I went into the parlour, and gave King twenty poundout of the thirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at the time. - A. Mr. Jones's boy was reading prayers at the time, the oldest son turned round and looked at me, while I was paying him the money; we agreed to meet the Tuesday evening to have the remainder of the money. On Tuesday evening they came to me, we went to the Dover Castle, I had not got the money, we appointed to meet on the day after Christmas day. On Thursday morning I saw Houghton, he gave me fifteen pounds, he told me that he had sold the deals.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did that leave to pay. - A. Thirteen pounds, with the expences, there were three pounds paid for waggons, wharfage, and landing, he promised to pay me that on the Friday or the Saturday after.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe on that evening, Thursday, an officer came to your house to take you in custody. - A. I was in the country, I heard of it, I sent a young man of the name of Murphy to King and Culliver, I saw Culliver, and told him that the officer had been after me; he said he had heard something of thirty pounds, he thought it must be Houghton that had told.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard of the reward. - A. I was apprehended that same day, through Houghton; after I was apprehended I told Glannon all I knew.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. In what way of life is Houghton. - A. He buys new and old building materials.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you. - A. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in earnest. - A. Yes. I am a tradesman.</p>
               <p>Q. What house is it you keep in Dover-street. - A. A private house.</p>
               <p>Q. In which you let out lodgings. - A. That is not material, my wife does.</p>
               <p>Q. I think, according to your own observations, you applied to Houghton to purchase these deals of the lightermen. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a bill of invoice at the time. - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it for granted, though you said you had these deals of a foreign captain to Mr. Houghton, that you did not produce a bill of invoice pretending that you had them upon that account. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember the man Houghton, when he was a witness before you and the other parties, do you not recollect his stating that fact, and did not you admit it. - A. No, I did not; I perhaps might, I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, did not the prisoner Houghton say in your presence, and in your hearing, that you told him that you had the deals of a foreign captain, and that was what induced him to purchase them of you. - A. He might, I made no answer, I heard him say something, about a foreign captain.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you standing as a party accused of the robbery. - A. Yes, I must.</p>
               <p>Q. Now attend to the question. When you were first examined, did not you at each of the examinations, desire to have it postponed, that you might produce the foreign captain of whom you had the timber. - A. I never said a word about the captain, Houghton did; I said if they would give me another day, I would bring the person that I had the deals of. I never saw the other men untill they were under examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you asked at that very time whether you knew them two men, King and Culliver. - A. I was asked that, I said I believed I had seen them before, that was before I was put on oath.</p>
               <p>Q. So then you only tell lies when not upon oath. - A. When upon oath, I speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the first witness that has been examined, Clements, the lighterman. - A. I saw him at Hick's Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you in the presence of Clements, and two other persons say, you would be d - d if you did not stick so close to Houghton as the shirt upon his back, because of your own expressions, he had pulled you up. - A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Houghton you say got the timber into his possession before you talked about the price of them. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. This yard of Houghton's in which the timber is put, is it not a yard directly open to the highway. - A. One part of it is open.</p>
               <p>Mr Gurney. Glannon took you up, and whether you were charged with stealing or receiving, you did not know - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Friday you were taken to Union Hall. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At first when you went there you had the discretion to hold your tongue; you told Glannon you would tell all you knew if they would receive you as a witness. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the receipt of Houghton's - A. Yes, Received of Houghton thirty pounds in part of the amount of the deals.</p>

Yes, with King, he went into the parlour, he did not stay in the parlour more than five minutes I think; that was on the Monday, they came out of the parlour and had some gin and water, there were three of them together then.

On Monday last, between the hours of twelve and one, the two prisoners came into the shop, they bought some check, paid for it, and went out of the shop, I missed a shawl that was laying on the counter, I immediately called them back and told them that I had lost a shawl, they came back and said they should like to be searched, I sent for a constable, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150056"/>while the young man was gone for the constable, we looked on the floor where the prisoners were standing, and saw the shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it near the counter. - A. It was two yards from the counter, when I took up the shawl it was quite warm. This is the shawl, it is worth seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Raymond's Defence. We were accused of taking the shawl, we said we would strip, and the shawl was found where they packed up the blankets.</p>

About ten minutes previous to his coming in, I saw the shoes, and in about ten minutes after he went out I missed the shoes. My partner was in the shop with some customers. I then suspected the prisoner, I went to several pawnbrokers near to tell the men to stop the shoes if they came there. After I had returned home, a young man came into the shop with the shoes in his hand, asking me if I knew those shoes, I told him they were my shoes which I had lost, he said the prisoner came to pawn them, they had sent him to the watch house, and kept the shoes.

            . - I am a pawnbroker, 90 East Smithfield. On the 7th of December, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in the shop and offered these shoes to pledge, I looked at the shoes and saw that the shoes did not correspond with his dress, I suspected that he had not honestly come by them, he then told me that they belonged to a shipmate of his, I told him I should detain the shoes untill he proved that he came honestly by them, I sent for an officer and sent him to the watch-house, seeing the name in the shoes, that they were made for a person in Ratcliffe Highway. That is how we found it out. These are the shoes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are mine, there is my writing on them. There was nobody but me serving on that side of the shop at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the shoes. - A. Seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along the highway, I went into this man's shop, he asked me nine shillings, I offered seven shillings and sixpence and went out about my business, I went to the public-house, a man came to me and asked me to pawn the shoes, he would give me something to drink, I went to the shop, he asked me if they belonged to me, I said, no, they belong to another man. I declare to God I never stole them.</p>

Yes, I was present at the time he was tried there for stealing a silk handkerchief; I was present when he was taken from Tothill-fields to be tried; and I was present in the Session's house at the time. I used to attend the Sessions, at that time he was transported for seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. What jail was he returned to from the Sessions. - A. To Tothill Fields first, and from there to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him after he was sent to Newgate. - A. I never recollect seeing him until I was sent for to go to Birmingham, near three years ago, I found him in the jail at Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him to be the same person whom you had seen tried at Westminster. - A. Yes, and under the sentence of seven years transportation.</p>
               <p>A. Did you see him tried at the Warwick assizes. - A. Yes, I was bound over to give evidence against him, and I did give evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the trial at Warwick. - A. Yes, and heard the verdict, the jury returned him guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible that you can be mistaken as to the man. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the next time you saw him after he was tried at Warwick. - A. Never, until he was brought to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, it is not with the intent of denying my charge, that I pleaded not guilty, but humbly hoping there are some circumstances in my case, that deserves your lordship's commiseration. At Westminster quarter sessions I was tried for the attempt of stealing a pocket handkerchief, by only moving the pocket handkerchief from one pocket to another; since my return, which is about fourteen months, I have had the satisfaction to say, that no police officer, or any other, can lay the slightest charge to me; I was, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150059"/>the first ten months in the country, residing on my friends' bounty, since then I lodged at Mrs. Hoare's, Blackfriers, never quitting her house till seven in the evening to enjoy the fresh air, and invariably returning at nine o'clock. I am by trade a glass-cutter, and should have ever been a useful member to society; I therefore humbly implore implore your Lordship to recommend me. With respect to my doing any hurt to the community, I declare to God I have not.</p>

            . I am a salesman in Spittalfields Markets. On the 7th of January, about five o'clock in the evening, I saw the Norfolk waggon going through <placeName id="t18120115-83-crimeloc490">Paternoster Row, leading to Union Street</placeName>

When the trunk was out they all three went away, I followed them, the waggon went up Church Street, and they went down Red Lion Street, quite a different direction, I seized the prisoner, one of the other men was carrying the box on his shoulder, and the moment that I seized the prisoner the man that had the box threw it down and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw two men get into the waggon, and the box handed out to the third, I suppose you could not say the third man was the prisoner. - A. No, I took the prisoner and the box to a place of safety, the prisoner made no resistance, he was close to the man that was carrying the box. I have hardly a doubt that he was one of the three persons.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was unfortunately married to this woman when I was an apprentice, I lived very sociably with her upwards of a twelvemonth, when her temper became so violent and disgraceful to all human society, that I could not bear to live with her any longer, I parted with her, and lived from her six years. It so happened that I had to go down into Oxfordshire, she wrote letters repeatedly, saying that she would be happy to live with me, and be a different woman to what she was before; I consented so to do, we lived in peace and comfort nine or ten months in the country, when I had finished my job I came to London; it is only two years ago that she robbed the house where I lodged, where I was taken up, the people knowing me innocent, never offered to prosecute; she frequently told me that I might go out on the highway, and get more money in two or three hours than I could earn in a month. I parted with her on the 2d of last September twelvemonth, I agreed to allow her a crown a week, and to pay ten pound a year for her house rent, I paid the last half years rent for her on the 10th of September last, when she found out I was married, she would not take my money any longer.

               <p>Q. Did you see his hand move. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any tin case on the counter, before he was stopped. - A. No, I did not, it did not belong to our shop; and after he was stopped, there was a tin case close behind him on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the tin case contain. - A. It contained five ear rings and the diamond hoop ring; then he was taken to Bow street.</p>
               <p>- PERKS. Q. You were sent for to Mr. Hamlet's shop. - A. Yes, I searched the prisoner's person, I found a passport on him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing. - A. No. He pretended not to understand me, I told him to go about his business, he understood that and was going.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Pizey.) Were you in the shop at the time that this man was laid hold of by Perks. - A. Yes, I was in the shop, I informed Mr. Hamlet of such a person being about, we had missed a watch and a pair of ear rings while he was in the shop. When he was taken he was removed into another room where there was a counter, Mr. Hamlet removed every thing out of his reach.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was searched was there any thing on the counter. - A. Yes, he had put his hand behind him, Perks brought his hand forward and said, you rascal, what have you behind you, and then I saw the tin case on the counter.</p>

               <p>MR. LAWRENCE. I saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutor running after him, I stopped the prisoner about an hundred yards from his door, I saw the prisoner come out of the shop, the prosecutor called stop thief; he threw the blanket down, and said, no thief.</p>

               <p>- BROTHERTON. On Sunday morning I was going through the wood between eight and nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner picking geese in the wood, I asked him what he was doing, he said he was picking some geese that he lit of, I told him I thought he had not come honestly by them. I took him and the geese to Harefield, I delivered him to the constable, he there said he found them on the common.</p>
               <p>- IVE. I am a constable, I took charge of the prisoner, I looked in the sack, I found in it three geese and a gander. The next day I took him before the magistrate, Green swore to the geese, and Cox to the sack.</p>
               <p>MR. COX. That is my sack.</p>
               <p>MR. GREEN. I really believe the geese were my property, one of them I can positively swear to.</p>

            . I am a broker; I live in Raven-row, Spitalfields. I know both the prisoners. On the 3d of January Steele came in doors, Lamb waited outside; it was about four o'clock in the afternoon; Steele had some shells under both his arms, he asked me if I would buy them; I told him, no, I was no judge of them; he said if I would sell them at the door he would satisfy me; I said, what is the price of them; he said, eighteen-pence the large ones, and nine-pence the small one's. I put them at the door; I did not buy them. Steele said he would take them back again if I did not sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of them - A. Twenty-one. Afterwards Mr. Combe the officer came, and Mr. Blundle; two of the shells on that day were at the door, and the others on a shelf. Steele was then in custody. I told the magistrate that Lamb was with him.</p>
               <p>- COOMBES. I am an officer. I went to Jacob's, I found two shells at the door, and twenty-one on a shelf just as you went in at the door. Jacobs described the other man, and Freeman went and apprehended Lamb. Steele said in Lamb's presence that they were together, and that they used to sell them at Burnet's in Mile End road. This was the first time that they went to Jacob's. Lamb said nothing.</p>
               <p>Blundle. These are the shells we lost in December.</p>

I let to the prisoner a furnished room on the 18th of September, he occupied the room untill the 19th of October; he paid me but one weeks rent, and when he went the sheets and blankets were gone; from information I and Mr. Heath went to the Scotch Arms, we saw the prisoner, I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150066"/>him what he had done with the key of the room; he said he left it with a woman in the room that he cohabited with; I asked him to go with me to authorise me to open the door; he said he would; he came about twenty yards, and then refused to go any further. We got two watchmen, they took the prisoner, and went up to the door with him; when I opened the door the sheets and the blankets were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the woman leave the lodgings - A. She was never seen after the 19th, in the morning they went out together. The watchmen took the prisoner to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>MRS. YOUNG. About four o'clock on the afternoon of the 30th of December the prisoner came into our house to have a pint of porter; she stood by our fire; she had the child with her; and there was a girl looked in our window about ten years of age. I went out to the door, the girl told me that there was a woman in the tap-room by the fire that took the little boy's pinafore from him and had put it her pocket; I came in and asked her what business she had with the child's pinafore; she said she had taken it to fill it full of apples; it was her brother's child. I told her apples were too dear to fill a pinafore with apples; I detained her; a person in our parlour took her to Lambeth-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the pinafore - A. In her pocket; I told her to take it out, and she took it out; I took it out of her hand.</p>

Soon after I stopped him I saw a man, he said, deliver him up to me and the goods; I thought he was a constable by his demand, and instead of the man taking the prisoner into Bedford-place he took him up Montague-place; I halloed to the man to bring the prisoner back; I ran after him and stopped him again; a constable came up then, and we took him back to Bedford-place, No. 16.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he called on me in December, I do not recollect the day of the month; I was engaged as foreman; I knew Moulds the prisoner when he was an apprentice. When Moulds called upon me I and Mr. Markey was at a public-house, we all had some porter together. In the course of conversation Moulds asked me where it was likely for him to get sale for marble chimney pieces; I said I did not know any likelier place than about that quarter that I was employed in, there were so many builders to purchase; the prisoner went away. I saw the prisoner again on the week following, we went over to Lisson Grove where the prisoner was at work; Mr. Markey expressed a wish to see the chimney-pieces, he agreed to go with the prisoner and to see the chimney-pieces. We went into Locks fields, I saw the chimney-pieces, Mr. Markey and the prisoner agreed for the price; this was on Thursday, on Saturday Mr. Mackey was to send a cart, and on the Friday before that Saturday they were brought and delivered into the shop; I was not present; when I came home I found them in Mr. Markey's shop.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner when he called on my man Barnes, I did not then attend to what he said. On the Thursday following we went over to see the chimney pieces; this was Thursday, he was taken up on the Monday. Barnes, him, and me went to inspect these chimney-pieces, it was a long way from the other side of Westminster bridge; he shewed me the chimney-pieces, he asked Barnes in my hearing what they were worth, if he thought they were worth twelve pounds; I said I thought they were; Barnes said, there is Ellison's cart; I said, that will bring them over on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it proposed that you should send the cart and bring them away - A. Saturday was mentioned. On the Friday they were brought over in my absence; on Saturday morning I found they were on my premises.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner's box, I found two books in it, he said they belonged to his master, he had taken them to read; at the bottom of the box I found sixty-four penny-pieces and about fifty halfpence. I searched his person, in his coat pocket I found a brace of loaded pistols, and this phosphorus box and matches; he said he carried the pistols about him for his own defence, and the phosphorus to get a light, as he was in the habit of getting up early in the morning. We then proceeded to Mr. Colderoy's, 13, Bunhill-row; he had another box there; we searched it; we found four or five books there, he said they belonged to his master, he had taken them to read.</p>

               <p>- JENNETT. I am a painter and glazier, 15, Compton-place, Brunswick-square. I was coming up <placeName id="t18120115-123-crimeloc730">Marchmont-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Is he a butcher - A. Yes, in Marchmont-street. I thought they were suspicious character; I passed them, and when I got to the top of the street I crossed over nearly opposite, I saw the two prisoners near Mr. Woodhatch's door; Drew reached over the partition which parts the shop from the private door, and drew over a piece of beef, and rolled it in his apron, and walked away; Holland looked into his apron as he was rolling it in. I went and told Mr. Woodhatch that a man had taken his beef away; I pointed out to him the man that had got the beef. Mr. Woodhatch took him back to the shop. I took Holland and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Drew's Defence. I throw myself on the mercy of the court.</p>
               <p>Holland's Defence. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Constable. I went to Mr. Woodhatch this morning, I said the prisoners were going to be tried to day, he said he did not care for the Old Bailey, we might all be d - d, he would not come.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor was called, and not appearing in court, his recognisance was ordered to be estreated.</p>

            . I have been in service some years; I have been out of service four months. On the 12th of January I was introduced to the prisoner by a woman of the name of Nowland, in company with a woman of the name of Byat for the purpose of buying some bad money.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Mrs. Nowland before - A. Yes. Mrs. Byat told me she would sell half a piece of goods, that is, twenty bad shillings, she would sell me a half piece for ten shillings. I appointed to meet her the next day at twelve o'clock, the 13th of January; if she did not come the next day herself Mrs. Slater would come, it was equal the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Slater was present at this time - A. She was. I then went to Mr. Powell and acquainted him with this circumstance; Mr. Powell told me to come to his chambers the next morning and to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there the next morning - A. I did, about half past nine; I waited there untill Mr. Armstrong came, and the officers came. When the officers came then they gave me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they gave you the money had you any money about you - A. No, I had not a halfpenny In the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you the money - A. Mr. Armstrong, I saw him mark the money; two three-shilling pieces, a half-crown, one shilling and sixpence, and they gave me four pennyworth of halfpence to treat the woman with gin. After that I went to the wine-vaults the corner of <placeName id="t18120115-124-crimeloc736">Hollis-street, Clare-market</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18120115-124-crimeloc736" type="placeName"

The officers were behind me, they had sight of me all the way I went. I then met the prisoner at the door of the wine-vaults, she told me that she had been sometime waiting for me; she then said, she had brought me what was promised me last night. We walked about an hundred yards from the door; she said they were very much in want of money, and Byat's people were at work; she said they were very bad, they were all scratchy, but if I could do away with them, that is, pass them off, she would get me some that would be much better to-morrow. We went into the wine-vaults, Mr. Armstrong was just behind us, and then I treated her with a quartern of gin, and gave her the four-pennyworth of halfpence; she then gave me the twenty bad shillings out of her hand, they were in brown paper; I gave her the ten shillings that I had received of the officer, the same money; she stood at the bar, and then she gave me in her turn a quartern of gin; she paid for that with the sixpence I had just given her, she had it in her hand; then I stood at the bar a few minutes longer, and then a little boy came in; I was to put my hand to my bonnet when he came in if I had bought the money; I did, and the officers came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that sixpence that was given by her for the last gin given to the landlord - A. Yes. Mr. Armstrong took hold of my hand and asked me what I had got there; I told him what I had bought and paid for; he took it out of my hand and looked at it, and asked me who I bought it of; I told him, the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were not you tried here last sessions - A. Yes, and I was acquitted. The woman was drunk and pawned the watch herself.</p>

When I and my son and Bishop went into the wine-vaults Mrs. Harcup's face presented herself to me, Mrs. Slater's back was rather towards us: I catched hold of Harcup's hand and said, what have you got here; I took out of her hand a paper containing twenty counterfeit shillings; I produced them before the grand jury, and by some mistake there is only nineteen, there were twenty then, which I counted. I then asked Mrs. Harcup of whom she got them; she said she had bought them and paid for them of the prisoner, the prisoner then being present. We took them into a little room and there I saw Bishop produce some marked money, which I knew I had given<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150072"/>to Mrs. Harcup. The money produced wanted a sixpence. I went to the landlord and told him the sixpence that we wanted had a dot in it under the letters, which the man found. The prisoner was secured and taken to the office. I did not search Slater, she never made use of a bad word, but behaved exceeding well.</p>

               <p>Mr. Shelton. Prisoner at the bar, the prosecutor has put in a plea that you have been tried and convicted of felony, and did receive the benefit of clergy before, and that you are the same person who was tried and convicted, and had judgment in October sessions 1810.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Gentlemen of the jury, the nature of the enquiry for you is, whether the prisoner is the same person that was convicted of felony, and if she is, by law no prisoner can be entitled to the benefit of clergy but once, and therefore she will be liable to a capital conviction. That she is the same person I undertake to prove; it appears that she was tried in October sessions 1810.</p>
               <p>MR. SEWELL. I am clerk to the solicitor of the Mint. I produce a copy of the record of the conviction of the prisoner,

             HARDY. Q. You are clerk to Mr. Newman, the keeper of Newgate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, I was present at the time of her conviction, and when she received sentence, her sentence was to be imprisoned one year in Newgate, and to be fined one shilling. She remained in Newgate, and was discharged the 31st of October last. I have no doubt at all of her being the person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Gentlemen of the jury, the question for you to determine is, whether she is the same person that was tried in October 1810.</p>
               <p>Verdict of the jury - We find that she is the same person.</p>

I saw the prisoner on the 16th of March last, he came by me at one o'clock in the morning towards town the Kilburn way, and then at three o'clock he came back again towards Kilburn; he passed by me, and I followed him to the top of Edgware Hill; there was a watchman there, he followed him. It was a moonlight morning. I went on along with him into the ground of one Tims, a gardener, he had a brother watching a mushroon bed. We watched about till four; I turned up to two horses that I had the care of, and coming back I met the prisoner with this bag with a horse cloth in it, five ducks, a hedging hook, and this sawyers dog-iron. I attacked him and said, what have you got there; he said, what is that to you; I made a snatch at him; he said, what do you want, you bloody fool, and turned from me; he threw the bag down, and after he ran about ten yards; I said, he might go and be d - d, if he would, I knew him. I have seen him since in the day-time.</p>
               <p>Q. If you saw him afterwards why did not you take him up - A. It was left for the Marlborough-street officers to take him. I knew him to be a thief well. Mr. Dobson had the ducks, they were dead and all warm.</p>

I took the prisoner in custody, and while I was searching her she endeavoured to turn two or three shillings of one side that I might not see them, they were in a little purse in her bosom. In her throwing the purse down on the ground, she had a method of throwing them two dollars of one side; there were twelve shillings and sixpence in the bag, independant of the dollars, and two of the shillings were bad. The prisoner was rather intoxicated, but she was able to run away while I was talking to the ward beadle, she was stopped almost immediately. I picked up three tokens, two were bad and one was good.

            . I am a boot maker, I live about five houses from this warehouse. On Friday the 13th of December, about five in the afternoon, it was dark at that time, I was standing at my own door, I observed four men, the prisoner was on the opposite side, shortly after they passed my house the prisoner joined them in company. Suspecting that they were on something bad I watched them, and just as I got to a house adjoining Mr. Hankes I passed on and the four men and the prisoner separated, three men took their station against the church nearly opposite the prisoner, and another turned round the corner of the hord, and at that instant I lost sight of them. It had not been a moment scarcely before I discovered the prisoner open the warehouse of Mr. Hankes and Lee, it was by the glimmer of the light at the extremity of the warehouse that I discovered the prisoner, at that time he had got his head and the forepart of his body in the warehouse, at that instant I jumped up and got hold of him by the neck, I then called out Mr. Hankes, the warehouseman came running down to me, I told him my opinion of the prisoner. There was a great deal lumber box and other things that he might have concealed himself in to have robbed the warehouse, which I suspected was the case.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the four companions. - A. They all decamped, then the prisoner was secured. The other four were grown men, one of them was convicted here last night, he went by the name of Joe the marine, he was tried for knocking down the bell-man of St. Bride's. I sent for a constable, he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150076"/>searched, nothing was found.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Messrs. Hankes and Lee, I heard Mr. Groves make the alarm, I had not been to the door for near half an hour, in consequence of the alarm I immediately ran forward and found the lad in the possession of Mr. Groves. Our door is a very heavy door and a pulley, if any person opens it it will shut itself, I sent for an officer, he knew him, and at the Mansion-house he was known by the officers.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow Street, I met Mr. Powell, the assistant solicitor to the mint, at Salisbury, he delivered me these ten guineas, Mr. Powell marked them in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got these guineas of Mr. Powell, and received directions of him, what did you do. - A. I went to the Devisees.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in the mail coach as far as Newbury. - A. I did. At Marlborough I paid for two glasses of brandy, one for the coachman who drove me, and one for me, I pulled out a pound note, and there the other saw the guineas, my hands were cold when I pulled out my bag, I could do no other, and there the coachman saw the guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. At Newbery, there you changed the coachman that drove the mail. - A. We did so.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him before you got to Newbury - A. No, he drove to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he and the former coachman in conversation. - A. Not as I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pulled the guineas out after you came in company with the defendant at Newbury. - A. I pulled the bag out to pay for something for the coachman, there the defendant saw the guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him them afterwards. - A. I believe not until I came near Maidenhead. At Maidenhead he told me I had better give my money to the guard, that was a great place for thieving, the Gloucester Mail had been fired at, and one ball had entered the side; soon after this conversation, passed about four miles, we talked again about the guineas. He told me that they used to be sold at twenty-seven and twenty-eight shillings, they did not go for so much now. I expressed a surprise that guineas should rise and fall, I had never heard any thing about it, he told me it was according to the risk they run in leaving the kingdom, that there had been a number seized. I before this, told him that I was going to Gerrad's Hall Inn, Baising-lane, that I had never been in London before, but my brother had come to London to meet me in a one horse cart. The subject was mentioned two or three times after that, but not so particularly; when I got to Piccadilly at the Gloucester coffee-house, I got down to have something to drink, he told me I had better go with him as I was going to Gerrad's Hall Inn, he was going great part of the way; I went on the coach again afterwards to the city, he then said as I did not know London we had better go together. As we was going along we went down St. James's Street and along Pall Mall, we came by a goldsmith's shop, I asked him if it was at this shop they bought guineas, he told me no, did I want to part with them, I told him if they gave as much as had been stated by the other coachman, I had no objection three and twenty shillings and sixpence he said, no, he would give me twenty-two shillings and sixpence, and as I was going to Gerrard's Hall Inn it would be nothing out of my way to go with him to the Swan and Two Necks, upon which I went with him to the Swan and Two Necks, I got off the box first, he told me to go into the parlour while he unhitched his horses, and he would come in directly, upon that I contrived to go out of the yard and brought an officer, the officer waited in a proper place. When I came back the prisoner was looking after me, he told me if I would go into the room he would be with me immediately, he asked me where I had been, I told him to have a run, I was so cold, I went into the room, called for a pint of porter, drank part of it, he went out in the yard and returned with the nine one-pound notes, the officer has the notes, I gave them to Chamberlain the officer, I gave the defendant eight guineas for the nine one-pound notes after he gave me the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these part of the guineas that were mark'd by Mr. Powell. - A. The same guineas, then Chamberlain took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in the coach with the prisoner. - A. I did, to the Compter, he said he thought me a friend, he did not think I would have served him so, I told him it was my duty, I was sent upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You went and left him in the yard, you gave him no change. - A. There was no change agreed upon.</p>
               <p>Q. So you tell us you did not mean to give any, you took your guineas and shook them for him to see them. - A. My hands was cold, I could not help it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you untend that he should see your guineas. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then you need not put upon me that your hands was cold. So you set out as a country farmer, with a silk handkerchief round your neck. - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150077"/>The same as I have on now.</p>

            . I am an officer of the city of London. On the 19th of September, about nine in the morning, Ruthwin desired me to go along with him; I went in a coach and waited at the corner of Lad-lane, he beckoned me and then I went to wait at the corner of the Swan and Two Necks gateway; I waited there a few minutes, Ruthwin came out of the office and said, here he is in the back office. He told me then it was for buying guineas; he desired me to take him in custody, he was my prisoner. I took him into custody and took him in a coach to the compter; Ruthwin went with me. Previous to the defendant's going in the coach Ruthwin said, I give you charge of this man for buying guineas, the defendant turned as pale as ashes and said, I thought you were my friend, you have taken me in, it is the first time I ever did such a thing in my life, and expressed a wish that it might be settled. I did not actually search him; he put his hand into his pocket at the Poultry Compter, and delivered to me eight guineas, I have had them ever since, and Ruthwin, in the presence of the prisoner gave me these nine pound notes; the prisoner acknowledged having paid the notes to Ruthwin. The defendant said he thought it very hard that he should be imposed upon in that way; Ruthwin said it was his duty, he was sent by the magistrate, and the solicitor of the Mint; he could not help it, he must do his duty.</p>

               <p>Q. You and your mistress were just returned from the country - A. Yes. I knew where they were always kept, and they were under my care; I put them in the drawers and gave my mistress the key, and when I returned I found the drawers broken open, and the things gone.</p>
