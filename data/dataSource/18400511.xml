On Monday, the 11th of Novem<lb/>ber, I and Sergeant Pocock had been watching the prisoner's house in Cro<lb/>mer-street, from eight o'clock—(he had been a policeman)—his wife came and looked continually at the street-door, and a little after nine o'clock I saw a man, who I believe to be the prisoner, go into the house with a basket—his wife was at the door, and they went in together—in a minute or two he came out, and crossed over from his lodging to the place where I and my brother officer were—seeing him coming, we ran away, and got down into a court to conceal ourselves—while I was going my brother officer said, "George, come back, there is no thoroughfare"—we then watched the prisoner—he went to his own door, and was talking to another man—he said, "Pocock and Collier are watching me, for I heard Pocock say, 'George, come back, there is no thoroughfare'"—the prisoner said, "They think I have got a swag to-night, but they shan't have it"—(a <hi rend="italic">swag</hi> means a quantity of stolen property)—he turned round, and went up Cromer-street, away from his lodgings—I and my brother officer consulted together, and went from there to Maiden-lane, Battle-bridge, we concealed ourselves behind a gate, and in ten minutes the prisoner's wife, Jemima Dorsett, passed us with a large bundle, nearly as much as she could carry, under her cloak—we watched her go into No. 22, Ashby-street, Somers-town—after washing about ten minutes, she came out without the bundle—I then stopped her—I went and searched the room, and found the bundle, containing all the articles stated—after coming from No. 22 to the corner of the street, I saw the prisoner and another man, named Lewis, (who has been tried and convicted,) in a court that leads to No. 22—I took Lewis, and the prisoner turned and ran away—I have been looking after him ever since—I took him on the 24th of April at Speenham Land, about half a mile from Newbary, in Berk<lb/>shire—I found on Lewis eleven skeleton keys, and one of them undoes the prosecutrix's door, and at the prisoner's lodging I found some more drop<lb/>latch keys and other keys.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to Lord Colchester. On Thursday, the 26th of March, the prisoner called at the house, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and said he wanted to know if the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping, and that he came from Mr. Tozer—I sent him to the housekeeper, who was in the kitchen—at night his lordship called me to take the lamp away—I went to bed at a quarter to twelve o'clock, leaving every thing safe—I was awoke about half-past four o'clock in the morning, by a violent ringing at the area-bell—I got up, found the prisoner there, and another man with him—I wished to know why he rang the bell so often and so violently—he said he was very busy, and had other places to go to—I let them in, and gave them a light—they went into the kitchen—I left them there—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I knew him well before—I went to my sleeping-room, which is immediately opposite the kitchen, and put on some of my things; I then went up stain to call the maids, then came down and went to bed—the gas light in the fanlight of the hall-door was burning at that time, and there is a window which throws a borrowed light from the passage on the fire-place—while I was in my room I heard somebody in the kitchen—I looked through the pantry window, which looks from my room</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184005110014"/>
               <p>into the kitchen, and saw one of the persons busy, apparently, before the fire-place, but only one of them; and while in my room I heard somebody go along the passage, which I supposed to be one of the maids—about half an hour after the prisoner came and knocked at my door, and said be wished to be let out, as I had locked the area-gate, and taken the key—I saw his companion in the area at that time—when I let them in they had an empty bag—when I let them out, I cannot precisely say which had the bag, but they had it with them, and it appeared to be fall—they wanted some beer, which I could not give them—I suspected nothing, and let them out—neither of the servants had come down stairs at the time I let them Out—nobody had an opportunity of coming into the kitchen except those two men—when I locked them out I went to bed, and remained there till half-past seven o'clock—I then went up to his lordship's dressing-room, which is on the ground-floor—the under house-maid gave me an alarm, and I then missed the silver ink-stand from his lordship's writing-table in the study, and a great-coat from a stand in the same room—I had seen them safe about eight o'clock the evening before—I also missed a pair of boots from the passage leading to the kitchen—they must have passed through that pas<lb/>sage to go out—in consequence of what was said afterwards, I examined the lower part of the chimney, but did not look up it sufficiently to say Whether it had been swept.</p>

About eight or ten days before the robbery the prisoner came to the house and asked me if the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping—I told him it did not, and when it did I would let Mr. Tozer know—I told him to ask Mr. Tozer if he could sweep the chimney with a machine, for it was Lady Colchester's wish that it should not be swept by the boys—he said, "Very well," and went away—on the day before the robbery he came again, and asked if the chimney wanted sweeping—I said it did, and asked if he had inquired of Mr. Tozer if he could sweep it with the machine—he said he had done so, and Mr. Tozer could not do it, unless Lady Colchester had two draft-holes made on the outside of the chimney—I told him the chimney smoked very much, and I would have it done by the boys in the morning—he asked at what time he should come—I said, "Half-past five o'clock"—I went down next morning at five o'clock, or twenty minutes after—the men had then gone—I found the kitchen-maid in my room—I looked at the kitchen chimney, and it had not been swept at all—I put a candle up, and opened all three of the flues, and there had been no soot taken from them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Somers-town, On this Saturday night, a little after eight o'clock, I was in Gordon-square—I saw two people endeavouring to get over the wall of Dr. Moore's house, one of them succeeded—one was the prisoner, he was the last, he had no shoes on, which attracted my attention—I asked him what was the matter, or words to that effect—he said, "I will have him," meaning he was pursuing the other one, who had got over and ran away—I followed him and called "Police," the prisoner immediately ran and jumped over a wall into an enclosure, which he ran across; I lost sight of him, I then went towards Euston-square and met the policeman and Collins—I told them I had seen the prisoner get over the enclosure, and then another officer took him.</p>

               <p>I was in Gordon-square, and saw the prisoner running with his shoes in his right hand—I attempted to take bold of him—he clambered up the wall about five feet—the descent on the other side was about fourteen feet—he jumped and fell—the policeman came up and got over the wall, then the prisoner started and another officer took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glover, and live at No. 27, Fleet-street, in the parish of St. Dunstan in the West.

I was passing Mr. Spoke's shop, about eight o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner, with two other persons—they passed me a short distance from the house—I saw the prisoner put his hand up to the side of one of the panes of glass, as if to cut the putty away—I mentioned it to three persons, and watched them—they all three stood together at the window, the prisoner being in the centre—I passed by, and saw the glass lying on the books, and saw the prisoner's arm inside—I went and seized him, called "Stop thief," and the other two were both taken—one knocked a person's hat off and escaped, the other was taken—I did not see the books outside the window, I only saw his arm inside—about five minutes elapsed between my seeing him scrape the putty and seizing him—his hand went into the window twice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cooper, and live at the Ten Bells public-house, Church-street, Spitalfields. On the 12th of April, about seven o'clock at night I was sitting in the tap-room; the prisoner came in partly tipsy, speak<lb/>ing</p>

I was present and saw the prisoner come in—he began talking about making nine days in a week, being a tee-total<lb/>ler, and paying three weeks' rent in advance, and boasting in a foolish way—the prosecutor said, plenty of people told lies without his help—that excited him, he instantly went to the fire-place, took the poker, jobbed it several times on the ground, and said if Smith would get up he would put his head where the poker was—he afterwards put ft back, called for a pot of porter, which he drank, and in about ten minutes went and seized the poker again, approached Smith, told him he would give it to him, and immediately struck him a blow on the head—it was a sort of side cut—it was certainly done on purpose—he immediately threw the poker back and ran out as fast as he could—Smith pulled off his hat, and the blood ran down his face—he went to get his wound dressed—we gave information at the station-house, and the prisoner was taken at the Duke's-head public-house, within two or three doors of the station-house—he had been drink<lb/>ing when he came in.</p>

The prosecutor's wound was about an inch and a half, or two inches long, it was quite a clean cut—a blunt instrument on that part of the scalp would produce a clean cut, if given with sufficient violence—I should say it would require violence to inflict such a wound—I did not see his hat.</p>

On Wed<lb/>nesday, the 22nd of April, about the middle of the day, the prisoner came, and inquired the price of a small dressing-case which was in the window—I told him—he asked me if I had any ladies' dressing-cases—I showed him what I had—he said they were too common, he wished some more expensive, mounted with silver—I said, when my father returned I would procure him some, and send them—he said, "Do," and gave me his card, with "No. 2, St. James-square," on it—he said I was to send them the following evening, about seven o'clock, as be could not decide on them himself; they were for the inspection of a lady who was coming from Windsor—he said if the lady approved of them, whatever was kept would be paid for—he said the gentleman's dressing-case was to be sent with the lady's, and also two pearl knives which he selected—they were all for the lady—I procured a lady's dressing-case, of the value of 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., fitted with silver, and a small mahogany gentleman's case, value 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I sent by my father, with the two knives, one of which was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner came again next day, and looked at some knives, forks, spoons, a pocket-book, and other things—he produced his own pocket-book—I saw what appeared to me some Bank-notes in it, and concluded that he was some foreign merchant, or something of that sort—on the Saturday he came again, and selected about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cutlery, but they were not sent in—he said die lady had not returned, that she was to come by the train—he did not say what train—he said he hoped I should let him have the best of cutlery, as he was particularly recommended to us on account of our good things, and he had no doubt the lady would be a good customer—all the articles were for the lady's inspection—I expected whatever the lady did not keep would be returned, or I should have the money paid down—that was the understanding, as he was a stranger to me—if it had not been for his representing that they were for the lady's approval I should not have parted with them without the money—I considered he would have decided at the time if they bad been for himself—I did not intend to sell them to him—I understood they were for the lady's inspection from the first.</p>

               <p>to No. 2, St. James's-square, on Thursday evening, the 23rd of April—I saw the prisoner there—he desired me to set them on the table, to let him see them—he said the lady had not arrived, but she would be sure to arrive on the morrow, and he must get me to leave them until then—he said she was coming from Windsor by the train—he looked at the things, and said he thought this dressing-case with silver might do—he then wished me good night—my daughter had given me a card with his address on it, and I saw a brass plate on the door, with "J. H. De Vries," I believe, on it—he said I was to call next day at two o'clock, as, no doubt, the lady would have arrived—I did so—he said she had not arrived, but she would, no doubt, arrive in the course of that afternoon, and I was to come again at six o'clock, by which time she would be there, and would be able to decide what she would keep—between four and five o'clock I went again with some more things—(he had been to the shop in the meantime)—he was not at home—a servant girl opened the door, and asked me if the things were for Mr. De Vries—I said they were, and she took them of me—as I was returning from the house, the prisoner hailed roe in the square—he was coming from Charles-street—he said it would be of no use coming that night, as the lady had not arrived, I must come next day about two o'clock, by that time it would be decided on, and whatever was kept I should have the money for—on the Saturday I went again, and saw him—he said he must trouble me to leave them till Monday, they could not be decided on before, as the lady bad not arrived—between Saturday and Monday I learnt something that made me suspicious.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and occupied the house, No. 2, St. James's-square, in April last. In February a person called on me for the purpose of taking it—in consequence of what that person said about a friend of his, the prisoner afterwards got possession of the house—he took possession on the 24th of March—he was to pay thirty guineas a month for the first three months, twenty-five guineas for the second three months, and twenty guineas for the last three months—he took it for nine months certain—I bad an indirect reference—he was at first rather offended that I should ask him for a reference—I said it was usual in England—he said, very well, he would refer me to a banker, a friend of his, in the City—he went away, and returned next day, saying the gentleman was not in town, but he would be in two days—he returned in two days, and again said the gentleman had not returned, and at length he got the house, because I depended on a former reference which I had from a friend of his, the gentleman who had called in February—the brass plate was put on the very day he came—di<lb/>rectly it was decided he measured the size for the brass plate, and in a few hours it was placed on the door—I cannot exactly tell how soon afterwards any goods came—it was about the latter end of that month—he asked me to recommend him a tailor, as he said his clothes were with his family, who were to bring them on the 1st of May—I did recommend him a tailor, but he was a ready-money tailor, and the prisoner declined having him—a great many parcels came to the house—on Friday, the 25th of March, I saw this dressing-case on the parlour table—I do not know when it came—it disappeared, 1 think, next day—I lived in the house—I let him the whole house, with the reservation of two rooms for myself—the first</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, carrying on business in Tottenham Court-road. The prisoner came into my service in March 1839—in September last he was paid by commission—he was to re<lb/>ceive a certain commission on the goods he sold for me—I have an order-book—I hare looked into it, with reference to some goods which be furnished to Mr. Creswell, a customer of ours, on the 9th of Sep<lb/>tember—it is in the prisoner's hand-writing—the goods were supplied—their amount was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not receive that 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the pri<lb/>soner—there is another entry on the 25th of September to John Wain<lb/>wright for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not receive that on the 1st of November—there is an order to Ashley for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he has not accounted to me for that—it was his duty to account to me every day, and in my absence, to Mrs. Davis—I dismissed him on the 23rd of November—I made no specific charge against him—he went over his accounts after that, on the 3rd of December—he would then have an opportunity of making up his accounts with me—he did not account to me for either of these sums.</p>

               <p>the reserves were to meet bad debts—if he introduced me to one of his old customers, and it turned out a bad debt, that would be deducted out of the commission to reimburse me for the money I had advanced—I bought all the stock he had—when we settled the commission, I allowed him for what had been bought—I was never in his debt for stock—he stated he had some little stock—I would not allow his doing business for me, and on his own account, but I had no objection to his bringing it—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first in advance, and the difference was paid from his commission—I had parted with the whole of that stock when he was dis<lb/>charged, with the exception of a few gridirons—he did not supply any thing to my customers from his own resources but once—that was some, glue to Mr. Paul—MR. Paul came to my house, and asked for his account—I made it out as 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "I have had some glue, I owe you more"—the prisoner said, "It is all right"—I supposed it had not been put down—I added it to the bill, and received it, supposing it was my own—when he was gone, the prisoner said, "It war a little, glue I had in my own stock"—it was what is called Scotch glue—I do not keep Scotch glue—I handed the amount to the prisoner, and forbid any thing more of the kind'—here is the entry in my book—I usually made the entries in the book—the prisoner made some, and Mrs. Davis made some—I have never had a dispute with the prisoner about coming to a set<lb/>tlement—a policeman was called in one night after the settlement, as the pri<lb/>soner behaved himself in a very abrupt manner, because I wanted a copy of the commission account—I called in the policeman for my own protection—I had a scuffle about the book in which he had the account of the commission kept—after I had settled his account, and made it up in his book, and he had given me an I O U for the. balance he owed me, I wished to have a copy of that account—he kept it in a book of his own—I insisted upon having it, and I caught hold of it—he had the book after giving me a copy—some months after that we went to Islington together, and some words took place—we had no quarrel—we did not part friends on that occasion—I kept a horse and gig, but we went with the prisoner's pony, as I had lent my horse—I understood a friend had lent the prisoner the pony—part of my harness was on the pony, and the other part was the prisoner's—he said a friend had lent it him to go round to the customer—he had to go to Hammersmith,. Clapham, Hounslow, and carious places wherever, he chose, with the gig—when we got to Islington that night, the prisoner was in a hurry, and said he wanted to go somewhere—I wanted to leave the gig at my brother's, and he role the pony, and left my gig—I took away the harness and the bridle, as they belonged to me—we had no words about the accounts—I think the prisoner called twice at my house alter he quitted me, to settle accounts—I am certain he did not call four or five times—I never beard of his calling after the 3rd of December.</p>

Davis has not claimed it, nor has the prisoner yet, he shall have it when he claims it—MR.

I have done nothing"—he then pro<lb/>duced this key, and said he had found it in the dust—I went to the bag, and found that a portion of the marked money had been restored, and was in the bag—this is it, but two half-crowns were gone out of it and ten shillings, the rest is in the bag now—this bag has never been out of my possession since—I had put the key of the chest into my pocket when I locked the bag up—the key the prisoner had was a false key.</p>

                  </hi>. I occasionally play the violin at Lawson's, the Hoop and Grapes public-house, in Whitechapel—the prisoner is a fiddler, and is quite blind. On Saturday, the 11th of April, I was at the Grapes between five and six o'clock in the evening—the deceased Richard Fleming was there—the prisoner came in, and was going away again, when Fleming told him he would be a pint to his pint—he then came back, and it was agreed to take a pot between them, but I cannot say which proposed tossing—they were both quite drunk—they tossed up—a dispute arose about it—the prisoner said he had won, and Fleming refused paying—the prisoner went to lay hold of him, but he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away—the prisoner had a dog which was fastened round his body—he unloosed him, and tied him to the leg of the table—he then went to lay hold of Fleming, and Fleming <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away—it was not a violent push—he laid hold of him at the corner of his jacket—there was a struggle—they pushed about from one side to the other—there was no blow struck—the deceased fell undermost—the prisoner kept hold of him when he fell—I did not observe whether he fell on him till the last—the prisoner helped him up, and appeared the more powerful man of the two—they did not leave go of each other till the landlord came—there were three falls, and all before the landlord came in, and Fleming was always undermost—the prisoner did not fall on him the second time, but the third time he fell on him with great force—his knees I believe struck him in the lower part of his stomach—that was in falling—I saw no blows or kicks given by either party—there were several tables in the room—I did not see whether they struck against a table—when the prisoner helped him up, he appeared hurt then, having his hand on the</p>

I recollect the scuffle between the prisoner and Fleming—I was not there when they tossed up—when I entered the room they stood by the fire very peaceable and quiet, and the boy, who carried the pot of beer in, stood waiting for money—the prisoner undid his dog, and fastened it to the table—Fleming asked the prisoner to pay for the pot of beer, as he had won it fairly, and then he attempted to leave the room—the prisoner felt for the collar of Fleming's coat—Fleming pushed him away—they caught hold of each other, and there was a struggle—I saw no blow struck by either—they fell three times—my master came in at the time of the second fall—the first time they fell on the table, not on the floor—the second time they fell on the floor, and the third time against the corner of the table, both of them together—Fleming went on to the seat, the table turned between them, and from there they both fell on the floor violently—Fleming in falling pulled the prisoner down with him—the prisoner was uppermost, and he fell with his knees on the deceased's stomach, I believe—after Fleming got up from the fall, he complained of being hurt—after that there was no more scuffling, but Fleming attempted to strike the prisoner, and a woman told him not to strike a blind man, that was after they got up from the second fall—they were both drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of John Johnson, a corn-dealer in William-street, Knightsbridge—he has a granary there—he does business in Thames-street—Crooks was in his service for three or four years, and Whiffen one year—they were carmen—they came at five o'clock in the morning—it was the custom to give orders to Crooks in the evening—I was present on the 9th of April, when my father gave him directions—there had been corn lost from the granary—I stationed myself, on the 10th of April, in the morning, in the lower granary—the corn was in the granary over my head—the prisoners both came about four o'clock—I was at the back of the hay, concealed—I could not see them come in, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184005110067"/>
               <p>I heard some one, and knew Crooks by a particular cough that he had—I then heard them go up stairs to an upper floor—I got on the top of the hay, and heard them up stairs for nearly a quarter of an hour—I heard them scuffling and stamping, and, as I imagined, dragging the sacks along the floor—I then saw Crooks come down the ladder, and go out into the yard—the sacks are lowered from the upper floor out of the window, by the hands—I saw four sacks descend, one after the other—I could not see who put them down, but I saw Crooks receive them, take them on his shoulder, and pitch them down in a cart—Whiffen then came down the ladder very cautiously indeed, and went out into the yard, and shut the granary door after him—I waited a little, and then went and spoke with my father—he got up and came down—I went out into the street, to stay a good way off, as I intended to follow the cart, and then I heard a noise of a cart, and thought they were gone—when I got out I met a policeman—I sent him to the yard—soon after that I saw my father, and saw Crooks running away across the road—the policeman followed him—Whiffen was there, and my father held his collar—I then came into the road where the cart stood—I examined it—there were four sacks in it full of oats laid n the bottom, carefully covered with the tarpaulin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor—the prisoners were in my employ.

He and old <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> had to go to a wharf to load these oats—Whiffen had no business to attend Crooks that morning—his duty was to cart corn in our neighbourhood—he had a horse and cart for that purpose quite distinct from Crooks—it was kept in the yard at Knightsbridge, and Crooks's were kept in Williams's mews—neither of them had any direction to take any corn from my premises the next morning—Crooks would have to take sacks—on the morning of the 10th I was awoke by my son—he told me something, and I came down—I went into the yard when I found Crooks had got his horse from Williams's mews, and placed it in the cart—he was about to go out of the yard, and Whiffen was standing there doing nothing—the gates were open—my son was with me—he did not go into the yard—I let him out at my private door—I said to Crooks, "I think I am up a little before my time, but I see you are going to start earlier, as it was my wish"—he said, "Yes, but I have not got my sacks"—I said, "You had better put them in"—he then put in about twenty empty sacks—I had observed nothing in the cart at that time—he did not tell me he bad anything—he then shuffled about and said, "Oh, master, I have lost my notice, I have lost my order"—he drew his cart out into the middle of the road, while I went, as he supposed, to write fresh orders—with that a policeman came up, and spoke to me—I seized Whiffin and told the policeman to seize Crooks—Crooks immediately dropped his whip, and ran as fast as he could up a court, and over the park wall, and the policeman after him—he returned in about a quarter of an hour, bringing Crooks back in custody—during that time I kept Whiffen—I searched the cart, and four sacks of oats were found in it, covered over very carefully with a tarpaulin—they were worth from 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not desired Crooks to start earlier than usual that morning—we wished him to start</p>

               <p>about half-past five o'clock—neither of the prisoners would have authority to take that quantity of oats from my granary—the first thing they had to do was to deliver twenty quarters of corn from Wheat Sheaf wharf.</p>

The prisoner Herbert was in my service—I had missed something—my daughter spoke to her, and she produced from her pocket a duplicate of this shawl—she said the shawl belonged to herself—my daughter said she had lost several things, and she suspected it was hers—I went the next morning to the pawn-broker's, and saw it, and it was my daughter's—this is it—my daughter's, name is Frances—she is twenty-two years old—I told my daughter to get up early the next morning, which she did—a ring came at the door, and my daughter opened it—I was up, and the prisoner Clarke came in—she was rather surprised to see us up so early—I asked what business she had' to come so early—she said she was bringing some things for her niece (Herbert)—I said I had been robbed of a gold watch, and some other things, and that a duplicate of a shawl had been found—I showed her the duplicate—she said it belonged to her, and she had a right to do as she pleased with her own property—I allowed her to go away—when I had seen the shawl at the pawnbroker's I sent for her again, told her I had seen the shawl, and it belonged to my daughter—she then turned to Herbert, and said, "How could you give me your master's things to pawn?"—they were then taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy warehouse-keeper at the St. Katharine's Docks. I belong to the warehouse letter D, where consign<lb/>ments of hemp are deposited—a person named Allen is employed in the Docks—I remember on the 24th of March receiving, an order to deliver four tons of half-clean hemp from a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Thetis</hi>—I received the order from our warehouse-office, and it appears by an indorsement on the order that two tons, two quarters, and ten pounds had been delivered—on the 24th of March, in the afternoon, I saw both the prisoners—I saw the prisoner Baker first—he came to our office for the delivery of the remainder of the four tons of hemp—in turning over the orders Baker pointed out this as his, and told me he had previously taken away about two tons, or a little more—I told him there were nearly two tons to give, or about one ton nineteen cwts.—he said that was right—I then directed that the order should be placed in the hands of Radford, who was a foreman—I believe 1 gave it to one of his men—I gave positive orders that it should be placed in his hand, but I did not see it in his hand—when an order of this kind is given, the foreman enters it in his delivery-book—I find Radford has entered on the 24th of March, to weigh and load, to Baker's own wagon, 39cwts. 1qr. 18lbs.—on the deli<lb/>very of this order to Radford it was his duty to go to the floor where the hemp was, to take his gang of men with him to see that the scale was cor<lb/>rect, cause his men to place the weights in the scale, and see that the proper quantity of hemp was weighed and delivered, and to enter it in his book—the order was sent to the office, at ten minutes before four o'clock, with the indorsement on it—the delivery-book was placed in at the same time, and the pass, which would enable the party to leave the Docks—the pass is in Radford's writing—I had given particular directions to Allen that day, and on the following morning, the 25th of March, I received a communication from him—the value of three cwts. of hemp is between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the parties attend the weighing for the merchant, to see</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the D warehouse of St. Katharine's Docks. On the 24th of March I attended the weighing of some hemp for Mr. Baker, the prisoner's father—it was part of the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Thetis</hi>—I was particularly attentive to what was done, and took a memorandum of it in writing by direction of my officer—the two prisoners were present at the deli<lb/>very—they both came close to the scale when the draught was called, and counted the weights—22cwt 1qr. 71bs. was in the scale on the first deli<lb/>very, and 22cwt. 1qr. 5lbs. was booked, allowing 2lbs. for the draft—the weight was called out in a loud and distinct voice, and Radford must have heard it from the position he was in—he was about nine feet from the scale when I called the weight—there was nothing between us—when the weight was struck I was assisting in discharging the hemp, and the fore<lb/>man (Radford) called out, "What was the draught, did it take the half or the quarter," meaning the 1/2 cwt or 1/4 cwt., and the answer was, "22cwt. 1qr. 5lbs. to book"—that was the second time it was called out—Baker was then present—when the hemp was discharged a man named Ryland hove it out at the loop-hole—I then saw the other draught weighed, and that was 20cwt. 0qr. 15lbs., and 20cwt. 0qr. 13lbs. to book—I heard Radford call out, "I want 20cwt. 0qr. 131bs. clear of every thing"—that I most solemnly swear, because I heard it—I took a memorandum of the second weight as well as the first in pencil directly, and inked it afterwards—I delivered the paper to Mr. Landy the next morning—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did not know at the time this was weighed whether it was wrong or right, as I had not possession of the order.</p>

On the evening of the 22nd of April, I was employed in sorting letters at the office, and so was he—he is a sorter when he is in the office—he sorts for the South Western division—he was sorting there that evening, and I observed when he came to one letter he took particular notice of it—he felt it, and did not place it in the box before him—(there were seven boxes before him for the different divisions)—instead of placing it in one of them, he placed it underneath the other letters—he then sorted into the different boxes till he got to that letter again, and then he took up other letters and placed on the top of it a second time—when he had sorted them into the different walks, he took this letter to his own desk—I had suspicion that the letter did not belong to his walk, and I informed Mr. Gapes, the Inspector—he went to him in a short time, when he was about to leave the office, and asked him for his bag and letters—he took his bag and letters, and out of his bag Mr. Gapes took two letters and an ac<lb/>count-book—one letter was much less than the other—I should know the letters which were taken out of the bag—I should not be able to recognize the letter he took to his own desk—not by the direction—I noticed the two letters that were taken out of the bag, and read the address of one—it was, "Mr. Seymour, gold-beater, Long Acre"—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—this is it, and I believe it to be the letter which he put behind the others—MR.

Mr. Pope kept an account at our house—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) was presented at our house on the 4th of March, 1837—I cannot say that I recollect the person who presented it—I paid the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which it is drawn—this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 5128, dated 15th De<lb/>cember, 1836, is one of the notes I paid; and this 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 8132, dated 27th January, 1837, was also paid at that time—here is one name written on each note of a customer of the bank—on the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note there is also something like the name of Alcock, and on the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note also—this 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 8133, dated 27th January, 1837, is also one of the notes that was paid.</p>

Pope has been a customer of Messrs. Wright perhaps two or three years, but I do not know—I have paid some cheques of his, not many—he has not been in the habit of drawing many—I have paid cheques in favour of Alcock—I should say, one or two, from memory—I thought this to be Mr. Pope's writing, or I should not have paid it—I think now that there is a great similarity, so much as induced me to pay it—I should say it was Mr. Pope's writing certainly from the similarity of the character in general, without close inspection, but when I have Mr. Pope's own cheques put before me, and compare it, it is a different thing—there is then a dis<lb/>crepancy—I believe it is usual for Mr. Pope to have the name of the banker in a different handwriting to the other part of the cheque—I do not recollect whether it was a man, woman, or child, I paid the money to—I have the numbers and dates of the notes entered in my book—I entered them when I paid them away, and have the books here.</p>

Pope said, in his presence, that he had obtained 495<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner promised to repay it—he never did repay it, to my knowledge—in March, the same year, I was deputed by Wrights, the bankers, and other persons, to go to France—I found the prisoner at Paris, and had con<lb/>versations with him on the subject of his affairs, and the claims against him.</p>

Wright, Pope, and Latchford—the forgery of this cheque had been discovered, and on seeing the prisoner I represented what I came about—I told him I was desirous of getting back some of the money he had taken away with him—he said he had none—I asked him what he had done with the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he had got by forging Mr. Pope's name, at Wright's—he gave me some details, which I wrote on the back of a letter, in pencil—this is the memoran<lb/>dum I made—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he said he had sent 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Milward, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Whitehouse, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mrs. Alcock, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Ferrell, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Emmett, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the Thatched-tavern, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to things pledged—that amounts to 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not remember that he gave me any further account—I returned to England, leaving him there—I saw him again on the 14th of April, this year, in Cateaton-street, City—I said, "Is that you, Alcock?"—he said, "How do you do Mr. Crosby?"—I said, "I want you to go with me to Messrs. Wright's"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "About the forgery"—he said he would not go—I then asked him to go to Mr. Latchford's—he said he would not go there—I told him if he did not go to one place or the other with me, I would give him in charge of a policeman—he then walked away—I followed him, and again persuaded him to go to Wright's or Latchford's, but he declined doing so—at last he said he would, but he walked in a contrary direction—and as I saw he did not intend to go, I gave him into charge of a policeman in Moorgate-street—he said I I could not give him in charge, I had no warrant—the policeman took him to Cripplegate station-house, where I stated the charge—he said first of all, "Now pray, Mr. Crosby, let me go with you to Latchford's or to Wright's; pray let me go"—he did not say that aloud—I told him I could</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who is Mr. Latchford? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A bitmaker, in St. Martin's lane—I looked to the fund for the costs in this Chancery suit—there was a fund in the hands of the solicitor to the Treasury—I believe it was not in Court—there is an old suit of Wilding and Boulden—there was a portion of the estate of a man named Laurence, who died intestate in America—the solicitor to the Crown had obtained administration, and it is for the recovery of that and other property the suit is—they talked of a large sum—I believe there is about 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the hands of Mr. Maule—I was employed to take my share in the transaction, by some old people named Wilkinson, of whom the prisoner is either nephew or grandson—he brought me their retainers—that was very likely at my instance—he was a client of mine in the action, but I did not consider him so in any other respect—I viewed him as the agent of the parties in the suit—he was so mixed up with the suit, and the result of it, that I considered him as one of my clients certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to be employed by Messrs. Wright to go to France, was it at their instance, or at yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I can scarcely tell you—I never knew Messrs. Wright prior to the transaction—I went to them—I should think I applied to them to act on their behalf when I got to France—I have no doubt of it—my object was not to take the man into custody, it was to get some of the money back—I intended to have brought him back here—my object was to get the money, and to take him into custody—the first time I saw him in France he was in custody—I told him my object was to put him into custody, and then I asked him about the forged order—I said I wanted to know what he had done with the money ob<lb/>tained from Messrs. Wright, by forging Mr. Pope's name, and then he gave me the account I have stated—that remark was preceded by the statement that I intended to give him into custody—I did not put him into custody there—I was the medium by which he was put into custody—I had taken with me his acceptance in favour of Latchford, and went to France, to ascertain what could be done with him, whether he could be sent to England or not—and under the advice of a French <hi rend="italic">avocat</hi> I en<lb/>dorsed the bill to a Frenchman, who took proceedings against him, and had him arrested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You put your name to it, in order that the Frenchman to whom he owed nothing might arrest him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, to get back the money he owed Latchford—I did not go on with the suit after he left—I have a brother—I know there were dealings between him and the prisoner—I never knew the prisoner had made advances to him—I do not know that he owed him money—my brother went to India in May 1837, and is now a partner in one of the first houses of Calcutta—the prisoner went to France in March 1837—I am not acquainted with the friends and connexions of Mr. Pope</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184005110085"/>
               <p>—I have no witness from Redditch to tell whose hand-writing the cheque is—I am not the attorney for this prosecution—Messrs. Wright asked me to take it into my hands—they put it into the hands of Mr. Humphries—I am not in any respect acting professionally in it—I did not expect the pri<lb/>soner was in England when I saw him in Cateaton-street—I do not know how long he was in prison at the suit of the Frenchman, but I think from information sent me from Paris that he was in prison two years—I think I never saw him write except in my office—that was not on the subject mat<lb/>ter of the suit—I think it was on the subject matter of Mr. Pope's money, as it turns out.</p>

Surely, sir, after all the suffering I have endured, you will not, with this Crosby, to try to inflict any thing further. You must received them humble and heart-rending letters which I have written you, one after the other in succession, in which you have read over the full details of my sufferings in France; and now I have scarcely held up my head; I am locked up in a prison here. Oh, I hope Almighty God will so operate on your feelings, that you shall be induced to act the merciful part. I need not remind you, that your Lord and Master Jesus Christ observed to St. Peter, "Yea, seventy and seven you must for<lb/>give. "And in my present siuation I have nothing; and if you could ever so much punish me, would you be better? No. The Lord move your heart the right way; and should I keep paying you till I die, and then be deficient, may He, in his goodness, make it up to you, and restore abund<lb/>ance of his mercies to your person in this world and the world to come. Amen, is my prayer.</p>

There is one thing in my favour, that is, your money has been got from me, and I can prove it; therefore, you had ought the sooner to show me pity, after all my sufferings. I must leave it with God and yourself. If you come up here, they will force you into things you would regret. If you keep away, there is no compulsion, and it may be Mr. Crosby will bring you into something to make claims on you.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Chalfont St. Peter's, near Uxbridge. In January I was carman to Mr. Richard Hatch, and on the 10th of January I went to town with the prisoner Hazell, with a load and a half of hay—master allowed me two trusses of hay to feed the horses with—we took two that journey for the horses—on coming back we stopped at the Coach and Horses public-house at Ealing, about two o'clock in the day, and put the horses in, that they should have their hay which my master allowed—went into the public-house to have a pint of beer, and while there I saw Hazell take a truss of hay off the wagon, and carry it into the stable to Shackell—I went to the stable on purpose to untie the truss of hay to give the horses some—Shackell prevented me from touching it, and said, "That is my hay"—I said, "How came it your hay?"—he said, "I have bought that truss of hay of John Hazell"—I went and fetched Hazell to Shackell, and said, "Hazell, have you sold this truss of hay?"—he said, "Yes, it is all right"—while I was talking to him, Shackell took the hay up and carried it from that stable to another—I said, "We have got nothing to feed the horses, I shall put them to and get on the road home"—I did so, and went back to Chalfont—the horses seemed distressed before they got home for want of it—as we went home Hazell said the horses looked thin—that was the first time I had gone to town with the wagon—I left Mr. Hatch's employ the last day of March—I came back on the 18th of April—I did not tell him of this, as he did not ask me about it when I came back—I went up with the wagon the next week, and six or seven weeks after—I knew this was not right.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Sebastian Garrard and Co., silversmiths in the Haymarket. The prisoner was in our employ—we have from day to day a quantity of silver filings accumulated—my atten<lb/>tion was called on several occasions to a deficiency in the filings, in reference to the business done, and on Wednesday the prisoner was given in charge—when I came to business in the morning, he told me he was very sorry for what had happened, and if I would forgive him, nothing of the sort should happen again—I had made him no promise—none of the servants have permission to take the silver filings—I lost 1200 ounces last year.</p>

I was in the prosecutor's service—there had been silver filings missing—there are about eighty persons in the employ—none of the servants have the privilege of having the silver filings. On Tuesday, May the 12th, I saw the prisoner go up to Mr. Hearn's shop-door, in Jerusalem-passage—directly he saw me he retired from it—my suspicions were aroused, and I concealed myself under a public-house window, nearly opposite Mr. Hearn's shop—the prisoner caught sight of me, and retired—in about half-an-hour I saw him come out of the house where I lodged, which is just by Jerusalem-passage—he beckoned roe out of the house—I followed him into the street, and he said to me,' What is the matter?"—I pretended I did not know what he meant—he said,' You have been into the passage'—I said,' And so have you, with two ounces and eighteen dwts. of silver'—(I had in the mean time made inquiry at Hearns's)—he said,' I have," and begged and prayed of me not to make it known to my employers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and live in High-street, Row. About two months ago I purchased three or four chaldrons of cinders and ashes mixed together, and placed them at the back of some stables, against the mills, in Marsh-gate-lane, Stratford—I missed some little lots in about three weeks—on the 14th of April, a little after six o'clock in the morning, I missed two loads, worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and found some strewed all about—then was no other heap, of that same sort of dust, in the neighbourhood, to my knowledge—I have often seen the prisoner about, and I have seen him at the place where the officer found him—he was in the habit of carting greens, and lately I have seen him carting dust, with a blind horse—I had seen the heap safe about a quarter-past eight o'clock on the Monday night—I never gave him authority to go to my place and take ashes.</p>

On the 13th of May, a few minutes after eight o'clock in the morning, I had occasion to take a pail from the shop into the yard—I left a little child about five years old standing at the shop-door—I returned in one or two minutes, and found the prisoner in the shop, standing close to the door—he asked if we had any split rings for sale—I showed him some—he purchased one for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and went away without waiting to have it put in paper—I then looked, and missed several rings from a glass case near the window—I went out, and overtook him on the road to London, laid hold of him, and said he must come with me—he said, "What for?"—I said he would see what for—he then said he had got nothing, and knew nothing—I told him be must come with me—we were going towards my brother's shop—a neighbor saw me, and walked on the other side of him—we endeavoured to procure a policeman, but could not—I took him to a neighbour's shop, and waited a quarter of an hour, but could not get a policeman—we then intended to take him to my brother's shop, and on the road he attempted to escape—he said we had not got him yet, and tried to wrestle his arm out of my hand—we took him to my brother's shop with assistance, and told him to sit down on a chair, to wait till the policeman came—the chair was about two yards from where I had missed the rings—he sat down, put his right hand in his trowsers pocket, drew it out, and put both hands together—he then stretched out his left hand, and I saw him put these gold rings into a drawer—it was the drawer which I had previously taken the split ring out of which he bought—that drawer was between two and three yards from the one from which these were taken—I distinctly saw him do it, and instantly exclaimed, "I saw you put them down, there they are"—at that moment the policeman came into the shop, and I gave him into custody—I believe my sister gave the policeman the rings, but I am not certain—I believe the rings he has to be the same—when the prisoner put them down, some were strung on a piece of paper, and some were loose—I know them by the pattern to be what were missing, but I could not closely examine them—the drawer laid on the counter at the time he put them in—I did not take them in my hand, but by looking at them in the drawer, I could be certain they were our rings—I know one by the pattern of it, and I ob<lb/>served that, before they were moved from the drawer to be given to the policeman—I find that one here, it has a black rim round it—I had seen the rings the night before, when I closed the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Richard Hughes And Fred<lb/>erick Guy, proprietors of Vauxhall gardens. I had seen this lead on the engine-house and stables before the 18th of March—I went to the premises after the 18th, and it was gone—there were footsteps on the premises, and the lead had been jagged and taken away by violence—on the 21st a shoe was sent over by a policeman, which I examined with the footsteps, and it corresponded exactly with the nails in number and in the site of the shoe—the lead was supposed to be taken on the 16th or 17th—some lead had been produced which I think was the lead—it was the same quality of lead and had the same marks as regards the flushing—I hare compared it with the rest on the roof, and it corresponds.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Trinity-square, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. On the night of the 30th of April I went to bed about eleven o'clock—my wife and the servants went up to bed at the same time—I saw the house safe—I saw the parlour shutters closed and bolted—I was not well in the night, and could not sleep—before three o'clock I heard a noise which I thought was in my neighbour's house, but on listening, there appeared a sound up my stairs—I got out of bed, lighted a candle, and went down stairs—I am certain it was before four o'clock—I think it was about three o'clock—I heard the clock strike four afterwards—on coming to the stair case before the parlour I found the back doors all open—I stood there a little time and listened, and distinctly heard persons in the house—I put my ear to the parlour door and heard two persons speak<lb/>ing in the parlour—I had the candle in my right hand—I put it into my left, took hold of the handle of the door, threw it open with violence, put the candle inside and saw the two prisoners—I immediately seized Calcott, and gave an alarm directly—in turning to the window I saw a policeman jump</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184005110143"/>
               <p>over my Wall—the very instant I took hold of Calcott, Douglas saw the policeman, and said, "Sir, I surrender"—I found a snuff-box which I had left on the mantel-piece the last thing, moved on to the table, a silver bucket which is an ornament moved from the shelf on to the table, and my spec<lb/>tacles moved from the back room on to the table—those were the only things I found moved in the room—I found nothing on the prisoners.</p>

The prisoner came to my place previous to September last, add saw my servant—I was out of town—he came again when I returned from the country, and on one occasion I saw him—I had known him many years—he used to live at Osborne's Commission-stable, in Gray's Inn-lane—he was ostler there—I wanted to dispose of my horse—two or three weeks before the 18th of September he came, and said he understood I had a horse I Wished to dispose of, and if I would allow him to show it he would bring me a customer—he rode a horse there, which he said was his—he left that, and took away mine—he was absent about two or three hours—he then brought it back, and said he could not see the gentleman, and took away his own horse—he came again some days after<lb/>wards on another horse, which he said was his own—he left that, and took away my horse to show the gentleman—he brought it back in a few hours, and took away the one he had ridden—on the 18th of September he came again, and said he knew a wood-merchant at Deptford who wanted a horse,</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener to William White, of Upper Tulse-hill, in the parish of Streatham. I was at work on the back-lawn on Thurs<lb/>day, the 30th of April, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, and saw a person drop off the porch over the kitchen-door, and heard the glass break belonging to the porch—I called to my son <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> to run to the front-gate—I also ran, and saw the prisoner go out of the carriage-gate—he turned his head aside before he got to the gate, and I saw curls at the back of his ear—I did not hear him say any thing—I followed him—he turned to the left, towards Brixton—I followed him about two hundred and fifty yards, and in turning the corner, I saw him take a parcel from under his coat and throw it down on the walk—I still followed him a hundred and eighty yards, leaving my boy to pick the property up—he got over into a back<lb/>garden, and was caught in my sight—I swear he is the man—I lost sight of him for about a hundred and eighty yards, while he passed through Mr. Marshall's garden, but that was the only time—I saw him go into Mr. Marshall's garden, but did not see him come out—I returned a short way back into the road, and saw him, with his coat off, on the road—I had</p>

On Monday night, the 20th of April, I heard an alarm between ten and eleven o'clock, as near as I can guess—I was in my bed cabin—I got up, went on deck, and saw the prisoner striking at Combes with the axe—Combes was all over blood—I assisted in securing the prisoner—I went forward after I secured him, and found the forescuttle fastened with a nail—that would keep the men below—this is the knife and the axe—there was one prisoner in the fore part of the vessel, and one man and a boy belonging to the vessel, besides that there was me and Combes and the master, and there was another man on deck at the Captain's watch—there were three people on deck at the time—the other man was forward looking out—he was afraid to come aft in the scuffle—the captain was cut, and his skull broken in—he it not able to be removed at present—Combes was much hurt.</p>
