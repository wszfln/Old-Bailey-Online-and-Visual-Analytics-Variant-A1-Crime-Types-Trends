                  </hi>. I am an attendant at Hampton Court Palace. It is my duty to attend in the withdrawing room—that is a place where articles are placed, to see which the public are admitted by permission of the Queen—there is a model in that room of the Palace of Moorshelabad at Bengal—it is very large—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a drawing</hi>) this correctly represents the rear and portico of it—it is an object of curiosity, and is kept there as such—on 20th Aug., between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in a small room adjoining the withdrawing room, having my dinner—I heard some footsteps in the withdrawing room, and opened the door—I had a very good sight of the model—I saw only one person near it; that was the prisoner—he walked up to the model, and put his hand on a piece of the wire which represents the balcony railing of the palace, and felt it—he took his hand off, and then put it on again directly, and pulled the piece of wire</p>

               <p>from between the columns, and put it into Ms pocket—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was between four and five feet from the ground—his arm was about level with it—he put it into his pocket, and walked away—I put on my hat, and walked quickly after him—he went down the stairs, into the quadrangle before I overtook him—he walked down by himself—there was no person with him—there were some persons talking to him—I stopped him in the yard, and told him I wanted him—he said, "What for?"—I said, "For breaking a piece of the railing off the model; you have got it in your pocket; give it to me; if you don't, I shall take it from you"—he put his hand into his pocket, took it out, and said, "Is this it?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I found it lying on the boards"—I said he must go before the superintendent of the Palace, I had nothing more to do with it—he was then given into custody—I am sure this piece of wire was not lying on the boards; it was fastened to the model, and was torn from it—the prisoner appeared to have been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Lockett, who keeps a lace and ribbon shop, at No. 58, St. Paul's-churchyard—last Saturday week, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, the female prisoner came in and asked for some brown ribbon; she bought one yard, value 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one yard of other ribbon, value 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I showed her a number of boxes of ribbon, but she went away without buying any more—in putting the boxes away a minute or two afterwards, I saw that there was a space in one of the boxes which I had shown to her, and missed a piece of ribbon—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I received it from the policeman—here is the private mark on it—here are six or seven yards of it—there was also an empty space in one of the other boxes, but I cannot swear to this other piece of ribbon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as there is no mark on it.</p>

I am a stock broker in Token House-yard In May last year I was at Bank Chambers—on 1 6th May the prisoner was in my employ—on his receiving money on my behalf, it was his duty to bring it to me daily—on 16th May, I received several sums which the prisoner had collected for me—amongst others I had four sums as having been received from Mr. Mossop; 139<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 418<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he did not give me any particulars what they were for—there was a running account with Mr. Mossop, and that balance he would have to pay that day—T had been away some time, and had only come home a day or two at that time—if these were cheques, I gave them to the prisoner to pay into the bank; if they were notes or gold, I should pay them in myself—it is all entered as cash—I have no doubt they were not gold, from the amounts being uneven—I cannot say whether they were gold or not—I have the entry in this book in my own writing, and here is a book made up by the prisoner which is a correct copy of my own book—the prisoner only paid me that day 418<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he left me the beginning of July.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of the <hi rend="italic">Air</hi> schooner, lying off Wool Quay. I was in a public house in Tower-street on the night before I went before the Magistrate—it was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I had a glass of rum—I was perfectly sober—I met with the two prisoners and another, in the public house—the other went away—the prisoners stopped there—I was just done drinking the glass of rum when I got into conversa<lb/>tion with them, and we went to a coffee shop and had a cup of coffee apiece—I paid for it—I took my purse out of my pocket, and gave the woman half a crown to pay for my coffee—there was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in that purse, and I had changed two sovereigns that day—I should say there was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd in it—after I had put the change in, I put the purse into my trowsers pocket—the prisoners were sitting at the table drinking their coffee—Fitzpatrick then left the other one, and came and sat down close by me—she had not been sitting there a minute before she pulled the purse out of my pocket, and both of them <hi rend="italic">whipped</hi> out of the house—as soon as I saw they jumped up and ran out of the house, I thought there was something the matter—I put my hand to my pocket, and my purse was gone—I ran out after them, I made a jump, and should have caught them, but my foot caught and I fell—I am positive that Fitzpatrick took my purse, the other was not near enough to get it—one was at one end of the table, and the other at the other—my purse was in my left pocket—she came and sat close alongside of me—she had been sitting on the right side, and she came and sat close by my side, and took my purse—there was no one else in the room—I fell down, and that enabled them to get away—I lost sight of them after that—this happened on Thursday night—I saw them again in the police station on Saturday—I should say I was with them an hour and a half, or there<lb/>abouts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am not in any profession, and live upon my property at East Sheen, in the county of Surrey. In June, 1854, I attended at No. 11, Waterloo-place for the purpose of making an advance of money—Mr. Kirby acted as my agent in the matter—I believe he is a conveyancer—on that occasion I saw Mr. Coape and Mr. King at Mr. Kirby's office—No. 11, Waterloo-place is Mr. Kirby's office, it is the office of the Albert Assurance Company—on that occasion Coape and King executed a deed—after the execution of certain deeds, I paid over 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. King by direction of Mr. Coape—there was conversation, but no fact strikes me par<lb/>ticularly—Mr. King was talking, Mr. Coape was talking, but nothing that I am aware of that bears upon this question—I paid over the money upon Mr. Kirby's advice, ho acted entirely—I was relying entirely upon Mr.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Kirby, his office is at the Albert Insur<lb/>ance Office, Waterloo-place. He is a conveyancer—I am the subscribing witness to this deed—the parties to it are James Ewesby King of the first part, Henry Coe Coape of the second part, Henry Porter Smith of the third part, and George Goldsmith Kirby of the fourth part—it is dated 3rd June, 1854—(<hi rend="italic">The deed was put in and read in part; it recited the will of Henry Coape, Esq., the father of the defendant, by which it appeared that certain lands therein named were bequeathed to the defendant with other property, which lands were assigned to Mr. Smith, as security for the advance in question</hi>).</p>

               <p>Coape—I do not think any body else was present—Mr. Smith and Sir John Wilson were in the room at the time of completing it, but I think not during the reading of the deed; it occupied, I should think, nearly two hours altogether—a warrant of attorney was also executed at the same time—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was executed by Mr. Coape and Mr. King—Mr. Rogers acted as the solicitor for Mr. Coape, in the execution of that warrant of attorney—there was also a statutory declaration made by Mr. Coape—the filling in of the amount of rents is in my writing, and the residence of Mr. Coape at the commencement—the other parts of the writing, I think, was done by the stationer's clerk—I did not fill in the names—in the sentence, "And I further declare that each of the heredita<lb/>ments are of the annual value of 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>", the words 1,300 are in my writing, and also the 1,700 as the annual value of the life estates—I drew the declaration, leaving the sums blank, for the purpose of obtaining them—I cannot say whether I handed it to Mr. Rogers to get the information, or whether I obtained it from Mr. Coape direct—it was either from Mr. Rogers or Mr. Coape—I obtained the information in the room during that two hours' interview, at the time of completion—it was declared at the time—the declaration was handed by me to the parties to read over and give the information, and no doubt it was read over.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185509170014"/>
               <p>King required the money—I do not know that it was said he had debts of honour—Mr. Rogers, I believe, supplied Mr. Kirby with the chief part of the information for the bond—when Mr. Kirby required information, he wrote to Mr. Rogers for it—I went down to Maldon, in Essex, in May—I went to make inquiry upon the subject of the allegations contained in the deed—I went with the agent of the Albert Insurance-office, just to check the statement of the parties—the negotiation for this loan had begun in February.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The names of all the farms had been given to you, and you were directed, were you not, to go down into Essex to make inquiry upon the subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not precisely so—a copy of the will was obtained by us, and I was directed to go to the agent of the Assurance Company, and ask him if his knowledge permitted him to say that Mr. Coape had property to that extent—I went to make inquiries—it was not my duty to make fall inquiries upon the subject—it was my duty to ask the agent of the Company to whom I was directed, whether he knew Mr. Coape, and whether he was known to be a person of property in that neighbourhood—I was not sent to ascertain the value of these securities, it was to ascertain whether it was known that Mr. Coape was a gentleman of property there—whether it was a fiction or not whether he really had property there—I should say that Mr. Coape did not know that the inquiries were made, till afterwards; he knew, at the time he signed the deed, that I had made the inquiry—Mr. Smith had been a client of Mr. Kirby for some years—I can scarcely say for what purpose he was employed by Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the least doubt in the world that it was your duty to make inquiries on the subject of the property, and that you grossly neglected your duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did what I was directed to do, and no more and no less—all my instructions were to go to the agent of the Assurance Company—Mr. Kirby directed me merely to go to the agent of the Assurance Com<lb/>pany, and I performed the duty imposed upon me—I was not directed to go round to the farms—they were not in the immediate orbit—I was informed that they lay in various directions, and that certain parts of the river or sea would prevent my getting at them—I do not know how much Mr. Kirby got for his advice and assistance to Mr. Smith in this matter—I have heard, of course—I believe it was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not receive the money, but I have heard in the office that it was 200 guineas in each case—that would be 400 guineas—I do not know whether Mr. Rogers got the same—I do not know what he got—various inquiries were made at the Tithe Commutation Office, and a copy of the will was bespoke at Doctors' Com<lb/>mons, and the stamps,' I think, you will find amount to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Kirby paid for the stamps—we made all the inquiries that we thought necessary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing director of the Albert In<lb/>surance Company, at No. 11, Waterloo-place. I am also a conveyancer—that office was established in 1838—I have been connected with it during the whole of that time—there are nine directors including myself—I know Mr. Rogers, a solicitor—in Feb. 1854, an application was made to mo by Mr. Rogers, with respect to a loan of from 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as stated in this memorandum—I received this paper from Mr. Rogers, or Mr. Allen—Mr. Allen is connected with Mr. Rogers in procuring loans—in consequence of what was stated to me in reference to this loan, I procured an official extract from the will of the late Mr. Coape, the defendant's father—I know Mr. King—I saw him some three or four times during the negotiation for this loan—I had several letters from Mr. King to Mr. Rogers handed to me, and I have had one at least from Mr. King myself, if not more—Mr. King wrote to Mr. Rogers a letter that was handed to me, and one letter I had direct from Mr. King—I arranged with Mr. Rogers for the advance of 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Mr. Smith, and 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Sir John Wilson—I saw Mr. Coape, on passing by him in my own office, ten days before this business was completed, but did not speak to him; and then on the day of its com<lb/>pletion, he was in my clerk's office with Mr. King and Mr. Rogers, but I had no conversation with him on that day—the Albert Company advanced 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon that day, or the day before, nominally for a month, upon the understanding that it was to be repaid upon the completion of the loan—it was advanced to Mr. Coape and Mr. King, upon their joint warrant of attor<lb/>ney—it was on 24th May—it was repaid to the Society when the loan was completed, on 3rd June—Mr. King made some hesitation about paying it on that day, and said as it was lent for a month, and that month was not up, it might as well be paid at the end of the month—I said it was agreed to be paid when the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced, and Mr. Coape recommended him to pay it then, and he did so—the whole 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was handed over to Mr. King, and out of that he paid the Company's secretary 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>had expressed myself satisfied with the security proposed—this was given in answer, as it were, to some inquiries about it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at several letters</hi>) this letter, beginning "My dear Coape", I understand to be Mr. Teesdale's writing—he is a solicitor—the others are Mr. King's writing—all of these letters reached me through Mr. Rogers—there seems to be one here from Mr. King to myself—that I received from Mr. King, the others I received from Mr. Rogers—I was present when this matter was completed and the money paid—it was on 3rd June, last year—I do not think I can tell what parts of the deed were read before it was executed—I was in and out of the room while the matter was being settled, but I was there when it was actually completed, the deed signed, and the money paid—I do not think I was present when the blanks in the statutory declaration were filled up, because I remember being asked a question about the amount filled in, and as to the rents of the leasehold property, afterwards—my clerk came to me, and said that the sum had been put in—that was before the business was over, before the cheques were signed, or the money paid—my clerk came to me when I went into the room, and said the amount of rents Mr. Coape had put in was 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the leasehold property, instead of 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as had been represented, and Mr. Coape came up to me, and said, "Yes, it was a larger amount, 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before; but I sold some of the leases, and the mortgage debt was reduced by the payment of the purchase money, to 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>".; not reduced to the extent of 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but reduced down to 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Coape personalty gave me that explanation of his leasehold property; that is the Pamlico pro<lb/>perty—he gave me no explanation whatever with respect to the freehold property—he made one observation as to his freehold property, that there was much more of it than I had been able to find out—that was said at the same time, at the time of the meeting—he said that his property was larger than I had been able to find out, larger than I had been able to discover—I had not made out satisfactorily the whole 1,100 acres at one time—I think I made some observation of that kind to him, and he said there was a good deal more than I had been able to find out—I had sent my clerk down into the neighbourhood of Maldon to make inquiries as to the acreage of the property generally, and the value of the rents—I furnished him with the extract from Mr. Coape's father's will for that purpose—I suggested that he should apply to Mr. Bridges, of Maldon, to whom he told me he went—Mr. Bridges happened to be one of the agents of the Albert Life Office—we made a great number of searches at the Tithe Commutation Office to ascer<lb/>tain the parcels, and extent of the property of Mr. Coape, and we found Bridgemarsh, and Plumes, and Westwicks mentioned, or rather the parishes in which they were stated to be in, and the number of acres—I did not find there were such names, but the acreage Mr. King gave agreed with the acreage we found at the Tithe Commutation Office in those parishes—the acreage would not appear in the Tithe Commutation Office, whether the property was sold or not—they were under Mr. Coape's name—I did not make any such inquiry as would have enabled me to ascertain whether any part of this land had been sold—it never occurred to us that the property could have been sold.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185509170017"/>
               <p>the business of a conveyancer is to investigate titles, and to prepare deeds—I think it is a conveyancer's business to send clerks into the country to make inquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there anything on earth to prevent you or your clerk inquiring of the tenants of these farms who was the landlord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not unless the restriction that we were not to make the matter known to Mr. Teesdale, would have precluded us from doing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a restriction that you were not to make the matter known to Mr. Teesdale? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that was made to me by Mr. Rogers, that Mr. Coape objected to my doing so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you knew that Mr. Teesdale was the pri<lb/>vate solicitor of Mr. Coape? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I believe Messrs Teesdale's to be a highly respectable firm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make any inquiry of them before you advised your clients to advance 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the morning of the settlement I sent to ascertain whether the letter that had been produced to me was written by them—I did not make any inquiry of them respecting the title to the property upon which I was advising my clients to advance the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was restricted from that—I made no inquiry except whether the letter was in the hand<lb/>writing of Mr. Teesdale—in loan cases there are generally great objections to being allowed to make inquiries of the tenants or on the premises; it is a common thing to have that restriction imposed—that was the reason I did not make inquiry of Mr. Teesdale—I think if I had gone down to Maldon myself, I might have made some inquiry of the tenants, but my clerk thought he had got sufficient information—he told me he had gone to two persons, one of whom he was referred to by the person of whom I had directed him to make inquiry; they, professed to know the property, to be aware of the acreage and the rental of the property at Maldon, and I was satisfied—they were apparently disinterested parties—hearing that there is a mortgage upon a portion of property, would certainly make one desirous of knowing to what extent it was entangled, and I wrote a letter to Mr. Rogers stating that I could not dispense with inquiry of the first mortgagee—I did not do so, but in lieu of permitting me to make that inquiry, Mr. Rogers furnished me with the letter written by Mr. Teesdale to Mr. Coape, for the purpose of showing that there were no other incumbrances than those that he stated, namely 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not make inquiries of the first mortgagee; they brought me that letter to prevent my doing so—that did prevent me—they stated that those inquiries could not be made without Mr. Teesdale being made acquainted with the transaction—of course I now wish that I had made inquiry of the teuants of these farms, if I had, I have no doubt I should have learnt the full particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that Mr. Smith has lost this money through your negligence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rather through the restriction, not being permitted to make inquiry.</p>

               <p>property had been sold by public auction—the Albert Office received back the 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the money—I had 400 guineas—I have nothing to do with what Mr. Rogers had—the office derived no profit from that 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—it was advanced for a month—they would not have lost that 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if the loan had not been completed—there was property then, and the Company had a warrant of attorney—I had the 400 guineas for the investigation, and preparing the securities in both cases—the office has lately presented me with a testimonial of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not make out any bill of costs; the sum was agreed upon—I do not of my own knowledge know that Mr. Rogers had 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have no doubt whatever that he had—I think Mr. King is a son of the late Admiral King—I believe Mr. Rogers is a solicitor; I have not the slightest doubt of it—I think he is; I feel quite sure of it—his name is in the Law list, therefore I ought perhaps to say he is—he has made several applications to me—we do not work together—it is not a joint affair—we do not share the people—we did not divide Mr. Smith between us, nor Mr. Cope—400 guineas was my charge—Mr. Rogers had 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I rather think—Mr. Rogers introduces persons wanting money—he applies to me to borrow money on behalf of persons by whom he is employed—there is very rarely a bill of costs in annuity transactions—I did not tell Mr. Smith or Sir John Wilson that I had got 400 guineas; I have not been asked—it has not yet occurred to me to return it—the statutory declaration was not for the purpose of catching them by the criminal law, in the event of matters turning out wrong—the great object was to test the accuracy of their statements—that was the only value of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And to force a settlement from their relations by a threat of criminal proceedings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never did so yet—I never proposed to anybody that the matter could be settled by this gentleman's relations paying the money—it has been talked of by two or three persons to me—several persons have asked me whether it would be settled—Mr. Semple asked me—he is one of the parties who lent Mr. Coape money before—I do not think Mr. Semple had taken a declaration, he did not tell me so—I do not think that Mr. Smith has spoken about it—Mr. Smith and I have not talked over this matter with a view to a settlement—I have never received any instructions at all from Mr. Smith—I have said to Mr. Smith that I should be very glad if it was settled—that was not a suggestion, I do not know what it was—I should have been very glad to get rid of the business—I do not know any other way of getting rid of it than by repurchasing the annuities—the annuities are repurchasable—that would have got the money back—I should have been pleased to have got rid of the thing—I have no interest, except in taking care of Mr. Smith—I have not said to Mr. Smith, "Why, Coape arranged with Semple, and we shall get the money too"—I do not think I have said anything to that effect—I will swear I have not said it—I think I have not said anything to that effect—I told Mr. Smith, of course, of Mr. Semple having had his money, and I hoped they would get him his, or something of that sort; that they would repay him; that they would repurchase the annuity—that must have been after the indictment, because the indictment went on directly it was known—I should have allowed the annuities to be repurchased after the indictment was found, if it could have been done with propriety, safely—the same sort of thing has not gone on between me and Sir John Wilson—I have not seen much of Sir John, he has been away mostly—I was acting both for him and Mr. Smith in this transaction—it was in respect of both the transactions that the costs were</p>

               <p>paid—I remember Mr. Coape going through the Insolvent Court—I think I was subpoenaed there to produce this deed—I did not attend, my clerk did—I think I sent him with the deed—I know I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What answer was brought by your clerk to the inquiries you directed him to make? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He brought me back word that the rental of Plumes, Westwicks, and Bridgemarsh farms, and some other property, Meek borough and another, I think, was somewhat more than half the rental of that which it had been first represented the fee simple property amounted to—I have since ascertained that those lands were sold by public auction ten years before—in the course of the whole proceedings neither Mr. Coape or Mr. King intimated anything to me with respect to that sale—inquiries were made to ascertain whether there were such lands, and whether Mr. Coape inherited them from his father—my clerk was to ascertain the value of the property, not the title, because that was assumed under the will—it never occurred to me that Mr. Coape had not these lands—I received this letter of Mr. Teesdale's about 21st March, within a day or two of its date—it was on the morning of 3rd June that I sent to ascertain whether it was a genuine letter of Mr. Teesdale's.</p>

I procure loans on security, negotiate loans—I know Mr. Rogers, the solicitor—I acted with him in the endeavour to raise a loan of 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was employed in the first onset by Mr. Gregory; that went off, and I was then employed by Mr. King—I saw Mr. Coape on the trans<lb/>action, but, to the best of my recollection, only once; he came to give me further information than that furnished by Mr. King—I had received infor<lb/>mation from Mr. King, and Mr. Coape came to give me further information—both these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), are in Mr. Rogers's writing; no, I think not, excuse me, only one is in Mr. Rogers's writing; this one—I supplied Mr. Rogers with the information contained in these papers—I received it from Mr. Coape—I have a rough memorandum book here; I received the particulars of the security from Mr. King, and I opened this book and entered them in it—I afterwards conversed with Mr. Coape on the subject of this entry, and took further particulars from him on a rough piece of paper, a copy of which is in Mr. Rogers's writing—the rough piece of paper I have not got—I had a conversation with Mr. Coape on the subject of the information King had given me, and the information made the security much better as it appeared—to the best of my recollection I read over to Mr. Coape the entry in the book—I cannot tell you exactly what he said, but I gave him a copy of what I had taken down on paper—if you will allow me to refer, I can tell you what he said—I did not know that I should require the rough piece of paper again, and it was destroyed; this book is merely a rough book—this memorandum is a copy of the memorandum I made, and which has been destroyed—I think it was made the following morning—Mr. Coape told me that he had fee simple property, or property partly fee simple and partly a life estate, to the extent of 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, but to a hundred or two I cannot say—he said that part was situated at Maldon in Essex, and at a place called Goldhanger; and he informed me that he had some property likewise at Pimlico—this memorandum is in the writing of Mr. Rogers; he wrote it by my dictation, from the lost piece of paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him write it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I compared it at the time—I would not swear that I compared it word for word; but he either read it over, or I did—I must first tell you that I handed him a piece of paper with the particulars in my own writing; it was very roughly written, and he copied it afresh—the best of my recollection is, that the fee simple property was about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>

               <p>particulars—what I wanted to arrive at was the exact rental and the encumbrances—I had never seen him before—I asked Mr. King for further information, and Mr. Coape came to me to give it—I was not certain that he would come, but I expected information from him—he told me that Mr. King had requested him to call on me to give me any informa<lb/>tion that I might require, to enable me to carry out the loan—I then referred to this book, and repeated what I had got down here, that the Essex property was about 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and that there was a farm at Hendon which I have no amount to—the first entry is the date his father died, 1844—then, "Property in Essex, about 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; farm at Hendon, blank; 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cents.; the life estates are mortgaged to the extent of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Mr. Coape, aged 42'—when I had read that over to him, he gave me fresh particulars; I do not know exactly what he said, all I know is that from what he said I mentioned to Mr. Rogers that the security was much better than I thought it before—he represented that the property was rather more, but I cannot tell what he represented without referring to Mr. Rogers's paper—that is, I believe, an exact copy of the paper which I have lost—I cannot positively swear whether I read it over, or whether it is word for word—(<hi rend="italic">The</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">decided that the witness could not look at the paper</hi>)—I cannot tell you what passed between me and Mr. Coape—I will swear that he said that the fee simple property was more than 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, but I will not swear to a hundred or two—there are no other entries in this book on this subject with respect to this loan—No. 40, St. James's-street, was where Mr. King lived at that time—I do not recollect say<lb/>ing, "Mr. Coape, I have no recollection of these matters"—1 do not think I have ever seen Mr. Coape in the company of King—I received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my assistance in this matter, from Mr. Rogers; it was understood that I was to have it—whether I was applied to first or second I cannot say, but I had had previous transactions with Mr. Gregory.</p>

               <p>On Saturday, 1st Sept., the prisoner came, towards dusk—she had a bottle of ginger beer; the price was a penny—she gave me a shilling; I gave her change and she left—before she left, I placed the shilling on the back counter; there were no other shillings there—within three minutes, when I had washed the glass, I took the shilling up to make up the difference of the penny, which I had taken from the till—I tried it with my teeth, and found it bad—I put it in my pocket, where I had no other shilling—when I went home at night, I placed it in a small jar, and kept it by itself—I afterwards gave it to the constable, when the prisoner was taken—on the Wednesday following, the prisoner came again about a quarter to 4 o'clock—I saw her in the shop, and knew her—she asked for a bottle of ginger beer, I served her—she gave me a bad shilling—I turned round and tried it with my teeth, and told her it was bad, and that she bad passed one with me before, and I should give her into custody—she replied that I should not <hi rend="italic">nail</hi> her, and ran away—she ran out of the shop, I followed her, and caught her about fifty yards off, at the corner of Homer-street—I did not see any officer—I detained her there—she looked round and said she would walk quietly with me to the station, which was on the right-hand side—she turned the corner with me, and she had no sooner done that than a man came up and said, "What is the matter, my dear?" she said, "This man is going to give me in charge for passing bad money"—the man took hold of her hand that had the purse in, from which she gave the shilling and said, "Come along"—he pulled her away, and I let go her hand—they walked very quickly till they got to the top of John-street—the station is in a line with that—I had previously sent a boy for a constable—they saw the constable coming, and the man ran down Should-ham-street as fast as he could go—the prisoner ran down Crawford-street—she was taken, and I gave her in charge—I marked the two shillings, and gave them to the constable—I am quite sure they were the two I had received from the prisoner.</p>

I had known Richardson two or three years—he first came to me about this matter about a week or ten days before 5th Aug.—he told me that he knew a person in the silk trade who was in difficulties, and was afraid he should not be able to get on, as he had some bills to meet, and he had a large quan<lb/>tity of bobbins of silk by him—he asked if I should like to be a buyer of them—on 5th Aug. the two prisoners came, and Richardson said, "I have brought a few of them here just to show you; there is only twenty, there will be a large quantity if you are likely to do anything with them"—I asked what they wanted for them—they asked me a shilling a bobbin for them—on 11th Aug. they came, and said, "We have got 400 bobbins here to-day, if you will like to buy them"—I told them it was a thing I did not understand—I did not know the value of them, Richardson said, "You know I would not bring them if they were not worth the money"—I told him I did not understand the value of them, I did not deal in anything of the sort before, and did not know what quantity of silk there was—they said they were well worth the money, and there were twenty-four drachms of silk on the bobbins—they said there was the trade mark on the bobbins, some four, some four and a half, and some five grains—the bobbins were marked; that was what the trade mark was, as they told me, and they showed me this bill of parcels.</p>

I went to Mr. Cowan in consequence of a communication made to me—I looked at some bobbins similar to these produced—these are not the bobbins usually used in trade, but when the silk is wound over them they have the appearance of bobbins used in trade—the value of these bobbins as they are is 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bobbin, if they were the usual bobbins they would be worth from 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 21<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—here is not quite a drachms of silk on these bobbins—it is usual in trade to have marks on the bobbins, to indicate</p>

               <p>the weight of the wood—these bobbins are marked four drachms, that signifies that the wood is four drachms—the wood of these would weigh four drachma, and eight drachms added to it.</p>

On the evening of 11th Sept., I was at the Lyceum Theatre; there were many persons going in at the same time I was—I had a gold watch in my waist-coat pocket—it had a chain through the button hole—I felt a pull at it, the prisoner tried to break my chain—it was very strong—I took his hand with my watch in it—he slipped his hand down—I saw my watch in his hand—I gave him to a policeman—I am sure he is the same person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the deputy comptrollers of the Post Office—I received from Mr. Dixon a letter in an envelope on the afternoon of 13th Aug.; this is the letter—I locked it up in my desk that night, and about half past 6 o'clock next morning I placed it in a tray of letters for the North Western railway division, to go by the daily mail—I saw Eames take that tray, about ten minutes after I had put the letter into it, to the North Western railway division—they would be placed before the prisoner—He was one of the messengers employed in the circulation department—it was his duty to place the letters before the clerks to sort—before placing the letters in the tray, I ascertained that there was money in it, by the hand—I could feel the money—I knew that it contained money—the letter was then perfect—there was no rent at the corner; I am quite certain of that—my attention had been particularly called to the letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe after this matter occurred, the prisoner was brought to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to me, to Mr. Bourne, another deputy comptroller—I know nothing of the searching of his person—what are called" Good letters", that is letters that have something more to be paid upon them, are sorted separately by other sorters—it is not the duty of the messengers to examine and see whether there are any good letters—they constantly do select those letters, and put them aside for the sorters—he places them in a distinct place—the only examination is to see whether it has a rate charged upon it—he would take it up to see whether it was a paid or an unpaid letter—I should say he would not take it up to see whether it was heavy or light—it would not be his business to see whether there was any excess due upon it—the table at which the divisional sorters stand, is a very long table—they stand about a foot apart—there are four or five sorters in that department—they stand with their backs to the messenger—they need not turn round when he delivers the letters to them; they need only make way for him to put them down—the room from</p>

               <p>which the tray was taken is another room—there may be thirty, forty, fifty or more persons employed in that room—I put the letter in the tray among other letters, not at the top—Eames took the tray to the North Western division—it is all one room, in fact, but in different compartments—formerly they were separate rooms—there is no partition—500, 600, or 700 persons are employed in that office—there are large open spaces to admit you from one compartment to another—the letter lay in the tray about five or six minutes before Eames took it away—I do not know of the prisoner having made any accusation against Eames of defacing letters, or any accusation—I am not aware of any accusation being made against Eames by any one—I know Mr. Ely—Eames would only have to go about thirty or forty yards with the tray, before he gave it to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>him and the light—lie then took and knocked it on the table on one end—he then applied both his hands to it, thumbs and fingers—he had some considerable difficulty—he kept working it on the table with both his thumbs, trying to force something out of it—he turned half round, and put his hands behind his head, and then drew his hand over his mouth—it appeared to me that he put something in his mouth—I then saw him turn round and take the letter up again; he seemed to straighten it a little with his hand—he then placed it in front of a row of other letters, took them up, turned round, and put them down to the sorter—I then went and told the comptroller on duty—I was in such a position that the prisoner could not see me—I was above him, in a private place up stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor to the Times Assurance Com<lb/>pany. In Jan. last I sent letters to Mr. Frederick Moul, No. 15, Cannon-place, Brighton—I received letters in reply to those I had written—I know the letters I received to be Mr. Moul's—(<hi rend="italic">The following copy of a letter sent by the witness was here read, as follows; it was addressed to the prisoner and signed, Edwards and Edwards</hi>:" 8th Jan., 1851. Sir,—Your letter to the Times Life Company of the 5th ultimo has been handed to us. It is impossible that we can extend to you the clemency you ask till some expla<lb/>nation respecting this loan is forwarded by you to us. On applying for the loan, you named Mr. George Cobham as one of your sureties, and referred to Mr. Parsons to answer inquiries as to Mr. Cobham's responsibility, etc., etc.—reference was made to Mr. Parsons, who assured the Company of Mr. Cob<lb/>ham's responsibility and respectability; the loan was thereupon agreed We find that Mr. George Cobham executed a deed at the office of the Company at the same time that you and Mr. James C. Moul did. Upon applying to Mr. Cobham for payment under his guarantee, you having made default, Mr. Cobham comes to us with his solicitor and emphatically denies all know<lb/>ledge of the transaction; that he never was applied to by you to become security, and never executed the bond. Upon the bond being produced to him, with what we had been led to believe was his signature, he says it is a forgery; that he never executed any deed, and reiterates his denial Now this requires explanation: either you have committed a gross fraud upon the Company in introducing some one who personated Mr. Cobham, or Mr. Cobham is telling a gross lie. We expect to hear from you by return, how the matter really stands; whether Mr. George Cobham, a big, stout man, did execute the deed, Mr. Cobham, a butcher, of Woolwich, as, if he did, we are satisfied he can pay, and after his statement, he deserves to be, and shall be made to pay. Remember, by return we expect your reply."—The <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's answer to this letter was as follows</hi>; "9th Jan. Sir,—I received your letter this morning. As regards Mr. Cobham, he told me he was will<lb/>ing to sign the bond with me; but the day before I had the money, he told me he should have nothing to do with it; this was after the Company had granted me the loan. I was then placed so that I did not know what to do. I asked another friend to sign for me, who said he would; I was not aware that he had put the name of Mr. George Cobham down, as his own name is Mr. John Williams, a master whitesmith, who is now gone to Australia,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185509170045"/>
               <p>which I did not know at the time he intended to go there. Had Mr. Cobham told me when I asked him that he would not do it, I should have given in Mr. Williams's. I am truly sorry that I was so foolish as to do what I did. As the loan was granted to me, I did not know what to do when Mr. Cobham disappointed me; and now all I can do is, to leave myself in your hands, and I do hope you will not take proceedings against me, and I will act honest and pay the loan, so that there shall be no more trouble about it. I sent Mr. Sweet, the agent of Mr. Cobham, before I filled up my loan paper"—in May, or July, I went to No. 15, Cannon-place, Brighton—the prisoner opened the door to me—I showed him this letter, and asked him whether that was his writing—he said it was—I told him that I had come down from the Times Life Office about it—he asked me to walk into a back room—when he got in he began talking about his circumstances, and telling me a long string of reasons why he had not paid the money; at last I put a stop to the conversation and went to the front door of the house, and beckoned in Terry, the constable, whom I had brought with me—I stated that I gave the prisoner into custody for forging that deed, producing the deed at the time—I pointed out the signature of George Cobham as being the signature which was forged—the prisoner said he was sorry it had come to this, he never meant to defraud the Company—we then all three went into the same back room again—he began talking about his circum<lb/>stances again, and asked if there was any means of settling it, whether he could pay it in part, and give security for the remainder—I told him I should listen to nothing of the kind—he asked me whether he could speak to Mr. Sheridan, and ask him to do it—Mr. Sheridan is one of the Directors of the Company—I said that I should certainly advise Mr. Sheridan to have nothing to do with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. You have been fetched here as a witness, have you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this is the first time I knew anything about being a witness, I never expected it—the gentleman who fetched me did not tell me what I was wanted for, only that I was to be a wit<lb/>ness to one of the signatures; he said nothing to me about the body of the deed—the body of this deed is in my writing; it is partly written and partly printed—I cannot say whether the whole of the written part was filled in after the signa<lb/>ture of Frederick Moul, James C. Moul, and George Cobham—I should say not, I should say it was put in before—as to this one of Baxter's, I can posi<lb/>tively state that the deed was filled in before that signature was put to it—it is my positive opinion that it was all filled in before any of the signatures were affixed—nothing has been said to me about this—the clerk of Mr. Edwards fetched me, and told me I was to be a witness to the execution of the deed—I will give you one good reason for saying it was filled in before it was signed, and that is, you will find the word "Carrington" has been written in after the other part; we did not know that name, and therefore it was left blank, and upon their coming to the office that word was written in—there are no dates to the signatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you account for the policy of 17th March, 1854, being recited in the body of the deed, when the deed is dated 10th March? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That has been put in afterwards, after the signatures—there was an old policy which was assigned at the time, but that was a new one, it was not then com<lb/>pleted, and it was put in afterwards—I cannot say as to whether that particular part was put in since the signature of Baxter; it is all in my own handwriting—I do not know Baxter, a person came and signed in that name—the word "Carrington" was not written at the same time as the other part, nor the words "17th March, 1854"—blanks were left in that part of the deed for that to be put in afterwards—I do not remem<lb/>ber copying any portion of that policy from a previous one—it is possible that we may have had a previous policy with the name of James Carrington Moul to it, as a surety for his brother—we had a fresh proposal, and I should not go to the old papers to make out a new one—I am not sure about its being a fresh proposal, I only know it from the word "Carrington" being added.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you speaking from memory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but from the appearance—when we fill in blanks, we spread the writing out to fill up the space, and you will find that this, instead of being written as close as the other part, is spread out to fill up the blank that had been left—I recollect Mr. Baxter coming to sign—he could scarcely write at all—he said his hand shook so, he could scarcely write his name—I do not know that these three persons put their signatures before the blanks were filled up—I only know that blanks were left, and filled up afterwards; I mean after the signatures—the other part must have been filled in before,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185509170047"/>
               <p>according to my impression—I do not know that it was so, but it is my impression that it must have been so, because we waited till the parties came, to ask them the name of Carrington, to fill in—I am not sure whether I was there when the parties came—it is my impression that they all came together, and when the name of Carrington was asked for, it was put before it was executed—it was most likely that it was put in before it was executed—what I have been saying is this, I believe the deed must have been previously filled up, before the signatures were affixed—that is what I have been saying all along—blanks were left for the name Carrington, and for the second policy—if the parties all came together, that would be put in before they signed—the regular course would be to fill in all the blanks before they signed—I do not know whether I was there when they came—I have no remembrance whether the deed was executed when it is dated—there is no one here from the office who can state that—the blank that was left for 17th March, 1854, was filled in afterwards—I cannot say whether it was after the signatures, but after the body of the deed was written—that is all I can say; whether it was after the signatures or not I cannot tell—I cannot tell positively whether it was filled in before the three parties signed the deed—it is my impression that the deed was written without the word "Carrington", and "17th March, 54, "and that those blanks were filled up before the parties executed it.</p>

On Friday night, 10th Aug., I shut up the premises at 9 o'clock—I secured the shop, and a window that I afterwards found open—that was shut the night before—there were rolls of cloth hanging up to dry in a first floor room, over the shop—about 3 o'clock in the morning I fancied I heard a noise—I lay in bed till about 20 minutes before 4 o'clock—I then turned myself in bed, and sat up, and fancied I heard a noise again—I lay down again, and about 20 minutes past 4 o'clock, I heard a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drive down Charles-street, which is about ten yards from the shop—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came down very slowly, and I heard some one unlock the shop door inside—I jumped out of bed, put the window up, and saw a man take a single piece of cloth to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the cabman was holding the door open, and the man threw it in—I called out, "<hi rend="italic">Cabman</hi>! stop thief!" as loud as I could halloo—the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi>, looked up at me, but still</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Great Western Railway. On the 14th July I was in the beer shop of the prisoner, No. 21, Spring-street, Paddington—just after 4 o'clock I saw the prisoner and his wife inside the bar—the little boy was there, crying—the prisoner had a cane in his hand, and he wanted to strike the boy—Mrs. Watts said, "No, you shall not strike him"—the little boy made his escape down stairs, and Mrs. Watts said to the prisoner, "It would be more to your credit to send him to school, as you ought to do, instead of keeping him at home"—on her saying that, the prisoner struck her twice with the cane across the shoulders—he was the worse for liquor—I said, "Mr. Watts, you are no man, for striking a woman"—he asked what odds it was to me—I said it made no difference to me what passed between a man and his wife, but I did not like to see a man strike a woman—he stepped up to her, and said, "I will be d——d if I don't kill you"—I said, "Not in my presence, you will not"—he made a bolt down stairs, and shut the door after him, and Mrs. Watte was left in the bar by herself—the stairs that the prisoner went down go down into the kitchen—they were the same stairs the little boy had gone down—Mrs. Watts came outside the bar—I said to her, "Don't cry, Mrs. Watts"—she had before served me with some beer—she was not the least the worse for liquor—after I had my beer I went out, and left her in the bar—I never saw any more of her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a confectioner; I live at Paddington. I knew the deceased Sarah Watts and her husband—on Saturday, 14th July, 1 went to their house in Spring-street, about 20 minutes before 4 o'clock—I was in the parlour which joins the bar—while there I heard a noise in the bar—I heard Mr. Watts's son crying, and his wife scream—I came out into the bar—I heard the prisoner's wife say to him, "Don't hurt Billy"; or "Don't hit Billy", I cannot be positive which—the prisoner had not any<lb/>thing in his hand—he pushed his wife out of the bar by forcing the door against her, to make her go out of the bar—that door goes on to a landing place, to which the staircase comes down from upstairs—the prisoner suc<lb/>ceeded in forcing her out of the bar, and shut the door, and he remained in</p>

               <p>the bar—I went back to the parlour, and some time afterwards I heard a woman screaming, whom I supposed to be Mrs. Watts, and something like a severe push or a fall against the wainscot—the parlour adjoins the bar, and the staircase comes down at the back of that parlour—I should say the screams came from the door at the foot of the stairs, at the back of the bar—on hearing those screams and fall, I went out into the bar—I attempted to go to that door which leads on to the staircase—the prisoner prevented me—he said I had no right to interfere—he held the door and would not allow me to go any farther—he said I had no right—I did not see anything on the other side of the door—the prisoner said she was a d—d bitch, and he would do for her—after he told me not to interfere, I went back to the parlour, and finished my letter that I was writing—I left the house about ten minutes afterwards—the next day, the 15th, I called at the house at 5 or 10 minutes after 1 o'clock—I saw the prisoner—I told him it was a great pity he had used his wife so, or words to that effect—he told me I knew nothing about it, that his wife had been drinking gin all day long with some porters belonging to the Railway, and a Mrs. Browning, and that she was drunk, and had fallen down stairs, which was the cause of her being injured—I had observed on the previous day, when I was at the her, the state the prisoner was in—I think he was drunk—when the woman brought me in the writing materials, and some ale that I had, the compli<lb/>ments of the season passed between us, that was all—she was in a state of perfect sobriety.</p>

On Saturday, 14th July, I called at No. 21, Spring-street, about 4 o'clock—there was no one in the bar—I saw a child, a girl, standing just out of the bar, at the foot of the stairs, crying—the next thing I saw was a woman fall at the bottom of the stairs—she was at the foot of the stairs, with her head against the wainscot—I do not think I was there more than two minutes altogether—it was almost instantly—she came down very suddenly, and fell flat—seeing her fall, I stepped forward to assist her—I then saw the prisoner—he came forwards into the bar, and shut the door after him, which divided the staircase from the bar—he had come down stairs—I requested him to allow me to go and assist the woman—he had come forward before I stepped to her, and had shut the door after him to prevent my going—I requested him to allow me to pick the woman up—he told me it was his affair, not mine, and re<lb/>quested me to have nothing to do with it—he said it was his wife—I told him I had known him when he was a child—he said, "Very well, this is my affair, not yours; I beg you will not interfere"—I saw the last witness</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living with my husband, at No. 32, Market-street, Edgware-road. I did lodge in the house kept by the prisoner when this happened—on the day this happened I heard a noise, which attracted my attention, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I heard screams, and a very heavy fall—I was then sitting in the front parlour with my husband—I went out of my room in consequence of what I heard—I found Mrs. Watts lying on the floor, at the foot of the stairs—she was screaming—her head was about half a foot from the passage door—the little boy and little girl were crying—I tried to raise her up—I was not able—I saw the prisoner on the stairs, I asked him to come and help me up with her, but he would not—he said, "I will have nothing to do with her"—my husband was at home, and I had a sister there—I called to my sister, and she and I were not able to get her up—I called to my husband, and he came, and we three got her up on her feet, and helped her the best way we could into my room, the back parlour, which I used as a bed room—it is on the same floor as the bar—we laid her down on the bed—after we placed her there, the prisoner came down stairs, and followed her into my room, and he tried to reach over me to strike her—he appeared to be tipsy—we got him out of the room—he came in again about two hours after, into the front and back parlours, he came into both the rooms—before he was put out of the room the first time, the deceased was crying, and holding her head, and just as he went out of the room she said, "Oh, Watts! what have I done to deserve this?"—I do not think he heard that, he was just out of the room—she might not know that he was out—nothing more passed at that time—in two hours afterwards he came into the front room—she was in the back room—the door was open—he came in with his two hands clenched, and said", Where is the d——d b—h?" and he said he would kill her—he tried to get into the back parlour—I was in the front parlour, I begged him not to go in, as she was trying to go to sleep—I took him by the two wrists and tried to prevent his going in, but he pushed by the sofa, and got into the back room—I still held him—he got one of his hands loose from mine, and tried to strike her—he struck at her, but did not strike her, because I pulled him back by the other arm—he said she was drunk, and not fit to live, and he would do for her—he called her Irish, and not fit to live—to the best of my recollection, that was the expression—ho said she was not fit to live, and the sooner she was dead the better—I persuaded him</p>

               <p>not to strike her, not to ill treat her—I said, "You have ill treated her enough already, and too much I fear"—she then said, "Oh, Henry! What have I done to deserve this? you cruel man to serve me so"—he said "You are drunk, and not fit to live"—she said, "I am not drunk, the fell has upset my stomach, that has made me sick"—she had been sick frequently while she laid on my bed—in what she threw up I did not notice any smell of liquor, not the slightest—he then turned to me, and said, "You are drunk, and have been giving her gin"—I said, "I am not drunk; I have given her no gin; I have not seen any spirits for a fortnight; I have given her nothing but cold water or tea"—he said she should not stay in my room—she said, "Let me stay till I am better, I will come"—I said, "Let her stay till she is better, don't disturb her now"—I got him out, and he went back into the front room—my husband was there at work—he is a tailor—my husband persuaded him to go out, and let her abide where she was—I cannot say exactly bow long she lay in that state after he was induced to go out of the room—it might be half an hour, or an hour—she then said she was better, and she would go up and lay on her own bed—the servant had persuaded her to go before, and she said she would when she was better—she did not sleep in a room over mine—it is a sort of double house—her room is on the first floor—when she left my room to go up stairs, I went up about three steps, and asked her if I should assist her—she said, "No, I shall do nicely now, thank you Mrs. Browning"—when she got to the top, she looked over the balustrade, and said, "I shall do nicely now"—I returned to my room—after that, I heard screams, up stairs—but a minute or two before I heard the screams, I heard Watts go up stairs—I heard his voice on the stairs—I did not hear the words he said—when I heard the screams, I went down in the kitchen to the servant—she came up with me—I gave her some directions, and she went up stairs—she soon returned, and at the same time Watts ran down, and went into the bar—the servant came back and said something to me, and the child came down and said something to me—I went up, and found Mrs. Watts and two children in the room, the little boy and the little girl—I do not know their ages—I should say ten or eleven—they were in the room crying—the deceased woman was lying on the bed perfectly insensible—her eyes were half open, and she was making a noise in her throat—I went up and spoke to her; she was not able to speak—she never spoke afterwards—I called for some water; I thought she might have been faint—I tried all I could, but she did not recover—I went down and found the prisoner in the bar—I said, "Watts, I believe your wife is dying; send for a doctor"—he said, "Let her die and be d—; I won't send for a doctor"—I said, "It is no use your talking like that, tell me who your doctor is and I will fetch him"—he said, "I will not"—he said she was drunk, and had fallen down stairs—I said, "If you won't send for your doctor, I will send for mine"—he said, "Mind your own business; you dare to send for a doctor; do it at your peril"—he then went into the bar and slammed the door—I went over the way to a doctor that I thought was their doctor, but he was not at home—I sent for another, and Mr. Reece came—that might be about a quarter of an hour after I had had the conversation with the prisoner—I went up stairs before the doctor came—I found the deceased on the floor—Watts was in the room, and he had hold of her, but I did not see what he did, for directly at that time the doctor came, and I ran down to let him in—I went up stairs with the doctor—I do not remember that the prisoner said anything to him then, but he did afterwards—he said, "I did not send for you, you</p>

               <p>have no business here, you only want to make a job"—the doctor assisted me to get her on the bed—he looked at her and said, "I fear it is a concussion of the brain"—the prisoner said she was drunk, and he frequently ordered Mr. Reece out of the room, and to leave her alone—while the doctor was in the room, the prisoner tried to assist to lift Mrs. Watts on the bed, and he said she was very tipsy—Mr. Reece desired him to leave the room, and told him he feared she would never recover—the prisoner went out for a short time, and he came in again and again ordered Mr. Reece to go away—Mr. Reece said, "I don't wish you to have me, but I shall not leave this poor woman till you send for another medical man, and send for him in my presence"—the prisoner said he would have Dr. Forbes if he had anybody, for he was a gentleman, and would not charge him anything—he was sent for, and Mr. Reece then left, giving me instructions what to do; to put a bottle of water to her feet, and to send for him if I wanted him, if Dr. Forbes did not come—when Mr. Reece took his leave the prisoner was in the room, and after Mr. Reece had left, he again dragged his wife off the bed on the floor—he got her to the hearthstone, and stretched her out straight on the hearthstone—he pulled her up by her clothes in front, and threw her head back on the hearthstone—he did that twice—he said he would bring her to her senses, he had done that before—I tried to interfere—I tried to pull him away, and he threw me across the room, and my side came in contact with the bed post—I went back again to him to try to save her, and he said he would serve me the same if I did not leave the room—I tried to persuade him to let her alone and leave the room—he said she was drunk, and not fit to live, and he would kill her—he repeated that many times—I said, "Watts, if you don't leave her alone I will call the police; you will kill her"—he then went out of the room, leaving her on the floor—I called the servant to help me to pick her up, and put her on the bed—(the servant was in the room near the door when I called her, but she ran out several times because she was afraid of him)—I and the servant succeeded in putting her on the bed—after we got her on the bed, the prisoner came in again before Dr. Forbes came—the prisoner came to the bedside, dragged his wife off again on to the floor in a sitting posture—he got behind her, took hold of her two shoulders, and pushed her forwards with his knees—he then put his foot up, and kicked her forwards—he was still making use of bad language, the same as he had done before, and saying he would bring her to her senses, and he knew where to touch her to make her feel—when he pushed her forwards with his knee, it was not towards the bed but towards the door—I got him to let her go, and she fell backwards, but I caught her—I held her shoulders on my arm, and I lowered her down gently—he then laid hold of her legs, and began shamefully treating her—I was close to him all the time, trying to pull him away, but I was not strong enough—I kept him off as well as I could—I got him to leave the room, and I and the servant got her on the bed again—Dr. Forbes then came, and he examined her in the same way that Mr. Reece had done, and made use of nearly the same words; that he feared she would never recover—during the whole time that this was going on, she was in this insensible state, with her eyes fixed—when Dr. Forbes came and was examining her, the prisoner put his hand under the bed clothes, and did something to her feet—she gave a <hi rend="italic">catch</hi>—I turned down the clothes to see what he was doing; he had got hold of her toes—I spoke to Dr. Forbes about it, and he ordered him out of the room—before Dr. Forbes came, the prisoner had squeezed her at the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you and your husband lived in this place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twelve months; it may be rather more—we are indebted to Mr. Watts for rent—I do not know how much without my rent book was here—I did not pay the rent weekly; I paid it when I had it—I do not owe 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have had no dispute about it—we were always on good terms before this—the prisoner never asked me for rent in his life—I know Mrs. Nash—she used to be a friend of Mrs. Watts—she was not there when this happened—when Dr. Forbes was there, I told him I must have some one to help me, I could not stand it much longer, and she came while he was there—to the best of my recollection I fetched her myself—there is a Mrs. Turnbull, I believe, a sister-in-law of Mrs. Watts—she was not there—she came on the Sunday—I wished her to be sent for—she was not there at all on Saturday to my knowledge—she was not there when Dr. Forbes came; he came, I think, about 9o'clock—Mrs. Turnbull knew nothing about it till she came on Sunday, and I told her about it—I did not say anything to her about having got into a pretty mess, and that my husband would send me 100 miles in the country—I said I would rather have been 100 miles off, than to have witnessed what I had witnessed, or words to that effect—I did not make use of this expression, "I have got myself into a pretty mess"—the girl who was examined before the Coroner may be about ten yean old—I believe she was examined before the Magistrate and the Coroner, I believe not before the Grand Jury—I did not say to Mrs. Turnbull that I would stay in the country, and she did not say I should be made to come back—I said before that I wished I had been in the country, and Dr. Forbes said, "It would be no good, you have seen it"—Mrs. Turnbull accused me for being in different tales about this matter, and she said I should be well rapped on the knuckles for it—I had told her about this on the Sunday when she came, and she was very much put out about it—she said her brother had no business to marry an Irish woman—Mrs. Watts died on the Monday—I have never had any quarrel with this man—he never separated me and my husband when I was tipsy—I never was tipsy in my life—nobody can come forward to say I was—my husband and he got drunk one night, and they both came into my room—my room was never on fire when I and my husband were sitting at the table drinking—my husband was in bed, and my sister and I were in the back yard, down in the wash house, when there was a cry of fire, we came in, and Mr. Watts was coming out of the room—I have never made any threats against Watts that I would hang him, or anything of that kind—I am sure I have not—on the day I came from the Police Court, I did not tell Mrs. Turnbull I would hang him if I could—I never told that to any one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On Sunday night did you, and your husband, and How it son have a gallon of beer that was drawn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had no beer at all; I was up stairs with poor Mrs. Watts on Sunday night—my husband was going to have some supper, and some friends came there—Mrs. Turnbull drew him some beer for supper, but I was up stairs—to the best of my recollection, I never tasted it—I am quite sure I have not exaggerated this matter at all in any way—the blows on the head that I spoke of, by lifting up the head and letting it down, were very violent, and she was insensible at the time—</p>

               <p>during this period the prisoner appeared to be tipsy—he said he was not, and told Dr. Forbes he was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not repeatedly said that he appeared to be very much intoxicated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have said that he appeared to be tipsy—he appeared to be drunk, but he was able to walk into the room and out again, and when a man is very drunk, of course he falls about—he charged me with giving his wife gin—that was not true—when he was doing what I have described, he repeatedly said his wife was drunk, and it would bring her to—he said that several times during the evening—he said she was drunk—I cannot tell his thoughts—he might think so for all me—from what he said to me over and over again, it did not appear to me that he was under the impression that she was drunk—it appeared to me that he was intemperate—he said she was drunk—he did not say it in a manner as if he thought she was drunk—I thought he said it just for the sake of saying so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any one in the room after Mr. Reece left, and before Dr. Forbes came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The servant was in the room once or twice—she saw a part of what passed—she was there part of the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before this Saturday had you ever had any dispute with Watts about rent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—there was a running account between us—I had done some things for the children, and I made the last black dress that Mrs. Watts ever had—to the best of my recollection, I fetched Mrs. Nash on the Saturday night, and she remained with me till about 12 o'clock—she then left me, and I remained with Mrs. Watts till some old lady that did washing came—I never saw Mrs. Turnbull till Sunday in my life—I asked Mr. Watts if he had not some relation that could come to assist me, and she came on Sunday—I think it was while church was in—she told me on the Monday that I was to be well rapped on the knuckles for having told different tales, and she told me on the Sunday, frequently, to be careful what I said, for there would be other witnesses beside me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness. I am a tailor—I lived at No. 21, Spring-street about twelve months—I and my wife had been on good terms with Watts to that date—we never had any disputes with him—on Saturday afternoon, 14th July, about 4 o'clock, I was at work at home, in the front parlour—my wife was sitting with me—I heard a heavy fall, and screaming—my wife went out to see what was the matter—my wife's sister was in the room—my wife called her sister, and then she called me—I went in the passage, and helped to pick the prisoner's wife up—I found her lying in the passage when I went out—I did not see anything of the prisoner—I assisted in carrying the deceased into the back parlour—I left her just as I got her to the edge of the bed—I went into the front room—it is not necessary to go through the front room to go to the back room—there is a way from the passage—a few minutes after she was placed on the bed I heard Watts in the room—I heard his voice, I do not know what he said—I remained in the front parlour—about two hours after, he came into the front parlour—he said, "Where is that drunken b—h?"—I advised him not to go in to her, not to ill treat her any more, and my wife tried to prevent him from going in, but he pushed by her—she advised him to go out—she got him part of the way, between the front parlour and the back parlour—he said, "The b—r is not fit to live"—he got into the back room, and my wife followed him—I heard him swearing at my wife, and saying she had nothing to do with it, and he would have the d——d b—h out—the deceased remained on my wife's bed till about 7 o'clock, I</p>

               <p>believe—I did not notice her going up stairs—I asked my wife how she was, and she said she was gone up stairs to her own room—after that I heard a fall and a scream immediately—it was up stairs—I could not tell which room it was in—my wife went out to see what was the matter—I did not go up stairs—the prisoner was drunk when he came into the front parlour, and went out into the back parlour—I do not think Mrs. Watts was in liquor; I never knew her to be drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I was living with my sister, Mrs. Browning, in the prisoner's house—I had been a lodger there for some months—on Saturday afternoon, 14th July, while sitting with my sister, I heard screams and a heavy fall—my sister went out to see what was the matter—she called me and I found Mrs. Watts lying upon the stairs—my brother in law also came out—I assisted in carrying her to the bed—after she was placed on the bed I bathed her head with cold water—the prisoner came in to try to get her out—I did not hear what he said—after some time he left the room, and about two hours after he came back to the front parlour—he came in with his hands clenched, and asked where the d—d bitch was—he pushed into the back parlour where she was, and tried to strike her—he did not reach her, for my sister prevented him—he said he would kill her, she was only drank and not fit to live—after that he left the room, and went out in the passage—I saw Mrs. Watts go upstairs, and after she went up I heard Watts go up—after he went up I heard screaming from upstairs—after those screams my sister went up into this upper room—I did not see or hear any one come down from the upper room after the screaming—I did not go upstairs—I saw nothing more of Mrs. Watts that evening—from what I saw of her that day, she was sober—she vomited, but there was no smell of liquor—Watte was drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 45, Sussex-gardens. I was sent for that Saturday evening to the prisoner's house, a little before 9 o'clock—I went immediately I had the message—Mrs. Browning met me in the passage—I went upstairs with her to the bedroom—I found the deceased on the floor perfectly insensible—her pulse was very weak, and the surface of the body very cold and clammy—I examined the eye—the pupil was very much dilated—it did not contract in the slightest degree—I at once expressed my opinion that she was in" great danger—she appeared to be suffering under some violence to the brain—either concussion or com pression of the brain—the prisoner was in room when I stated it to be my opinion that she would not recover—he asked me who sent for me, and said I had no business there, he did not wish my presence, or my interfer<lb/>ence, and that he had not sent for me—I told him his wife was in great danger, that I had no wish to interfere with the case, but I should take charge of it until he had sent for some one else—I then assisted in remov<lb/>ing her from the floor to the bed—he then gave directions to one of his children to fetch Mr. Forbes, and the child left the room for that purpose—we assisted his wife to the bed, I and Mrs. Browning, and I think the servant—the prisoner attempted to assist, but it appeared to me that he was not in a fit state to assist—he placed himself in a position where he could not be of use, and I desired him to leave the room, and I sent for a lighted candle.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any opportunity of ascertaining whether she was tipsy <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My attention was drawn to that by some one saying she was tipsy, but there was nothing of the kind—I ordered hot water to her feet—a fall down a portion of the stairs might account for the symptoms I saw; supposing that fall to have produced concussion of the brain, sickness would follow as a consequence—the first impression would be insensibility, but when re<lb/>action came on it might produce fulness of the vessels of the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have heard that in this case this unfortunate woman talked, and walked up stairs, and two hours elapsed after that before you saw her; would you refer the state in which you found her after such an interval as you have described, to the injuries of the fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Such a thing is possible—if a person talked after this and went up stairs, and I found her two hours after in the state in which I found her, it is possible that state might be referable to the fall—there are cases in which the vessels of the brain dis<lb/>charge their contents, and effuse the brain little by little—that is after re<lb/>action comes on—I should think the violence I have heard described after the fall, might have produced the state that I saw her in—it certainly would have accelerated it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons On Saturday evening, 14th July, I was called to the house of the prisoner—his little boy came for me, I believe, about half past 9 o'clock—I had attended the family before that day—I went as soon as I was sent for—I went to a room up stairs—I found the deceased lying on the bed—Ma Browning, the servant, and two children, were in the room—Mrs. Watts was insensible—I examined to see if there was any sign of spirits, and there was none—I attended her till her death, on Monday 16th July—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—there was a bruise on the head, of the size of a crown piece, immediately above the right ear—there was no other mark of injury on any part of the body; no external mark but this bruise—internally, there was a large quantity of blood effused on the surface of the brain, beneath the bruise, and extending over the whole of the hemi<lb/>sphere of the brain—there was no evidence of any disease previous to this—I attribute death to the injury to the head—the immediate cause was the effusion of the brain, which was the effect of the injury—on my arriving at the house the prisoner was in the passage—he made a statement to me with regard to his wife—he told me that she had fallen, I think he said down stairs, I am not certain, in consequence of having taken too much—while I was examining her in the room up stairs, he was there part of the time—he put his hand under the clothes, to her feet, while I was there, to her toes—Mrs. Browning called my attention to it—what he did to the feet had an effect on the deceased—she made a start—if he had pinched her feet, or any pressure on her feet, it would make her start her leg—a tickle with a feather might produce the effect, or it might be a pinch—at the time I was there, there was a conversation passing between Mrs. Browning and the prisoner—the purport of it was, objecting to Mrs. Browning's inter<lb/>ference—I observed her conduct while I was in the room—there was nothing in her interference that appeared to me improper; not at all—she made a statement to me as to what the prisoner had done to his wife in the room—she stated the circumstances—I could not say positively whether the prisoner was present—he was in and out of the room—I saw a girl tea or eleven years of age in the room—she made a statement to me about her</p>

               <p>father—the prisoner was intoxicated—after the woman was dead, I was in the house when the prisoner was taken into custody, on Tuesday, the 17th—the prisoner made a statement—he said that he pushed against his wife—he said that he wished to get her back to the bar; that he followed her up stairs, and pulled her by the dress to get her back, and, not succeeding, he went up above her and pushed her, and she took hold of the rail of the banister; it gave way, and she fell—I observed that there was a banister broken, but not at that time—I dare say there were fire or sir steps from the landing place to where the banister was broken—that was where the staircase was straight, but it turned afterwards—the woman died on the Monday night—the prisoner was on the bed at the time—I told him of it, and he turned his face away and cried.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would a fall without a push have occasioned it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I never saw the prisoner otherwise than kind and attentive to his wife—I never heard of quarrels between them—of course I attended at times when kindness was of consequence—I think there have been five such—when he cried, it appeared to be a genuine expression of emotion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have heard Mrs. Browning's statement about the treatment on the hearth, do you believe that so much violence could have taken place without some marks of injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think the absence of marks might be attributed to the hair being on the head.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what happened to her afterwards could not accelerate or increase it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it would have a tendency to do so, but I think all I saw might be accounted for by a fall.</p>

On Thursday, 6th Sept., about 10 minutes past 3 o'clock in the morning, my wife awoke, and directed my attention to a noise in the wall, which separates my house from Mr. Reeves's, as if persons were breaking in—I listened for a few minutes, and heard it myself, and then went into the dining room underneath, when I heard it more plainly—I then went into the parlour, and heard it more plainly—I then went into the street, listened at Mr. Reeves's shutters, and was quite convinced that men were at work—I spoke to a policeman, he rang the bell, and then I heard a noise, which I supposed was the dropping of their housebreaking instruments, and after that a tremen<lb/>dous crash, as of something falling, which turned out to be three or four feet of cooking stove—Mr. Reeves opened the door, I went in, and saw a large hole partly cut through the wall which divides his shop from mine—his is a milliner's shop, but the house was supposed to be empty, as the furniture had been removed—there might be a bedstead or two, as Mr. Reeves was living there—the shutters had been up for a day or two, and bills on them—I found a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, and a stock and bit, on the floor—the circle of the hole was large enough to admit a man's body, but it was not completely through.</p>

I first took notice of the condition of the child about three weeks prior to the prisoner's apprehension—as I went into the room I missed the child, and as I was coming out I found it under an old coat, in a very bad state, dirty, covered with sores, and very sickly—I had it washed by my wife—there was no furniture or food in the room, except a piece of crust unfit to eat; no animal could eat it—I saw the child three times—it always laid in the same corner—prior to the prisoner being taken, I told him on Tuesday night that I would give him in charge if he went out and left the child in that state, and that I had been from 4 till 9 o'clock hunting the public houses for him—he said that he would go out if he liked, and I could not do anything to him for it—he was not drunk or sober then—he is a very hardworking man, and if left alone by his wife would work six days in the week, but I never knew it to be so—when he did work, and had anything for sale, I have seen her out in Petticoat-lane selling the things—I have known that she has taken money for them—I have seen a good deal of money, time after time, with her—there is one instance when I lent the prisoner half a crown, and he acknowledged to me afterwards that he had over 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods to spare after supporting themselves—that was three weeks previous—I knew them when they lived in Reeve's-rents—the child was awfully treated there, because they left it without a fire, in the frost and snow, in the dead of winter.</p>

I am the proprietor of Belgrave Villas, in the turnpike road there—about the end of June I received information, went to the house No. 1, and found that it had been entered, part of the first floor water closet fittings were broken off and taken away, the cup and handle, and also a quantity of brass taps—I gave infor<lb/>mation to the police—about the last week in Aug. Mr. Whitworth showed me a handle and cup which I recognised as my property—I compared them and they fitted—on 8th Sept., after the prisoner had been bailed by a Ma<lb/>gistrate, he came to my house, and said, "I am very sorry that this has occurred, and I shall be very glad to make any recompense in my power"—I said that if he was innocent and did not do it, he had no occasion to come about it—he said that he hoped I should look it over in the best way I could—I said that I did not want to hurt him—he had not been employed by me to work in that house, but he had in other houses near that spot—this cup and handle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), are mine, and this other is the part which was fixed to the water closet.</p>

On Thursday, 6th Sept., I went after the prisoner, and found him at Hudson's-town, in the parish of West Ham, about three quarters of a mile from this place—I asked him if he had sold any bell knobs or a cup of a water closet to Mr. Whitworth; he said, "No, I have not"—I asked him if he had taken any to his place; he said, "No"—I asked him if he had given him any; he said, "No"—he then said that he had sold some bolts and locks to Mr. Whitworth—I told him that I must take him to the station for stealing some bell knobs and the cup of a water closet, the property of Mr. Plater—he said, "Very well, the old b—owes me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." he asked me to let him go down stairs to put his clothes on—he went down to the kitchen, and I waited up stairs on the landing—I said, "Jex, come, you are a long while"—he had then been about five minutes—he said, "I</p>

About 23rd July I missed two de lane dresses from inside the shop—I had previously missed a piece of print from outside the shop—I cannot exactly say the date—one of the dresses was a blue, and the other a green, with a little red flower—the green one was rather a particular one, we only had one of that pattern—Mr. Evelyn serves in the shop, and a young lady as well—they are not here—they had not been sold—I had seen them safe half an hour before I missed them—they were taken from just inside the door—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them.</p>

               <p>had better go to the Bank of England—he did not go with me to the Bank of England, he went to the Auction Mart to get something to drink, and I went and asked whether the note would be changeable, because the number was gone—I presented it, and it was stopped—I then went back with the officer.</p>

On 15th Aug., between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning, from information I received, I went with a constable to No. 19, Sarah-street, Kingaland-road, and found Woodhouse in bed—I told him I belonged to the police, and came to take him into custody for being concerned with others in stealing a quantity of money and bank notes in July last, that a man named Foley, a publican, was in custody for receiving one of the notes, and that he, Woodhouse, was recently found dealing with one of them, a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said, "I do not know what you are talking about, I know nothing about it, nor do I think you know what you are talking about yourself"—I told him to dress himself and said, "Pray how long do you intend to keep me here?" he said, "You know You must not ask me questions, it is not your duty"—after a time he was dressed, and we proceeded along Kingsland-road towards Shoreditch church—he said, "Where are you going to take me to?" I said, "To Foley's public house and if you are not identified you shall not be detained"—he made no answer for some time, but then said, "You can only make a witness of me, I will be a witness if you like; we went last Wednesday week with <hi rend="italic">Tom what's his-name</hi>; I do not know his name, but <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> Foley knows him for the last twenty years; we asked him whether he would buy a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; we told him it was queer; he said that he did not care a d—; we told him not to take it to the Bank or it would burn him; I do not think he took the note to the Bank himself, he sent somebody else; he said he would not be gone three quarters of an hour, and he was gone two hours and a half; the note was an old ripped up thing."</p>

I was drinking at the bar of the Artichoke, with Fox and Dudman, between 11 and 12 o'clock—at about five minutes to 12 o'clock I heard a ft row in the tap room, and directly the door came open I was knocked back-wards—the first blow was on my left eye, which was cut—I think it was done with a quart pot—I fell against the door leading from the bar—I got up again to see for my cap, and got another blow on my ear, which rendered me insensible, and I recollect no more—I had had no quarrel with anybody—I saw neither of the prisoners there—I did not see the man who struck me, it was all done so suddenly.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 22, Charles-square, Hoxton, and live on my property. On 28th Aug., about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in High-street, Southwark, coming from St. George's Church, towards London-bridge—a woman was telling me a pitiable tale in King-street, but was not within eleven inches or two feet of me—at the moment she went from me, I was iron bound, and was bent down by some one behind—I was seized round my throat, and was hurt severely—I felt it afterwards—while this person was holding my throat, there was one person on my right, and one on my left—they began pulling at my chain—it was all done in a moment—they wrenched off my buttons—the person on my right was pulling at my watch over my head—I struggled with all my might, and held my waistcoat—I held my watch as long as I could, till the one on my left wrenched my hand back—that was the prisoner—in doing that my thumb was very much out by my chain—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person who wrenched my hand away—they got away with my watch and chain—I gave 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the watch, and the chain cost me 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or some few shillings under—two of the men went to the right, and the prisoner went to the left—I pursued him, and never lost sight of him—he had got a crutch, like that which he has now—I got up to him, and he said, "What do you want? if you do not go off I will do for you"—I said, "You shall for me, or I let you; if you will walk till I get an officer, I will let you"—we walked on till I saw a police-man, and I said, "I will give this thief in charge"—we only walked about twice the length of this Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. On the night that I met you at the top of King-street, did not you say, "There is the villains, there they go?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I told you that you were one of the parties who had robbed me—I did not turn round and say", Very likely you are one of them, and I shall take you whether you are or not, for I can see nobody else"—when I ran you down, and captured you, you gave yourself into custody to the policeman—you can run like a young roe—I was not intoxicated, I had only had a little from one glass of brandy and water—I drank some water at the station house, but not half of a half pint—I did not charge you with robbing me of thirty-six guineas as well—I knew very well that you had not got the watch and chain: if I had gone after those who had, they would have killed me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 187). On 20th June I was stationed at Penge—about half past 1 o'clock, in the middle of that day, I was called out of my bed to put an end to a fight—I went to the Crooked Billet, and in front of that house outside I found a fight going on—there were a great number of men outside, I suppose 150, shouting, and making a noise—the prisoners were all there—I went quietly to the men, and told them to give over fighting—they said they would not be interfered with by the police—Collins said he would kill all the police that came to interfere—Collins struck violently at me three times—I put my arm up to save my head—the other men pushed me back—I do not remember that Ratcliff was there at the beginning, he was there soon afterwards—Collins struck at me three times, and the other prisoners were pushing me about, with a great many others—I went and stood at a short distance from them, and in a short time Cannon, another constable, came up—I sent for more assistance, and I told Cannon what had taken place, and we considered it was best not to interfere—the <hi rend="italic">men</hi> were getting up a pretended fight—I really did not notice who it was that pretended to fight, they were striking each other—they left off of their own accord soon after Cannon came, and a great number of them went into the Crooked Billet—I and Cannon remained outside, at the top of a court, leading to my house, which is close by the Crooked Billet—I then saw Pooley; she spoke to the men, and pointed out Cannon, and said, "That is the b——r that gave me a month, serve him out for it"—there were a great many persons outside the public house at that time—Pooler having said that went into the public house—she came out again is about five minutes, and Bavington, Collins, Sheppard, Dixon, and Kem<lb/>mish, came out with her—Cannon and I were still standing in the same place, at the top of the court, and four Persons came up to us—Bavington was one, but whether they were all the same men that came out of the public house, I do not know—they came down two abreast—Bavington pulled off part of his clothes, and said to the man by him, "You take that b—r, and I will take this"—Bavington struck Cannon directly, and the other man struck me—who the other man was, I do not know—I was then struck by a great many—there were but four at first—the other three struck me—Cannon 'and I stood on our own defence, and directly a great number came, as many as could get near us, but how many it is impossible for me to say—beside striking us with their fists, they threw stones at us—this struggle went on at the top of the court, for five or six minutes—soon after this Cannon was separated from me, and I was knocked down a few yards down the court—I was knocked down three times—I succeeded in getting up twice—the third time I could not get up for some time, and I was knocked about and kicked, and jumped upon—I was near my own door when I was knocked down the third time by Collins—Kemmish was in the court, and while I was on the ground with the truncheon in my hand, he stood on my hand and wrenched it out of my hand, and Sheppard kicked me on my left hip—I turned to prevent their kicking me, and they got on my back—I hallooed "Murder!" as loudly as I could, till I could halloo no longer—I then heard one of the men say, "Come away, leave him, he will do now"—I do not think I laid long in that court—Cannon came down the court the third time, as I was holding by the fence—Cannon and I got into my house, we fastened the door—some persons came down the court a</p>

               <p>very short time afterwards—I saw Bavington, Collins, Sheppard, Dixon, and Kemmish, outside my house—they looked in at the window, and then commenced throwing stones at us, and broke the window all to pieces—all the prisoners that I have mentioned took an active part in it—Cannon and I tried to keep the door shut, which we could not do, and Cannon said, "We had better leave, we shall be murdered"; the front door was burst in, and we went to the back—I saw Bavington, Collins, Sheppard, Dixon, and Kem<lb/>mish, in the house—at the time they came in, Collins had this large piece of wood (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) in his hand, which he had split off the bottom of the door—he held it in both his hands, and struck Cannon on the head with the edge of it—Cannon had a butcher's chopper in his band—Collins struck at Cannon's head with this board—Cannon put up his arm, and got the blow on his arm—I was attacked also in the room—I was in one corner and Can<lb/>non was in another—the furniture in the room was broken to pieces—these are the legs of my table (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw these legs in the hands of the persons in the room—I cannot Bay positively who had them, I was too much excited—there were some legs of chairs in some of their hands—1 was knocked down—one of them pulled me by the arm out of the corner I was in, and another knocked me down—when I got up I fought my way to the door—the violence had gone on in the house from five to ten minutes before I got out of the house—I did not see Cannon there at the time I fought my way out—I believe he was there—when I got to the door a man had a knife in his hand, and he made a stab at me as I went past—who it was I cannot say.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have mentioned Bavington, Collins, Sheppard, Dixon, and Kemmish as being in the room, and that Collins struck Cannon on the head; what did the other men do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were fighting with Cannon and me, and there were a great many others—the room was quite full—I do not remember Dixon doing anything particular inside the room, but outside he was trying to break the window in with his hand—Cannon put up the chopper, and Dixon put up his foot, and <hi rend="italic">smashed</hi> the window sash right in—I saw Ratcliff in the court leading to my house—that was the first time to my recollection of my seeing him—he was in the court following me—I do not know whether he took any part in the attack—I do not remember seeing Hurry take any part, but he came and spoke to me previous to Cannon coming up—I do not remember seeing him afterwards—I understood Hurry to say that he had got a father in the police, but nevertheless he would not suffer one of his mates to be taken away.</p>

               <p>except these prisoners—I saw several sham fights got up—I did not at all interfere—I saw Pooley come out of the grocer's shop with some bacon in her hand—she said, "That is the b——that gave me a calendar month serve him out, but spare the rest"—there were none of the police there but Wiles and me—she went into the public house, and came out again, and Bavington, Collins, Dixon, and Sheppard, came out of the public house—they came up to me and Wiles, took off their jackets, and Bavington said, "We are going to fight these b——policemen; I will take this, and you take the other"—Bavington then struck me with his fist in the left eye—I saw Wiles struck, but I could not say who struck him—I should say there were nearly fifty round us—I drew my truncheon and struck Bavington, and Wiles struck the other one—we kept them away as well as we could for some little time—Bavington closed on me, and shocked me up against the butcher's shop—some one called out, "Take the b—n truncheon away, and use it"—I passed my truncheon over the frost, and gave it to Mr. Wren, the butcher, who was in his shop—I then armed myself with a butcher's chopper that I saw lying in the shop—I took it to defend myself—Bavington kicked me on the leg—Mr. Wren assisted me with the long arm—I got in the shop, and Mr. Wren and I kept them oat as well as we could for Home little time, but the stones came so thick that I was obliged to retreat out at the back door—I should say there were forty or fifty in front of the shop engaged in throwing stones—all the male prisoners were there—Hurry was there while the stones were throwing but he was not throwing stones—Ratcliff was there at the commencement when Bavington commenced striking me, and Ratcliff said, "Give it the b——"—I am sure of that as to Ratcliff—I saw Ratcliff and Hurry in front of the butcher's shop—I did not see them throwing stones, but there was so many there, I could not say—I noticed Hurry jumping about and shouting, but I did not see him throwing stones—the stones were thrown so fast that I retreated out at the back door—Wiles was then gone down the court—he was not in the shop—when I got out I met Sheppard standing in the court—he said, "Here comes one b"——and he tried to prevent my going up the court—I had the chopper in one hand, and my truncheon in the other—I struck him with the truncheon, and I went on towards Wiles, whom I saw standing at his own door—I and Wiles went into hi house, and we locked and bolted the door—his house is at the back of the butcher's shop—no great distance down the court—when we got into Wiles's house, there were a number of them throwing stones through Wiles's window—I noticed amongst them Sheppard and Kennish—there were several others—I could not particularly identify any other—they were all about there—they were in the court—the court was full of people—Bavington and Collins were there—I could not positively speak to any other—after they broke the window in with the stones, they forced the door in, and we tried to escape out of the back door—I distinctly saw Collins come in with this piece of board in his hand, which had formed the bottom part of Wiles's door—Collins took up this with both hands and struck at my head—I put up my arm, and the blow broke my arm—he struck me on the head afterwards—I had seven blows on my head—one was a severe blow, I believe it was done with this board—as my arm was broken I could not use the chopper—I struck Collins with the truncheon, and retreated to a corner of the room—I had seven blows on my head—not all with this board, some with these table legs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I was in the corner, Dixon called me out into the middle of the room, and said, "Come out, face</p>

               <p>me like a man"—I could not say how many persons were in the room—the room was full—immediately one of them turned the table bottom upwards (it was a Pembroke table), and broke the four legs off—Bavington, Shep<lb/>pard, and Dixon were amongst those who broke the table, and armed them selves with the legs—as I stood in the corner, they made strokes at my head with this board, and the legs of the table—they broke my. hat right in, and hit my head—I was then leaning against a corner in the angle of the room, supporting myself that way—I was not able to defend myself—I called out "Murder!" as well as I could, and they left me, and one of them said as they left me (I believe it was Dixon), "The b—r is dead enough now"—I was in a fainting state, leaning in the corner of the room, and when they got out, I tried to get up—I fell down—the neighbours came and got me up, washed my face, and gave me some brandy—I heard these people coming back again, and I crawled up stairs as well as I could—my head was cut all to pieces—my left arm was broken, and bruised from the shoulders to the wrist, and my left leg was bruised very much with the kicks—I saw Wiles in the room some five minutes after these persona broke in—there were so many there I could not see what position he was in—I saw some of the men strike him—the sergeant at last came, and I went away with him—I assisted in apprehending the prisoners—these men have been there about six weeks—I knew them by being about there—they had been drinking, and were about half-drunk, but every man was capable of knowing what he was about—I was a witness against Pooley; she had a month for picking pockets, on my evidence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horsekeeper to the South Eastern Bail-way; I lire near the Kent-road. On the morning of 25th July, I saw the prisoner Delora coming out of Mr. Ballard's front gate, a few minutes before 1 o'clock—that was at No. 1, Terrace, Old Kent-road—there was no one with him—I did not see him with anything—he passed me, and I lost sight of him—I did not see him at any other time that morning—after he came out I saw Gover and another person on the other side of the street—the other person left Gover, and went into the house—that was about five minutes after I saw Delora come out—I saw Gover afterwards—he was going from the house down the Kent-road, and he returned—I was opposite him the width of the Old Kent-road—I have no doubt Gover is the man—Delon came close to me as I was passing the front gate—I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 31, King-street, Kent-road; I am a horse-keeper keeper in the South Western Rail way. On the morning of 25th July I was walking past the house, No. 1, Terrace, Old Kent-road—I looked round, and saw a person beckon to some one to come out of the house—I did not stop, but directly I saw two persons come out at the door at the side of the house, and the three walked together for a short distance, and then one who had a cloak on advanced a little way ahead, and they kept that distance till they got to the end of Kent-street—the prisoners are the two persons that came out of the house—Gover was the one with the cloak.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. How near were you to them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Opposite—the road is about as wide as this Court is long—I had never seen them before—it was daylight, but it had been raining, which made it rather dark—they walked on one side, and I on the other—they walked on to Kent-street, and went on—I went down there—I am sure it was a loose cloak, with a fur collar—I noticed it because I thought there was something amiss—I did not see the door before they came out—the door is at the side of the house—I was opposite the passage which leads to the door—I saw Delora come out first, and the other afterwards—they came out smoking; that made me notice it—the passage is about the length of this Court—I might be double the length of this Court when I saw them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you saw the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw the doorway—I cannot say whether the door was shut or open—I saw the doorstep—I will swear I saw them come out, and step on that door step—they joined the other man at a short distance—those houses have a little green lawn in</p>

               <p>front—the houses have about six windows in front—I do not know anybody that lives in these houses—I should think they are not such houses as the prisoner might have—I cannot say whether persons might get up that passage, and lie about at night—there is room for it—I cannot say whether No. 2 is inhabited.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was the man standing who beckoned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Close to the gate—he beckoned for them to come out—I heard a sudden stop—that was the man who beckoned—I saw him stop at the side of the door—the door is up steps, but you go some distance before you get to the door—you go from the pavement to the fore court, and then on to the door—I am quite sure I had a good opportunity of seeing the men's faces.</p>
