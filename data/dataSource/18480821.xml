On 10th July, the prisoner came for a glass of ale and tendered a shilling—I put it into my pocket—a few minutes after she was gone I took it out, and found it was bad—I had another shilling in my pocket, and I was not positive that the prisoner gave me the bad one—on 17th July she came again, called for a glass of ale and tendered a bad shilling—I said, "This is a bad shilling, are you not ashamed of yourself, you passed one with me last week?"—she said she had not been in the house before—I sent for an officer, and gave him the shillings.</p>

On the morning of 3rd July, I was on duty in the Inland office—the prisoner was employed there—there are several tables, distinguished from each other by letters—the prisoner was stationed at the table letter C—the Scarborough bag would be taken to that table and opened—it was the prisoner's duty to open it, take out the letters, and separate them—I had received directions to watch the prisoner during the performance of his duty—I was looking at him when the Scarborough bag was brought to his table, that was about a quarter-past six o'clock—I saw him open it, take out the letters, and put them on the table before him—there is a letter-bill along with each bag, with the amount of paid letters—the prisoner puts all the bills before him on the table as he opens the bags—I could not distinctly see the Scarborough bill by itselt—there might have been twent or thirty bags opened at table C—it would be</p>

               <p>the prisoner's duty to open them all—as many as can be carried are put on the table at once—I saw him put two letters before him on one of the letter-bills—I was not near enough distinctly to read their addresses—one of them had two red postage stamps on it—the letter-bills should state what letters are registered letters—it would be the prisoner's duty to fold up the registered letters in the bill, and put them into a drawer under the table provided for that purpose—the letters that are not registered are put on one side for a senior clerk to examine—I saw that the prisoner did that, leaving the two letters where he first put them—I could see they were not registered letters, because all registered letters are marked "registered" in red ink—I was near enough to see that there was no such writing upon them—I saw him take the registered letters out of the drawer and give them to the register clerk when he came round to the table—they are put over to the stamper's and stamped when he opens the bag, before he gives them to the register clerk—the register clerk, when he receives the registered letters," checks them by the bill to which they refer, and then signs the bill—Mr. Davis was the register clerk that morning—I saw him go to the prisoner and receive the registered letters—I saw the two letters that I had previously noticed, the prisoner put them on one side, and after he had given the registered letters to the register clerk, he put them into the drawer again—Mr. Davis then went to his desk—the duty went on, and other registered letters were collected in the drawer—after the prisoner had finished opening the bags he took all the letters out of the drawer, and went up towards the register clerk with them and the bills—I followed him to the register clerk—he gave the register clerk the letters and bills which he carried—they were checked with each bill, by the clerk, and signed for—he still retained in his band the bill, folded up as if it contained letters—I know it was a bill by the red colour of it—he then proceeded in a direction towards his own table—he did not go there, but went towards down stairs, to the water-closets—I immediately made a communication to Mr. Hodd, one of the presidents—I afterwards went down to the water-closets—I saw Peak, the officer, take these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the basin of a water-closet—I am sure this letter was one that I bad seen lying on the pri<lb/>soner's table, it is the one with two stamps—I know it by the handwriting—Iliad noticed the hand-writing as it laid on the table—I could not speak to the other—this one was lying over the other—I could tell the form of the handwriting—they both bear the Scarborough post-mark—they have not the stamp of the Inland office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintending-president of the London District Post-office. The fragments of a letter was brought to me on 13th July—I sent for the prisoner, who was brought to my room a little before ten o'clock—I put these parts of the letter together, so as to ascertain that it formed one letter, and so as to see its contents—I charged him with stealing a letter that morning—I had the fragments in my hand—he said, "I have no letter about me"—I said, "I know that, but you had the letter in your pocket when you were taken into Mr. Bell's room"—he made no reply to that—I then said, "The letter contained a duplicate, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two postage stamps, and you stole a letter on Saturday morning"—he said no, he did not—Cole then asked him if he had any postage stamps about him—he said he had two—I said, "Produce them?" and he said they were in his office coat-pocket—that coat was sent for, and examined—there were none there—he then produced a pocket-book, which was examined, but nothing found in it—I said, "Peak the officer must be sent for to search him," and the prisoner then took his watch from his pocket, and on his opening it two postage stamps were found in the case—I then said, "These postage stamps were stolen from the letter"—he made no reply to that—I then took him to the solicitor's office, but before doing so I asked if he had any explanation to offer—he said, '" I did it; I am very sorry; I do not know what could have induced me to do it, but I did not take the letter on Saturday"—I think he said it was distress that made him do it—I think his wages were 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he had only just married, and I expressed my regret to him at the time,</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter-carriers, at the London District Branch office. A letter addressed to Mr. Ponsford, ought to go to Paddington—letters in the vicinity of. Paddington are delivered at the North-road Branch office—the prisoner was employed there, and was on duty there on 1st July—it was his duty to assist in sorting the letters of that division—this letter would go to that district—it should go to an office at Paddington, where the letter-carriers meet, and not to the office where the pri<lb/>soner was, but letters are sometimes missorted—sometimes we have 60 mis<lb/>sorted—letters addressed to Mr. Ponsford have come to the office since this—Mr. Ponsford is in the Paddington district—the prisoner was last on duty on 10th July—he came on 11th, but Peak came to see him, and he went out saying he was indisposed—on 1st July, he was a supernumary letter-carrier, on the Edgware-road, in the vicinity of South Wharf-road—he continued there till the 4th, doing duty for a sick man—if a letter addressed to Mr. ponsford accidentally got into his possession, it would be his duty to give it up for me to return it to St. Martin's-le-graud—this letter, addressed to me, is in the prisoner's writing—I first saw it at Bow-street, after Peak had been to Liverpool—the letter to Messrs. Moses is also the prisoner's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you seen him write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I am inspector of his office, I have seen his writing on the back of letters, saying he cannot find the parties—this letter from Cork seems to be written in a hurried way—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Cork, July 18th Sir,—having succeeded in reaching my native shore, my first step was to obtain some information from Bow-street—I find by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of Friday, the affair is greatly exaggerated—the amount of the cheque was 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and also, the boy has not told a particle of truth.

               <p>paliation of my folly, nor my subterfuge for my guilt. But this I declare to you and to the God who knows it well, and before whom I must at some future day appear, and I hope before I appear in Newgate, that I had no knowledge of how the cheque was obtained until the Friday night following the fatal 4th July; and up to that melancholy day, my character and integrity was as pure and unstained as it was at the age of seven. But lo! there was a fatal hour, and that was the hour of two o'clock; the bargain was con<lb/>cluded, and I have sold that which I thought the wealth of Peru could not purchase—my character. My colleague in iniquity, who was a person totally unconnected with the office, but who was concerned in some same way with a mercantile house, deluded me into the belief that chance threw it in his own way; first taking good care to use those stimulants necessary on such occa<lb/>sions—brandy and water. The fact was, as I have subsequently discovered, and when too late, that it came from head quarters, the sorting office. Finding I was made a complete tool of, and that I could scarcely escape de<lb/>tection, I considered it more advisable to inhale the breeze of my native mountains, than the air of Bermuda, having by mere accident met this woful acquaintance of mine; and I believe when every other remedy was tried by himself, induced me to accompany him to the Minories.—I am, Sir, &amp;c, J.

                  </hi>. I am chief assayer of the Goldsmiths' Company. I received this purse on 2nd Aug., for the purpose of being assayed—I assayed it—it is not silver—the ingredients of standard silver are 1loz. 2 dwts. of fine silver to 18 dwts. of copper in the 12oz. lb.—this is 2oz. 18 dwts. worse than standard—the Goldsmiths' Company would not permit the mark to have been put on such an article as this, as silver—it would be base metal—it is the practice if anything of this sort is brought there, which is not up to standard to break it to pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It would be one-eighth or one-ninth part less valu<lb/>able than if it was standard silver? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Considerably less than standard—standard silver would be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the ounce, and this is about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is only those persons that have their punches entered at the company who can get the mark put on—I am not aware that the prisoner is one, nor Johnson—there are a good many working silversmiths not entered at the company, who get a friend who has his name entered, to get things marked for them—the company first had information about this on 1st Aug., and I went to Dr. Halley—I got my information from the solicitor of the company—I do not know where he got his information from—I have not seen Johnson at the hall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy-warden of the Goldsmiths' Company. I have examined the rim of the mounting of this purse—it is not such a mark as is used for this species of article, but for tea-spoons and other small spoons—the letter "I," in old English, is on it—that letter is used to denote the year in which the article is stamped—that is not the proper letter for the pre<lb/>sent year—it was used last on 29th May, 1845—a different letter is used every year—the proper mark for such an article as this would have been altogether different—part of the marks would have been put on the front of the clasp and part on the back, to prevent the possibility of a part of this being made use of and attached to a piece not hall marked, and there would also have teen a small mark on each of the mountings of the tassels and all the small movable pieces—the mark on the front would have been the lion passant and the leopard's head—I believe this mark has been let in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What mark is on it now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The lion passant, the letter for the year, the leopard's head, and the Queen's bead—if it was properly marked, the Queen's head and the letter would have been</p>

               <p>placed on the other side—the lion's head and the leopard's head would be there, but all the marks would be differently arranged—an ordinary working silversmith ought to know that this was not the correct mark—if he is in the habit of sending manufactured work to Goldsmiths' Hall, he must know it, or if he was in the habit of making articles of this description—we do not mark very many of these in a year—the prisoner's name is not entered at the hall, nor is Johnson's—I knew nothing of them before—it was Johnson who gave me the information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you put the Queen's head on all articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and the leopard and the letter for the year, but the difference is in the arrange<lb/>ment—this mark would not be used for large spoons—tea-spoons are marked by a press, at a single blow, but such articles as these are marked by punches put on by hand, with a hammer.</p>

I knew the prisoner at Edinburgh, and worked as a shopmate with him there—I met him in London, about two years ago, and since then have at times assisted him in his work—I remember the order of Dr. Halley, for the <hi rend="italic">sporran</hi>—I went into Gordon's shop just after he had got the order for it—he said he was rather busy, and would I assist him in making the purse—I said I would—this is it—I got the metal from Gordon—I was in the shop when Dr. Halley called about it—it was not then finished—the doctor said that he wanted it made of good silver, that he did not think it was silver, and he wanted it hall marked—the top part of it was mounted at that time, except two little bits at the side—the chasing was on it before it went to be mounted—after Dr. Halley had left, Gordon said that he would get a tea-spoon, and take the stamp from that, and solder it in—he asked me to do it—I said I would not do such a thing for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said he had much better break it up, and get a good one at once—I knew at that time that it was not proper metal—I laid it down and went away—that was about six o'clock at night—I went back in the morning, and the stamp was in it—(I had mounted it before that—I made all the silver part of it, except the chasing)—Gordon asked me if it was not done very neatly—I think I made the same remark that I did before, that I would not do the same thing for a good sum of money—when it was finished I accompanied the prisoner to Dr. Halley's door, and handed the purse to a servant, with the bill—I did not get paid for it—about a fortnight after I had a quarrel with the prisoner, and left him—it was somewhere in May that Dr. Halley called—I took the purse home, between two and three days and a week after that.</p>

I gave him most of the poison"—I asked whether she had taken any of it herself—she said, "Cer<lb/>tainly not"—she was not sick, and showed no symptoms of having taken poison—I administered emetics, and the second child was well next day—this boy was tolerably well next morning, but was still in pain—there were teathings on the table, and a jug, containing what I at first thought was milk—I asked what it was, and was told it was not milk, but a solution of sugar of lead—I tried it by chemical means, and found that account was quite right—it was a very powerful solution—I gave the contents of the jug to a woman in the next room, who said she would lock them up, but they have never been found, she says some one came for them, in my name, and she gave them up, and they were thrown away—I think this boy would have died, if medical assistance had not been at hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The stomach was rejecting the poison when you arrived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not think the stomach would have gone on to reject all the poison, it is not impossible—the room presented the appearance of poverty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you a member of the College of Surgeons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I am a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company—this boy had vomited a great deal I was told, and was still vomiting when I was there—I did not analyze anything which was rejected from his stomach, or preserve any of it—the three children were vomiting all over the room, and on the beds—there was no vessel used—what was in the jug was cold, it appeared like milk, slightly curdled, it was of a light colour towards the top—if sugar of lead is dissolved in water, it would be opaque—goulard water is made from it—that is a solution of acitate of lead—it is not a sub-acitate—it has been called a super-acitate—I am acquainted with Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence—I do not know that he says goulard extract is formed of sub-acitate of lead—it would not make any difference in its poisonous qualities—I tasted it, it had a sort of sub-acid sweet taste—I tested it by litmus paper, to ascertain whether it was a more active poison—it slightly reddened it, which denoted the pre<lb/>sence of acid—oxalic acid would have made it very red—any mineral acid would produce redness in different degrees—I tested it to influence me as to the antidote—I afterwards added a solution of hydro-sulphate of potash, which precipated black—the boy's symptoms were, rolling on the bed and drawing up his legs, a sort of convulsive appearance—the mouth was of a grey colour, he had great pain in the abdomen—it is not the effect of taking sugar of lead that the pain is eased by pressure—I have known cases where</p>

               <p>persons have taken sugar of lead accidentally, and I think the pain has been increased by pressure—I will not be positive—I should think twenty or thirty grains would be sufficient to produce the effect I saw on this boy—it would take an ounce of water to hold that quantity of sugar of lead in suspension, that is two table spoonfulls of water—that would make the sort of solution I saw—about three grains will render a quart of water milky—I said to the prisoner; "What induced you to do this?"—she said she was in distress, and had been threatened with a distraint for rent—she expressed great anxiety about all her children—she seemed in strong bodily health, but very distressed and excited—she was rocking backwards and forwards on a chair, and exclaiming against her folly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What should you judge of her mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not im<lb/>paired—I should say she was distressed—I do not think she is insane—the woman who said the prisoner had given the child sugar of lead, was standing close by her—it was then that she said, "Save the baby, sir, I gave that the most of the poison."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the partners in the firm of John Ismay Nicholson and Co.—there are three partners—we carry on business at Nicholson's Wharf, Lower Thames-street—we have a wharf and warehouse for the reception of goods—the prisoner came into our employ in Feb., 1847—we have different floors for the reception of different goods—the prisoner had the sole charge and superintendence of the fruit floor—he came on 30th May, in the morning, stated he was not well, and left before I arrived—from that day he did not attend his duty at the warehouse—I sent a man to him next day, and I went myself on the following Saturday to the place he lived at—we could not find him—I had caused an examination to take place on the floor under his care—a person called several times at our counting-house, and on two occasions I had conversation with that person—and I received this letter, which is in the prisoner's writing: (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"July 24th, 1848, 28, Mount-street, Whitechapel. Gentlemen,—I arrived in London last night, after travelling 200 miles, to meet your wishes and that of my friends, who advise me to wait upon you and give you every information that I can respecting the missing goods, &amp;c. For that purpose, gentlemen, I am now here; I am anxious to throw every light in my power, on a transaction which I fear my continued absence has given a colouring anything but favourable to my character. Awaiting your commands, I am, Gentlemen, your obedient humble servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM HENRY SMITH</hi>.—To Messrs. Nicholson and Co.") The prisoner came to the counting-house on 29th July—I stated to him that there was a large deficiency in his department, handing to him a paper con<lb/>taining the amount of the deficiency, 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he could explain the deficiency he thought, and I gave him till the following Tuesday to do so, which would be 1st Aug.—I saw him on 1st Aug., but did not enter into it then because I was engaged—he came on 2nd Aug., by appointment—he said he would explain the deficiency in one particular parcel, that of Stubbs and Church's—he said there was an error in the delivery—I told him that error had been corrected, that they had acknowledged receiving eleven boxes more than he had charged against them—the total number of boxes of Stubbs and Church's which appeared by his account to be deficient was fifty—that eleven made thirty-nine to be accounted for.</p>

On 11th Nov., 1847, there were landed at—Nicholson's Wharf, from the ship <hi rend="italic">Nimble</hi>, 2642 boxes of raisins—they were deposited in the fruit floor, of which the prisoner had the care—they were imported on account of Stubbs and Church, and marked with a diamond and C----when I went into the fruit floor I asked the prisoner if he had made them all right—I cannot remember the words he used, but he gave me an admission of some sort or other—here is the warehousing book of that day—here is the entry in the prisoner's writing—he charges himself with the reception of these boxes—on 2nd Dec, 1847, we received 200 bags of white pepper by the <hi rend="italic">Felicity</hi>, numbered from 1 to 200, on account of Peck and Co.—in the prisoner's book, in his own handwriting, he charges himself with having received them—I saw him on that occasion, and he gave an admission of some sort or other of having received these goods—on 19th Nov. I received sixty-nine boxes of Jordan almonds by the <hi rend="italic">Leonidas</hi> from Malta, marked O, on account of John Dalgleish—in the prisoner's warehousing book here is the same entry—on that occasion I agree in amount with him—all those goods were placed in the fruit floor—on 9th Nov.

I was at Nichol<lb/>son's wharf, and received him in custody—I found on him this memorandum<lb/>book. <hi rend="italic">The contents of the book being read, were as follows</hi>:—"In this unplea<lb/>sant business of ours, I find I have but two alternatives; the one is, to confess all I know to N. and Co.; the other is, to leave the country. N. and Co. have told a friend of mine who called upon them to plead in my behalf, that if I will tell all, and who bought the goods, they are inclined to be merciful towards me. Now, if I do this, I must compromise you most fearfully. I do not wish to do anything of the kind; I wish to leave the country for ever. I have made arrangements to do so, and my friends are trying to raise money to accomplish this. I think, taking all things into consideration, you ought</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210052"/>
               <p>to contribute towards this object. 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would greatly assist me; and I think you will see the great necessity there is. 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would make up the sum necessary to take me quite away, and I think I have every right to call upon you for that amount; your safety so much depends upon it. I therefore expect that you enclose me a Post-office order for that amount, so that I may get the money to-morrow before twelve o'clock. Do not fail in this, as worse may follow."—" Gentlemen, I wish to address a few words to you touching the unfortunate affair now at issue between us, before I leave this countryfor ever. You apprehend that I have robbed you, and unfortunately appearances are greatly against me; but although I have been mixed up in one or two mat<lb/>ters which has to some extent compromised me, yet they cannot be set down as robberies. A counsel at the bar must greatly pervert the truth to induce any jury of Englishmen to bring in a verdict against me. That goods have been missing, I was well aware for some time past; but I can most positively state that I was quite ignorant how they went. I was thunder-struck, and I positively would (indeed I made an effort to raise the money) have paid up all deficiencies if I by any possibility could; but 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a great sum for a poor fellow like me to raise. But if God spares my life, and if I have ever so moderate a share of success in the new country to which I am bound, I most solemnly promise to remit you money by instalments till every defalca<lb/>tion is made good to you. Messrs.----ought to take into consideration, in proof of my innocence, that had I been so disposed, I could have taken goods of much less bulk, and much more valuable than fruit; in fact I could have robbed them of hundreds, in lieu of the paltry amount charged against me. The facilities, to persons dishonestly inclined, to rob, are greater at N. W. than I ever remember to have seen at any other W. wherever I have been. Not only can the foreman deliver any quantity of goods without the slightest check, but even the very labourer employed, can, in his temporary absence, send out goods with ninety-nine chances out of every hundred in their favour of never being detected. Your own words, so often repeated to me, to keep a sharp look-out after the fellows, for they would rob you before your eyes, would prove that you were not ignorant of the facilities afforded to the evil-disposed. Messrs.----will I hope ponder over this, and cause some alteration in a system to which I have fallen the victim; a knowledge of this fact would make importers of goods think twice before they sent their goods; and however glad I am that there is every probability of my escape from the disgrace of a public prosecution, I am equally glad that a further injury will not fall upon my late employers through my instrumentality. Is conclusion, I beg to state that so paltry a robbery is not at all in accordance with my character. I am either good or bad in great degrees. Had I robbed you at all, it should have been to some amount; had I robbed you at all, rather than allow myself to have been compromised, I would have fired the warehouse."

On Sunday, 6th Aug., about half-past one, I came out, in consequence of hearing a noise, and saw the prisoner and his wife—she was lying on the ground, with her back against the wall, which has an iron railing on the top of it—the prisoner picked her up by her two arras, stood her on her feet, with her back against the wall, and said, "Stand up"—I do not know whether he did that care<lb/>fully—he then took hold of her shoulders, and shook her rather roughly—the back part of her head stuck in between the railing—her head seemed to hang down a little as he raised her up—it appeared as if her neck was not strong enough to hold her head up—she slid down again, and he pressed his knee against her stomach—she was standing—she fell on the ground, and he walked away—I said, "You brute to illuse the woman like that"—he turned round and said, "Look at the dirty <hi rend="italic">fagot</hi> "—I think he meant the woman—I afterwards went into the house—she was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 6th Aug., about half-past one, I was called to the deceased—she appeared dead, but I was not quite certain—I had her removed into a house, and opened a vein—a very few drops of blood flowed—I could find no external marks of violence—on 19th, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination with Mr. Courtnay—there was a great extravasa<lb/>tion of blood at the base of the brain—the larger quantity was on the left side—it appeared to arise from the rupture of a blood-vessel—a blow with a clenched fist on the left side of the head would be likely to produce it—it night not have left an external mark—the brain was not very healthy—a blow to a subject of that kind, though not very violent, might rupture a blood-vessel—the extravasation of blood was the immediate cause of death—the brain was slightly congested, so that less violence would produce serious consequences.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The brain was very much diseased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was of long standing—I imagine from the effluvia, she had been drinking all the morning—if she had been very drunk, the exertion of walking would not be so likely to produce extravasation as if she had fallen down—if she had resisted a person, it is possible the excitement would have caused it, but not so probable as a blow—if her head fell back against the railings, that would very likely cause it.</p>

I assisted Mr. Park in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and agree with him as to all the appearances, but would add, that the rupture appeared to be of a cluster of vessels, and not of a single one, which leads me to think death arose from violence rather than from disease—one vessel only would give way at one time from disease.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in bottled beer, in Crutched-friars. I was at the counting-house on Saturday, 22nd July—I saw a man named Williams—he spoke to me—after he was gone I went and asked Brooks if he knew anything of Williams—he said, "Very little, but there is a man outside, named <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, who knows him"—<hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> is a porter—I spoke to <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, and told him not to let any goods go out of the cellar, as I was not satisfied with the man Williams, and to let no goods go out unless I was there—I can very seldom go to my place on a Monday, as I am engaged for a brewery—I went on the Wednesday, about twelve o'clock—Brooks ought to have been there, but he was not—there was no one on the premises—I waited till nearly six—Brooks did not come—I undid the hasp of the door, and found in the cellar a lot of straw—I missed some ale and some stout and two baskets—the sell<lb/>ing price of the ale is about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, the stout about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, and the pints are 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is, to the trade—I live in Charles-street, Islington—I left a note, and the next day Brooks came to my house—I said to him, "Henry, how is this about these things in the City?"—he said, "I suppose you think I know something of them"—I said, "Certainly; how can I think otherwise?"—he said, "Oh, if you think that, I will fetch a policeman, or something to that effect—I said, "No; I will make further inquiries"—I said, "If things were wrong, why did you not come and tell me?"—I gave him into custody—the usual way when goods were sold, was for me to make a bill, and he to bring back the counterpart, signed—he was never to sell in my absence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Tysoe-street, Spa-fields. I occasionally assist, Mr. Hobson in a friendly way. On Monday, 24th July, I went to his pre<lb/>mises—I saw Brooks, he said to me, '" Williams has been, and wanted to see my master"—I said, "Then he must wait"—Williams came to the counting-house about ten minutes afterwards—I did not see that he had a cart with him,—he came into the counting-house—Brooks was there—Williams asked if Mr. Hobson was there—I said, "No"—he said he came to see him about some ale and stout—I said, I could not say anything about it—he went. out and returned in about half an hour—he asked if Mr. Hobson was there—I said he was not—he said it was all <hi rend="italic">humbug</hi> his waiting about like that—I said I knew nothing about it, I could not help it—he said, "You can take the money for the ale, can't you?"—I said, "Yes; if you are going to pay for it on delivery"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Very well"—Randall, Brooks, and Williams then went out of the counting-house, in the direction of the cellar—(Randall was there with the cart when Williams came the second time)—in about ten minutes I went into the cellar myself—I found Brooks and Randall there—Brooks was taking the ale and putting it into a dozen baskets, and Randall was carrying it to the cart for Williams to pack—Williams was with the cart then—Brooks said, "He has got three dozen"—they still went on till they had got eight dozen of ale—Williams then came off the cart into the cellar, and asked me about the stout—I said, "It is use<lb/>less asking me about the stout; I am sure you have not bought it; if you had, I am positive Mr. Hobson would have made it known to me"—while Williams was talking to me about the stout in the cellar, Randall took the cart away—I turned round, and saw the cart was gone—I said to Brooks, "What is the use of going off with half the load; why did be not wait till Mr. Hobson came?"—he made no answer at all—I gave them leave to pack some stout against Mr. Hobson came, and if it was incorrect, it was to remain there—I remained till they had packed two dozen, and then went to the counting-house to speak to a gentleman—Brooks came in and said, "Williams is gone to borrow some prickles"—I looked out, but I could not see anything of him—Williams did not come back—I directly went down into the cellar with Brooks, and told him he was very stupid for letting the man go without my knowledge—I said, "You have let the man go, the goods are gone, and where will you apply to for the money?"</p>

               <p>I might hear said—there were a great many persons present, but still there was room for more—it was inconveiently crowded at that portion where the persons were assembled together, still there was room sufficient for other persons—I cannot tell the exact time the defendant spoke—it might have been half an hour—I would not undertake to swear that he did not speak for nearer three-quarters of an hour—I do not think his speech extended to an hour—my impression is, it was about half an hour—I took this down in pencil and signed it in ink—I am sure it is signed in ink—the signature was put not a great while ago—I have had these notes in my possession without the signature—they have never left my possession since the evening of 31st July—I signed it about an hour ago, because I was requested to sign it by a superior officer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not say so at first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took the question to be, whether the person who handed me the paper asked me if it was correct—I do not remember that I was asked whether I had anything to add to it—the defendant said, with a very little exception, the charge was an entire fabrica<lb/>tion—he asked me whether I had taken notes at the time—I answered that he had not an opportunity without being observed—(<hi rend="italic">the Witness's deposition being read, was as follows</hi>)—"On Monday evening, 31st July last, I attended a meeting held at the house 83, Dean-street, Soho—I had attended meetings there before, and know it is used for meetings of the Chartists—I was in plain clothes on the occasion in question—the meeting was held in a large room capable of holding 200 persons, on the first floor—there were from 100 to 150 who appeared to be principally mechanic, some women, and children—I heard a young man read some extracts from a newspaper—one of the expressions used as an extract from the paper was, 'To hell with the Queen'</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210083"/>
               <p>—that expression met with general applause—I heard the defendant speak. about five or ten minutes after that extract had been so read—I paid strict attention to certain portions of his speech, with a view to carry them in my memory—he stated as follows, 'The late insurrection in Paris has shown how easy a Crown can be crumbled; now is the time to be ready, now is the time to be resolute, and the game your own—I do not care for those persons present who wear other people's clothes—I do not care if what I say is criminal—I for my own part shall do all in my power during the next week to put a stop to trade, and urge the Irishmen in London to rebellion '—there was general applause at the conclusion of the last sentence—I was about six yards from the prisoner.

"An address. Educate that you may be free. My Brothers, we live in very extraordinary times—the spirit of Revolution is fast thickening around us, and Freedom marching with giant strides over the earth, making even Kings and Governments sub<lb/>missive and obedient to the will and authority of the people—the people, the despised and oppressed victims of every species of aristocratic insolence which pampered wealth and outgrown profligacy could invent, the people at last forcing their recognition of their power, as expressed by M. de Lafayette when he said, 'For a nation to love liberty it is sufficient that she knows it—to be free, it is sufficient that she wills it;" the people, in whose ranks it is our proud boast to be numbered, striking down with a mental sledge those innumerable grievances that tend to enslave them; yes, the people, even in this country, crippled as they are by class legislation, the inevitable offshoot of personal aggrandizement, which, if permitted to continue, would stamp indelibly on the character of Englishmen "that most unholy and ungenerous passion called selfishness; albeit, the utter extinction of nationality, a death<lb/>blow to patriotism. In this condition, my brothers, as a portion of the people, it is befitting us to resolve what course to pursue, whether to return in seclusion within the precincts of selfishness and despair, and with open your mouth and shut your eyes, policy, wait and see what these Lords of the soil will send you; or whether, obeying the instinctive spirit of freedom which in youth swells our souls with passions and our hearts with firmness and resolution, we disregard the timid injunctions of Conservatism, and dare to climb the hill of life, regardless of the dangers attending, that we may one day realize the promise of a beautiful prospect from the top, the prospect of a nation lifted from the slough of moral, social, and political despond, in which we find her, to a state of contentment and happiness. To aid in the accomplishment of this task we offer to devote ourselves, and now let us consider in the first place its true extent and nature, and in the second place the means of accomplishment within our reach, &amp; c. I now come at once to the lever by which the whole machinery of our league must be worked, namely, the obtainment of the suf<lb/>frage in its most unrestricted meaning; for as Government is for the whole people and not a class, and as the object of Government is to promote the hap<lb/>piness and improvement of the whole people and not a class, and as all the people, individually or collectively, take a life and death interest in the promo<lb/>tion of their individual and collective happiness, it follows, therefore, that the entire people by the exercise of individual power, are the true holders of legislative power; this step once obtained we would advance for the over<lb/>throw of a class legislation from whence all class distinctions emenate—Royalty and all its attendant manifestations of middle-aged despotism, must</p>

Ireland is in arms, oh! at last, amid doubtings and eclipses, the Sun of Ireland peeps through the murky clouds—the heat is diffusing alike its brilliant light and its genial warmth to bless her rugged surface! Oh, yes, Ireland, in spite of all the machinations which tyranny could invent, ruthless and blood-gorged tyranny could do, Heaven's pure light stalks; pierced thy dungeons, and those felons' chains, that with Lilliputian ingenuity strove to enthrall the slumbering giant of Irish discontent, falls to the earth! When God's greatest blessing, liberty, had breathed upon them, yes, our pledged faith partook of the invocation, which falling from a Grattan's tongue, dashed the blood-stained sceptre from the quivering grasp of British despotism: yes, the invocation when Britons trembled as the voice of united millions taught to know their strength, proclaimed it; yes, the invocation which when Freedom's draught was quaffed but inflamed the canker of past misrule and scenes of blood, and we followed to behold her once more in arms against her gaoler—yes, the invocation which, when a victor of Waterloo and a bantling of Tamworth dared to crush a nation's voice, hurled its thunder<lb/>shaft of defiance from Mallow, making the puny intruders shrink again; yes, the invocation which, when a storm of desires had wrecked our bark of pride, our cherished-one, the lowly of Glasneven, gave life and action to slumber<lb/>ing thought, baptizing the young Phalanx in the name of liberty; yes, the invocation, which, when a partizan judge, a packed jury, and a juggling sheriff transported our dearest one to a foreign island, did instantly throw off the foibles which made our country infantile, and assumed, and at this moment does assume, a manly and different attitude. Too long, oh God! has out country bent in abject slavishness, supplicating for leave to live at the hands of those whose interests it is to make us starve. How long, oh God! shall thy throne be insulted by the piteous prayers of the crouching slave, sustained by the niggard crumbs of British charity: how long oh God! before this cringing herd becomes a dauntless band, lifting before thee their prostrate forms, erect and manly, and ring through the confused brain of Britain, the thrilling shout for justice, which though long delayed she must accord.

On 17th July I was in a boat on the Thames, near Blackwall, with the deceased John Doherty, and his father, mother, and sister—some barges belonging to the Trinity-house were moored near the West India Docks—I was in the stern-sheets of the barge—it was a lighter, not likes a coal-barge—the cabin—head was decked—there was one man on it, and another on the cabin—head—the prisoner was taking the wash-boards out—the deceased got out of his boat and came on to the barge, and asked the prisoner to let the wash-boards alone—the prisoner asked what that had to do with him, and said he did not belong to the barge—deceased said if he did not, he belonged to another belonging to the same Corporation, and it was all the same, and stepped down to take hold of one of the wash-boards—the prisoner said, "You <hi rend="italic">shan't</hi> have it," and challenged him down in the hold to fight—de<lb/>ceased stepped out of the boat into the barge, and said, "I am low enough where I am"—before he had time to go to the cabin head the prisoner struck him, and knocked him overboard—I was four or five feet from them—the other man did not interfere till deceased was knocked overboard—Dohertv had not time to raise his hand—his sister was on the barge—she got out of the boat before me, and had hold of him at the time he was knocked over, trying to pull him away—I saw him in the water, and stepped into the boat and <hi rend="italic">shored</hi> off to save him, but a steam-boat passed by, which caused a swell, and he was drowned—he was not prepared to fight—he had had a fever six weeks, and had only come out to see the rowing-match—there was only one person on that part of the barge when he was struck.</p>

"—my brother used angry words—the prisoner said, "Come down in the hold and fight"—my brother said he was low enough—I took hold of his hand and said, "John come along," as I saw words were going to occur, and said, "I shall go"—he took my right hand and said, "Wait a minute"—he had not time to turn round, when the prisoner hit him, and he fell overboard—his other hand was down by his side—my father and mother went to look for him—I took hold of the prisoner and said, he was the man that threw my brother over<lb/>board, and said I would follow him wherever he went—he took hold of me and said, "You b----y bitch, if you say much more, I will throw you where I threw your brother "—I took off my bonnet and hailed for assistance—two gentlemen came in a boat—I went ashore with him in the boat to the station, and did not lose sight of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lodging-housekeeper, in St. Georse's-in-the-East. I was on the aft of the barge, about 'midships, and saw the prisoner, his wife, and several women—I had seen him before, but did not know his name—they were on board before me—there were ten or twelve men on the barge in different parts, and about as many women—I should say there were more than twenty—the deceased came up alongside in a boat with several others—he came on board and came up to the prisoner and his wife, and several other women, and desired them to get up—they did so—he took the board, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it down to the bottom of the barge, and went away about 'midships—it appeared to have been put there for the accommodation of the women—he began abusing the parties sitting on the board—the prisoner said, "Do you belong to the barge? "—he said, "If I do not belong to this barge I belong to some other one"—the prisoner said, "If you don't let that board alone I will give you in charge of the police"—deceased then began talking about pulling noses and punching heads—the prisoner said, "If you want to punch my head you had better come and do it "—deceased then went to him, doubling his fists, but did not hit him—the prisoner was sitting on the cabin—head, his wife had hold of his arm, holding him down—the deceased stepped three steps back—the prisoner said, "You had better punch my head"—the deceased was going at him again, when the prisoner's brother, who wore a blue frock and a straw hat, got up and gave the deceased a push to prevent the blow, and through the gunwale of the boat being slanting, he was overbalanced and fell overboard—the deceased was near enough to strike the prisoner when he was pushed—I kept my eye upon William Green—he got into a boat with about five men, and rowed ashore as fast as he could—I jumped into my own boat, caught him on the West India Dock Pier, and gave him in charge of the dock constable, who took him to the station—I said, "You <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> that man overboard "—he said, '" I could not help it'—the prisoner never touched the deceased—he was in the act of rising—there is no doubt he would have struck him, but his wife held him down.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am a barrister, and am one of the directors of the Medical, Legal, and General Mutual Life-Assurance Society, to which the prisoner filled the situation of secretary and actuary, from 1846, when it was completely registered—he had been employed previously to that—in conse<lb/>quence of circumstances that attracted the attention of the directors, the prisoner was suspended, I think, on 18th April—I went through the accounts with him on 24th April, after his suspension—he had the account of premiums and the interest account—I went through the interest account with him—this is the ledger—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at page 136 here is an entry headed "Interest on Shares"—amongst the entry of paid dividends, here is a dividend entered as paid to Dr. Chalmers—I do not think I called over these names to the prisoner—I had been through the account previously by myself, and I said to him, "Mr. Morris, here are several entries here of money paid for interest for which I have no vouchers"—he said, "The vouchers, I think, are in the iron safe"—this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is the form of a receipt used in reference to the payment of dividends due on 31st Dec.—this account in the book refers to dividends due at that period—this form is a voucher to our bakers who pay it—this came to us as one of the vouchers for the paid dividends—this, to the best of my recollection, is one of the vouchers which I found in the iron safe—I had possessed myself of them before, though the prisoner did not know it—there were other payments entered in the book for which no vouchers were found—there was a further investigation, the prisoner's attention was called to it, and he resigned—the directors accepted his resignation—the filling up of this receipt is in the prisoner's handwriting, and here is his signature to it as attesting witness to its genuineness—the prisoner putting his name would be to attest the correctness of the document, and that the signature is that of the person receiving the dividend, but not that saw him sign it—this document being taken to Messrs. Praed's would be paid as a check, and come back to us as our voucher—the bankers would not pay it without the prisoner's signature—here is an account for Stallard, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; T. W. Fletcher, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Davies, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and Richard Hey, of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these others are similar documents purporting to be signed in the same way, all filled up by the prisoner and witnessed by him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have referred to the ledger in which there is reference to half-yearly dividends being paid to Dr. chalmers, in whose handwriting is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The handwriting of Nixon the clerk</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210096"/>
               <p>—the name of Fletcher and the whole account is in the writing of Nixon I be<lb/>lieve—when I read over the ledger to the prisoner, I read the items put in by Nixon—the deed of settlement directs the books to be kept by the prisoner—Nixon was a clerk in the office, and he had access to the strong box—it was the duty of the secretary and actuary to keep the key—Nixon would only get it by applying to him—I think there was no counterfoil to these vouchers kept—the prisoner never made a representation to me that there should be a counterfoil—the prisoner did not make the Company—I should think it was made by the medical gentlemen, I do not know that he was their agent—when these became vouchers they were filled up and kept in a bundle—I do not know where they were kept in blank—the prisoner was the resident actuary; if he were absent, Nixon remained in the office—the prisoner went an excursion in Aug. 1846—I had occasion to reprimand him once when he was absent a whole day—Nixon remained in the outer office—the receipts were to be made out when they became due, if an application were made for them they would be paid, if the actuary were there—I do not know that these receipts were left unsigned—I have never known them to be left filled up—an account was made out of who the dividends were to be paid to—I do not know that, with the exception of the word "witness," these forms were left out filled up, in possession of any person in the office—(<hi rend="italic">Form read</hi>)—"Re<lb/>ceived the 5th of Feb., 1848, of the Medical, Legal, and General Life Insur<lb/>ance Society, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for half a year's interest, due 31st of Dec, 1847.—Signed, <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM CHALMERS</hi>, proprietor; <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, R. W. <hi rend="smallCaps">MORRIS</hi>. "—these receipts never ought to have been given but by the defendant—there was not another clerk under Nixon—there was a messenger called Richard, who is in the office now—I never heard that Nixon and Richard had a key of the strong box—they had no authority to have such a key—Nixon left on 2nd May—he was called to account and resigned—his resignation was accepted—he confessed to the directors that he had received a premium which he had not entered—I suppose he pocketed the money—these forms were kept filled up, but the "witness" ought to be put to it only at the time of the application.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose an application had been made to Nixon, and the proprietor got this form, and left his signature, when the defendant came, and saw this, and believed it to be William Chalmer's signature, he would be entitled to sign it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if he believed it to be his signature—Dr. Chalmers would take this to the banker's, and there receive the money, if it had the actuary's signature to it—I do not know that our actuary has been in the habit of advancing the money instead of giving these orders—I have not sanctioned his cashing these orders; he would have no authority to do it—it would prevent there being a check from the banker's—if a customer were to say, "Will you be kind enough to give me the money for this?" if he were to do so, he would do it on his own authority, because we should have the document.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he never authorized to issue these with his own name, as witness, previous to the signature of the proprietor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but in two instances my mother-in-law and sister could not attend for their dividend, I received it for them, and guaranteed to the directors the genuineness of their signatures—those were the only two instances—I cannot charge my memory whether the prisoner signed them before I got the signatures of my relations attached to them, or afterwards—I did not request him to send one of these documents witnessed to Mr. Dolman, or to anvbody else—Mr. Dolman has a brother</p>

               <p>residing in London, who is a medical practitioner, and I made an application that the brother in the country might receive it through his brother—I have not taken any step to produce Nixon here—I have suggested that it was right he should be here—I heard you intimate that he (Nixon) was pro<lb/>bably the person who had committed these acts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know, that in consequence of that suggestion, a subpœna has been issued, and an endeavour made to find Nixon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it has—I did not, in the instance of those two relations of mine, ask the prisoner to put his name before they had signed; but he trusted to me—if he did it, he did it knowing me to be a director—I firmly believe the sig<lb/>natures of Hey and Fletcher to these documents to be the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have no doubt that the signature, "R. W. Morris," is his writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt of that—I have no doubt that the writing of the body of both these documents is his—I am not equally sure about the signatures of the proprietors; I speak to it from my belief—I cannot divest myself of the belief that it is his writing—I have not heard that this has been shown to the messenger, and that he has declared it is not his writing—these signatures are not the prisoner's genuine writing; it is a feigned hand—I believe that from the general knowledge of the character of his writing—I have seen it for two years—it approaches very nearly to his ordinary writing—I have the same reason for my belief in the character of Fletcher's signature—I have the same belief of that from the character of his writing—I should say the "D" in "Davies," in this signature, is so very pecu<lb/>liar in the formation, that I could almost stake my belief on that only—I know that the body and the indorsement are his writing—I am not sure that I did not see him write this indorsement in Mr. Hey's case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and general practitioner, at Victoria-square, Pimlico. I had attended this child from its birth, and the mother at the birth—with the exception of some attacks of thrush, I believe it had been a healthy child—I was out of town when it was taken ill, and left my house and shop in the care of Mr. Hustler—my nephew dispensed the medicines—he lived at the retail shop—Mr. Driver was to attend to the patients—I returned to town I think, on Wednesday, 19th July, four or five days after the child died—I went to Mrs. Dore's the evening I arrived, to express my regret—I saw Mrs. Spry—I had heard from Mr. Hustler that there was a difficulty about the certificate—it is necessary, before a body can be buried, to get a certificate from the medical man who attended, stating the cause of death—Mrs. Spry expressed great displeasure at Mr. Driver's con<lb/>duct—she said he had acted ungentlemanly, or unkind, or words to that effect—I had not before heard that Mr. Driver had called there—she told me something about Mr. Driver having mentioned the case being an inquest case, or words to that effect, or that it had been overdosed with calomel, or had had something given to it that was not proper, and she replied, if anything had been given it that was not right, it must have been given by my assistant—I said I would go down, and see Mr. Driver as I was quite certain she must be mistaken as to his conduct, and I would bring back the certificate in my hand—it was suggested that Mr. Driver should open the body, to which she</p>

               <p>made a positive objection; but she added that she should have no objection to my opening it—I was their regular attendant—I saw the body of the child at that time, but made no particular examination—I opened the body next morning, and asked Mr. Inskipp who lived next door to be with me, but he declined, and I took my assistant Mr. Hustler with me—I found on opening the body that it had had an attack of intersusception of the bowels—I looked there immediately because I understood that the child had bloody motions, and in that part of the body I found a distinct case of intersusception—that consists of the drawing up of the <hi rend="italic">ilium</hi> into the <hi rend="italic">colvn</hi> so as to cause stoppage, inflammation, and death—I found marks of severe inflammation down wards, at the ends of the bowels—that, in my judgment, separated from anything else, was sufficient to account for death—it would produce a stoppage of the bowels, and would account for the sickness, the cries, the bloody evacuations, the convulsions, and for every symptom which the child had during life—it is an incurable disease when it is so inflamed—sometimes it is not incurable—it may be dissolved—the body was not particularly distended—distension would arise chiefly from mortification before or after death—I took out a piece of the bowel and preserved it—in consequence of Mrs. Spry telling me the child had had the thrush, I directed my attention to the stomach—I con<lb/>ceived it might have had a very bad state of thrush, not having seen it for two months, and I perceived a dark black patch about the size of a shilling, or a little bigger, and a small opening in the upper part of the stomach, through which there was exuding a dark-coloured mucous fluid, and that led me to the necessity of analysing the contents of the stomach—I tied both ends of the stomach and took it out, and then it was subjected to experiment by Mr. Rogers—the child had been dead five days, and I saw that dark patch shining through the outer coat of the stomach—I did not know how to account for it, and thought it better to take it home to look at it—I should say that was such an injury to the stomach as must have been inflicted dur<lb/>ing life—there was considerable inflammation from the seat of the intersus-ception of the bowels to the external part of the bowel—there war no appear<lb/>ance of disease or inflammation between the stomach, where I saw the black patch, and the seat of disease in the bowels—the small intestines appeared perfectly healthy—there was a considerable interval presenting a perfectly healthy appearance between the seat of disease and the black patch.</p>

BODKIN</hi>.<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Arsenic is an antiseptic, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and therefore has a tendency to arrest decomposition—I did not find the other part of the stomach decomposed, only the part where the patch was—the opinion I formed from the patch and the mischief I found there was, that the arsenic must have been taken into the body at least two days before death—arsenic would occasion death more quickly if taken when a person is in a morulent state.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Therefore it would take a shorter time to produce those appearances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think those appearances would ever have been produced then—some of the arsenic generally remains in the stomach, and some passes out into the system—I should say it was impossible that all should remain in the system—if arsenic has passed into the bowels I should expect to find some appearances of it occasionally, not always—you sometimes find patches and erosions; but it is not a necessary consequence—I only examined the stomach and gullet—arsenic has been known to be detected in the stomach a week after it was taken—a portion must remain in the stomach, or we could not detect it—the whole could not remain that time in the stomach decidedly—I regard the locked bowel as an effect of the arsenic—the irritation of arsenic passing onwards might produce it—I should give a medical opinion that some must have passed down near to the colon, and that that was the cause of the intersusception.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. TAYLOR</hi>. I have been for eighteen years lecturer on Chemistry and Medical Jurisprudence, at Guy's Hospital. Last Wednesday I insti<lb/>tuted experiments with a view to ascertain the presence of arsenic in what was put before me as the contents of the child's stomach—I found about a grain of arsenic hanging about the black patch that has been spoken of—I have heard the evidence in this case, and have made notes of it—in my judgment death was caused by the intersusception of the bowel alone, and the inflammation of the colon that followed inconsequence—where the strangulation has proceeded to the degree described, I should always expect to find bloody stools; it is one of the most prominent symptoms</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210118"/>
               <p>where the strangulation is so great and so low down—my belief is con<lb/>sidering all the facts of the case, that the arsenic was not in the child's stomach till it returned from the Isle of Wight, and that it was administered to it within eight or ten hours of its death—all the symptoms exhibited by the child during life would, in my judgment, be referable to the intersus<lb/>ception—there has not been a single symptom of arsenic, except vomiting which is common to both—some of the most prominent symptoms of arsenic have been entirely wanting—the witness, Elizabeth Susan Spry, has stated that she slept with the child on the Wednesday night; that it went to bed at eleven, and slept till two o'clock, when it awoke in pain, now I declare it to be utterly impossible that three grains of arsenic could have been in the system of that child at eleven, and all the symptoms be suspended until two—the effect of arsenic on a child is exceedingly powerful; more so than in an adult—I have known a child, sixteen years of age, killed by one-third of a grain, which was considerably less than was discovered here—then it is proved that the child went to sleep again, and awoke at six, screaming, and in pain; thus we have an interval of four hours without any symptoms whatever to indicate the presence of arsenic; it could not have been in the system at that time—I think I understood that the child did not vomit in the night; now vomiting is one of the most prominent symptoms of arsenic, and where the bowels are at all obstructed it must exist in a most intense degree—it appears that the mixture sent by Mr. Woolmer's assistant, on Thursday morning, was given about eight, and up to the time she left by the train a period of an hour and a half, there are no symptoms referable to arsenic—in crossing to Ryde there was a discharge of blood from the bowels; that is exactly what I should expect where intersusception has lasted fifteen or sixteen hours; for when the bowels become constricted the congestion of the vessels leads to bursting, especially in the case of an infant, and it is not a consequence of arsenic until a later stage of the case—I think Mr. Bloxham has taken a most judicious and sound view of the case—he saw only a bilious vomiting, no blood—now if Mr. Rodgers's theory were correct, and the arsenic had then been in the system, and gone on to produce gangrene and ulreration, the destruction of the lining membrane would have caused blood to exude from it, and would have been seen in the vomited matter which Mr. Bloxham speaks of—the sickness was undoubtedly referable to the obstruction of the bowels—if arsenic had been given in the morning the child would have been in a dying state—there would have been cold sweats, violent convulsions, and incessant vomitings; so that no person of ordinary science could possibly mistake the effects of arsenic—then the child reached London about half-past three on Friday, and we see there just such kind of inter<lb/>mittant symptoms as we should expect from the state of the bowels, occasional vomiting, not incessant, as in cases of arsenic; occasional pain, not incessant burning, as in arsenic; indeed, the symptoms all through, up to that time, refer to the strangulation of the intestine—Mr. Hustler saw the child at six in the evening, and it was then very ill; he thought it suffering from inflammation of the bowels, and it was rather convulsed—the question is, what caused this inflammation of the bowels; it is quite impossible that arsenic could have caused it, because the symptoms hitherto have only been in connection with what the child took, and are not reconcilable with arsenic, which would operate upon a child in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—then it seems that Mr. Driver gave it a powder about nine; there appears to have been no symptoms to indicate the nature of that powder; in fact I should judge from the description given that the child was dying: that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210119"/>
               <p>shortly after its return from Ryde it was in a morulent state, and therefore the stomach would lose that irritability which characterizes it in a healthy condition, and it would not be affected either by calomel, arsenic, tartar emetic, or any substance which, in a healthy state, tends to irritate the coats; so that we have no symptoms produced, as far as I can judge, by that powder; I am unable, therefore, to say what the nature of that powder was, as far as the symptoms are concerned; but this I must say, that I examined the stomach with the greatest care, and as Mr. Rodders has admitted, there was not a particle of calomel in the stomach—I cut up two square inches of the stomach, and tested it with every test I am in the habit of using, and by which I have discovered calomel ten hours after it has been administered; but here, although five grains are said to have been administered, not one atom of calomel remained—Mr. Rodgers has admitted that there was no in<lb/>flammation of the bowels, and my Lord asked whether three grains of arsenic could remain in the stomach three days without some portion passing through into the bowels, and taking effect there; I say decidedly not; it is utterly impossible—if food passed, arsenic would have passed; and if arsenic passed, it would indicate its presence by inflammation of the intestines—Mr. Rodgers's statement, that arsenic must have been two or three days in the stomach, is quite unfounded; there is not the slightest ground for it, unless he admits that which I believe to be utterly impossible, that three grains of arsenic can remain for three hours in the stomach without producing any effect—I never met with or read of such a case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a short-hand writer. On Friday evening, 28th July last, I attended a meeting at the theatre in Milton-street, City—I arrived there about a quarter to eight o'clock—there were about 100 persons there when I arrived—when the chairman was appointed it had increased to about 500—John Shaw was the chairman—the numbers increased to upwards of 1000 in the course of the evening—they appeared to be composed of the poorer classes, but principally Irish I judge—the speakers spoke from the stage of the theatre—the defendant came on the stage a moment or two after Shaw the chairman had been speaking—I took a note of Shaw's speech, and have it here—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—" Friends, you have placed me in rather a responsible situa<lb/>tion to-night; however, I obey the call with alacrity, and with pleasure to myself, and I trust any despotic conduct of mine, or on my part to-night, will be excused by you, because I believe you have all assembled here for the same good and religious purpose that I have been induced to attend here for. I will just read you the bill calling this meeting. I believe the meeting was only agreed on to-day; I was not privy to any of the arrangements, and therefore, however I may express my ignorance of the arrangements that are made by the conductors, I trust you will excuse it on the score of ignorance. It is as follows, 'Is Ireland up? 'That is a most important question to me. 'A great public meeting will be held to-night, Friday, July 28th, at the Milton-street Theatre. Cripplegate, to take into consideration the momentous crisis in Ireland. Chair taken at eight o'clock. Several talented patriots</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210120"/>
               <p>will address the meeting. Englishmen, Irishmen, attend! attend! Admis<lb/>sion, pit and gallery, one penny; platform and boxes, twopence.' I believe it is not the intention of the conveners of this meeting to shut any poor man out, be he Englishman or Irishman, for want of the means; therefore if there are any of those persons outside, I trust, as your chairman here to-night that the managers of this meeting will announce the same to them, and give free admission to every poor man. (Applause.) My friends, let the police all come in—let the walking telegraphs come in if they please—let the living telegraphs, that are placed over you to watch over your every act, come—make room for them all if you can convert them, if there is the slightest probability of making honest men of them at all, let them all in: however I despair of any great utility arising from such a task as that. My friends, I was about to say, I rejoice to think, and I verily believe it, that Ireland is up! (Cheers.) Notwithstanding the garbled reports that we receive continually day by day, and every express that arrives in order to delude and deceive the people of this country, I believe sincerely that Ireland is up, and I believe that Ireland will do its duty to itself. The time has now arrived when it is too late to mince the matter; the time has now arrived that both Englishmen and Irish<lb/>men should be up to do their duty. I will tell you a little bit of intelligence that was conveyed to me about half an hour ago, intelligence that I deeply deplore; cur worthy, patriotic, straightforward, indomitable friend Patrick O'Higgins, is apprehended on a charge of high treason: now there is no question in my mind, that every other honest and patriotic fellow, both in Eng<lb/>land and Ireland, will be pounced upon by the same worthless hands, as soon as there is an opportunity. My friends, Patrick O'Higgins is in durance vile, I have every reason to believe; and as soon as ever the govern<lb/>ment are prepared to arrest your indomitable champion, Smith O'Brien, they will serve him precisely the same. However, I am glad to think they have not got him yet, and I do believe they will have something to do to take him too. While Smith O'Brien is surrounded by 100, 000 brave Irish hearts, (he government will have something to do to stop him. I believe they say that he carries a brace of pistols with him; now these things perhaps ought not to be indulged in by a public meeting like this, but I sincerely hope to God that such is the fact, and the first dirty fingers, be it a policeman in his own uniform or otherwise, that lays a hand upon Smith O'Brien, or any other man who dares to vindicate the rights of his country, I trust that—I dare scarcely trust myself, for our respected friends here, on my right hand and on my left, are sent here for the purpose of performing a professional duty, and I do hope and trust you will excuse them in the performance of their duty,—that alluded to myself and Mr. Bennett, who accompanied me—" they are but men, and they must perform that duty for which they are sent here faith<lb/>fully, and in accordance with the employ under which they labour. Is Ireland up? I should like to answer that in a very Irish method practised by this country, by putting another question—Is England up? I trust we are up; at all events, my friends, we are up this night, to listen and to be ad<lb/>vised by those gentlemen who will presently address you. This is a very critical period of our history, both for England and for Ireland. I believe, and I do hope and trust that we are up in this way, that we shall calmly dis<lb/>cuss the subjects that may from time to time be brought before us, and that when this meeting concludes, that we will give no possible pretext to the common foe to pounce upon any man; no processions, no row, or anything of that sort publicly made, so as to enable them to lay hold of you and your</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210121"/>
               <p>friends to-night; but every one will leave this Theatre, and he will pursue his own quiet and calm way home again, and reflect on what he has heard. I hope, nevertheless, that you will agree with die sentiments that will be uttered here to-night. I do not believe that there is one man that will address you to-night, but are your best friends, consequently they will give you no bad advice; at the same time, I think it is the duty of every man here, to register a vow in heaven that he will never rest contented till both England and Ireland are in possession of their rights. I think, my friends, that it is a duty incumbent upon all; and it is of no use for Mr. John O'Con<lb/>nell or any other sham patriot, threatening me, or Irishmen and Englishmen either, that if the people do not agree with his advice and will not act upon it, he will walk his body away, and take his father's bones with him; if he should, my friends, carry his threats into execution, I do not think it will be any great loss to his country at all. My friends, I shall presently introduce Mr. Dwaine to your notice, to move the first resolution. In reply to that, I an sure I have not the slightest disposition to disturb the bones of Daniel O'Connell, or any other dead man, but I think when we are threatened by the mnan who has taken that illustrious man's place in the affections of Ireland, when he threatens to deprive us of such a valuable blessing as that, namely the bones of the late Daniel O'Connell, I think we ought to pass our opinions on his motives and conduct. I will not address you at any further length to-night, my friends; but I have this request to make, that those gentlemen who are inconvenienced towards the entrance of the pit, will be allowed to move on.")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now after some other persons had spoken, did the defendant Bezer speak? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—I took a note of his speech—this is it (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"It is not the fashion of Chartists to prevent free" and fair discussion; it is the fashion of the enemies of the Chartist to prevent discussion. I love discus<lb/>sion; I glory in being in a discussion, and simply because I think that dis<lb/>cussion, based upon fair and equitable grounds, is the best way of arriving at the truth; and I hope it was a little mistake on the part of two or three of our friends; if it was not a mistake, it was only a trick of the authorities themselves to kick up a disturbance. Now then to the resolution I hold in my hand,—'Resolved, that this meeting deeply sympathises with the struggling people of Ireland, and is resolved to assist them by all and every means in their power, and that we consider the physical preparations of the government unjustifiable, without the proper remedial measure attached thereto.' Brother Chartists! brother Republicans! brother Democrats! for I do not know that I can address you by any better name than democrats, for the principle of democracy is the principle of fair play; the principle of democracy is the principle of a free stage to all, and no favour to any; the principle of democracy is the right of the rich, and no more; the principle of democracy is the right of the poor, and no less; the principle of democracy is the greatest amount of good to the greatest number; in short, the principle of democracy is the principle of justice and of truth. Democrats understand each other all over the world. Democrats are the same in every nation; the democrats of Russia, the democrats of Poland, the democrats of Switzerland, the democrats of Germany, the democrats of France, the democrats of Ireland understand each other; they are all travelling the same road; they have all one end; they have all one aim; they have all one object in view, and that object is glorious liberty! they are all singing one song, not in the same language perhaps, but the same sentiment—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210122"/>
               <p>' Oh liberty! will man resign thee; Once having felt thy gen'rous flame? Shall locks, or bars, or bolts confine thee? Or whips thy noble spirit tame?'No, it has not tamed John Mitchell yet, I will be bound. It has not yet tamed Ernest Jones, I will be bound. Did it tame the men of old, when they were burned at the stake? No, it did not; it actually progressed their principles more than they would have progressed; and let tyrants beware. You had better shut up shop; you had better put up your swords, and cut and run, for democracy is spreading, depend upon it, and sooner or later it will overwhelm you all. My friends, we live in strange times, we live in very queer times; and yet it is a privilege to live in these times. We have seen a great many things; we have seen lords, and dukes, and princes, and all the rest of the mob in different nations cut and run. Louis Philippe had to change his clothes and his whiskers, and to take his umbrella and cat and run away. (Cheers and laughter.) We have seen great changes, and we shall live to see greater changes yet. As a democrat I hope so; and as I said before, I do not know that I can address you by any better word than democrats. I might say, Mr. Chairman, and all respectable people, and for this reason, because every man that works for his living honestly, either by his head or his hands, is a respectable man, though by bad laws he may be badly clothed, badly housed, and badly fed; and those who do not work for their living, but who fatten upon the labour of others, are not respectable people; but, on the contrary, are thieves, and rogues, and vagabonds—(loud cheers)—though they may wear fine linen, and fare sumptuously every day; though they may wear crowns on their heads, and have swords hanging at their tails—(laughter)—and though they may be called lords, and dukes, and marquesses, and viscounts and right reverend fathers in God, and knights of the garter, and grooms of the stole, and lords of the bedchamber, and all the other mummery, and flummery, and humbuggery. I therefore will address you, Mr. Chairman and friends, as respectable people; for I presume, that with the exception of a sprinkling here and a sprinkling there, and a few here and a few there of despicable wretches, who have hired themselves for blood-money,—with the exception of these creatures we are all respectable people, I hope. I work for my living. If Lord John Russell wants to know what I am, I am a merchant of the City of London. I am a merchant in the City of London; and though perhaps I have not much <hi rend="italic">rhino</hi>, I am perhaps more respectable than many other merchants, for I do go to market with ready money. I sell fish about the streets; and if Lord John Russell wants to be a customer, I will sell him a <hi rend="italic">pike</hi> cheap—(loud cheers, two or three times repeated)—or if the Treasury is almost exhausted, (which I dare say it nearly is,) it the Exche<lb/>quer is very low indeed, I am a charitable man, although our friend Shaw the other night said he would not be so merciful as I am,—if the Treasury is so very low, and Lord John Russell can't afford to buy a pike, I will give him one. (Laughter and cheers.) I was going to say we live in queer times; I say again, it is a privilege to live in these times; but let us not forget that there is a danger also in living in these times. Some of the men that I invited to-day to speak on this platform perhaps think so. However, there is one thing that we must not forget, before all and above all, viz., that we live in times when every man expects each other to do his duty. (Cheers.) These are the times for duty; we must perform our duty. If we perform our duty well, genera<lb/>tions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210123"/>
               <p>yet unborn will bless us; if we perform our duty ill, generations yet unborn will curse us. What is that duty? The <hi rend="italic">Northern Star</hi> of last week says our duty is to sympathize with Ireland; the <hi rend="italic">Northern Star</hi> says well. Is our duty to end there? My friends, our duty is to sympathize with Ire<lb/>land; yes, our duty is to pity Ireland; yes, and our duty is to help Ireland (loud cheers); and I will tell you how we will help her the best way we can. (Loud cheers.) I am not going to tell you, 'Gentlemen,' or 'Friends, in God's name, get arms! for that is sedition; I am not going to say, 'In God's name, get pikes! 'for that is felony; but I am going to say, in God's name, get umbrellas, for the rain may fall (laughter); I am going to say, in God's name, get great coats, for the winter is coming, and you might catch cold. I am not going to tell you my opinion of the Government of this country; you all pretty well know that; but I will give you the opinion of somebody else; and as this man is a long way off, I do not think that the Government will be able to catch him; and that is the editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>. I am reading from a stamped newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, the most loyal paper in all the world, and therefore there is no treason in that. This is what Brother Jonathan thinks of the British Government. They say we are a nation, you and I, we are a nation, Say they, grovelling in abject slavery;' there is a shame: a narrow oligarchy is grinding the masses of our population to powder; it rules taxes and plunders the State for its own lucre and ambition; the Church, the Law, the Army and the Navy, and the Crown, are kept up only to satiate its hungry maw, and aggrandize its power. 'The middle classes' says Brother Jonathan, (I do not say so,) 'are either slaves or toadies; the lower classes only slaves. Chartism, says Brother Jonathan, 'is the natural and true expression of the popular feeling; the unconcealed wish of the majority of the people is fora republic, and they are only kept in check by the terrors of military force.' And now something to the point that has called us together to-night We will quote Brother Jonathan again, because they cannot catch him. 'If ever there were a people,' says the editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>—which, mark you, is the organ of the War party, and the War party in America is now getting the ascendancy, and that is another sig<lb/>nificant fact—' If ever there were a people who had cause to rise and strike down their tyrants, the Irish are that people; if there ever was a time to do it, the present is it. The crisis may be delayed till after the harvest, but we are inclined to think that it will come then beyond all peradventure. They will gain an accession to their ranks, from Mr. Mitchell's conviction and trans<lb/>portation, of thousands who have heretofore opposed their movements; and if, after rising in arms, they can but hold their ground for five or six weeks, their example will assuredly be followed by Chartists;'—I do not say so, it is the editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald;</hi>—'and the result will be the downfall of the great tyrant of the universe,—one of the most corrupt, tyrannical, grinding, and despotic governments that Providence ever permitted to afflict a world. In this downfall the nobility and aristocracy, the well-fed puppets of the government, they who have lived on the fat of the land, and revelled in luxury, purchased by the sweat and anguish of a nation, will be crushed to atoms.' (Loud cheers.) If I am not detaining you too long, I will read you another extract—(Cries of 'Go on')—because, you know, I was told the other night that I was a very good general, that I should not get into <hi rend="italic">quod</hi>. It would be more luck than judgment, in my opinion, however. The last evening I spoke, I only prayed something. It does not say in the Act that we must not pray; it only says that we must 'not imagine, compass, or devise. To-night I am only reading something. The Gagging Bill does not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210124"/>
               <p>say we must not read; so you see I like to do everything according to law Brother Jonathan says again,: 'By the last arrival from England, we have some indications of the policy which England has shaped, and which, from all appearances, she is determined to pursue. It is not a direct, open, and honest policy, such as Russia has marked out, but a mean, pitiful, sneaking and underhand system of petty intrigue, and Machivælian deception, which has always characterised her Government from time immemorial. It is the same system which she has so successfully thus far used towards Ireland, and by which she has been enabled to retain her dominion over that of Ireland, in despite of the wishes of its people, and in direct contravention of all princi<lb/>ples of justice, human and Divine. Fearing the powerful republic, its increase, its stability, and its future greatness, and knowing herself to be powerless to oppose any obstacle in its way, this wicked, atrocious, and diabo<lb/>lical government has embarked in a policy which would disgrace the Thugs of India. She dare not meet the republic in the field, and there manfully and honourably dispute the spread of the principles of free government in Europe. The first shock of battle would show her nakedness, and pros<lb/>trate her; but she can play the assassin; she can stab her enemy in the back, as she has done on former occasions, and as she is attempting to do again, but it will be seen with what success eventually. The policy which she has determined upon is to send abroad her agents for the purpose of in<lb/>triguing with the people and with the governments of the continental nations; of putting the people against the governments, and the governments against the people; of inciting the masses to rise for their rights, and inciting the governments, when the masses have risen, to massacre them, as has been done in Naples; there is not only every probability but it is almost a moral certainty that the late dreadful massacres in the city of Naples, were the work of this treacherous and mean government: through the agency of its intriguers; at the present time there is no doubt that England has her agents scattered throughout all Europe'—of course she has, she has them scattered in Milton-street Theatre, 'whose missions are of this character, and who if successful would deluge Europe with the blood of her people, and re-establish amid carnage and desolation, monarchy in France, and stop the progress of the principles of free government from making further headway in Europe. These are the despicable and underhand means which this assassin govern<lb/>ment has resorted to, to overthrow France, not daring, as we have before stated, to measure lances with the giant republic;'—now, <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> says, in answer to this, that England 'has no more to dread from the navies of France than she has from the armies of America, but she will meddle with the internal affairs of neither, not because she dreads the strength of either, but because' and I think so too, 'but because she respects the rights of Nations and recognises the value of peace. Now there is an important question in the Bill, 'Is Ireland up <hi rend="italic">V</hi> I am not in the cabinet; I am not in the coun<lb/>cil;"—(a person behind the speaker here handed him a slip of paper)—"oh yes, I know Lord John Russell was found guilty once by a Galway jury, but there has been more juries than the Galway jury sit upon Lord John Russell; but the question is asked in the Bill 'Is Ireland up?' I think you will all own that she has been down long enough; and another thing you will own too, I think, that it is time that she was up, and if she do not get up herself as one man, serve her right for being down, serve any willing slave right, serve any one right that kisses the chains that bind them, it is only a shame that the innocent should suffer with the guilty, and those who pant for liberty should still be in bondage, while some are slaves at</p>

               <p>heart, but I hope that Ireland is not a slave at heart, and the time is fast approaching, perhaps at this moment she is at it, and if she is, God of the suffering poor defend the right! In ancient times the question was asked, 'How long, O Lord, how long shall tyrants reign?' I ask that question. again; I say, 'How long, oh Lord, shall tyrants reign?' Tyrants have reigned in Ireland for seven centuries nearly, and I hope that those who have mocked her sufferings and starved her, may now meet with the reward they merit, whoever they are. But what would Ireland do if she had he nationat say some people; what has that to do with me as an Englishman. The Irish have a right to govern themselves; if they govern themselves ill, the rod will fall upon their own backs. Why should eight millions of Irish<lb/>men, merely because they are Irishmen, be called the most stupid people upon the face of the earth? if they govern themselves ill, they will have all the consequences; if they govern themselves well, they will have the advan<lb/>tage of all being well. But let the Irish nation, as every other nation, govern itself by its own laws; some people say, what have the English to do with it? The English I consider, if they are democrats at heart, have to do with everything that is oppressive and unjust. They have raised their voice against injustice and oppression in Poland. Why not raise their voice when oppression and injustice is perpetrated in Ireland? Lord John Russell said yesterday, when some of the Irish members of the House of Commons were told by his lordship to go to Ireland, where they were wanted to make peace, they said, 'But will you not give us some remedial measures—something by way of an olive-branch, to take to Ireland;' 'No,' said Lord John Russell 'you must go without any remedial measures at all.' I say the govern-ment are acting either very roguish or very insane, and therefore I say, openly and advisedly, that neither a roguish government, or an insane government ought to exist. But the same gentleman says that we do not want any reform—why, Gentlemen, I am ready here to assert, and as I love discussion, I would discuss it with anybody, that there is something rotten in the political state of England—that, from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot there is nothing but wounds and putrifying sores. But Monarchs, Aristocrats, Lords, Free-Traders, Special-Constables, and Blue Devils, have all done that which. they ought not to have done, and have left undone that which they ought to do; and if there is one monopoly more than another in this country; it is the monopoly of legislation—one in seven has no voice in this country, and while that is so, we are virtually slaves. If there is one abomination in Ireland more than another, it is the English Church as by law established; and I advise you as soon as you have threepence about you, to read the <hi rend="italic">Black Book of England</hi>, published by Cleave, and learn, and mark well, and inwardly digest too, and you will find that Lord John Russell was very foolish, and told lies too, when he stated that the people of England wanted no reform. But some of them tell you that the great cause is the surplus popu<lb/>lation in England and Ireland; that is just what I believe myself, and I think that that is about the first time that the Government and I have ever agreed. But so it is, there is too many bishops, there is too much aristocracy, there is too many drones to live upon the bees.—I wish to God they would emi<lb/>grate, I would not send them to heaven, though there is no question about that, for they would not be let in, nor would I send them to hell, for I should not be uncharitable enough to do that; but I would send them to some remote quarter of the globe, and let no one go there but the bishops, and those persons. I say that a system of emigration is a very good thing, and the sooner these fellows emigrate the better. With these few remarks, I beg.</p>

               <p>leave to reiterate the sentiment, whether it be treason, or felony, or sedition or no. I beg leave to reiterate the sentiment that is now in my bosom, for I always like to say what I mean, and mean what I say, notwithstanding the consequences that may ensue, for the truth ought to be spoken. I reiterate the sentiment, that Ireland is justified in rising up in arms against those who have oppressed her, and God grant she may win, and I say, in the language of the poet of last week,</p>

Q.</hi> The meeting was announced by placard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—a person named Nash was turned out of the body of the meeting, but was after<lb/>wards admitted, and made a speech—I did not know his name at the time he was turned out, but when he came forward and spoke, I put it down.—(<hi rend="italic">The extracts from the</hi> New York Herald, <hi rend="italic">as given in the defendant's speech, were here read from the</hi> Times, <hi rend="italic">with the editor's remarks</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I shall detain the Court but a very few moments; and there is one thing, at all events, true in my speech, if there is nothing else, and that is, that I have not much judgment, not with standing all the 'cunning and talent, ability, eloquence, and wit' that I have displayed, according to the remarks of the learned Attorney-General; evidently I have not had much judg<lb/>ment, or I should not have been placed in this position; and permit me to state, that I stand here this day unaided by counsel, not because I have any idea that I can defend myself in anything like a lawyer-like manner; on the con<lb/>trary, I am a poor, uneducated working man, with no pretensions to learning; but the reason is simply that I have no money to provide professional aid, and if I had, I should consider that money better applied in relieving the necessities of my wife and family, who are placed in a poor and destitute posi<lb/>tion by my apprehension. I hope, therefore, Gentlemen, taking these facts into your consideration, that you will listen to the few remarks I have to make, just as calmly and dispassionately as you would to those of the highest law authority in this realm. You will agree with me, I think, Gentlemen, that it cannot be said of the laws of England, notwithstanding the learned counsel has told you in his opening address, that the law of sedition is very plain, and that any man can understand it; still, after all, I think you will agree with me, that it cannot be said that the laws of England are so plain and intelligible that a wayfaring man though a fool should not err therein; on the contrary, most men say that for the most part they are so inexplicable as to confuse the minds of the wisest of men. I shall not, therefore, attempt to enter into the labyrinths of that law, by following the learned counsel through its mazes, but I shall ground my defence upon principle, and upon principle alone. Gentlemen, I am a <hi rend="italic">Chartist</hi>—I avow it in this place—a conscientious <hi rend="italic">Chartist</hi>. I firmly believe that the principles of <hi rend="italic">the Charier</hi> are based upon sure foundations; that they are true, and if I suffer for the pro<lb/>mulgation of those principles, I shall not be the first by thousands that have suffered for the truth's sake; and let me tell you, Gentlemen, that although these Government prosecutions may be detrimental; for the time being, to the individual victims, I do think, and I here avow it, that they will rather accelerate than retard the democratic cause, because that democratic cause is the cause of justice, and must ultimately prevail, in spite of all opposition—in the language of Charles Mackay, that beautiful poet of the people—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210127"/>
               <p>" The truth will yet come uppermost And justice will prevail." 'I am charged in the warrant issued for my apprehension, with maliciously endeavouring, by the words I uttered on 28th July, to incite the Queen's subjects to anarchy and rebellion. I deny that charge most emphatically, and with indignation. I hold that there is no maliciousness, no wickedness, in the free expression of one's firmly-rooted political opinion. There seemed to be no maliciousness, no wickedness, on the part of the Whigs when they were out of office in using exciting language; and yet I need not tell you that language as violent was uttered by the Whigs when out of power and place, as was used by your poor, humble fellow-countryman on 28th July last. The policeman who apprehended me has in his possession a paper, which was read in evidence against me at the Mansion-house; it was a mere extract from Goldsmith's History of England—a work certainly not seditious, and which I should like to have had for the purpose of preparing my defence in something like a uniform order, but that book, as well as the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper of July 7th, was denied me by the authorities of the prison, though they were left at tie gate by my wife. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Cope, in answer to an inquiry from the Court, stated that he was not aware of any papers or books having been left at the gaol for the prisoner. The extract he referred to teas here handed to him by the policeman</hi>.) The papers are not at the gate now, my wife would not leave them. I merely wanted the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper for the purpose of showing that I did not say anything but that which was in the paper, but as it has been read, it is of no material consequence. But this is the extract from Gold<lb/>smith's History of England, and I think it is particularly applicable to the present time, and to my case; it is a portion of a speech of Mr. Curran, M. P., in 1796, relative to freedom of speech—he says: 'Freedom of speech is essential to all real liberty, and none but those who were conscious of wrong would attempt to impose silence upon the people. The public voice sounds harshly in the ears of bad ministers, whose fears prompt them to abridge the liberties of the nation, but he trusted that his countrymen would not tamely submit to such insult and oppression; it was only in meetings that the real sentiments of the people could be manifested; and if this right should be annihilated, all opposition to ministerial tyranny, either in or out of Parliament, would be crushed, and the democratic branch of the constitu<lb/>tion would be overborne by the Crown and the aristocracy.' Those were the sentiments of a member of Parliament in 1796, and that which was true then may also be said to be true in my case. It is only for freedom of speech—for I have done nothing, I have committed no moral wrong—it is only for freedom of speech that I stand here this day; it is only for exercising that acknowledged right of an Englishman, that a strong government has thought proper to lay violent hands upon your humble fellow-countryman; and why? doubtless because the Whig ministry are at their old game again—finality; notwithstanding their promises out of office, they are endeavour<lb/>ing to stop, by tyranny, the onward progress of all reform: they are endeavouring to <hi rend="italic">gag</hi> the mouths of your starving fellow-countrymen, not by acts of justice, but by acts of oppression; and in doing this they are flattering you; they are calling upon you, Gentlemen of the middle classes for the time being, just to serve their turn, and then they will grind you down also. Disappoint them, Gentlemen; show by your ver<lb/>dict this day, that acts of oppression and tyranny are not the means in these times to stifle public opinion; but if they want to continue in place and in power, let them do justice to all, to the working classes as well as to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210128"/>
               <p>middle classes, or let them make room for better men. The learned coun<lb/>sel, I believe it is the Attorney-General, urges that I uttered a seditious speech, of a violent and inflammatory nature, and to persons of a violent and inflammable nature, too. That is not right; I did not assemble the people together; if they wort the 'lower order of Irish, (I saw plenty of English<lb/>men among them), it was not my fault; and if they had been, I presume that the lower order of Irish me men, are human beings, subject to the same difficulties, and to the same feelings as other men. Surely this cannot be urged against me; the assembly that was there met—they were men, and for aught I know, honest men, though perhaps not dressed in fine linen; not persons of the higher station of society, but still men. I uttered a seditious speech, says the learned Attorney-General. After all, what did I say? First, I gave it as my opinion that the democratic principle was founded on justice; that the principles of democracy were the principles of truth; and I believe that I spoke the truth in so stating, whether it be sedition or No. I also gave my humble definition of respectability; not in an eloquent style, that I could not do, for I am sell-taught, but I gave my definition of respectability, and that definition was simply that labour was the source of all wealth. I may have been mistaken in my views, but I apprehend that I uttered no sedition. Thousands upon thousands of the best and wisest of men in this country have laid that political doctrine down as an axiom not to he contro<lb/>verted. I believe so too; I reiterated that doctrine. I repeat I may be mis<lb/>taken, but I apprehend that in reiterating that, I uttered no sedition. I said, thirdly, in contradiction to Lord John Russell's assertion some time ago in the House of Commons, that we wanted no reform, that we did want reform. Surely it would be vain to take up your time in endeavouring to dilate upon the various reforms which men of all classes admit to be necessary. There is scarcely a man that has studied politics, but will admit that there are some reforms necessary in the state. I added, it is true, that all had done that which they ought not to have done, and left undone that which they ought to have done. Was that sedition? the mere political application of Holy writ? I have been told so by the reverend Ordinary in Newgate, time after time in the reading-desk since I have been here; and I said so at the meeting at Milton-street theatre: I uttered no sedition surely in saying those words. But fourthly, and upon this point the Attorney-General has spoken very strongly, I read extracts from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, according to the remarks of the editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>. Now remember, Gentlemen, that whether those remarks be of seditious tendency or no,—for I admit my ignorance, I do not know that there is any shame in my saying that I admit my ignorance of the law,—he it remembered these remarks were not mine; that, the evidence this day incontestably proves,—I see that the Attorney-General by his pen and ink, is about to answer me,—the evidence of Mr. White incontestably proves that those remarks were not mine; but that, on the contrary, I interlarded those observations by giving an opinion contrary to the remarks of the editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>, and actually agreed cor<lb/>dially with the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> thereupon. Now then the question arises, whether the mere reading of these extracts constitutes sedition; if it does, then I plead ignorance of the law; and I humbly but naturally conclude that, if I am to suffer for reading these extracts, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> will be punished for printing them. I read them to 800 or 1000 persons, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> circulates about 30, 000 copies daily; if 1 am to be punished for merely reading them, then, in common justice, it may not be the law, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> ought to be punished for printing them. Certainly this is logic if nothing else is, that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210129"/>
               <p>I could not have read them if he had not printed them. Well, Gentlemen, I expressed sympathy with Ireland—unhappy Ireland, and this is a crime! expressing sympathy for the sufferings of millions of my fellow-men. I said that it was our duty to help Ireland: did I say that it was our duty to help her with arms and ammunition? did I say it was our duty to help her unconstitutionally? I did not; I added that I hoped that those who had starved and plundered her would meet with the reward they merited; mean<lb/>ing of course the great landed proprietors in Ireland; and what does that amount to? Simply that I am no friend to the unnatural relationship exist<lb/>ing between landlord and tenant in that country; a relationship which gives all protection and power to the former, and none to the latter; a relationship that causes a drain of four millions in the shape of an absentee drain; and thus leaving millions of my fellow-countrymen in a helpless condition, and not only helpless and starving, but continually starving year after year. If uttering these remarks was sedition—if giving my veto against such acts of tyranny and oppression was sedition, then I believe that millions, at all events thousands, of my fellow-men of all ranks are seditious people; for they, like me, are no friends to the unnatural relationship which exists between landlord and tenant in that unhappy country. Well now, Gentlemen, this is about 'the head and front of my offending.' I urged no riot, nor was there any; I recommended no disturbance, nor did any take place—in short, I am here merely for the free expression of my conscientious opinion; and 1 am here too, because those conscientious opinions are displeasing to a truckling Whig ministry. But, Gentlemen, I anticipate a different verdict from you. Place yourselves in my position for a moment in imagination—a poor man, with a wife and five small children to maintain, in the heaviest taxed country in the world, solely by my own exertions, literally in a distressed condition, not because I am lazy, or a drunkard, or dishonest, or a spendthrift; there is no man in or out of this Court that can lay aught to my charge in this respect, or in any immoral respect; I say literally in a dibtresstd condition, and I am merely stating that condition to show that it is no worse than that of thousands, ay millions, of my fellow men. What is the condition of the greater portion of the labouring classes of this country at the present time? Thomas Hood depicted them very eloquently and very truthfully when he said,</p>
               <p>"Work, work, work! My labour never flags; And what are its wages? a bed of straw, A crust of bread, and rags." This was in a great measure my condition, and place yourselves in imagina<lb/>tion in my position, and you might—yes, Gentlemen, you might—for perhaps you never felt the pangs of hunger—perhaps you never had the struggles I have had, and the thousands, perhaps millions of my fellow men have had, to get through life. I have struggled hard from my youth up to obtain an honest living for those I love; and you might have used much warmer ex<lb/>pressions than I did on this occasion: then, do unto others as you would be done unto; and if you do, I confidently wait your verdict of acquittal. I hope you will consider these things calmly; I am undefended, and I am a poor, humble, uneducated, working man: and consider the times—the learned counsel has told you you ought to consider the time at which I uttered this speech. You ought to consider the time in one respect—perhaps in the respect which the Attorney-General has urged, but also in another—these are exciting times, distressing times, and you ought to consider that what I uttered was in a moment of excitement; it was no written speech; a man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210130"/>
               <p>may utter that at one time which at another he might think it unadvisable to say; not that I am here this day to tell you that 1 have changed my princi<lb/>ples.; no, those principles are engrafted in my heart; I believe them to be founded in truth; I can see nothing unnatural, nothing unreasonable, nothing immoderate in the demand of the people when they ask for the charter. I cannot see that it is just that one in nine in England, one in eleven in Scot<lb/>land, and one in seventeen in Ireland, of the male population only, should have a voice in the country. I might go through the principles of the charter, but it is not, of course, necessary, you have all heard and read of them; I am not here to defend those principles eloquently; I cannot—you know what they are, and I think you will not see anything unreasonable or unjustifiable in my remarks. I am not here to endeavour to create pity among you; my principles are as they ever have been, and if I am to suffer in a dungeon, I shall at least have this to console me, that I am not there for any moral wrong that I have committed, but only for that which I think true and just. Take these circumstances into your consideration, and I confi<lb/>dently await your verdict. I hope the Searcher of all hearts will guide you right.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant at 63, Lower Sloane-street, Chelsea. On the night of 11th July, about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock, I was in Sloane-street, and saw the two female prisoners there—they acosted me—one came on my right, and the other on my left side—they invited me to come along with them—I declined, and told them to go about their business—they would not—Pickett, who was on my left, snatched at my watch, and dragged my silver chain, gold seal, and common key from my watch—the guard, which is now round my neck, saved it—she flew into the road—I immediately <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> after her—she up with her fist and knocked my hat off, and I received a tremendous blow at the side of my head—I stooped to pick up my hat, and as I rose I received another tremendous blow at the side of my head—the prisoner Keates then came up, and said, "Did you strike that woman?"—I said, "Yes"—her shawl fell off, he picked it up, and said, "Do you mean to strike her?"—I said, "Yes"—she ran as hard as she could down the street, calling out, "I will follow you home"—I said, "Do you mean to keep that shawl?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I will thank you to give it to me. till I get my property back"—he said, "No"—he took it and gave it to Tapson, who was on the pavement—she said, "I know who that shawl belongs to"—I said, "You shall give it to me"—she said, "No, I shall keep it"—they walked on down Sloane-street and I followed them, and insisted on having my property or the shawl—there were two more <hi rend="italic">bullies</hi> on the pave<lb/>ment—at the corner of Exceter-street a policeman came up, and I gave Tap<lb/>son in custody—I did not charge Keates then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my sister, Elizabeth Wilson, as stage-coach proprietors, at Islington. On Friday morning, 21st July, about twenty minutes before seven o'clock, Chapman came to our yard and told me he had got two loads of clover for me—I asked where it was—he said it was not come—I said he might bring it in—about ten minutes past eight I saw his wagon in the yard, close to the hay-loft—he had been unloading—it seemed to be quite empty—I saw it again about ten minutes to nine—it then had about two barrels of manure in it from the layers about 100 yards further down—it was standing near where it had been unloaded—Munday and Chapman were with it—I heard Chapman say to Munday, "You can be going on"—I had given Rowbottom some instructions—I told Chapman to</p>

               <p>No. 23053, from Mr. Nicholson, at a booth—I put it in my right-hand trow<lb/>sers pocket—when I got in the passage, between the seats, I was hustled by several persons—there were two women there and five or six men—the note was taken from my pocket—I gave information, and on 11th Aug. I went with Mr. Harris to the prisoner, and asked him what knowledge he had of that note—he said he had it from a man and woman at the Fleur-de-Lis public-house, which is half a mile from Mr. Harris', which is in Shoreditch, that he did not know anything of the man, more than having seen him at the public-house four or five times—he knew neither his name nor address, that he was rather tall and stout, of a florid complexion, and was accompanied by a woman, who was round-faced, and smartly dressed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the partners of Messrs. Cook, Son, and Company, St. Paul's Churchyard, Manchester warehousemen. The prisoner was in our service as salesman and manager of the outfitting department, a business we knew little about ourselves—he had no authority to take money for goods, or to take poods on his own account, or to delivery to Baker—if any ready money transaction took place, or credit not to shippers, it was his duty to enter the goods in the journal of the day—I have here the waste-book and the journal—in the journal there is no entry of these goods—there is an entry in the waste-book to H. Baker—I am not acquaint with the prisoner's writing, but it is very likely it is not his—he might order the clerk to enter it—here is, "Henry Baker, one and three-quarter of super wool, dyed, two and a half kerseymere"—this book is intended expressly for the convenience of shipping—if I wanted an order that was not shipping I should not expect to find it here—across this there is another mark, <hi rend="italic">"Ent, "</hi> meaning it has been entered in the journal—this "<hi rend="italic">Ent., "</hi> in red ink, in my opinion, is the prisoner's writing; but I am not sufficiently aware of it to speak to it—we are unable to turn to the journal of this date, for this is not dated—the item before it is Jan. 24, 1847, and the entry after it is Jan. 16—these two entries are posted in the journal—there is no entry in the journal of Baker's goods—we have never been paid for them—if I had known he had had any transaction with Baker, or let him have these on his own account, I would not have permitted it.</p>

I saw the prisoner on 26th May with a water-pot on his shoulder, and a jacket over it—he was in my son's service—when he saw me he did not come out of the ground to go to breakfast as the other men did—I went to him—he slipped the jacket off his shoulder on to the water-pot—I looked into it and saw these plants.</p>

Mrs. Newman told me something—I had seen the prisoner lyinu down at the corner of the street through which the cart had to pass five minutes before—I knew him when they described him, and took him on the 1 Uh Aug., in Billingsgate—I told him the charge—he said he knew nothing about it—I could not trace the property—after the depositions were taken, he said, "How could Mrs. Newman see me take it from the tail of the cart when she was in the front? I know better than that, how it was taken."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plane-maker, and live at 5, Wood-street, Westminster. On Tuesday morning, 18th July, between two and three o'clock, I was going up Dean-street, Westminster, and met the prisoners Jones and Flynn—they stopped me, and wished me to go home with them—I would not at first, but after some talk I consented, and went to 20, St. Ann-street, to the front-room second-floor—both the women went into the room with me—I gave Flynn 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she went out to get some gin—Jones remained—she asked me to give her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave it her; and while we were on the bed together I felt her draw my watch out of my pocket—there was a hair guard round my neck, which snapped in two—I snatched at her hand to</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the family of Mr. Wallop, of 23, Rutland-buildings, in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster. On Thursday night 20th July, about half-past ten o'clock, I went round, and saw the house all secure—I was disturbed a little before one—I heard a great shaking in the hall by the kitchen-door, and the alarm bell sounded muffled—I called Eliza, thinking it might be her—I then laid quite quiet, and three men came up stairs, and came altogether into my room—one came close to my bedside, right round the bed, another stood at the foot of the bed, and the other at the door, but I could not perceive, for I did not rise up—I know Hawkins from staring at him—I could perceive him very well for some time, looking round the room, they said it was all right, and went out—they were not aware that I was awake—they did not look much at me—I swear to Hawkins, but not to the others—Wilson had been in Mr. Wallop's service as page, and left last Christmas—some of them went up stairs, and one went down stairs, and there was a terrible noise up stairs, and shaking of doors—I got out of bed, but could not open the door—I moved the drawers and a table, put them against the door, and then opened the window, and began crying, "Police!" for about five minutes—they all came rushing down, and I kept on at it, and presently a soldier passed, and asked me whether I was mad—I said, "I suppose I am, for I have had three fellows get into my room"—he went and got a policeman—the policeman came, and we went up stairs, and found Mr. Wallop's cash-box that should have been in the top drawer, on the stairs, and Miss Wallop's jewel-case on the ground, and all the jeweiery about the floor, by the bedpost in Miss Wallop's bed-room—the family were out of town, except me and the cook, named Eliza, who was sleeping up stairs in the attic, two stories above me—I was on the first-floor—the things were lying about, as if the place had been rummaged—Mr. Wallop's drawers had been broken open where the cash-box was, it was a patent lock—I went up to Eliza, and found her asleep—I then went down stairs—the kitchen window was open, and the flower-pots removed from the inside to the outside, on the area steps—one flower-pot was kicked down on the inside cill, and the back door, that leads into the garden, was wide open, so that some one must have come in at the kitchen window, and opened the back door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Wallop. On the Sunday before the robbery, Hawkins called, and wished to see the page—I said he had gone to Church, but he would be home when Church was over, and be at home all day, if he liked to call again—he said he did not know that he could—I said if he did not call before next Sunday he would not see him, for he was going into the country with Mr. Wallop on the Tuesday—I had never seen Hawkins before—I asked if he would call again—he said he thought he would, but would I tell the boy when he came borne that John Hawkins called to see him—I observed his shoes—I was awoke on the night of the robbery, I came down into the kitchen, got a light, and saw the kitchen window open, and I found these shoes, which I believe are the shoes Hawkins had on on the Sunday—they resemble them—I had noticed his feet when he called before—I should not have noticed them so much, but he was so shabbily dressed, except the shoes, and he stood in so careless a manner, not knowing what to say, that I noticed his shoes particularly.</p>

On Thursday, 20th Aug., before the robbery, I saw Wilson in front of Rutland-gate, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning—he passed by me about two yards—I called him back, and said, "Halloo! what are you doing now?"—he said, "Nothing now; I have had a job, and am waiting to get on an omnibus"—after that he asked me if the family was at home—I told him Miss Wallop was out, and if Mr. Wallop was not gone, he was going.</p>

On Friday, 21st July, I ex<lb/>amined the house, 23, Rutland-gate—inside the kitchen-window of the area I found a flower-pot broken—two of the iron bars were about 6 1/2 inches apart, from which I conclude that a small person must have got in that way—a person of Wilson or Hugginson's size could have got in there very well, I think Hawkins could not—there was no appearance of breaking in, in any other direction—in consequence of information on Monday 24th I went to the Hampstead-road with two constables and a man named Price, and whilst watching the house, 4, James-street, Camden-town, where Hug<lb/>ginson lived, I saw Hawkins walk along the road opposite the Mother Red Cap—I followed him three quarters of a mile, and into a brick field, and when he saw me following him he immediately turned quickly round a brick kiln and was out of my sight about two minutes—I went sharply up and said to him, "I want you, Hawkins"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "For a bur<lb/>glary at Knightsbridge"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—while search<lb/>ing he turned round, and I observed Price pick up four bracelets and a buckle from beside the brickkiln where Hawkins had gone—he had these shoes on</p>

I was house surgeon at the London Hospital, on the morning of 20th July, when Culf was brought there; he was tipsy—he had a contused wound on the left side of the forehead, about an inch and a half above the eyebrow, about three-quarters of an inch long, and extending to the bone—it might have been inflicted by the poker—it was serious from its consequences, for erysipelas came on—I attended him as an out-patient for six days—he did not come after—I do not believe the wound could be occasioned by a fall—it might be caused by a fall on a fender—the wound was not one of that shape—I did not see this fender.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 132.) On 16th July, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in Lawn-place, Wilsden, and heard loud screams from a female on the towing-path of the Grand Junction Canal—I went up, and found the witness, Sarah Spicer, screaming—she pointed out a spot in the canal, and also pointed out the prisoner who was about thirty or forty yards off—she said he had been quarrelling with the woman who was in the water—I took him into custody, and asked what he had been doing—he said he had struck her, and he was very sorry for it—I gave him into the custody of another policeman who came up, and one of the by-standers went and fetched a rake—we dragged the canal, and very shortly succeeded in getting out the body of a woman—we sent for a surgeon who said she was dead—I took the body to the Crown—I found this bonnet, cap, and shawl on the towing-path close by the spot—there is blood on the cap and bonnet on the same side, and the bonnet was broken and crumpled as it is now—the prisoner had a child in his arms, and was coming towards the spot as I went up—I assisted in getting the body out—the nearest part of the body was about five feet from the bank—the towing-path is level with the water—there is no bank for a person to jump off—a person might be pushed in head foremost—that would send them some way into the water—a person jumping would go in about the same distance—it is on the descent after you get in—I saw the body when taken out—I did not see any blows or marks of violence about it—there was not sufficient light—I did not see it afterwards—the prisoner had nothing in his hand—the woman had not the least appearance of life when taken out—from the time I first heard the screams till the body was taken out was about half an hour—she must have been left in the water without any effort to take her out—it is a lonely place—I asked the prisoner why he did not assist in getting her out—he said he had a complaint on him, and the doctors had prevented his going into the water—he said it was fistula—I have not ascertained whether that is correct—I believe the water is three feet deep so that a person who had any life in her might find her feet and come out—that depth would not drown a person—she was face upward.</p>

I saw the body of the deceased that same morning—she had a severe bruise on the nose, just such as would be inflicted by a blow from the fist—I think it almost impos<lb/>sible that it could have been received by falling into the water, and coming in contact with any hard substance there; the water would break the fall—I should say, from its appearance, that the blow must have been such as to strike her to the ground or throw her off her legs—if she had been drinking that would be more likely—it was an <hi rend="italic">ecchymosised</hi> wound—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the state of the vessels of the brain indicated previous indulgence, and a blow would be calculated to produce insensibility, which, however, might have been recovered from, if immersion had not taken place; but the blow rendering her insensible she had not power to struggle in the water—I should not say that drowning was the immediate cause of death, for I found plenty of air in the lungs, and no water—the body had not imbibed any water—it is my opinion that she was knocked into the water in an insensible state—I think it possible that she might have thrown herself into the water after receiving the blow—a lapse of time would occur before con<lb/>gestion or insensibility would take place—she might have received the blow and rushed in, and at the same moment might be deprived of her senses—I attribute her death to congestion, from which, owing to her being in the water, she had not the power of recovering—I do not think the water itself would have done it—if she had not been hurt she could have got out at that depth—the blow itself might have caused death; but 1 do not think there was sufficient in the brain to account for death without the aid of the water—the position in which she was found, with her feet towards the bank, does not at all fall in with the idea of her having thrown herself in, unless it was in retreating to escape from the blow—I am acquainted with the spot—the stream is very blight there—the bank is very shelving—if the woman went in herself she must actually have walked into the water—the blow was not such as would be received from the rake in getting the body out.</p>

I live at 31, Cardington-street, Hampstead-road—I let the shop to Mr. Connington—I was awoke on 9th Aug., between twelve and one o'clock in the morning—I heard a rushing noise in my bed-room—the door was shut, I had locked it, and the key was outside—I had gone through a middle door to get into my bed-room—hearing the noise I said, "Who is there"—some one spoke—I got out of bed and called "Thieves!"—I saw two persons going out of the private door of my house—I saw two policemen at the same moment—they took them, and brought them back—I afterwards. missed the key with which they had locked me in my bed-room—that key was not found till after they had been to the station.</p>

On 29th July, about half-past four in the morning, I saw the prisoners coming along Marylebone-street towards Oxford-street—they each had a bundle—they looked at me—I went to the station, got assistance, and followed them into Woodstock-street—I asked Hall what he had got—he said "These," holding up a handkerchief, and that he had brought them from Notting-hill, that they belonged to him, and he was moving them himself to prevent their being scratched—we took them both to the station—I said to Hall, "You say these boxes belong to you?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Who is this?" pointing to Stewart—he said, "My brotber-in-law"—I said, "If these boxes belong to you, you have got the keys of them"—he said, "Yes, these two keys open three of the boxes," and gave them me from his pocket—I said, "Whose box is this?"—he said, "My sister's"—I said, "What is in it?"—he said, "Tapes, cottons, and other things"—the key opened it—it contained those sort of things—I said, "How is it you had it at your place if it belonged to your sister?"—he said, "She was in service at Porchester-terrace"—I found several letters in it addressed "Porchester-terrace"—I said. "Who does this box belong to?"—he said, "That is my wife's"—I said, "What is in it?—he said, "The same sort of things, I can't tell you exactly; I <hi rend="italic">don't bother</hi> myself about my wife's things"—I opened it, it contained similar things to the other, and a letter addressed "Miss Fletcher, Porchester-terrace"—I asked who Miss Fletcher was—he said a friend of his wife's—I found these purses in another box, one with money in it—I said, "Here is a purse, what money is in it?"—he said, "You will find three half-crowns and some silver"—I found three half-crowns and six shillings—another constable took two boxes out of Hall's pocket—I said, "Who does this one belong to?"—he said, "To <hi rend="italic">his</hi> sister"—I said to Stewart, "Does this belong to your sister?"—Stewart said, "Yes"—I opened it, it was quite full of tea—Hall said, he filed it full before he left—I said, "Who does this box belong to?"—Hall said, "That is my own, the key won't open that"—I said, "Where is the key?"—he said, "It is on my other keys, which I have left</p>

               <p>behind"—I sent to Notting-hill to make inquiries—I then charged the pri<lb/>soners on suspicion, and went to Porchester-terrace about half-past eight or a quarter to nine, and found a pair of steps inside the garden, which would enable a person to get down from the garden-wall—there was a quantity of grass put on the bottles on the wall—I traced footsteps from the wall to a window of the house—the window was broken, which enabled any one to undo the fastening and throw up the sash—this iron bar was given me by the gardener—the bar could be bent with it and the shutters opened—the bar is bent—the house is in Paddington parish.</p>

On 24th July, while Knight was under examination, I took Ward at the back of the Court—I followed him to the cells, and beard Knight say, "Tell my friends where I am"—I said to Ward, "Were you in company with the soldier, yesterday?"—he said yes, he was at the George public-house, and left him there, but he knew nothing of the robbery—I said, "I believe the officer wants to see you"—he said, "No, he does not"—I said, "I believe he does"—we had some conversation—he gave me his address and the key of his room—I went there and found this stick and the coat which he had had on, all over mad and dirt—it was a very wet night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bailiff at the County Court, Greenwich. On Wed<lb/>nesday, 26th July, I put a man into possession of the prisoner's house, at Plampstead—in consequence of a communication, I went to the house, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon—when I entered the house I saw the prisoner standing at the door—I said I was a bailiff of the County Court, and had a warrant to seize his goods—I produced the warrant to him—he said, "Get out of my house, you d----vagabond; if you don't I will kill you"—he had something concealed behind him, and he made a <hi rend="italic">job</hi> at my eye—it turned out to be a red-hot poker—it burnt my ear, and all my hair off there—he then struck me a violent blow with it at the back of the head, which caused a wound, and a great quantity of blood to flow—Holmes, who was with me, tried to take the poker from him, and he struck Holmes over the hat at the back of the head, which made a large dent in his hat—we at length succeeded in getting the poker from him—I went to a surgeon.</p>

The prisoner was a lodger in that house—on 17th July he came home in the afternoon—I was sitting in the kitchen with my wife—the prisoner began to use ill words, and said he had a little thing that would settle some one in the house—I did not answer him—he went out, and came back again be<lb/>tween nine and ten in the evening—he was not the worse for liquor—I believe he had taken something—I saw him strike a child who was there—I got up, and said, "If you hit him again, I shall hit you"—he said, "I am quite ready for you"—I struck him, he fell—he put the knife into me twice, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> I have done it <hi rend="italic">for</hi> you"—I found I was wounded in my right shoulder and breast, and my shirt was all blood—I was under the doctor for five weeks—the places are no: well now.</p>

I saw the prosecutor on the evening of 17th July—I found a wound on the arm about three inches long, and two inches deep along the bone—he had been bleeding profusely—I suppose he had lost nearly three pints of blood—he was also bleeding from the right breast, where there was a wound about two inches and a half long, and half an inch deep—they appeared to me to be inflicted with a clasp-knife—I do not think this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) could have inflicted them—the wound on the arm was very dangerous—he was under my care some time, and is not yet recovered.</p>

I marked a half-crown and a five-shilling-piece, and six shillings were marked and put in the till in my presence—after my brother was gone to London I placed the half-crown in the till—it was the only half-crown there—the prisoner came in ten minutes—he went to the part where the till was—I then went to the till, and the half-crown was gone—I followed the prisoner, who had then left to go to the Arsenal, and charged him with having stolen the half-crown—he said he had not—I told him to produce the money he had in his pocket—he produced a sixpence, some copper, and this half-crown—my brother returned, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, at the Bricklayers' Arms, Eccleston-street, Pimlico. My father died last Dec.—he was alive at the time of this robbery, but it hastened his death—on 15th Sept. last, about a quarter-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Eccleston-street, near our house, and the two prisoners came up to me, and asked if I could tell them where the Bricklayers' Arms was—I do not think they mentioned the land<lb/>lord's name—I directed them—I went home half an hour after, and they were then standing at the bar, drinking gin and water—on 21st Sept., about seven in the evening, I saw both the prisoners again—I saw Lawrence first in company with another man, not Chappel—they were standing at the counter, taking half-and-half—Chappel came in shortly afterwards, and called for a glass of half-and-half—he stood talking to me about a quarter of an hour—after that Lawrence and his companion asked for two glasses of gin—Chappel was not with them—I had to turn my back to serve the gin, and when I turned round again Chappel was gone—I did not see him go—Law<lb/>rence and his companion had some gin and cigars—they then began to talk about their friend not having come; that they should not stop any longer, and they left shortly after—soon after that, my sister Mary, who was sitting sewing, jumped up, and ran up stairs, as though something had suddenly attracted her attention—she then called out to me that the house had been robbed.</p>

On Tuesday, 5th Oct. last, about eight o'clock in the evening, I deposited some money in a box, and left it on the mantel-piece, in my bed-room, on the first-floor—I shut the door but did not lock it—after that I came down to the bar-parlour, which is behind the bar—about nine the two prisoners came in, and two others with them, and went</p>

               <p>into the parlour—no one could come into the bar, or the parlour, without my seeing them—a person must pass the stairs to get to the parlour-door—the stairs are about a yard or a yard and a half from the bar—they had some ale, and tobacco and pipes, and I believe some cigars—they staid about half an hour, and all four went away together—I went into the parlour while they were there, and Chappel went out—he said he was ill—I had left the parlour when they came in, and went into the bar—I heard, from my daughter, that one of them was ill—she was to and fro, waiting on them—I did not see him go out—he could not have gone out at the front door without my seeing him—while I was in the bar no one passed the bar towards the stairs from nine till eleven but those four people—several customers had come to the bar—none of them went beyond the bar—I was not away between eight and eleven—if anybody had come in from the front door, and gone to the stairs within that time, I must have seen them—no one but those four came from nine till eleven—we shut up at eleven, and went to bed, and then found the box broken open, and the money gone—my husband bad also been in the bar—the bar does not command a view of the stairs—a person might have stepped out of the parlour, and gone up stairs without being observed—there is no door at the foot of the stairs—the bar opens into a little passage, in which the stairs are.</p>

I was called to the prosecutor's house on 5th Oct., and on the landing of the first-floor stairs, about a yard from Mrs. Wood's bed-room door, I found about two inches of composition candle—I also found a lucifer-match about three inches from the candle—it had been ignited—I noticed a mark on the wall where it had been apparently lighted—this house was formerly a private house—when you go in you face the bar, it is an open room, but there is a place which you may term a pas<lb/>sage, leading to the stairs, about two feet after you had passed the counter, and there is a back door there—I do not think a person could pass from the front door to the stairs without being seen—the counter is about four feet high, and the place where the beer is drawu is upon it, but that would not prevent a person being seen.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Shadwell. On 18th July, I was in front of the Red Lion, Deptford-road, drinking with other people—I went into the back yard to make water, and saw the prisoner sitting with two females—in a minute or two a stone struck me on the head, I did not see who threw it—I was at a regular place, out of thefemales' sight—I went up to the prisoner and asked him what he did it for—he said, "I meant to pitch the stone into the second butt"—I said, "It is very strange you should throw it at me when I am a stranger"—I spoke quietly—he said, "If you don't like it you can have more of it," and wanted to fight—he made a blow at me—we had two rounds, and both fell—he pulled out a knife, opened it, showed it to me and said, "I will give you this"—an officer came and made him shut it up—</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Camberwell, and am a short-hand writer—on the evening of Friday, 28th July, I was present at a meeting at the Chartist Hall, Webber-street, Blackfriars'-road—I got there shortly before eight o'clock—I should say there were from 150 to 200 people present—the number increased afterwards to about 500—they appeared to be working men—a person named Bryson was elected chairman—I heard the defendant speak there—three persons had spoken before him, one was a person of the name of Keene—I took a short-hand note of Shell's speech—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"Mr. Chairman and fellow-workingmen—Being called upon to come forward and propose the second resolution to be submitted to your notice this evening, I do so with feelings of great pleasure and satisfaction, because the opportunity which now presents itself leads me to embrace that opportunity for the pur<lb/>pose of expressing my opinion as to what I consider to be the policy of the English Government towards that unfortunate country, Ireland, as well as to express my determination and disapprobation of the same. The resolution I submit to you is as follows:—'Resolved, that this meeting do solemnly protest against the base and unconstitutional act of the British Legislature, as committed by them in the suspending of the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland; and further, do hereby tender to Feargus O'Connor, Esq., Member of Parliament, and to those gentlemen who supported him, our best thanks for their manly and patriotic conduct on that occasion; and further, that we do hereby solemnly pledge ourselves, that we will render in the hour of trial our full aid and co-operation to our Irish brethren.' In making a few remarks upon the resolution I have submitted to you, you will at once perceive that the resolution which I have moved may fairly be divided into three points; first, condemnation; secondly, commendation; and thirdly, de<lb/>termination. In reference to the act of the Legislature in suspending the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland, it may-perhaps be necessary, for a few moments, that we take a retrospective view of the proceedings of that Legis<lb/>lature in connection with Irish affairs. If we look back to history, and trace the proceedings from the time of the Union up to the present, we shall find that the policy of the English Government towards that unhappy country has been one systematic system of coercion. The Irish people at the time of the Union were promised equality with the English people; they were promised that they should have equal laws and equal justice with the English people. Now, Mr. Chairman, although I have not condemned the acts of the Legislature in connection with my own country, I have still to condemn, and more justly too, I think, the acts of the Legislature in connection with Ireland, whenever and by whomsoever an appeal has been made to the Legislature of this country for justice to the Irish people, it has always been met by a system of coercion entirely; the English people have been coerced as well, and more especially of late, than they formerly were. You will remember that the English people, as well as the Irish people, have wrongs which they justly complain of, and they complain most reasonably and most justly too, because, as men and Englishmen, and as the wealth-producers of this country, they consider they have a right to a fair repre<lb/>sentation in the House of Commons, which at present they are denied. Such is the case with Ireland; and until, as my friend who moved the first resolution observed, Ireland is fairly represented by the people and for the people, no good will ever accrue either to the one country or the other. We know, Mr. Chairman, that there have been fine spirits of late exhibited in the sister country, as well as in this country; men have sprung up who have declared to the people, and told them and taught them what they are as men,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210218"/>
               <p>what they should be as men, and how they may obtain that which they seek Mitchell, the Irish patriot, who has been condemned and transported as a felon for freely explaining to the Irish people what was their duty, what were their rights, and how they were to obtain them, has been sacrificed and made the victim, for promulgating those principles which I am quite glad to see at present are so prominent among the Irish people. Ireland has been taught by the Apostle Mitchell, and I rejoice to see that, although the Govern<lb/>ment has removed him, there are other individuals equally as patriotic as himself, who have nobly and manfully come forward and taken the people by the hand, and declared that they will to the death lead them on, if possible, to victory. Mr. Chairman, I rejoice that such has been the case; and I recommend to the Irish people to follow implicitly the commands of their leaders. I would call also upon the English people who desire liberty, who desire justice, and who desire equality, to stand by the Irish people in the hour of need. As soon as the Irish people are up, as soon as the insur<lb/>rection in Ireland becomes general, (as I believe in the course of a very few hours it will become general), I trust that the people of England will rise to support them. Mr. Chairman and fellow working men, for whatever I say I care not, whatever may follow, I as an Englishman consider that on all occasions, and upon every occasion, when my conscience dictates to me that I have an opportunity of speaking to my fellow men in public or in private, I have an unbounded right to tell them what is the honest conviction of my mind; and if I suffer for so doing, I shall only be another added to the band of patriots who have been crushed; and if, working men, you do allow those men who do nobly come forward and tell you your rights, and how to obtain them, if you allow them to be picked away, if you allow them to be trans<lb/>ported, to enjoy, I was going to say, but rather to be placed in a dungeon, there to suffer all the indignities which it is possible for a base, bloody, and brutal Government to inflict, you do not deserve the name of men, but you ought to be incarcerated yourselves, your families ought to starve around you, and you ought to go howling through the streets as a base and cowardly race of men. Gentlemen, I am not inclined to take up much of your time this evening. In what I say, however humble it may be, remember I am only a working man, and have not much time to spare to study to make use of fine grammatical expressions. I sincerely and honestly co-operate with the friends of liberty as much as those who have more time to spare and to devote to the cause. But, gentlemen, allow me to ask you if you are men, will ye act as men? (cries of "Yes.") If ye are called on to-night, to-morrow, or at any other time, do not show you are cowards, and flinch, but rally round the standard of liberty, defend it with your lives, and may God Almighty grant we may be victorious, that our enemies may be crushed, that they may hide their heads in the dungeons in the hulks, and that our honest patriots may be restored to us, and that they may take their places is my sincere wish."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what manner was this speech received by the meeting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With applause at various parts of it—the resolution Mr. Keene moved was as follows:—"Resolved, that this meeting views with feelings of distrust and alarm the measure adopted by her Majesty's Government, and sanctioned by the Imperial Parliament, for the suppression of public opinion in Ireland, as tending to the final severance of all amicable relations between the two countries; and this meeting is further of opinion, that the Irish people are fully entitled to a free and independent Parliament, and therefore resolves to render to their patriotic brethren in Ireland their cordial sympathy."</p>

No lady is too delicate for the culinary operation of casting bullets; no hand is too white to make up cartridges; and I hope, if it be needful to come to the last resort, that the citizens of Limerick, male and female, will not disgrace their paternal and maternal ancestors"——"Now the fact is, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">United Irishman, "</hi> meaning Mr. Mitchell, "is no hero at all, and never said he was: he has only endeavoured to persuade his countrymen that they will never gain their liberties except by fighting for them; and that the only arguments the British Government will understand are the points of pikes, that's all; and he con<lb/>tinues to preach this saving doctrine, and will continue so to do, until a considerable number of his countrymen agree with him, and then he hopes to aid in enforcing the arguments practically, that's all. As for the sneaking away of Mr. Mitchell, or Mr. Meagher, or any of them, under the protection of the police, it is merely an untruth; the writer in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> who wrote it, and the editor of <hi rend="italic">Saunders</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Mail</hi>, who we find have copied it, know it to be an untruth."——"How are we to meet that day? In arms, my countrymen, in arms! Thus, and not otherwise, have ever nations of men sprung to liberty and power: but why do I reason thus with you, Irishmen cf Ulster, who never have denied the noble creed and sentiment of manhood? You have not been schooled for forty years in the fatal cant of moral force; you have not been utterly debauched and emasculated by the clap-trap platiudes of public meetings, and the empty glare of imposing demonstrations. You have not yet learned the litany of slaves, and the whine of beaten hounds, and the way to die a coward's death. No; let once the great day of your country's destiny seize on you my townsmen, and the way will be as plain before you as a pike-staff twelve feet long."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Having been arraigned at the bar of this Court to-day to answer to a charge preferred against me by the Gentlemen of the Govern<lb/>ment, it is not my intention to follow them through all the mazes and intricacies of the law, for I believe the present existing laws to be so compli<lb/>cated and confused, as to pass my humble powers of conception; but although I stand at the bar of this Court to-day, I trust that no man in this Court will for a moment suppose that I stand here accused of any crime, or any act of dishonesty that I may have committed against my fellow-men; no, not with<lb/>standing all the difficulties that I feel surround me this day, it is a consolation to me to know, that in standing here my honour and integrity as a man, are not impeached; I am here merely for differing from the Government in opinion; for that, and that alone, and in support of that assertion, allow me to draw your attention to the materials out of which this prosecution has been framed. You have heard that on the evening of the 28th July, a meeting was held at the Chartist-hall, Webber-street, and that I at that meeting delivered a speech which has been termed seditious. Was there ever a more diabolical, a more fabricated statement urged on the face of an indictment than that upon which I have this day been accused? I have been accused of having mali<lb/>ciously and wilfully excited her Majesty's subjects to rebellion, and so forth. Now I contend that the remarks I made use of at that meeting are support<lb/>able by historical facts. You have heard from the evidence of Wm. Counsel, the Government reporter, that I felt a pleasure and satisfaction in expressing my opinion of the policy of the British Government towards Ireland, and in moving the resolution condemnatory of the base and unconstitutional acts of the British Legislature I stated that it was necessary to refer to history to support the assertion which I then made, and on referring to history, what do we find? why, that up to the period of 1782, Ireland was free from English legislative thraldom, and it was not till that date that the Act 6 Geo. III. passed, which claimed and exercised the power of British legislation over Ireland. Now the mere passing of that Act, even of itself, admits the pre<lb/>existence of freedom, and leads us to inquire how a nation, that long before 1300 possessed its own legislature, came to give up to a foreign power the right of self-government. What do we find? Why, that the Irish parliament, backed by the Irish people, exerted this power of independence in legisla<lb/>tion for their own country. But passing over that period, and coming down to the time of the American war, when that people revolted against England for attempting to trample on their legislative rights, and insisted upon perfect legislative independence with such an ardour and force of arms, that England became alarmed and proposed a final adjustment, which was entered into. But England never yet preserved or performed a treaty with Ireland; and thus we perceive one encroachment after another, until we come down to the period of 1800, when the Act of Union was carried by the most diabolical and contemptible means that was ever resorted to for a class legislation; which atrocious acts of plunder has at last plunged the country into all the horrors of insurrection. Such has been the policy of the English Government towards Ireland. Will you tell the world, by your verdict this day, that it is sedition for a man to sympathise with Ireland's wrongs? To tell them that they have a right to use any constitutional means which they have in their power to remove the tyrants from power who have brought them to death's door by heir acts of tyranny? Will you tell the world, by your verdict, that it is sedition to tell your countrymen to organize and oppose the same tyrants</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210222"/>
               <p>who are trying to reduce you to the same depths of misery and degradation? Will you tell the world that it is sedition for a man to try to unite English<lb/>men and Irishmen together? Gentlemen, I hope better things of you; are: are men, I presume, who are moving in what are called the middle circles of society, some of whom, I doubt not, have sons who, when brought to years of maturity, will have to grapple and struggle with the affairs of business; think seriously of the ruin and misery which the atrocious policy of the Government is entailing upon you by seeking to destroy thac spirit of justice and growing intelligence which the working classes are determined to enjoy, and to remove the fruits of those who have so long laboured for the working classes, just as they are beginning to make their appearance. But the working classes are beginning to understand that they are the wealth-pro<lb/>ducers, and are entitled to receive a proportionate share of enjoyment, and they are determined to meet from time to time to consider what steps are likely to promote their cause, and to discuss and promote tbeir principles and if the noble Lord at the head of the Government supposes that by employing a few thousand policemen to break the heads of honest and hard-working men, and by employing spies to procure convictions, through the means of prejudiced juries, he will ultimately find himself mistaken. The avidity with which the great majority of the people of this country have adopted the principles of the people's charter, seems greatly to have frightened the noble Lord at the head of the Government; and no wonder, when the eyes of the people being to open, and they begin to inquire how the taxes have become so enormously increased, and when they see nothing but bankruptcy and ruin staring then in the face. This has led a great many men to desire a speedy change in public affairs, and to inquire how this state of things has been brought about, The noble lord has said that the disaffection of the Chartists has been to such an unparalleled extent, as has obliged him to increase the rates in order to support the men who had come forward in order to put down that disaffec<lb/>tion; but this lame story has only led the people to make further inquiries, and to adopt such measures as to bring about a better state of things, and the means they had decided upon are the principles of the people's charter. Do you know those principles, Gentlemen?—if not, allow me to refer you to that excellent little pamphlet written by Dr. M'Douall, wherein be states what they are, and what they want. I believe that the principles of the people's charter contain one of the best political creeds that was ever submitted. Its points are easy of conception, and its principles are just. It does not, as some assert, wish to destroy one class of society to raise up another, nothing of the sort; but it does wish to give to all a just political equality. It seeks to give to every man of sound mind, untainted by crime, a voice in the election of the representatives of the people. It seeks to destroy a pro<lb/>perty qualification, for the purpose of giving men of talent, without pecuniary resources, an opportunity of obtaining a seat in Parliament. It seeks to pre<lb/>vent that disgraceful intimidation and bribery which is carried on under the present system. It seeks to shorten the duration of Parliaments, to keep the representatives of the people honest. It seeks, as nearly as possible, equal electoral districts, so as to give as fair a representation of the country at large as can possibly be obtained. These are some of the leading principles of the charter; and for calling upon my fellow-countrymen to organise, never to cease their agitation, but to avail themselves of every opportunity to forward their cause, I have been charged with all the foul and malignant falsehoods contained in the indictment; and for this the learned counsel wishes to obtain conviction. I feel assured, Gentlemen, that I need not remind you of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210223"/>
               <p>good conduct and forbearance of the people on 10th April, when the Govern<lb/>ment mustered all their forces, and banded all their troops, to prevent the people from getting free access to Parliament. I feel assured that you are already convinced that the contents of the indictment are nothing more than a tissue of falsehoods, and that this is only intended for the purpose of putting down public opinion—of destroying the right of public meeting, and making victims of honest men. Do not lend yourselves as the tool of such a Government; but let your manly and consistent verdict this day tell the tyrants of misrule and oppression, that Englishmen shall inherit the ancient rights of their forefathers, and the gratitude of a grateful people will reverence your memories in ages yet to come.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a short-hand writer. On Friday even<lb/>ing, 28th July, I was present at a meeting at the Chartist-hall, Webber-street, Blackfriars-road—I got there a few minutes before eight—about 150 persons were then assembled—the number afterwards increased to the extent of between four and five hundred—they consisted of mechanics—the defend<lb/>ant presided as chairman—he was not in the chair before I got into the room, but a few minutes afterwards, as the numbers gradually increased, the chair<lb/>man and other parties appeared on the platform—he took the chair without being moved in—he addressed the meeting in the first instance—I took a note of his speech, and have it here—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Ladies and Gentlemen, we have met this evening to give utterance to sentiments of sympathy in behalf of a people who have suffered the first shock of the tyrant's vengeance. Whether the intelligence that was received, and generally circulated yesterday, is correct or incorrect it still requires some time to elucidate; but it is very evident that the excuse, and the lame story told by Sir George Grey last night in the House of Commons, tallies very ill with what appears this morning in the papers. A newspaper when it receives intelligence from its correspondent at a distance, know whether to place confidence in the man or not; and it is not likely that so many correspondents would put their heads together to send one and the same story to this country by express, and then the next day contradict every word of it. They must. have stated, the correspondents themselves must have acknowledged, this morning, that they were gross liars, and it is not very likely that they are going to do that for their employers; or else they must have stated that they fell asleep from over fatigue, and dreamt all about it. However it is very evident something is going on in Ireland; what it is we do not exactly know, but it is quite evident this Government is afraid of what is going on in Ireland—(cries of "let us go on here, now is the time)—Gentlemen, if I am your chairman this evening, I hope you will keep order, and if any gentleman makes use of expressions in the body of the Hall, I hope none of you will pay any attention to him, for depend upon it that Gentleman has not any good intention towards your cause, for it is the way in which all Govern<lb/>ment spies attempt to get up a disturbance in public meetings; now be upon your guard, I beg of you, for it is quite evident they are sent on purpose to do such things—(a voice, "they ought to be kicked out")—if you are not satisfied with <hi rend="italic">this</hi> meeting, and if you have got anything to say, I shall be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210226"/>
               <p>happy if you will come on the platform and say it, and all the company besides. I beg of you to have a little patience; do not mind the interrupt<lb/>tion, pay no attention to it, that is the best way to get over it—there can be little doubt, as I was stating to you, there must be something doing in Ireland of an extraordinary nature, because even in this day's paper, in the organ of Government, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, it mentions the fact that 400 war<lb/>rants have been issued against the confederate leaders, by the Lord Lieutenant, in one day; that does not look amicable, or as if things were going on peaceably and quietly. It is stated how many forges were ringing with the manufacture of pikes, in defiance of the police and the authorities. Troops have been leaving every morning from London and other parts to go to that unhappy country, as I must call it. But nevertheless, it is evident that whatever has been done, they have stood the shock very nobly, if shock it has been. There can be very little doubt the sword is drawn and the bullet is flying on the other side of the channel—(Loud cheers)—our rulers may attempt to disguise the fact, but the truth will ultimately come out. There can be no question about it at the present moment, that we are in a very precarious situation: it is for us, however, to remain quiet, and not commit ourselves in any way; and I trust any gentleman who comes up here to say a word this evening, will be very careful of his language, because a very good authority; and we, the Chartists, have great confidence in his authority on law; informed me to-day that this was, according to the new Act, a seditious meeting. However, Gentlemen, I have not withdrawn from what I promised the learned counsel, and that was to take the chair this evening, although he informed me it was seditious; but I trust none of you will allow me to answer for your crimes, it is quite enough if I answer for my own, and all the words upon this Bill I hold in my hand, and all the expressions I have given utterance to I have no objection to go into a Court of Justice and defend, without the aid of Counsel. I do not want any attorney to pick out a flaw in the indictment, or any forensic oratory to get me off; I stand by the principles mentioned in the Bill; I stand by the words I have used, but I hope and trust you will be careful in what you say, for I am answerable for everything you say this evening, the same as if I spoke it myself. With these remarks, Gentlemen, as there are several resolutions to come before this meeting, I trust none of you will overstrain your language; no doubt many of you are warm and enthusiastic in it, and perhaps might feel the spirit rising as it did in Douglas, and you might perhaps say you 'longed to follow to the field some warlike chief, but you must not say that here. With respect to that unfortunate country, Ireland, there can be no doubt also that our Government has sent some of the very harshest—to give it the mildest term—the harshest of their Generals. The last new importation, the oriental slaughterman has been sent over; that gentleman has been sent over, no doubt, for the purpose of slaughtering our Irish brethren, doing it in a Sikh fashion; but it is to be hoped that he will find even a tougher foe than the Sikh was. That General, not to call him by a more harsh name, that human butcher, was in the habit of tying his red bandanna to his bloody sword, and waving it in the air as a signal telegraph to his troops to go in and cut down women, men, and children who came in reach of the weapon. Is he gone to Ireland to do the same thing? He is gone, but whether for that purpose or for a more amicable one we have not the opportunity of knowing. With these few remarks, Gentlemen, I will sit down, and call upon your old friend—and I also beg to state, before I sit down, that it may create no confusion hereafter, that as we are only working people who have got up this meeting—you know a meeting of this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210227"/>
               <p>description cannot be got up without expense—and therefore there will be a collection this evening for the purpose of defraying the expense. I hope we shall hare many such numerous meetings as we have now, and as peaceable as the last time we met in this Hall. With these remarks I will sit down, and call upon your old friend and warden, Mr. Keene, to propose the first resolution; and he will also read you a letter from an individual you will be happy to hear would have attended this evening, were it possible; and also, I may state that even the Government hirelings of this country are beginning to use the victims at present in their possession rather harshly; although the Defence-fund has paid for the maintenance of Mr. Vernon in prison, to exempt him from labour, nevertheless he has been forced to pick oakum until his fingers were blistered. This is no flying report; I have had it to-day from the lips of Mrs. Vernon herself; and also I have seen a letter from Dr. M'Douall, which you will soon have the miserable pleasure of reading to<lb/>morrow in the 'Star.' That gentleman was thrust into a cell through which the hot water pipes passed, for the purpose of conveying hot water to other apartments of the prison, and there they kept him stewing, I cannot give it any other name; for hoars, until he refused to complain, because it only gratified them; and this gentleman was obliged to take off his coat, waist<lb/>coat, and trowsers, and stand up in a corner of the cell to keep life, soul, and body together—(Loud cries of shame). That is the state of your Govern<lb/>ment, and the resolution therefore calls upon you loudly to sympathize, par<lb/>ticularly with your Irish brethren, who no doubt are suffering similar acts of outrage and violence."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was that speech received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With cheers—a person named Keene then spoke—in the course of his speech he said: "Mitchell saw the misery his country was suffering under; Mitchell knew he must be a sacrifice, but he was willing to be a sacrifice, if by—that sacrifice he could rouse his countrymen to a perfect knowledge of what their rights were"—(three cheers for Mitchell were then given)—the resolution that was proposed by Mr. Keene was, "Resolved, that this meeting views with feeling of distrust and alarm the measure adopted by Her Majesty's Government, and sanctioned by the Im<lb/>perial Parliament, for the repression of public opinion in Ireland, as tending to the final severance of all amicable relations between the two countries; and this meeting is further of opinion that the Irish people are fully entitled to a free and independent parliament, and therefore resolves to render to their patriotic brethren in Ireland their cordial sympathy." After Keene, a person named Pedley spoke—the following is a passage in his speech: "I believe, Mr. Chairman, the fact is this, that Ireland is in arms; that they are fighting there; I trust they will speedily gain a victory, and God speed them in their cause!"—that was received with cheers—the resolution was then put by the defendant to the meeting, and carried unanimously—Shell then spoke—I took his speech—Mr. Counsell also took it—we each took the meeting throughout—Shell proposed the second resolution—it was this: "Resolved, that this meeting do solemnly protest against the base and unconstitutional act of the British Legislature, as committed by them in the suspendin? of the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland; and, further, do hereby tender to Feargus O'Connor, Esq., M. P., and to those gentlemen who supported him, our best thanks for their manly and patriotic conduct on that occasion; and, further, that we do hereby solemnly pledge ourselves that we will render in the hour of trial our full aid and co-operation to our Irish brethren"—I did not take that part where the defendant introduced Mr. Rooney to second a resolution—I have Rooney's speech—he said, "Mr. Chairman, Englishmen, and Irish<lb/>men too, I don't know that I am in my place to-night in seconding this reso<lb/>lution;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210228"/>
               <p>I only come among you as a visitor, but I wish to ask you one or two questions, and I take the opportunity of seconding the resolution to ask to ask you—I wish to know, has organization done its duty among you?—are you satis<lb/>fied, Englishmen, that the troops of Britain are sent to slaughter your fellow<lb/>men in Ireland <hi rend="italic">I</hi> Are you satisfied? We are not satisfied, and we are come to the determination, and let the reporter hear me, that sooner than any shall leave London for Ireland, they must leave it across our corpses (cheers); I made a vow a month ago that I would never say anything at a meeting again; but you must pardon me to-night, for the future nothing but action is required for men; I beg to second the resolution"—there were some words at the con<lb/>clusion which escaped me—Mr. Counsell's note is fuller than mine—after that the defendant spoke again—he said, "I rise for the purpose of answering the two questions Mr. Rooney has required to have answered. One was, whe<lb/>ther we were organized or not? You are aware we are organized, and that all the acknowledged Chartists belonging to this Hall are organized, and under the proper officers; but every individual who comes into this Hall is not under organization, therefore we have no control over them. The other ques<lb/>tion was, whether you were satisfied with the present abuse towards Ireland.? '(cries of 'No!') and whether you would co-operate, and whether you are willing, that is, the organized part of you, because the others are of no use to any party, whether those who belong to the organization are willing to co<lb/>operate with the confederates (cries of 'Yes! ') It bas been said some time ago, that the confederates would not come over to us, and that we must go over to them; but this evening is a contradiction to that statement, for the confederates have come to you, and they are willing to co-operate; and I trust Mr. Rooney, when he returns to his club, will inform them that the organized Chartists of the South Lambeth locality, are willing to go hand in hand with any scheme that the confederates have for the amelioration of Ireland"—immediately after that Rooney said, "I beg to tender the best gratitude of the John Mitchell Club, for your sympathy with their unfortunate countryman, and I hope"—there was an interruption there—something was said about a nod being as good as a wink to a blind horse, but I did not write it down—Mr. Counsell has it.</p>

But with all these disadvantages, I do not despair of being</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210230"/>
               <p>able to show you that the part I took in the political sympathy with my brother democrats was nothing more than a justifiable right, inherited by all freemen; nor are you to suppose, because I stand before you unassisted by counsel, that I do so for the purpose of creating sympathy in my behalf I do it from a conviction that any one of you, similarly situated, and having the least regard for your word and honour, would have acted the same; neither are you to suppose that my political associates have abandoned me to my fate; on the contrary, I was no sooner arrested than professional aid was tended and refused, on the ground that however learned the advocate might be or how<lb/>ever conversant with the intricacies of his profession, conviction would follow conviction, until once that class of society out of which juries are composed become convinced that to coerce the working classes is but the steppin-stone to their own political and social degradation. I have no doubt that most of you have presided at a public meeting during some period of your life, and, therefore, you are aware that some warmth of language is required on the part of the chairman, that the audience may be made acquainted with the nature of the motives for calling them together; and if I, on the 28th ult., while acting as chairman, gave utterance to language con<lb/>trary to law, it was nevertheless dictated by views of humanity. We had received the day before, by public intelligence, a brief account of Irish dis<lb/>turbances; and as that people were struggling for political freedom, with<lb/>held from them by the same power that kept us in political thraldom, it was but natural we should tender our sympathies at such a crisis, and particularly when our grievances were so closely allied; and I do not think there was anything dangerous in the reply I made to Mr. Rooney, that we were willing to co-operate for the amelioration of the Irish people; common courtery required me to say as much, seeing that that gentleman headed a deputation of fifty members from the Mitchell Club; and certainly, had I returned a less favourable answer, there can be little doubt that a disturbance would have been the consequence, because there were a great number of policemen in disguise, in the room at the time, and they had made several attempts to disturb the meeting during the evening, and a greater number outside fully armed and ready to act at a moment's notice, fully determined to break up the meeting if possible prematurely. I was aware of their intention both inside and outside the room, for I had just received a note from one of those sent to watch their proceedings, telling me to endea<lb/>vour to keep order if possibly could, because, said he, 'the butchers outside," this is the policemen, I do not disguise the fact, "are evidently bent on: slaughter, and all they want is a pretext to begin." That the police are capable of doing such things you are all very well aware, from the late in<lb/>vestigation into the Bishop Bonner's-field police onslaught. It appears, however, that I conducted the meeting to its close without the least approxi<lb/>mation to disorder. Then as for putting the public into great alarm, as the learned gentleman has stated, with respect to the Life and Property Protection Society, I can only tell him that such things are very common, and I should suppose he had seen similar societies in this country and other parts of Europe: it is certainly called a Life and Property Protection Society, and that was by the advice of counsel, and also by the advice of the Mayor of Nottingham, and the society founded in the city of Nottingham was approved of by the Mayor of that city; and our rules are the same. It has nothing to do with the Chartist Association, and in fact that society does not exist at the present. time in any locality that I am aware of, because it was assumed that the Chartist Association was sufficient to answer all the purposes. As for the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210231"/>
               <p>organization that is merely an arrangement, as to the internalmanagement of the society, and the documents referring to it, can be purchased at any of the political booksellers for a halfpenny. With respect to Mr. Vernon and D M'Douall, if I had been allowed to have the documents in I could have shown you the very words I read in my speech—or I might have sent for Mrs. Vernon, who no doubt could prove that her husband has sent word to that effect; for she stated in the presence of several other people besides myself, that he had been compelled to pick oakum, and that Feargus O'Connor had been sent to about it. As for Mr. Keene's speech, I can see notthing that very material against me; the fact is, he had had intelligence which is confirmed by another gentleman, Mr. Cope, who belongs to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, that Ireland was in a state of disturbance; and surely it was no great harm to repeat at a public meeting, that which appeared in the newspapers. As for the witness Bywater, perhaps there is nothing very objectionable in his evidence, he found the trunk containing these papers unlocked; many of them are not my writing, nor has there been any proof that they are the minutes of any particulars produced at any meeting. With respect to the sympathy we held with the people of Ireland, it is quite clear they were in a state of disturbance at the time I presided at this meeting: and are we on this side of the channel to be deprived of the rights of humanity, and be come amenable to the laws for sympathizing with those on the other side? for who among you, if he has not drained his veins of the milk of human kindness, would not sympathize with an oppressed people, standing on the threshold of civil war, and unable to say how soon the same horrors might surround your own dwellings? Does it not make your blood run cold, when you think that the maladministration of our internal affairs has driven the people to such a course, leaving them no other choice than open insurrection or unregretted starvation? But do not imagine that the coercive measures lately enacted were framed for the purpose of suppressing the spirit of free<lb/>dom that is rising in the bosom of the honest mechanic will be laid aside when a few convictions have been obtained; on the contrary, when you have occasion to complain of ministerial oppression, and I do not think that many of you will say that the present Cabinet are doing that which is best calculated to promote contentment and prosperity in the country, that moment will you become subject to the same persecution, and those Acts of Parliament that have been framed to suppress us, will be unscrupulously used for your oppression; you may read a lesson of your future fate in the subterfuge which the present ministry resorted to on 10th April last, when the working classes of the metropolis attempted to exercise what has never been disputed to be a constitutional right,—the right of meeting and going in procession with the petition of their grievances to the Legislature. But, though they were determined to make no concessions, they were aware that there were sample reasons for complaining, and they felt no hesitation in raking up an obsolete act,—an act that had been consigned to oblivion for more than a century and a half, and one that had only been passed to prevent a debauched monarch from being interrupted in his royal revelries by the con gratulations of his loyal subjects;—I allude to the act of Charles II., which suppressed a constitutional right possessed by the people at that period: what are you to expect from such men as these, when you will no longer allow them to rob you with impunity? do you imagine that if Lord John Russell succeeds in suppressing the present discontent among the working classes, which is very doubtful, that he will next Session withdraw his bill for an additional income-tax, merely because it is not consonant with your</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210232"/>
               <p>wishes, or will he consult the necessity of ministerial extravagance and bring you to compliance by statutory and military coercion—every thinking man in this country follows some political creed, the principles of which either accord with his pecuniary interest or coincide with his con<lb/>scientious belief; and I have no hesitation in saying that I believe the Charter to be the best political creed that has been brought forward for the consideration of all classes. Its points are easy of comprehension, and its principles are honest. It does not offer concessions for one class of men, and refuse them to another; nor docs it involve the ruin of one set of men, as the necessary basis upon which another set are to flourish. Can there be any sedition in demanding for every man of sane mind, untainted with crime, and at the age of maturity, a voice in the election of the national representatives? Can it be sedition to demand security for that voice? Is it seditious to require the people's representatives to give an account of their delegation at shorter periods than they have hitherto done? or will it appear seditious to demand that a man of talent, without property, should have an equal right to a scat in the people's parliament which the man with property, but without talent, now possesses? Is it seditious to require that that man shall be remunerated for his labour? Or can you call it sedition to demand that each division of the kingdom be as nearly as possible equally repre<lb/>sented? Yet such, Gentlemen, is the sum total of all the points of the Charter—the meaning; of the principles of this new philosophy, which has frightened the Sovereign, alarmed the Ministry, maddened the aristocracy, and distracted the middle classes, but now reigns paramount in the minds of the people. Depend upon it, Gentlemen, when the people understand and adopt a line of policy, neither scaffolds, nor dungeons, nor shackles, will arrest their onward career; nor will unprincipled oppression annihilate their power. You may do as Castlereagh did, thirty years ago, with the Radicals in the west of Scotland, when he emptied the gaols and bridewells of their criminal inmates, and set the felon free, that he might make room for honest Reformers: and although he brought some to the block, and sent some few into exile, yet radicalism prospered, and at this day stands high in the estimation of political reformers.</p>

My husband keeps a beer-shop in Tooley-street On 6th Aug., the prisoner was there in the evening—I served him with half-a-pint of beer—he paid me a penny—he then asked me for two sixpences for a shilling—I had not two sixpences—I gave him sixpence and sixpenny. worth of halfpence—he gave me a shilling, which I put into the till where there was no other silver—in about five minutes he called fora pint of beer—the girl gave it him—he gave her a shilling, which she gave me—I said it was bad, and returned it to him—he sent me twopence for the beer—he then had half a screw of tobacco, and sent a bad shilling, which I returned—I looked at the first shilling which I had put into the till—it was bad—the prisoner took it out of my hand directly and went away with all the three shillings—the officer has one shilling which I believe to be the one I had from the prisoner first and put into the till.</p>

On Sunday night, 5th Aug., I fastened my house up about nine o'clock—I came home about three in the morning, unlocked the door, and went to bed—in about twenty minutes I heard footsteps come down the staircase;—I got and said, "Good God! who is that in the room?"—the prisoner said, "You b----y whore, I have come to murder you!"—I believe he had got in at the window—he has been in the habit of coming in that way—I missed a shawl from my table.</p>
