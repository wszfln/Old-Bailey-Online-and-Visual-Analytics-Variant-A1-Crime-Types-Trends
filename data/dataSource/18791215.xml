On 10th November I was on duty in Oxford Street, and about 5 p.m. saw the prisoner in Castle Street, near Tottenham Court Road—I said "Have you been in Tottenham Court Road V—he said "No"—I said "You answer the description of a man who is wanted for uttering counterfeit coin"—he said "You are labouring under a great mistake; I am not the man"—I said "I shall take you in custody on this charge"—on the way to the station he put his hand in his pocket, and when he pulled it out he had some money in it which looked like silver—I wrenched it from his hand, and found these six bad florins, one wrapped in newspaper and five loose—I searched him at the station, and found on him a screwdriver, a black lead pencil not cut, a bottle of blacking, a new collar, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and bronze—he gave his name Morris—he was taken to the Court next morning; I gave him into the charge of another constable, and he escaped—on the Saturday fortnight afterwards I saw him in Rupert Court, Russell Square, and said "Is your name Mitchell?"—he said "No"—I said "You are the man," and took him in custody—I after<lb/>wards went to his lodging in Anerley Street, Battersea Park, with Inspector Angier.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry James Fitzroy—I was married to him at the parish church of St. Michael, at Worcester, on 29th May, 1878—at that time I was a widow and my name was Kate Walsh Smith—Henry James Fitzroy was the eldest son of Lord Charles Fitzroy—before my marriage I knew Mr. Froggatt as a solicitor practising in Argyll Street, Regent Street, and in preparing a deed of settlement he acted as solicitor for my husband; I had no separate solicitor acting for me—this is my signature to this deed, and this "Henry Fitzroy" is my husband's—the others are the signatures of Mr. Froggatt and Mr. Meare, the trustees—that deed was signed at Worcester on the morning of my marriage by those different parties—I had not known Mr. Mears before, he was quite a stranger to me and to my husband; Mr. Froggatt introduced him to me at Worcester; he lived there—Mr. Froggatt was present at my marriage, and after the ceremony he took possession of the deed—I lived with my husband till 9th May, 1875—up to that time the dividends were paid from time to time into my husband's account at Drummond's bank—in December, 1875, I received this letter from the defendant; it is his writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "7th December, 1875. 6, Argyll Street, Regent Street Dear Mrs. Fitzroy,—I send you by book-post copy of your settlement. Mr. Webber called here yesterday and would not make the affidavit without he was paid a guinea. I went to him this morning; he has gone to Brighton, and will not be back till to-night. I will see him, pay him the guinea, and get his affidavit.") I also received this letter, dated 4th January, 1876; it is the defendant's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had sent her settlement to be copied and would send copy to-morrow, and that he would pay in to her credit at the Bank of England dividends amounting</hi> to 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) This letter of 5th July, 1876, is also in the defendant's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had paid in the dividends.</hi>) This is the copy of the deed, which I received with the letter of 7th December, 1875—after my husband left me in May, 1875, I opened an account in my own name, at the Western Branch of the Bank, of England—being a married woman, they would not take the account as my own, and it was headed in the name of Mr. Webber, a friend of mine, a wine merchant, and the dividends were duly paid in by the defendant to that account—after my husband left me I had obtained a protection order, to protect property which I was separately entitled to—from that time until 1877 I did not know that the trust had been interfered with by anybody; I thought I was receiving my dividends from the proper funds—at the latter part of 1877 it came to my knowledge that the defendant was being prose<lb/>cuted; I then consulted another solicitor, Mr. Yorke—I subsequently saw Mr. Froggatt at a restaurant on Ludgate Hill—at that time he was on bail on the charge of the turf frauds—I met him at his request, that was in writing; I have not got the letter—I asked him what was he going to do</p>

Farrer, Ouvry, and Co. in reference to myself, but I have not—I do not know the signature to the letter produced—I do not know a person, of the name of Benjamin, nor was I aware that my husband was in very great difficulties until the first year of our marriage—it was then that Mr. Froggatt managed his monetary affairs—I did not know that some of the stock was sold out and not reinvested—I have read this letter (<hi rend="italic">blue paper</hi>); it is in Mr. Fitzroy's handwriting—I did not know that Mr. Fitzroy autho<lb/>rised Mr. Froggatt to sell out—Mr. Yorke is my solicitor at present—I have not said that I wished to prosecute my husband for misappropriating these moneys—I do not know that my husband has attempted to upset our marriage on the ground that I have a husband living; I never heard it from Mr. Fitzroy or anybody—I saw my solicitor, Mr. Yorke, in August last about this case, and commenced a Chancery suit for the recovery of this trust money—I do not know that Mr. Yorke has done things without my sanction, nor do I know that he has applied to the Court of Chancery to distribute this trust money. (<hi rend="italic">The statement of claim was here put in.</hi>) I don't remember the date exactly that the defendant came out of prison; it was after the writ was issued, and he was thereupon arrested—I told Mr. Yorke to take proceedings against him, and I left it entirely in his hands—I have never heard of such a thing as a "Ne-exeat"—I brought a Chancery suit, and obtained a decree—as far as I know, interrogatories were not administered to Mr. Froggatt—the dividends were paid to me in July and January—I believe the writ was issued after I found that the dividend was not paid in to my account in January, 1878—I do not know that Mr. Farrer bought the reversion in the year 1873—I never knew that the defendant was dealing with this trust fund under my husband's direction; I never heard of it—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my husband's handwriting—I think he</p>

Farrer, Ouvry, and Farrer, are solicitors to the Duke of Grafton's and to Lord Fitzroy's family—I was led to believe by Mr. Webber that the reversion was purchased at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings—I have never heard of my first husband since the London went down—the action that was brought against me was by Madame Ox, a milliner—on that occasion I was represented by a solicitor and counsel—Mr. Roberts was my solicitor, and Mr. Besley my counsel—I left the conduct of the case entirely in the hands of my solicitor, and he put what answer he thought fit—I also resisted the claim on the score of its being very exorbitant—after I last saw Mr. Smith I was left entirely on my own resources up to the time I married Mr. Fitzroy—Mr. Froggatt did not act for me as my solicitor before my marriage—I acquainted Mr. Froggatt with everything concerning my former husband, and gave him the letters and papers—before my marriage to Mr. Fitzroy I gave directions to Mr. Froggatt to make certain inquiries—since November, when I first became acquainted with Mr. Yorke, I placed the matter entirely in his hands to manage for me.</p>

               <p>—the prisoner was the butcher, and the deceased William Wiggi the chief steward—on 6th October we had made fast at Port Said, and ther was a lighter alon side the vessel—I saw the prisoner go towards the steward in a very threatening way with something in his hand, and by the time got round the mast the blow had been given—I heard the blow and saw the steward falling overboard—he fell seven feet into the lighter—I took holt of the prisoner and handed him to the chief officer—he said something in French which I did not understand, and dropped this belaying-pin (<hi rend="italic">producd</hi>)—it is made of iron—before the blow was struck the steward was finding fault with the prisoner for being negligent with the poultry, and I saw him give the prisoner two or three blows; I cannot say whether with his open hand or fist—that was 10 minutes before I saw the steward falling into the lighter—the prisoner was standing behind the steward when he struck the blow.</p>

I was surgeon on board the Duke of Buccleugh—on 6th October at Port Said I was called to the chief steward, and found him bleeding from a very severe wound at the back of his head, about three inches long, both incised and contused—this instrument would cause it—he complained of great pain in his back; he had no power in his limbs, and could not feel his legs—when I saw him he was in the lighter alongside the steamer—he was unable to move, and was carried on board—I then examined him, and found a bruise on the lower part of his spine, which would be likely to result from a fall overboard into the lighter—he remained paralysed the whole voyage, and on our arrival he was conveyed to St. Mary's Hospital—he was a very strong man, and was in robust health before this.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the service of Mr. Hartell, of 12, Earl Street, Westminster, 12 months—the prisoner used to wash for Mr. Hartell—she has not had the washing since about a week before this affair occurred—on 31st October she came to the house—I opened the door to her, and she said "Tell Margaret I want to see her"—Mrs. Henley's Christian name is Margaret, and she was housekeeper to Mr. Hartell—I was kitchen-maid and had to attend to the door—Mr. Hartell had a house<lb/>maid, kitchen-maid, and cook—I went to the kitchen and told Mrs. Henley, and she went upstairs—I followed her—before Mrs. Henley got to the top of the stairs the prisoner threw some vitriol in her face, and then opened the door and fled—she had her band under her cloak—I did not see her take her hand out—it was all done in a moment—it was a dark thick fluid—it burnt Mrs. Henley, who cried out "Oh, my eye!"—it went into her eye—she sat down in a chair, and seemed in much pain—there was a quantity of fluid lying about the hall—her dress was much burnt—the housemaid, Mary Keen, took her to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. On 31st October I was acting as house surgeon at the Westminster Hospital—I examined the last witness—she was suffering from a burn on the right cheek and right side of the neck and right arm and slightly on the left arm—the upper part of the body of her dress was also burnt—the burning substance had penetrated the dress to the skin of the neck and upper part of the breast—the right eye was injured by the intrusion of some fluid—she was taken into the ward, and evidently suffered very much—she has remained in the ward ever since with the exception of attending at the police-court—sbe has entirely lost the sight of the right eye, and it remains a question whether the eye will not have to be removed to endeavour to avoid sympathy and to try to save the other eye—where there is an injury to one eye there is always a liability of the other to suffer—the burns were such as would be caused by oil of vitriol, which is the popular name for sulphuric acid—it is a dark liquid and oily—I submitted the dress to a chemical test, and undoubtedly detected oil of vitriol—she is still under my care.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Cove, a carpenter, living at No. 2, Payne's Place, Kentish Town Road; we occupy the front room ground floor—the prisoner lived in the back room ground floor—he came there about 11th October last with Mary Ann Piper and three children; the eldest child was a girl about 13, named Emily Piper, the next was a boy, Charles Piper, about 11, and the third was the baby, Louisa Piper—Mrs. Mead occupied one of the rooms upstairs—the woman Mary Ann Piper used to go out to work the greater part of the day; she used to go out at all times, mostly early in the morning, and return in the evening—the eldest girl, Emily, was out during the day, she had a little place; the boy was mostly at school during school hours—the prisoner was usually at home with the baby—I first saw the baby about a fortnight after they came, on a Sunday, I saw her going out along with the elder sister—I noticed the appearance of the child; I noticed bruises on the side of its little ear and scratches on the side of its face—in our room I could hear distinctly what took place in the prisoner's room; there was only a partition door between the two rooms—he has knocked the baby about when the woman has been at home, but he has beat it most shamefully when she has been out—I could hear every word that was said—I heard him beating the chili about a fortnight after they came, and he called her dreadful names; he used to call it a little bleeding mare—on one occasion he said to the woman she would have the pleasure one of these days, of seeing the bleeding mare lying under his feet and dash its little guts out before her own eyes—when he has been alone with the child, I have heard noises as if he was slapping its little bottom, and as if he has thrown the child against the door, and I have heard the child make a kind of squeaking noise, it would not last a minute—this used to occur more or less every day—when I heard it I have hammered at the door and told him he ought to be ashamed of himself to use a dear baby like that—he made the reply once that he would rip my b——face open—the child died on Monday, 1st December—on the Friday before that he was brutally ill-treat—the child whilst the mother was out, slapping it, and as if he was jobbing it on the floor, and he threw it up against the partition door—the child only made the squeaking noise, and it would die off into little sobs; you would not hear much of its crying—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself, if he went on much more of it I would fetch in a policeman—he came out into the passage and told me to mind my own b——business, it was the mother that had done it—on that Friday the mother was there; she did not say anything; she came out—I don't think the prisoner heard what passed between us, because she was too frigtened he should hear it; she went into the back yard for some water—on the Saturday before the child died, he was ill-treating the mother all day long, as well as the baby—on the Sunday the child had wetted in front of the fireplace, and he said the bleeding little mare had taken a warm place for it; it wanted to go to the po, and he broke it against the door and threw the child on to the po—the child broke into a</p>

               <p>little sobbing cry, but it was soon over—on the Monday morning, a little after 9, I heard the mother crying; I knocked at the door and asked what was the matter—I ultimately went into the room; the mother was dressed to go to work, the prisoner was just getting off the bed putting his trowsers on—the child was lying on the side of the bed, its little arms drawn up—I tried to lay them straight as well as I could; it was quite dead—I said "Oh, you poor little murdered creature'—the prisoner stood against the fireplace—Mr. Mead was present at the time—the prisoner said "Make matters as well as you can for me, Mrs. Core"—the woman did nothing, only stood crying—I noticed that the child's head was dreadfully bruised, there were two bruises on its head; it only had on a little shirt—the mother and I went and fetched Dr. Brown—the mother had placed the child on the side of the bed where she and the prisoner used to sleep; it usually slept on the floor on two pillows—I showed the woman the bruises and asked her how it was done, and she said it fell off the po; she afterwards said that the prisoner had done it, that on Sunday he picked it up three times by the hair of its head and threw it on the floor, that she picked it up and tried to stand it on its feet and it could not stand, that he then kicked her into the corner of the room, that he was coming across, as she thought to hit her again, and she said "Oh, don't, Charley, you have done it for me this time," and he said "Nonsense, you want to make me believe something now," and then he knocked her down—she said the bruises were caused as the child was going to get up off the floor, he hit her on the side of the head and the head came in contact with the door, and that the child was never sensible afterwards—she was telling this to me, and the prisoner said "Oh, it is all nonsense."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never called in a policeman; the other lodger did, about a month before the child died; I was not present—the prisoner was not taken up by the policeman—I have seven children—I was there about a month before the prisoner came—there were other lodgers; all the rooms were occupied; there are six rooms—I never went into the prisoner's room but once—the woman Was too frightened to speak to any of us in the house—what I have told is only what I heard; I never saw anything take place—the prisoner Was nearly always at home; I never knew him to be at work; I never missed him out of the place above an hour or half an hour during the day; I am perfectly sure of that—t am sure he was not at work on the Friday fortnight before the child died; that is the Friday I have spoken of, not the Friday before the death; if I slid so it must have been a misunder<lb/>standing; it was the Friday week before, and on the Saturday and Sunday before it died—I don't know of anything particular that took place on the Friday before it died—on the Saturday and Sunday the woman was at home all day—as far as I could tell she was very fond of the children—I never heard her beat them—I have never seen the prisoner, only when he has gone past the window and come back again—I could not tell from his manner whether he was drunk at times; I never had any conversation with him; I could not tell whether he was drunk or sober—it was on the Sunday after<lb/>noon before the child's death that I last heard anything particular; at that time the mother was in the room; it was on that occasion that the mother was knocked in the corner against the door—it was on the Friday week before the child died that I called Mrs. Mead down into my room; that was one of the occasions when he knocked the child against the wall; on that occasion the mother came out of the room and said it was she who had been</p>

               <p>knocked into the corner of the room—I cannot tell you when it was that he said she should have the pleasure of seeing him place the child at her feet and dash its guts out under her eyes, because it was every day's occurrence; it is impossible to remember the dates—I don't mean that I heard that expression every day; it was on the Friday fortnight before the child's death—I forgot it when I was before the Magistrate; I believe I said it before the Coroner—on one occasion, when I knocked at the door and complained that he was knocking the child about, the mother did not come out and tell me that I was mistaken; the prisoner came out and told me so—it was after that that she came out and said that she had been thrown against the door; she said she was thankful to think that I had interfered—I could not exactly say the last time I saw the child before it died; I think it was about a month before—the scratches I saw on the face were not like sores, just as if it was from finger-nails—I had no opportunity of seeing how the other children were treated—I never saw the prisoner nursing this child or the others—I never went into the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was always on good terms with the woman when I spoke to her; I had no occasion to be otherwise; I have had no quarrel with either of them—on the Friday, when she came out and said she was glad I had interfered, she was crying; she said he had knocked her into the corner because she had taken the baby's part.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Thomas Mead, a plasterer, of 2, Payne's Place; we occupy the first floor back, directly over the prisoner's room—I was living there on 11th October, when the prisoner came to live there—about a fortnight after they came I heard the man smacking the baby's bottom; I was on the stairs; the mother was not there at the time—about six weeks previous to the child's death Mrs. Cove called me downstairs, and we went close to the door of the prisoner's room, and I heard as though he banged the baby on the floor; once the child gave a kind of moaning cry, and after that it seemed as though he threw it against the partition; the child only gave the same kind of moaning cry—I said, "You brute, you are knocking that child about again, while the mother is out earning the bread to put into your mouth"—the mother was not there then; she was out at work—he told me to mind my own business, and he would like to serve me in the same way, he would like to put the heel of his boot on my a—; after that I went upstairs—the same evening, about 5 or 6, I went downstairs for some water; at that time the woman was at home—I heard the prisoner swearing; it seems the mother was undressing the child to put it to bed—he said, "Do you know what I would like to do to her? I would like to lay her down on the floor stark naked, a—up<lb/>wards, and thrash her till she could not move, and let her lie there and not have anything to eat until she died"—I heard this through the window; I could not see into the room; the glass was papered up—I said to him, "Do you know what I would like to do with you if I had my will "I would serve you in the same way; I would get a cat-o'-nine-tails to you"—he told me to mind my own business, and I had no business looking under his window—a night or two after that I was again outside the window, and heard him swearing at the mother and the child—I heard him say to the boy, "Undress her, Charley, and put her to bed out of the way"—some</p>

               <p>time after that, it might be a week after, I was passing up the stairs; apparently the baby was on the po; I heard him say, "This is the second time, God help you the third; if you don't do it this time I will do for you"—I think that was between a fortnight and three weeks before the child died—on the Saturday before it died he was swearing all day at the mother, through something he did not like in the child's doings; I did not hear distinctly what he said—all day on the Sunday it was the same, he and the mother continually grumbling at each other—during the whole of the time I never saw or heard the mother ill-treat the child—she was there when I spoke to him about the cat-o'-nine-tails; she did not speak—on the Monday morning, 1st December, about 9.15, I was fetched down into the room by Mrs. Cove, and saw the child on the bed dead—it was very much bruised about the forehead and about the body; it had on a little shirt—I told the prisoner he was the instigation of it—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Missis</hi>, how can you say so?"—I said, "Because I do"—the mother said that on the Sunday she went to stand it on its feet and it could not stand; it fell down, and he hit it on the side of the ear as it fell-down; he lifted it up three times by (he hair of its head, and sat it on the floor; that it fell over against the chair, causing the wound on the forehead, and that it was not sensible after that—the prisoner said, "Nonsense, nonsense," nothing more.</p>

I live at 1, Bartholomew's Road, Kentish Town—on 1st December I was called to Payne's Place, and saw the deceased child; it was very much emaciated—I made these notes of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—it weighed only 13 1/2 <hi rend="italic">lb.</hi>, and the usual weight of a child of that age is 301<hi rend="italic">b.</hi>—there was a bruise on the right forehead, and the left cheek was swollen and hard—there was a scratch on the right cheek, a sore on the top of the head with a scab on it, three scratches at the back of the neck, a bruise on the left forehead, three raw wounds on the right buttock, each about the size of a threepenny piece, a similar sore over the right knee joint, and also on the back of the leg—the bruises were quite recent—the worst one was on the right forehead—the internal organs were healthy; there was nothing to account for death—the inner surface of the scalp had considerable extravasation of blood, which was the result of bruises, and under the bruise on the right forehead was a slight amount of congestion of the brain, not sufficient to cause death by itself, but it would decidedly do so combined with such treatment as I have heard to-day—the stomach con<lb/>tained no food—I found the mother there when I first went, and spoke to her; the prisoner came in afterwards, but I did not speak to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The woman gave me an account of the bruises on the forehead—I did not call the sores on the legs "cinder sores;" I only said "sores"—I think they were the result of neglect—that applies to the greater portion of them; I mean neglect in cleanliness, but if the child had been scratched, and had picked it, very likely it would cause sores—I Said before the Magistrate "Those marks might be caused by violence, or by the child rubbing itself on the floor, and scratching the wounds afterwards"—the sore on the head might be caused in the same way, from a pimple—the room was very poor; I did not inquire of the prisoner or any one else as to whether there was any food there—the bruises on the forehead might have caused the congestion, but the congestion was not sufficient of itself to cause death—to produce the congestion there must have been concussion first, and I think the shock to the nervous system arising from that was the cause of death in a weakly child—the immediate cause of death was the shock to the nervous system; that sheck must have been caused by violence of some sort, and that violence must, in my opinion, have been inflicted within 24 hours of death—I presume that the death was from shock, because I could find no other cause—I think the child had been very weakly from its birth—I think the mother said at the inquest that the father died from cousumption, but I am not sure—the condition of poverty Would be likely to make the child worse—I did not notice that the children had nothing but their clothes to put on their beds—I think I have understated the weight of a child of two years at 301b.—I do not think the prisoner was</p>

               <p>present when the woman gave me an account of the bruise on the forehead; he came in before I left the room, but I think she had told me how it happened before he came in—I do not think he was present when she told me—she said "The child fell from the po and bruised its forehead"—a child of those tender years falling a short distance might receive a severe bruise on its forehead, but it would not produce three bruises—I think the child simply falling would scarcely account for the severe bruises on the forehead, but I cannot speak for certainty—I do not think that a child weakly from its birth falling forward in a helpless condition on its face would receive such a bruise as was on this child's forehead, but I should not like to swear it would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw no symptoms of consumption, except that the mesenteric glands were a little enlarged, but not in a state to cause death—the state of its body would come from neglect—I should expect to find sores in a child weighing 13<hi rend="italic">lb.</hi> which ought to weigh 30<hi rend="italic">lb.</hi> if it was not properly attended to—scratches from anything on the floor, and the child picking them afterwards, would account for the sores on the legs—I think the bruise on the forehead was the result of considerable violence.</p>

I was cook and steward on the ship Coringa, a British North-American vessel—on 3rd November we were in the Channel off Start Point, on our voyage from New York to Antwerp—there were about 20 men in the ship—the captain's name was Robert Gibson, and prisoner was chief mate—Graham was the second mate—the prisoner was in command of the port watch, which consisted of John Backiers, William Konstead, James Henry, John O'Connor, a man called Bill, whose other name I do not know, Edward Macfie, and two others—on the 3rd November I came up on deck about 10.30, and saw the second mate fighting with a man named Mike Kearney—the captain was standing on the poop, about six yards from them—the prisoner was not on deck—I parted them—a few minutes afterwards Cutting came up on deck with this hatchet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at that time no one else on deck was armed—the captain told Kearney he was</p>

               <p>going to put him in irons because he had threatened his life—Kearney said he would not go into irons, and tried to make his way forward, farther away from the captain—the captain followed him up, and told him he must put him in irons—O'Connor and Ronstead told the man not to go into irons—the captain then ordered the port watch below, but they did not go—the captain was going to put Kearney in irons, and had a revolver, which he held out in his hands—I saw Ronstead with a hatch-bar in his band—it is about six feet long and several inches broad—he was some distance from the captain, and could not have struck him without ad<lb/>vancing—the prisoner came alongside the captain with the hatchet in his hand—the deceased told Kearney to go quietly into irons—Henry was then going towards the captain, having his hands on the waistbands of his trousers, holding his trousers up—he had nothing in his hand—I saw prisoner with the hatchet raised, and said "Mr. Cutting, what are you going to do with that hatchet!"—as I said that he advanced and struck Henry on the forehead with the blade—the blow cut him right through the bone—I heard the captain say "My God, what did you do that for!" as soon as he was struck—the captain took him to Graham's cabin—I assisted to sew up the wound—he remained in the cabin till he died, on the 6th—I did not hear Cutting make any answer to the captain's remark—there was no row after that—Kearney went into irons afterwards.</p>

I am a native of Sweden and was able seaman on board the Coringa—I joined it at New York on November 3rd—I was asleep down below and was awakened by a noise—I went on deck and saw the second mate and Kearney fighting—I saw the captain come along from the poop with a belaying pin in his hand, but when he had got down two or three steps the fighting had ceased, and he turned back again—the second mate said to Kearney "Well not fight any more"—a short time afterwards I saw him with a carpenter's maul in his hands—about 15 minutes after I heard a noise again on deck, and when I was standing at the door I heard the captain say to Kearney "I am going to pnt you in irons"—the captain had a revolver in his left hand—the prisoner had a hammer in his left hand and a hatchet in the other—I saw Kearney run forward into the midst of the port watch, and saw the prisoner try to cut him—Henry was walking towards the captain and mate, about five feet from the captain and three feet from the mate—he said to Kearney "It would be best for you to go into irons"—I saw prisoner strike Henry with the axe—Bonstead had a natch bar—he was about five feet away from Henry when he was struck.</p>

I am captain of the Coringa—I sailed with her from New York on the morning of the 3rd—I saw Kearney and Graham quarrelling, and ordered it to cease, and ordered the port watch below—they did not obey the order, and said they were not sleepy, or something like that—they urged Kearney on to give it to the second mate; I asked Kearney what he meant by creating such a disturbance in the ship—he said he was not raising any disturbance—I told him I had had him logged before for threatening my life—he said he did not care, and I told him I would put him in irons—he said "I will go in"—I said "All right," and went down to get the irons—as I was going down I heard them say that we could not put him in irons, or something like that—the mate was in his room, and I said to him "We must put that man in irons"—I got two or three pairs of irons, and put my revolver in my pocket; I passed the irons to prisoner, and took another pair as I was coming out of the cabin; prisoner followed me on deck—the port watch were all standing on the forecastle, and Kearney was down ait the poop by the mainmast—I called him to go in irons peacefully, and the port watch sung out to him not to go in irons—I followed him, and told them to go below, and two or three of them, especially Ronstead, remarked "We are not soft enough; we are not sleepy enough"—they did not go below; Kearney retreated into the port watch—I said "If you do not come I will shoot you"—he said "Shoot away," and I pointed my revolver at his legs; I was watching him—I heard some one say "Look out, captain!" and then I saw the prisoner strike Henry—Ronstead had a hatchbar in his hand—as soon as the blow was struck Ronstead gave in—I believe the whole of us were in danger, and that prisoner's intervention in my behalf at that moment was necessary—as chief officer it was his place to protect me.</p>

On 1st December I was called to Granville Grove, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor—the prisoner rushed ont of the door first, and the prosecutor came afterwards, bleeding—the prisoner had a hammer in his hand, and was swinging it about, saying "Come on"—I took it from him—he said, "I gave him a slight tap"—I examined the hammer—there was a hole in the hat which the prosecutor was wearing—this is the hammer and the hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is a dent in the hat now—the prosecutor was covered with blood—he had his coat off—they were both sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 120, High Street, Deptford—on 1st September about 7 p.m. I was called to examine the prosecutor—I found a wound on the left side of his head and two bruises, both contused and incised—they might have been caused by a blow from a hammer like this—it is always uncertain how these wounds will turn out—I saw him the following morning, and I then thought the wound would be serious—his circulation was excited, bis pulse rapid, and he had a certain amount of giddiness—the symptoms passed over, and he went on very well—he had a bruise on the right arm—it must have been a heavy blow—it might have been caused by a weapon of this kind, but I should think through the coat or shirt-sleeves, not directly on the skin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> He said he would turn me out. I said "You have no cause to do that; I will go quietly if you will wait." He said he would not wait, he would fetch the police. He caught up the bundle, and I caught hold of the hammer. I did not know what it was at the time. I gave him a tap on the arm, and that was all I did.</p>

I am a clerk, living at Netherton House, Kidbrook Park, Blackbeath—on the night of 22nd October I retired to bed somewhere after 12 o'clock, leaving my brother William Henry Southwell up, and two servants—I was called up at 7 the following morning by the servants—I went downstairs and found the window in the hall at the foot of the stairs open about 2 inches—the hasp of the window had been wrenched and broken inside the window with a spade, which had been used to wrench it open—a large stone vase which stood inside, 14 feet high, was</p>

I speak English a little—I am a coffee-house keeper, in partnership with a man named Wiener, at 154, Cannon Street Road, Commercial Road East—on 14th October last two strangers, Poles, came to lodge with me—shortly after they came they gave me a letter, which I took to 171, Church Road, Islington—I went there, but did not find the person to whom the letter was addressed—I went there again by their direction, and I saw an old woman, whom I left it with—the next day Dombrowski came and asked where the two Poles were—I showed him into the room where they were, and he remained some time and then left—on the following morning a box came by the parcels delivery, and the two Poles went away with it—after they had gone a letter came—Dombrowski afterwards took the letter back with him—I have not seen it since—in consequence of that letter I went to him in Church Road, Islington, and met him—he told me that being a coffee-house keeper different people came to my plnce—he spoke in Polish—he also told me that I could get rich by the'affair, and that the others had got plenty of money through it—before this he told me that he had sent the two Poles false rouble notes—I said I should look out for some' customers—I then went away, telling him that if he wanted to write to me I would answer him—he gave me his address, "Taffe, Church Road, Islington"—on 18th October I wrote to him, and received this letter, marked A, the same evening—it stated "I shall wait for you to-morrow, Sunday, and Monday, 11 o'clock in the morning; I say Monday, as I do not know if you will receive this letter to-day"—in consequence of that I and "Wiener went to the Nag's Head, Holloway Road, where we met Dombrowski—I told him that I had a buyer for the rouble notes—he siid</p>

Take this letter with you." H, "November 5th, You may see me tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock.") On 5th November I met Dombrowski again near the Nag's Head, and while I was speaking to him he was taken into custody by Greenham—I knew his name was Dombrowski, but he wanted me to address him in the name of Taffe.</p>

I have been in England nine years—I first saw Dombrowski on 14th or 15th October—when he first told me to get him some customer he told me his name was Dombrowski, but to address him as Taffe—that was on the first day I saw him—Iam an Austrian Pole from Galicia—I do not know that Dombrowski belongs to one of the most ancient and noble families in Poland; how can I know that?—I knew nothing about him before 14th October—the letter the two Poles gave me was addressed in the name of Taffe—it was after the two Poles came to my house that I first saw Dombrowski; he came to ask "for the two Poles that sent me a letter from this place"—he did not give his name then—I was not acquainted with those Poles before—I can't tell whether they were gentlemen or workmen—they stopped in my house two days, I think—I don't know whether they were refugees—when the box arrived on the 16th the two Poles took it, paid their bills, and went away—after they had left Dombrowski wrote to me—he afterwards took his letter back—he first used the words, "false notes"—I cannot speak Polish well; our conversation was more in German than Polish; the first conversation was part in one and part in the other—he told me that he would send me false money—he promised to send me some false money, and it was spoken about that if anybody was arrested in Russia with this false money it would be as dangerous as in England—Dombrowski said that three people were taken up about false money abroad, and he sent money there to save them—he</p>

               <p>told me that he made money and he sold money, and he would make me a rich man—he told me his name was Dombrowski and I knew the name before—nothing was said about political matters—immediately on his offer<lb/>ing me these notes I agreed to accept them—I communicated with the police on the 20th, I think, and what they instructed me that I have done—I wanted to find out before I communicated with the police what he was, and I promised to write to him on Saturday or Sunday—I wrote to him so that he should answer me before I went to the police, so that I should not recom<lb/>mend a fool—I have never been a witness against any of my brother Poles before either here or abroad—I was at the Embassy of Russia between the 16th and the 20th, and from the 20th I acted under the instructions of the police—I do not recollect that I received any samples of false money up to the 20th, but all I have received I have delivered in Scotland Yard—I received the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from Mr. Greenham; I did not see them marked, and am not aware of there being any mark on them (<hi rend="italic">notes produced</hi>)—I know good notes when I see them; they were good English notes—the inspector advised me to give those good notes for samples of false notes worth nothing at all—I gave him the money, and he sent me afterwards the Russian rouble notes—I only saw Dombrowski for the first time, and knew nothing of him beyond his own statement—I was anxious to get the false notes from him because Mr. Greenham and Mr. Marshall told me to do so—nobody heard the conversation with Dombrowski; he called me aside—I said, "Perhaps you want the buyer present"—he said, "No, I will have nobody but you"—I have never passed by any other name in any country; I never passed by the name of Levy—I have received no promise of remu<lb/>neration from the Russian Government, or from the police, if I convict these men—I have carried out the scheme from the duty which a man man ought to do when he finds such a thing.</p>

I was with Greenham when Dombrowski was taken—I afterwards went with him to 29, Arlington Road—I had not searched Dombrowski—I said to Mrs. Seymour "Have you any one in the house I have you any men?" she said "No, no one but my child and the woman"—I heard some noise and walked from the room to go upstairs, and she said "No you shan't;" but I went up to the first<lb/>floor front room, where I found the two Yankowskis standing in front of a fire—some paper was burning, and Vincent was stooping with his hand towards the fire—I rushed across the room, took off my hat, and tried to knock some paper which was burning in the grate—I then took hold of the two, one with each hand, and pulled them from the fireplace—Vincent raised his fist and said "I can smash you"—I said "I am a police officer, and you had better not"—I called out to Greenham "They are burning some paper"—he came up after some time; I believe he had some difficulty in getting up—they both had on slippers and old coats, as if they were working—I could not sec the papers which were blazing, but Vincent afterwards picked</p>

I think Marshall said at the police-court that the men were without their coats—Vincent's coat was older than Albert's—the prosecution there was conducted by Mr. Wontner—I did not say anything there about the discoloured hands—I have mentioned it before, but not in evidence—I believe Vincent to bo a metal cutter, from his own statement that night—we paid this visit about 3.15 p.m.—he said that he worked at one place for 20 years, but I did not understand where—he does not speak English very well—I do not remem<lb/>ber that he mentioned Messrs. Foxall, of Hampetead Road—I have since ascertained that he worked for Farmer and Cotteroll eight or nine years ago—their address was not given me in that conversation; perhaps it would be unfair to mention when I obtained it—he did not say that the appearance to his hands had been caused by metal cutting—when he said "I can smash you "I had not told him that I was a police officer; I ran suddenly into the room—no violence was used—he threatened me after that, and he certainly rose his hand, evidently in a violent temper.</p>

Gaunt, for L. Davis"—this is the paper (<hi rend="italic">Stamped November</hi> 4)—I put the letter in a rack in the kitchen, and it was given to Mrs. Seymour next morning by my wife by my orders.</p>

I am an auctioneer, at Station Road, Brixton and an agent for some of the houses in Arlington Road, Tulse Hill—I let No. 29 from 1st May last to Mrs. Seymour—she took it in the name of George Seymour, who she said was an engineer—Annie Gibbard, her sister, was with her, no one else—I let her the house at 3 guineas a month, payable monthly in advance—she said that she had lately come from Oxford, and gave her address 247, Gray's Inn Road.</p>

I am a dairyman, at 247, Gray's Inn Road—in the beginning of March my second floor was to let, and two women came to take it—Annie Gibbard (who I have since recognised in Newgate) was one, and the prisoner Seymour the other, who came and lived there in the name of Parker—letters came in the name of Parker, and they gave that name—they had two rooms in my place, a sitting-room and a bed-room, and they occupied them, three of them, Vincent Yankowski, and Miss Gibbard and Mrs. Seymour—when they took my place Miss Gibbard said "My sister's husband is something on the Great Western Railway"—they were there about six weeks, and I did not know any one of them except by the name of Parker—Vincent went by the name of Parker—I never heard any Christian name—I have lived there a great many years, and I know Albert Yankowski by seeing him somewhere; I don't know where—I did not know his name.</p>

I live at 15, Industria Terrace, Brixton Road, and am a plasterer—on Saturday, 6th December, about 9.30 p.m., I was in the London Road in a public-house, where I saw the prisoners—they asked me to treat them—we all had something to drink—I said "I want to go to the Elephant and Castle"—they offered to show me the way—we left, and they took me up a dark turning, and Worster knocked me down, and before I was fairly up Hall knocked me down—Worster took my watch and chain from my pocket—I called out "Police?" and he gave it me back and ran away—three constables came up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Hall.</hi> The master of a public-house did not refuse to serve me—I did not throw down a pot of beer—a constable did not come in and put roe out—I did not drop my money on the floor—you did not pick up two half-sovereigns and return them to me—I did not say I left my silver cigar-holder there—I did not put my arm round your neck—I did not say to the constable that you did nothing to me.</p>

               <p>10 o'clock, when I saw the prosecutor and the prisoners together at St. George's Circus—I watched them till they got to the Duke of Clarence, in the Westminster Road, where one of the prisoners asked for some drink, and the barman refused to serve them, and they crossed back from the Duke of Clarence to the Grapes—I remained outside with Chamberlain, and they remained there three-quarters of an hour, when they left and went down the London Road and entered the Royal Mortar public-house—after they were turned out the prosecutor was between the prisoners, one taking hold of each arm—they crossed the London Road, down St. George's Market, where there are about a dozen short courts—I got behind some vans, and Chamberlain ran round through another court—Hunt was behind me, and I heard the prosecutor say "No, I am not going that way; I will go back again," and he began to struggle to get away from the prisoners, and as soon as he began to struggle Worster hit him at the tide of the bead and he fell, and on trying to rise to his feet again the other prisoner struck him and he fell again, and while he was on the ground they got round him—he called out "Police) "and "Murder 1"—as soon as he began to call out they ran away, and Hall ran into my arms—the other prisoner was secured by Chamberlain—they were charged at the station Hall said he was in the Borough Road at 10.45 at a public-house called tile Fountain, and from there went to the Victoria Theatre and saw the prose<lb/>cutor there, who was going to be looked up by a policeman, and he took him away, and the prosecutor asked him to shew him the way to the Elephant and Castle, and he was taking him that way by a short cut, and when he got down by St. George's Circus he said he wanted to go back after a woman, and they did not want him to go, and while he was struggling to go he called out "Police!" and "Murder!"—they were both searched and nothing found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist of Rendezvous Street, Folkestone—in May last, in consequence of an advertisement which I saw, I applied to Buer by letter for a loan of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in reply received this letter, requesting a personal interview—I attended there accordingly and saw Kelly—he went to a desk and picked up a letter, which I recognised as mine—I said I had called to see Mr. Buer, and he said Mr. Buer had been obliged to go into the country, and was unable to see me according to appointment, and would be back in the course of the evening—I said I could not stay in London later than the afternoon—he said no doubt things might be arranged, and the foe would be two guineas—I said I wanted a letter from Mr. Buer in answer to mine to know whether business might be done, as it would be useless to run me into any expense unless they entertained the security I offered—I returned to Folkestone, and the next morning I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "19, London Bridge Station Approach, etc., 21st May, 1879.

I went to the defendants' office on the 28th August, and saw Airey—I told him I was a police officer, and had a warrant for his apprehension for obtaining money under pretence of granting loans—he said he was the principal, and that was his place of business—I waited about two hours, when Kelly came in—I asked him if his same was Kelly—he made. no reply—after a moment Mr. Thompson, who was with me, and who occupies the greater part of the house, said "His name is Kelly"—Mr. Thompson was examined as a witness at Southwark—I hare a letter to the effect that he is now very ill—I told Kelly also that I had a warrant for his apprehension—he made no reply—they were taken to the station, charged, and taken before the Magistrate and admitted on their own tail—I then arranged to meet them at the office at 10.80 the next morning,</p>

I am a labourer, of 2, Kelson Street, Camberwell—on 9th November, between 1 and 2 am., I was passing through Crown Street with another man to a coffee-stall, and saw Timothy Shea—I had before that seen Michael Collins, Mary Shea, and three or lour young men standing together at the Lord Clyde, and heard Michael say to Shea "God blind me, you cannot do me"—Shea said "What, do you want to fight too?"—and with that Michael walked away—he was gone two or three minutes, and returned with his brother <hi rend="italic">Dan</hi>, who took off his coat and struck Shea in the face, and he went reeling into the road, and before he could regain his feet he gave him a blow under the chin, which knocked him backwards, and he fell on the back of his head in the road—Shea had not raised his arms to defend himself at all—when he struck the second blow Daniel said "That's the bleeding way to do them"—Michael then came and caught me, but Daniel did not touch me; Michael struck me, and I had to run away for my life, and I went and told his brother Jeremiah Shea—Timothy Shea was insensible after he was knocked down—he was sober—I did not see him again that night.</p>

               <p>you; where does your brother Dan live?"—I said "What do you want to know for"—he said "I had a row with him this evening, and I want to finish with him; will you go and fetch him?"—I said "It's not likely, as he is in bed—he said "I hear you are a better man than you brother, I will fight with you, and took off his coat, and threw it down—I said "No, you won't fight me, you can hit me if you like," and walked away, and left him, and went to my brother's house, and said "Ban, Timothy Shea stopped me, and said he wasted to fight you, and if I don't fetch you out he-frill pull you out of bed—he said "1 don't want him to come here and get me out of this place; I will go and see him, and get him to put it off till to morrow"—he lived with his brother-in-law, who is in the submarine telegraph office—he got up and dressed, and went book with me to Shea, who had his coat, waistcoat, and cap off, and said come on, you are just the bloke I am waiting for," and started sparing—my brother threw off his coat, and I picked it up—Shea struck my brother somewhere in the body, and knocked him three or four yards—he fell on the kerb, and broke his braces—he got up; they sparred in front of each other; they bott struck at the same time, and Shea fell in the middle of the read—Chapple held Shea's clothes, and gave them to Alien, and said "Hit him again, and you will do him"—my brother and Allen helped Shea up; Kelly stood there, but I did not see her put her hand to him—my brother, said he was very sorry, and he did not want to fight him at all—my brother was not anxious to fight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Shea knew the street my brother lived in, but not the house, and I did not tell him, but I went to my brother's house, as I wanted something to wrap my child in, which was to be christened in the afternoon—on my oath I did not go my brother's bouse to bring him back to fight Shea, as I was man enough for it myself without my brother—Shea wanted to fight me before I left, but he did not strike me—it did not strike me to say "Don't go out and meet that infuriated drunkard; he does not know where, you live"—there was an advantage in his going out, because if Shea came round kicking up a row at my brother-in-laws house my brother would have been turned out on Monday—my brother might have gone out to try and put it off till morning—my brother and I did not attempt to kick Shea—I ran after Chapple, as he was urging the other man on, and if I had caught him I would have struck him—my brother did not run after him; he was picking Shea up—Kelly did not say "For God's sake don't do any more; you have nearly killed him; how could she?" I nad not struek him—there were two rounds, and there might have been two blows struck in the first round; in the second round they struck one another's faces together—only one blow was struck at Shea's face in the second round—I did not try to raise Shea, as my brother and Ellen were doing so—he walked home between Kelly and a stranger—I had had a drop, but Was sober—I heard that my brother had been tipsy in the afternoon, but he had time to get sober between 6 and 1 o'clock, and perhaps lying down did him good—I did not want to fight him, and I did not want my brother to do so.</p>
