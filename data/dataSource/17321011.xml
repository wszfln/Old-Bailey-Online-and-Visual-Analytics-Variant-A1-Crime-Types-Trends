               <p>Prisoner. Was I carrying the Logwood off, or only standing by the Pile?</p>
               <p>Cox. He was standing by the Pile, and his Knot was lying on his Foot.

               <p>I had been with a Load from Stocks-Market to Tower-Wharf, and coming back over the Keys, I stopt at the Pile of Logwood to make Water. One of the Sticks fell against me, upon which I took it up to put it in its Place again, and while I had it in my Hand, Cox came and charged me with stealing it.

               <p>George Bond. Between 4 and 5 in the Afternoon the prisoner came to my Shop, and ask'd for a pair of blue grey Stockings, I shew'd her a Paper in which there were just a dozen pair. She then wanted a different Colour. I turned about and took down another Paper. We did not agree about the Price. She went out, but came in again before I had put up the Stockings, and desir'd to see another pair. I observed her to double up one pair that lay on the Counter. I turn'd about again to reach another Parcel. She look'd over several, but not liking the Price she went away a second time. I miss'd 2 pair; I went after her, brought her back, found one pair in her Bosom, and another pair in the Lining of her Gown. She own'd that one of the Pairs was mine, but said that she bought the other pair at another Hosiers.</p>

I suppose at that time he put the Wig into his Breeches. He soon came back and stood talking in the Shop about a Quarter of an Hour, and then went away. I mist<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173210110003"/> the Wig in a few Minutes after it was gone, and went directly to Middle-Row in Holbour, and at the 3d Wig-shop I came to I found it. Mr. Horn who keeps that Shop had it in his Hand when I came in, and he said it was not 5 Minutes since he bought it.</p>
               <p>- Horn. I bought the Wig of the Prisoner on the 11th of September, towards the Evening; he said, he had it to sell for a Gentleman's Servant. He ask'd a Guinea and a half, I bid him 25 s. and a Shilling for himself; he said he would have half a Pint of Winethen, and so we agreed. I did not mistrust him, because I had known him a pretty while. He gets his Bread by making up Wigs, and I have bought a great many of him, and took him to be a very honest Man. So that when Mr. Major's Man came in and said the Wig was stolen, you must needs think I was very much surpriz'd, and wonder'd how the Devil came to put it into the Prisoner's Head.</p>

From thence we went to the Anchor and Vine at Charing-Cross; Macqueen then said, that the Prisoner might go about his Business, for he would not prosecute him, and so the Prisoner was discharged. When he was gone, Macqueen threatened to prosecute me for receiving stolen Goods. He sent a Girl on some Message to his Wife, and when the Girl return'd, he ask'd her, who let her in, and she describ'd the Prisoner. I told him I thought it was very strange, that he should still harbour a Man whom he pretended had robb'd him. He said, if I would get his Books from Mr. Millan's, I should come to no harm; I told him I would not trust to that, and so I got a Constable, went to his House, and apprehended the Prisoner.

When I was got about 10 Yards from the House, they laid hold of me, and said, that I should go no farther, for fear I should be robb'd, or come to some Mischief. I told them I would go, and they said again, that I should not, and so they took away my Wallet, and carry'd it in a Doors; I follow'd them, they bolted the Door as soon as I came in, and then they went up Stairs with my Goods, and I after them.</p>

               <p>Harris. I had a large Parcel of Stockings, I can't remember how many Pair; but I can be positive to 7 Pair of fine Hose in particular, which stood me in 4 s. 6 d. a Pair prime cost.</p>
               <p>Court. Were your Goods in the Room when you first went up?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes; but they were soon thrown out of the Window; and I never set Eyes on any of them afterwards, except these a Pair and an odd one, which were pick'd up near the House by the Watchman, and this Fellow to the odd One, which Sneeshy had sold. I call'd to the Woman below, and said, I was robb'd, and wanted some Body to fetch a Constable; but she could not go out, because her Husband was sick a-Bed, and had no Body but her to look after him; so I went down my self, and before I got out, I heard 2 Men jump out of the Window. The Woman open'd the Street Door, and I went out and stood there with my Knife in my Hand, and swore I would stick the next Man that came out of the Door or the Window; and there I staid till the Watch came up, which was at 2 in the Morning.</p>

I went to him and he said, he had been robb'd by 2 Women, and some Men above Stairs, and wanted a Constable, I told him the Constable was gone home, and he must take care of them himself, so I left him; but as I was going along beating the Hour, I found 2 pair of Stockings and an odd one in the Road, about 50 Yards from the House.

            , Beadle. The Watchman call'd me at 11, but he not having a proper Officer, I refused to obey; and about 2 he came again with the Constable, and then I got up. We took the 2 Women, and 2 of the Men, the Hemp-dresser and the Baker; but Sneeshy and the Prisoner Richardson had got off; however we took Richardson in less than 2 Hours afterwards. For he coming again to the House, to enquire what was become of his Companions, a Woman told us of it, and we went and took him. He swore, damn him, he would not go to Jail, for he never was in a Jail in his life; and indeed he had like to have been too hard for us, but my Dog kept him under. Mr. Sorrow, the Constable, would have been here, but poor Man, he's gone aside, he's under a Colour, and can't appear.</p>

He begun to rifle at me, and swore damn him, he would not go with us to the Cage; but however we made him, and as soon as Abigal saw him, she cry'd, and said, this is all along of you, if you had not jump'd out of Window, we had never been brought hither.</p>

We sat drinking about an Hour and a Half, it was then near 10 a Clock; we went to the Chandler's-Shop for a Dram ; he was very much suddled, and my Husband not being at home, I desir'd him to stay all Night and lie in my Bed, and I would lie with my Sister. So I got him Upstairs. Coxon and Richardson lodg'd at my House, Richardson and the Prosecutor join'd together for a full Pot of Two-penny; I left 'em drinking, and went to see a Neighbour who was not well. I return'd about 11 and went to Bed, and knew no more of the matter till about 3 in the Morning, when I was waked by the Prosecutor.</p>

It happen'd one Day that I had not a Shirt to put on, tho' I had bought 7 new ones which cost me about 30 s. a-piece but 3 Weeks before. I examin'd her about it, and she told me, some were soul, and others were at Washing. This put me upon a farther Search, not one of these 7 Shirts was to be found. A large Silver Spoon and 2 Tea-spoons, several Neck-cloths, Handkerchiefs, and other Things were missing. Next Morning when she came up to light my Fire, I tax'd her closely; she fell on her Knees, and said, for God Sake don't ruin me! I ask'd her what she had done with my Shirts, my Neckcloths, my Handkerchiefs and Spoons? She said, they were at pawn, and that her Husband had tempted her to carry them, and if I would forgive her, she would confess more Things than I knew of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you deliver me the Shirts to wash?</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding. No; I never order'd you either to wash, or to get wash'd any Shirts since those 7 were made.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nelthorp, Constable. By Mr. Harding's Order I went with her to Jarvis's the Pawn-brokers on Newstreet-hill to fetch out 4 Shirts. I carried 2 Guineas for that Purpose, but understanding when I came thither, that there was a Silver Spoon likewise in pawn, and the 2 Guineas not being sufficient to fetch that out too, the Prisoner pawn'd her own Gold Ring to redeem it. These are the 4 Shirts, they were deliver'd to me by Jarvis in the Prisoner's Presence, and by her Direction.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding. And these 4 Shirts are para of those I lost.</p>
               <p>Nelthorp. She own'd too, that she had pawn'd four of Mr. Harding's Neckcloths and 2 of his Shaving Cloths in Black-Fryars; but she said, she could not remember at what House it was. This white Callico Waistcoat was deliver'd me Yesterday Morning ( without paying for) by Jarvis. The Prisoner said; she did not remember where she had pawn'd it, but he happen'd to find it enter'd in his Books to her Name.</p>

            , the Prosecutor's Servant. The Prisoner own'd to me that she took the Shirts, and 2 or 3 Shaving Cloths, and some Towels, and pawn'd them; and she said, that, her Husband came and beat her, and took a Shirt and a black Suit of my Master's Cloaths, and put them on, and went away with them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not Mr. Harding deliver me the Shirts to wash?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did he not give me 1 Shirt to get the Ink out of it?</p>
               <p>Weller. No; there was 1 Shirt indeed that had been ink'd, and my Master gave it me to get the Ink out, and I spoke to you about it, but did not deliver it to you: Besides, you said you knew of several other Things that had not yet been miss'd, but that you would not name them till they were miss'd, and when they were, you said, you would not disown them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He pretends I took a couple of Tea-spoons too, because when I was cleaning the Plate, I said I could not find them.</p>
               <p>Weller. When I ask'd her for the Tea-spoons, she said, she had put them in her Pocket, and carry'd them home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Day before the Spoons were missing we had had Peas for Dinner, and the Spoons were then in Use; and some of his Companions came to see him at Night ( as they often did when my Master was out of the way) and he treated them with a Bottle of my Master's Wine, and they were as likely to take the Spoons as any Body else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding. When I ask'd her what was become of the Spoons, I did not name any Spoon in particular, but spoke in general Terms, and she told me they were in pawn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I own that I stole them?</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding. You confess'd that you had taken them away and pawn'd them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burker. When Mr. Harding examin'd the Prisoner about his Shirts, Towels, and other Things that he had lost, she said, if you'll have Patience I'll tell you. where they are. I have pawn'd 'em, I am sorry for it, and ask your Pardon, but it was a Rogue of a Husband that persuaded me to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. While I was in the Compter, I was swell'd up with the Poison that my Husband gave me, so that I miscarry'd and was like to dye; and being in this Condition I sent to the Prosecutor, desiring him to let me have my Wages, but he sent me Word back, that he would stop it on Account of the Shirts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding. She indeed sent to me for her Wages, which was not then due, and she having wrong'd me so much, I thought I had no Reason to send it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had some Witnesses here Yesterday, but now they are gone.</p>
               <p>Court. You was call'd up to take your Tryal Yesterday, but then you desir'd it might be put off till to Day, because your Witnesses were not come.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No; my Husband and I were called up together, and it was he that desired his Tryal might be put off, because he had not got all the Witnesses that he had hired to swear for him.</p>

            . My House was broke open on Wednesday the 27th of September, between the Hours of 12 and 4 in the Morning. The Entrance was made at a Back Cellar-window, which I left fast at Night, but found the Grate wrench'd open in the Morning. This Window leads into the Kitchen, from whence my Goods were taken. I recollected, as well as I could, what Particulars were lost, drew up an Advertisement, and went directly to Goldsmith's Hall, and got a sufficient Number of them printed and dispersed about the Town, by 10 a Clock the same Morning.</p>
               <p>Court. What Goods did you lose?</p>
               <p>Mr. Carey. Here is one of the Advertisements with the Particulars in it.*</p>
               <p>* On Wednesday, the 27th of this Inst. September, 1732. Mr. Carey's House in Dorrington-street, Cold-Bath Fields, near Sir John Oldcastle's, was broke open this Morning, and there was stolen from thence one Silver Spoon, with an Arm and Sword for the Crest, the Mouth a little worn. One Pair of large Brass Candlesticks in a Kind of Square or Diamond Cut. One Pair of small ones, with square Bottoms. One large odd one, with round Knobs. One Copper Coffee-Pot. One large Tea-Kettle, both clean scower'd. Two Pewter Dishes, one a little melted on the Side. One Pewter Pint Pot. One Dozen of Pewter Plates, all marked either with HCE or the Arm and Sword aforesaid. One Soop Plate a little melted on the Side. One Water Plate, with a Cover to it. Four Shifes, one mark'd at the Breast with M.C. Four white Aprons, and three colour'd ones. One Pair of Sheets, one Flaxen, the other Irish Cloth mildew'd at one End. If offer'd to be pawn'd or sold, you are desired to stop them and the Party, and give Notice as above, and you shall have three Guineas Reward. P.S. They took likewise one Mourning Sword, one Lacquer'd Sword, one Boy's Hat; a salted Ham, quite white, and just hung up to dry; also a small Leg in pickle. A Bermudas Hat lin'd with red Silk, a narrow Brim, and Hat-band curiously wrought with Bugles and Silk. A small Pestle and Mortar. A Copper-pot, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Court. You may refresh your Memory by looking on it, but it is not to be read in Evidence.</p>

I lost a Silver Spoon, 5 Pair of Brass Candlesticks, a Copper Coffee-pot, a Tea-Kettle, 2 Pewter Dishes, 14 Plates, one of them was a Water plate, 4 Shifts, 7 Aprons, a Pait of Sheets, 2 Swords, a Boy's Hat, a falted Ham, a Leg of Pork in Pickle, a Bermudas Hat, a Pestle and Mortar, a Copper-pot, and some other Things; and I offer'd 3 Guineas Reward for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173210110014"/> stopping them.

But both of them neglecting to dispose of it, I got up on Friday Morning, and swore if my Wife would not go and sell it, I would break her Neck, and so I pull'd her out of bed, and made her carry it to the Goldsmith's, and there she was stopt.</p>

            . I went (by Direction of Mr. Wood, who was Marshall's Landlord ) to make a Distress upon Marshall's Goods for Rent. and there I found this Shift, mark'd M. C. And remembring by Mr. Carey's Advertisement, that such Shifts had been lost out of his House suspected that this was one of them, and that made me search more narrowly. In a Wig-box in the Shop, I found these two Candlesticks and this Pewter Cover, and a loaded Pistol. I met with this other Pair of Candlesticks in a Bundle under the Dresser, and above Stairs I found a Ham in a Bag: Here it is.</p>

Then we went to the Garden-house Door, and broke it open with an Iron Crow, and there we found a China Decanister, and a Pewter Cover. Then we broke open all the other Doors that stood in our Way, and rumaged the House from Top to Bottom.

So I went and bought the Bed for 35 s. and I could not afford to give more; for I had a Sale at Islington not long after, and I sent this Bed thither, and allow'd it at 40 s. but no body would give so much, and so I was forced to bring it home again.</p>

I look'd as long as I car'd for, and then turning about to go away, I perceived that the Prisoner, with his Hands behind him, had got hold of my Pocket. He had a Penknife in his Hand, and my Pocket was cut; and with his Fingers in the Slit, he was pulling out my Snuff-box. I actually saw him take it. You Rogue, says I, you have got my Box! Damn your Eyes, you Bitch, says he, speak such another Word, and I'll sacrifice you? I took hold of his Arm; he struck me several Times on the Stomach. I still held him. He threw something over my Head, and said, Damn you, you Bitch, there's your Box, Some of the People cry'd, that's none of it. I look'd, and saw it still in his Hand. It was the Penknife that he threw away, for it self in a Puddle, and a little Girl pick'd it up. Then he let the Box fall,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173210110017"/> and twisting himself about, he got from me, and ran cross the Way into a Court; telling the People he was pursu'd by the Bailiff's, and begging them to hide him.

               <p>Mrs. Collet. I question whether they did or no, for when he said so, he leaned over the Table, and whisper'd to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you first took hold of me, and looked in my Face, did you not say, that you was mistaken, and I was the wrong Person?</p>

            . As I was standing at the Nag's-Head Gate, to see a Funeral that was coming from Bromley; the Prisoner pass'd by me, and said, it's a very fine Burying, if you do but view it well. Mrs. Collet was standing against an Oyl-Shop, and he went and stood close before her. I saw him put his Left-hand into his Pocket, and take out this Clasp-pen-knife, and look on it thus; and then he put his Hands behind him. Mrs. Collet presently took hold of his Arm, and said, he had got her Snuff-Box. Damn your Eyes, you Bitch, says he, speak such a Word again, and I'll make a Sacrifice of you. Then he threw away the Knife; it fell in a Puddle of Water, and a Girl took it up. The People said, that's not the Box, and with that he threw the Box down, and as Mrs. Collet was stooping to take it up, he got from her, and went a-cross the Way, into a Court that had no Thorow-fare, and there he was stopt. I follow'd and heard him say to Mrs. Collet, You do it to take my Life away; but pray, Madam, don't say that I am the Man, for I live in repute.</p>

Mrs. Collet stoop'd to take up her Box, and he sprung away from her, and got into Elephant and Castle-Alley, which being no thorow-fare, he was taken and carry'd into Mr. Cave's House.</p>

When the Men met me, one of them ask'd me, what was a Clock? I said, I could not tell. You lye, damn you, says he. Don't damn me, says I. God damn it, says Headly, the Dog mutters, let's thump him. With that I took to my Heels, and they after me, and when I came near the Bason, Headly struck me with a Stick and fell'd me; then Chapman clapt one Hand to my Mouth; and the other to my Coat Pocket, while Headly took my Tye Wig, my Hat and my Cane, and the other Man rumaged my other Pockets. I lost a Shilling out of one of my Breeches Pockets, and 3 d. out of the other; but being on the Ground I could not see which of them took the Money. After that, they threw me into the Bason, and said, Now lye there and he damned, and so they made off; but a poor Man a Carpenter coming by, Aha! says he, what are you going to drown your self? and so he help'd me out; but for Blood and Dirt never was poor Creature so abused. I ask'd the Carpenter where he liv'd,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173210110019"/> that I might send for him upon Occasion to be an Evidence. He told me in Wardour-street, or Water-lane, I forget which, but I could not find him again.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you see the Prisoners plain enough to know 'em again?</p>
               <p>Young. Yes; it was as light as it is now.</p>
               <p>Court. What betwixt 9 and 10 at Night?</p>
               <p>Young. It was light enough to diseern any Man living, and I am very certain to both the Prisoners.</p>

               <p>Young. No; it was a very windy Evening.</p>
               <p>A Juryman. Whither did you go after you got out of the Bason?</p>
               <p>Young. I went with the Carpenter to Scavenger [Cavendish] Squar, and there I left him, and went directly to Mr. Pain's the Distiller in Highstreet, St. Giles's, but he was gone out, and I saw only his Boy at home.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the Boy here?</p>
               <p>Young. No; I was in such a dirty Condition when I went in there, that I look'd more like a Blackguard than a Gentleman; and there are so many Blackguards go to that Shop, that when I went there afterwards the Boy did not remember me from the rest of his Master's Customers. No poor Creature was ever in such a Pickle. In short, I was asham'd to go along the Streets, but however, I made Shift to get home at last.</p>

               <p>William Row, Watchman. Last Sunday Night, between 11 and 12, as I was upon my Watch, the Prosecutor came to me, and said, he had seen two Men hard by, who had robb'd him some time ago in Marybon-fields. I went with him, and he took one, and I took the other, near the New-Exchange.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did you not take them up before?</p>
               <p>G. Young. Because I did not love Trouble, and had not done it now, but that I met them accidentally, for I never hunted after them; tho' several of my Friends offer'd to go with me to Newgate, to enquire if no Body there knew such Persons, who committed such a Robbery; and they said, they did not doubt, but I might hear of them. However I never went; but it happen'd last Sunday Night, as I was going home from the King's-Head Tavern, the Corner of - I saw one of the Prisoners leaning against a Post, in the Strand, opposite to the New-Exchange, and the other standing by him, knocking his Link against the Heel of his Shoe. As I past by, I heard one of them Mutter to the other, Damn you, there's the Man we took the Hat and Wig from in Marybon-fields !</p>
               <p>Court. 'Tis very strange he should say so in your hearing.</p>
               <p>G. Young. So I seem'd to take no notice, but went on and call'd a Watchman directly; he was then, I think, crying past a 11, and going up a Court about a 100 Yards from where I met the Prisoners; I told him they were both standing together; but when we came back, one was on one side of the Way, and the other on t'other; Mr. Mand's House is opposite to the New-Exchange.</p>

               <p>Mr. Harding. Before I had taken up the Prisoner's Wife (who was try'd just now) I was told that he and she lay together in my Chambers during my Absence. I challenged her then with some Things that were missing, she said, that he had taken them away. She gave me the Key of his Room, in Black-Friars, I went thither with my Servant and a Constable. The Prisoner was in Bed; I found a pair of Shoes, a pair of black worsted Stockings, and a Wig there, which were mine. He got up and put them on, and said, his Wife brought them. I told him, I had lost several other Things, and that his Wife had sent me to him. Says he, what Things are they, set them down upon a piece of Paper, and I'll go with you to all the Pawnbrokers that she deals with in Shoe-Lane, and if we can't find them, I'll pay you for them, or make you any other Satisfaction. I told him, that I understood he lay at my Chambers in my Absence, and he owned that he had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, in the Footman's Bed, my Wife told me you desir'd her to lie there, and she desir'd me to lie with her. She told me too, that you would take it well if I sorted some Votes and Pamphlets which lay in your Chambers, and I did so. I believe the Shoes and Stockings she gave me were yours; but she said, you had given her leave to take them. As for the Wig, she said, it was given her by her Master Thickness, who lived with you.

A Penny Trumpet, says he. They were mighty difficult in chusing, but at last they fixt upon one, and then she bid me give her change for half a Crown. I ask'd for the half Crown; N o, says she, I never part with my Money in a Fair, till I have my Change. My Husband was just gone for a Penny-worth of Cheese, and I not having Silver enough about me, I gave her a Shilling in part, and told her my Husband would be back in 2 or 3 Minutes, and give her the rest. Come, says the Prisoner to his Wife, we can't stay, give the Woman her Shilling again, I believe I have got Halfpence; says she, I gave the Shilling to you; No, says he, you did not; but I did, says she, look in your Pocket, and you'll find it. So he took out some Silver in his Hand, and about 3 Pennyworth of Half pence, and gave this Shilling and a Penny to her, and she gave the same to me, and they went away; I put the Penny in my Pocket, and keeping the Shilling in my Hand, I felt it crack as I held it. I subscrib'd the Prisoner and his Wife to some People, who follow'd and took them presently. The Prisoner offer'd me a Guinea and a Crown bowl of Punch to smother it up, and not appear against them. And his Wife confess'd before the Justice, that she knew it was a bad Shilling.</p>
