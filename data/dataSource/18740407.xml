                  </hi>. I live at 2, Beale Road, Old Ford Road, and am a cabman. About 12.20 on a Tuesday morning, I don't remember the day of the month, I was on my cab stand at Cambridge Heath, while stand<lb/>ing there I saw two young men and a female going along the road on the right hand side of Hackney Road coming from Shoreditch church. I also saw three men following them on the same side of the road, I should say from 4 to 6 yards behind—I heard some loud talking, I looked towards them—the three men parted from the others and walked across to the top of the cab rank—the prisoner who was one of them turned round and used some vulgar expression towards the female—he was then in the middle of the road, at the top of the cab rank—he held up a knife and said, "You b----if you come and fight with me, you b----<hi rend="italic">sod</hi>, I will rip this up your b----guts"—I had not heard either of the other men say anything to him before that—the two young men who were with the female then walked across towards these three and left the female at the other corner, and all of them walked right to the other side of the road and then we heard a scuffle—I could not say who began the scuffle—I went up to them, I got close to them—I was not more than 4 yards away from the prisoner and Freeman—the prisoner stepped back a few steps, unbuttoned his coat and pulled out something, and made a stab at Freeman—he made a plunge at his left hand side—he bent a little and stabbed up, like that—Freeman called out "I am stabbed, you have stabbed me"—the prisoner was then walking quietly over the way and buttoning up his coat—Free-man put his hand like that and kept on reeling about—he did not fall down—I followed the prisoner who walked towards his two companions who were on the other side of the road, and made some sign or signal to the companions who were following, and they all three turned and walked towards Cambridge Heath Bridge—I followed them, and saw a constable and spoke to him, and we went up to the prisoner and the other men, and I picked the prisoner out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was very dark—there were from a dozen to sixteen persons round altogether, not more—I did not see the beginning of the scuffle—I stated before the Magistrate that the prisoner used the expres<lb/>sion "If you come and fight me I will rip this up your b----guts," I am sure of that—I told the Magistrate as nearly as possible the same I have told to-day—I believe I said that before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The fourteen or sixteen persons were round at the com<lb/>mencement of the scuffle, but at the time the prisoner made the stab at Freeman there was nobody near Freeman and the prisoner but themselves—I don't know which commenced the scuffle—when I went across the road Freeman and the prisoner were by themselves, separated from the others; they were standing up to one another, they were not close—there is a stone with three lamps on an obelisk, I should not think there was another lamp near the spot—I did nut lose sight of the man at all till I told the police<lb/>man,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070012"/>
               <p>I followed him close up behind—I was not more than 3 or 4 yards behind him at the very extreme, and he turned round and said something to me going along which I could not hear—I wish to say something which I think is of very great importance; when the constable brought the prisoner back to the corner of the Hackney Road, Freeman was gone and there was no one there who saw the affair, only me—the constable took the prisoner's name and address and let him go, and he said I should be more careful in what I: said in giving a man in charge for stabbing, and the prisoner said, "I shall know you, you b----<hi rend="italic">sod</hi>, if for three months to come, I will do for you, I will know you by your talk," and that he would sling a half crown in my eye.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brush maker, and live at 41, Canrobert Street—I was with Freeman and Lamb that night, in the Hackney Road—I and Freeman were singing as we went along—we went into an eel-pie shop—we came out, and walked along—I saw the prisoner and two other men before we went into the eel-pie shop, and we saw them when we came out—before we went into the eel-pie shop we were singing "Do come in on Sunday, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>," and the prisoner with the other men turned round and said, "We can come in any b----Sunday you like"—there was no quarrel before I went into the shop—when we came out Lamb said something to Freeman—we walked on up the road without saying anything to the men—they went in front of us, and they crossed by the cab-rank—they then turned round, and I believe the prisoner said "I have <hi rend="italic">up'd</hi> your old woman many a time, and I will up her again"—Freeman and I crossed the road to ask for an explanation—I did not know any of those three men—when wo crossed the road he wont in front of them, and <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall (which is a nickname for Hall) said to Freeman "Why don't you turn it up, <hi rend="italic">Sal</hi>?"—that is a nickname of Freeman's—Freeman did not say anything in reply—the prisoner struck him in the chest—the prisoner and Freeman then backed out into the road by themselves, and <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall and Brown came on to me, and said "Boot the b----<hi rend="italic">sod</hi>" and they began to kick me—I did not see what the prisoner and Freeman did—I afterwards took him to the doctor's, and afterwards to the London Hospital—I heard Freeman halloo out "I am stabbed!"—I did not see the prisoner stab him; that was whilst tho other men were kicking me—I had just jumped up, when ho hallooed out "I am stabbed!"—the other men were at me then—I then went and looked, and found Freeman—I think there were more than a dozen people on the spot while this was going on—none of them interfered—I am quite certain that none of those strangers administered the stab—I knew Freeman well; I was his companion—I have seen him since he died; I was there every day—his name was James Richard Freeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not at any time hear the deceased say it was <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall who had stabbed him—the prisoner and Freeman were out in the road alone together when Freeman was stabbed—I did not see anyone else near them—I was on the pavement and they were out in the road—I could not tell whether there was anyone else standing anywhere near them;</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The depositions of the deceased, James Freeman, was read as follows: "I</hi> live at 11, Hill Street, Hackney Road, and am a rough stuff cutter—last Monday night week, just by the eel shop in Cambridge Heath, some men insulted my young woman—one of them was like the prisoner—I think he is one of them—he told bar to go and—herself—I told him he was no man—he sparred up to me and I to him—he bit me and I hit him, and he hit me in the groin with a knife—I said "you have stabbed me"—I was frightened, for a minute—the prisoner is, like the man who did it—I can't swear to him, as it was rather dark—I was taken first to the doctors and then to the hospital—I am called by a nick name <hi rend="italic">Sal</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall who was there, said "'why don't you turn it up Sal, I have two of them on to me and I cannot get away from them"—<hi rend="italic">Punch.</hi> Hall never hit me at all—I never said he stabbed; me—he was one of the three—I think it was the prisoner who did it—it was dark—I said <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall knew something about it—there was <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall, the prisoner, and another one, whose name I don't know—I am certain I did not tell the inspector that <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall did it.";</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said to the deceased "Have, you been stabbed?" and he answered "Yes, by Jack Hall; he is called <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall; and I saw the knife in his hand."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He said that on the 25th, two days before he died—he was examined before the, Magistrate on the, 26th—I told the Magistrate what he bad said to me, and that was why he was examined on that point—he appeared sensible at the time-the doctor was present—he appeared to understand the drift of what I was saying—I did not take down what he said; he was not then considered in a dangerous state—he was in bed—I heard him tell the Magistrate he had not said it—I can't account for that; I know he did say it—I put it down in my pocket-book—this is it; "Jack Hall, called <hi rend="italic">Punch Hall</hi>, 25/2"—that was the note I made at the time—I am sure he said that he was stabbed, by <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall, and that he saw the knife in his hand.</p>

"Oh, he has bled me I" and he ran away towards the Hackney Road—the prisoner came on to the pavement, and I said "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, have you stabbed him?"—he said "No, I have not"—we went up towards Cambridge Heath Bridge—the cabman followed us—he would not lose sight of the prisoner till we got right over the bridge, and then he went and fetched the policeman—the policeman came up, and the cabman picked the prisoner from us three, and me and Brown went away and left the prisoner in company with the policeman—I did not stab Freeman; I was 14 feet away from him, and I was friendly to him up to the same day—Brown could not have done it.</p>

                  </hi>: I live at 109, Church Road, Islington—on 20th February, about 11.50 at night, I was going home to my father's house, and saw the prisoner inside the front garden standing at the foot of the house steps. I asked him if that was No. 109, he said that it was No. 1ll, and I turned to go out again—lie followed me—I found that he was wrong, laid hold of him, and asked him what right he had there, he gave me a furious blow in the face with his fist, causing blood to flow from my nose in great quantities. I was staggered but went up to him again about 5 yards from the house, caught hold of him and made two or three attempts to strike him—I succeeded in knocking off his hat, which is now in the hands of the police—the prisoner then drew a heavy instrument from the side pocket of his over coat and gave me a tremendous blow across my forehead, and I was partially stunned: I still kept hold of him and we struggled 10 or 12 yards further—he continued to beat me about my head, and feeling sick and faint from loss of blood, I called to him for mercy, but he still con<lb/>tinued</p>

My husband's name is William Bass—I have been working for Mr. Coate for about twelve years—I receive the manufactured materials and then make the brushes and return them, and am paid for the work done in making them—I was at work for Mr. Coate in 1871, and during that year I delivered the work when finished to Mr. Collins, and received the money for it from him—I did not keep any account or book of my own—they did not give me an account of the materials I took out, but they were entered in a book—I simply did the work, took it back and was paid—I worked for Mr. Coate up to the time of my confinement, on Sunday, 17th December, 1871, and I received payment for the work that I had done—I am positive I did not receive any money from Mr. Collins the day before that—I did not do any work for five or six weeks after my confinement—I had work in the house, some done, and some undone—I did not deliver any back undone, it was all taken back done—during the time I was ill no monies were paid to me—at the time of my confinement my husband and children had the small pox, they were ill five or six weeks altogether—I did not receive any money during those five or six weeks, nor did anyone in my house—my mother, Mrs. Newport, used to take the work in some<lb/>times for me when I was ill—I can't say when the work which I had in hand was returned—I did not receive 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 23rd December, nor 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 30th December.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of work in the house when I was confined—I did not receive any other materials before that was finished, that I am positive about—they were paid for when they were taken back—I can't re<lb/>collect what amount I received during the time the family had the small-pox and I was confined—when the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of work was taken in we had that 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can't say exactly when it was taken in; it was five or six weeks—I had no other work than that during the five or six weeks; that I am positive about—I did not receive any money except for work actually done—I can't say how long it was before the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of work was finished, some were finished and sent, but not paid for till they all went in—my mother took the last and was paid for it—I don't recollect when that was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of Mrs. Bass—she was confined on 17th December, 1871, and Mr. Bass and the children had the small-pox—I nursed Mrs. Bass in her confinement—there was some work in the house for Mr. Coate at the time she was taken ill—I can't tell what the value of the work was—it was taken in by me—I can't tell how long after the con<lb/>finement—it was not for another month—I received the money for it, but what the amount was I don't know—I did not receive any money from Mr. Coate or Mr. Collins until I took that work in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brush manufacturer, at 41 and 42, Lisle Street, Leicester Square—the prisoner was in my service as cashier up to January, 1873—he had the entire control of the cash, and it was his duty to pay the workpeople—as a rule separate books were kept for each of the workpeople, except when new hands were taken on trial for one or two weeks, and if they were found to suit a separate book was given to them—I have here the book of Sarah Bass, for December, 1871—the entries are in the prisoner's writing—the entries in December, 1871, are: December 2nd, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 9th, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 16th, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 23rd, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and 30th, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner kept a cash account as well, and those sums are entered by him in the cash-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have about one hundred workpeople altogether; about fifty in London—the prisoner had to settle with from forty to fifty, but not in the same way as he did with Bass—there would be about thirty or thirty-five people to pay every week for work done—they did not come in regularly every week—the number of workpeople I had would not be shown by the week—I dare say thirty-five to forty were paid weekly, and it was his duty to pay them—he had other duty to perform also; to cut up bristles, give out work, and take in work—he has been with me nearly twenty years—he has not assisted me materially; he has been in the habit of cooking my books, and making it appear so—I was insolvent in 1855, and in Whitecross Street Prison—the prisoner was one of my bail for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he might have lent me money occasionally since that time; the books will show—he has never given me his name to accommodation bills—he never discounted a bill for me; he filled one in in my absence, and put his name at the back—I don't remember his lending me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in October, 1871; I have no knowledge of it—the cash-book is here, and will show every transaction—how could he lend me money when he was indebted to me?—I have no recollection of his lending me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 23rd October, 1871—I don't swear that he did not: if he did he should have entered it in this book—the cash-book shows him a debtor to me of 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that moment—I have do recollection of his lending me 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in October, 1871—will not swear he did not—it would not have come into my hands if he had; it would have gone into the bank—I have not got the pass-book or the paying-in book for that year—I was away eight or nine months, and sent money to my wife—I don't think my wife knows whether he lent me 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or not—she is here—she would not know—if he had done it, it would have been in the book—I have no recollection of his lending me 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 23rd October—there is a cheque here, written "Collins," but I say now that at that moment he was indebted to me in 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he frequently kept back sums and entered them in the wrong dates, and made a fictitious balance every week—he did not lend me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 18th January, 1872—the balance at that moment was</p>

I have no knowledge of them—I don't think they did—I won't swear that not one of them did—they might have been used for me, but I have never seen them, and I don't believe it—there is no evidence to convince me that those cheques were used in my business—the balance that I find is a balance in my favour at the end of the year—the accountant has gone through the books—the prisoner had notice that the books were opened when the new cases were presented—he was not present when the accountant was going through the books—I did not let the prisoner know at any time that he was going through the books—I might have borrowed money from the prisoner over and over again to pay the wages on Saturday night for a day or two—I don't recollect distinctly; if he did, did that justify him in robbing me?—he might have lent me money; certainly not as often as thirty times in the year, nor twenty; he might have done so a dozen times in the course of fifteen years—I produce an acceptance of Matthews &amp; Blight, and also some letters, which I have had notice of—this is a bill drawn in my name and accepted by Edward Matthews—they did not pay the bill at maturity—very likely Matthews &amp; Blight wrote and told me they did not pay it—I believe the prisoner discounted it at the bank—it might have been at my request—I must have known it certainly; it must have been with my sanction—I might not have been in London when it was done—I don't remember now whether it was done at my special request—I must have known it certainly—I have exchanged cheques with the prisoner now and then—when my cheque would not be paid, I have got a cheque from the prisoner on two or three occasions—I don't recollect to what amount—there was another transaction with Matthews &amp; Blight in April—the two transactions amounted to 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am not aware that he has accommodated my wife with money; I believe he has lent a few pounds occasionally, and he has as often borrowed of her if he wanted money—I suppose my wife is a witness; she was a witness before the Magistrate.</p>

Humphreys and Son, ship-builders at Hull—I commenced with them in 1856—I had been in Hull previously—I first went to Hull in 1849, I left in 1852, and came back in 1853—in 1853 I knew the firm of John Lundgren and Co.—I knew their clerks—I knew Mr. Trana, the last witness and I knew the prisoner by the name of Lundgren, the same name as his employer—he was in the service of John Lundgren and Co. when I first knew him—I knew him at Hull, from the latter part of 1853, till about the middle of 1854—he was a Swede—I would see him perhaps every other day, sometimes perhaps there might be a day or two between; at all events, I used to see him frequently up to the middle of 1854—I was then in the employ of Hall, Reeme and Son, curriers—I had no business with the firm of Lundgren, only I was acquainted with Mr. Trana, and through being acquainted with him, I became acquainted with Lundgren's firm—the first time we ever met together was at the Minerva Hotel, we met there of an evening—I went there to see Trana, being an old friend, and so I became acquainted with the prisoner—(I have been in Sweden), he is the same man—I saw him in the Court of Queen's Bench in December last.</p>

I may inform you that one of the judges who tried the case is related to the Tichborne family, and of course is strongly biassed against the Claimant. Should you make a full disclosure of all you know, you will not only obtain a full and free pardon, but you shall also receive a large sum of money, which will enable you to leave this country and go to America. On the part of the Treasury, and also on the part of the judges of the Queen's Bench, there is a strong feeling against the Claimant, and the fact of one of the judges being related to the Tichborne family will be a great thing in your favour should you make the disclosures I suggest. Write to the Solicitor of the Treasury, Mr. Gray, saying you will give every information required, and you will immediately obtain your freedom and also a good round sum. When you are at liberty you can assume another name, call yourself William Smith or Jones, and go to, Australia or America, and no one will know anything about you. You can easily regain your position in life on going to a distant</p>

               <p>quarter of the globe, with good means and money in your pocket, which you will obtain without difficulty from the Tichborne family, as the dis<lb/>closures you can make will completely defeat the Claimant, and on that occasion the judge who is related to the Tichborne family will, behind the curtain, give you every assistance. Write also to Mr. Hawkins, telling him you are willing and ready to make all disclosures. I am one who knows of the relationship alluded to and who is also a native of Hampshire.")

Funcke and Mencke, New York, also Baron Falkenberg, New Bedford"—I telegraphed to New York, and wrote a letter on 10th July to Funcke, Eadie, and Co.—I found out that they were the representatives of Funcke and Mencke—about 5th August I received a reply to that letter—I showed it to the prisoner, and read it to him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "July 22, 1873: Dear Sir,—Your letter of</p>

It is a hard thing for me to bare, and you know very well that if I can have no assistances given to me to bring Lundgren's relations here as well as Jean's, the two American ladies, and they two men now in England, who knows both the <hi rend="italic">Osprey</hi> and myself, independent of that villain woman, who is a—, and living with another man than her husband Lundgren, as well as proper and independent medical men to examine me respecting rupture, I must be in a hopeless state.

It is the truth, and nothing but the truth, and that it seems to me villany is practised all over the world against both Roger and myself. Harcourt asked me if I could defend myself. What does he mean? I wrote you last night a letter. I wrote also to Mr. W. Perhaps you have not received it. What am I to do? I am shut out from the world, and am starving. I must go to the criminal side to-night, as I have no means. See what Sir Roger says.

I think it was after the second day, I think it must have been the 16th, it was the day we signed the paper, the testimonial to character; that testimonial was written by me—I have been in Court most of the time while this trial has been going on; I wrote this, "that he has borne himself through all his life as a man entitled to confidence and respect"—I ask permission to explain specifically why I used those words; they were written with great deliberation under these circumstances, we knew that the Crown had in their service a great number of detectives engaged in following up any investigation, and ascertaining the character of every person that was called, or about to be called on the part of the defence, that every circumstance of their life was in the hands of the cross-examining counsel, and we came to the conclusion that if anything whatever could be found against this man unless he was a plant by the Government, unless he was put forward knowingly as the man he turns out to be, that that undoubtedly would have become known to the Government and would have been disclosed in his cross-examination. Therefore Mr. Onslow and myself, in considering what was due to the man, deliberately stated that we believed, having passed through the cross-examination as he did, that his character was by that circumstance well established; that was the reason—it was a matter of full consideration, and not written with any haste or carelessness—I signed it "G. H. Whalley, M.P." and Mr. Onslow signed as "Guildford Onslow, M.P.;" we desired to give as much weight to the testimonial as we could—we knew that the Government had detectives who knew the whole life of every witness, by the complaints that were made by those witnesses of the extent to which they were harrassed previous to being called, one person committed suicide in consequence, so we were told, and his widow had to be provided for—am a magistrate of three counties—I live</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070053"/>
               <p>I objected to answer the questions of Mr. Hawkins respecting the latest period of my life in consequence of a misfortune that I was really led into, but the Lord Chief Justice ordered me to answer the questions. I was compelled to do so, and I did it as it came into my mind at the <hi rend="italic">time.</hi> Numbers of witnesses have been called here against me as to the period of 1853 and 1854, one, according to his account, being himself a schoolfellow of mine. How is it possible for me to contradict these men when I am deprived entirely of assistance, either legal assistance or assistance of people whom I should have been able to bring forward? If I had time I should prove that they are mistaken—entirely mistaken—in the identity. It requires, in fact, a wonderful memory for any one to distinguish one man from another after a period of over twenty years' time, and especially when you have a man only just come into Court to discern an individual Had I been able to be defended, and produce witnesses, it would certainly have substantiated my story to a great extent. Of course in the later periods of 1862 and 1867 misfortunes have fallen to my lot. That undoubtedly is true, but respecting the time of 1852, 1853, and 1854, there is no truth whatever in what has been said. I don't say that people have perjured themselves, because if they have perjured themselves a vast number of witnesses who have been brought against Roger Tichborne must be as bad as they are in that respect. But I say I have been the sole victim of prosecution from a number of people amounting to nearly 300, no matter on which side. I think it is very bard indeed that I should suffer the inconvenience in which I am placed. It can be proved, and will in time come out, that the <hi rend="italic">Osprey</hi> which I joined at New Orleans in 1852, and was with her up to July, 1854, is a fact undoubtedly, and it will be found to be true. Time will tell that, and it should have been proved satisfactorily both to your lordship and the jury, if I had had that ample means given me which I now stand in need of. Had it not been for the misfortune of this bigamy affair of mine I certainly should never have given the account which I have given, because I stood in the position that whatever turn I took, when it came to the period of 1855 to 1857, whether I admitted that or made any false statement or not, it would have fallen to my lot to be punished. I am very sorry that this has taken up the time so long, keeping your lordship and the jury for such a length of time through the calling of these witnesses, since I am not in a position now to bring forward evidence in support of my story. Very sorry, indeed, I am, but I trust that the time will come soon enough to prove my story and the fact of the <hi rend="italic">Osprey</hi> in 1854. At the same time, I beg his lordship to be as lenient in his punishment towards me as possible, bearing in mind that I have still eighteen or nineteen months to be under servitude.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the merchant service, and have been a captain twenty-five years—early in 1854 I was master of the <hi rend="italic">John Bibby</hi>, and was with my vessel at Rio—remember the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi> arriving while I was there, and knew her captain very well indeed, Captain Birkett—he was a personal friend of mine—he had then been about three years in command of the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">George Fafe</hi>, Captain Hosking, was at Rio at the same time, she is a Liverpool ship—I remained at Rio five or six weeks—I have not got the books with me, but this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an old journal which I kept at the time—it is in my writing—I arrived in Rio on 2nd April, and left again on 12th May, 1854—I remember the <hi rend="italic">Bella sailing</hi> about 20th April—on the morning she sailed I went on board of her to see Captain Birkett, and to assist a young gentleman who was with him, whose name I have since ascertained was Roger Tichborne—I cannot recollect the name he went by at that time—I was to get him out without a passport, he had got into difficulties—he represented that his friends were very well off, but he had not the means of paying his debts in Rio, and Captain Birkett gave him a passage to New York—he promised Captain Birkett that he would pay him at some future time as his friends were <hi rend="italic">very</hi> wealthy—I managed to get him away without a passport, by leaving my own ship early in the morning with my boat's crew and going on board the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>, which was lying at the outer anchorage all ready to go to sea—my own ship was in the</p>

               <p>inner anchorage in the ballast ground, not more than a quarter of a mile from the nearest landing place, and a quarter of a mile from the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>—I slept on board my own ship, and when I got on board the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>, Captain Birkett was there and this young Englishman—that was about 5 a.m., and the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi> was preparing to weigh anchor, and a steam-tug was ready to tow her out to sea—I saw the young gentleman there and Captain Birkett, and the steward arranged that he should go down into the lazarette, under the store room, under the cabin floor—it is a place where they stow provisions and light goods, and is opened with a grating hatch—the steward placed a few packages over the hatch after he was down—it is like a small hold from one side of the ship to the other—he would have plenty of room, and he would not see if the hatch was lifted up for a moment—the steward replaced the hatch and the steamer came alongside, and the ship began to move down the harbour—she was made fast and towed ahead, and when she got opposite Fort Balignan, which is a Government Fort, near the entrance of the harbour the Government officer came on board to give the ship her final clearance—he brought a true list certified by the English Consul—the <hi rend="italic">Bella's</hi> crew were mustered and each answered to their names—the officer said "No passengers!" or something of that sort, as no passengers were marked on the list—the Brazilian officer said that I must leave the ship before he did—I bade Captain Birkett good bye and got into my boat—that was a mile or a mile and a-half from the anchorage—it was in order to pass that place that we stowed him away—as soon as my boat left I saw the Brazilian officer get into his boat and I pulled directly back to the <hi rend="italic">John Bibby</hi> to breakfast, and the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi> proceeded on her voyage in tow of the steamer—Captain Birkett was perfectly sober that morning and so were the crew, and they were all at work as far as I know—I was perfectly sober—Captain Hosking was not on board the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>, while I was there—I had seen the young gentleman on shore several days previous—the prisoner was not on board while I was there—it is not true that while I was there a panel was taken out of the state cabin, and the young gentleman put in there by the prisoner—Captain Hosking, and Captain Birkett, and I, did not go on board in one boat—I left the young gentleman with Captain Birkett on board the boat, and I found him there the next morning—it is an utter impossibility that the whole of the' crew were drunk, and that the hawser slipped, and that they, got it on board again and made it fast—I saw the vessel and all went on smoothly—the prisoner was not there at all during the whole time I was there—the hawser did not slip, there was no accident whatever—he did not lift me and Captain Hosking into his boat, and row us both ashore together—I never introduced the young gentleman to the prisoner at Rio, by the name of Mr. Tichborne or otherwise—the first time I saw the young gentleman at Rio, was at Fox's stores with Captain Birkett—I never played at billiards with the young gentleman at the Fairy Hotel, Rio—I could not play at that time—I did not in April sleep in a double-bedded room there, this man occupy<lb/>ing one of the beds, or at any hotel with him—I never had a bath in his presence in a room at Rio—I never saw him at Rio—I first saw him at Bow Street, when he was brought up on this charge—I knew very little of the hotels at Rio in 1854, but the water was not laid on to the houses then—a few days after the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi> sailed a vessel brought in her longboat and two watercasks—it was then supposed that something had happened to the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>, and I heard of her loss afterwards when I got to</p>

               <p>China—I never saw any more of Captain Birkett or the crew—I saw a person on his trial in the Court of Queen's Bench, he had no resemblance to the person I stowed away—after Captain Hosking and I had been examined at Bow Street, the prisoner in my presence stated before the Court that we were not the men he had seen at Rio de Janerio, that there was another Captain Oates in command of the <hi rend="italic">John Bibby</hi>, and another Captain Hosking in command of the <hi rend="italic">George Fife</hi>—I know no other Captain Oatea in the Mercantile Marine, and there is no other <hi rend="italic">John Bibby</hi>—she was named after a member of the firm well-known in Liverpool, Old Mr. John Bibby—her tonnage was 850—the <hi rend="italic">George Fife</hi> was between 800 and 900 tons, and both were ships, not barques—as a sailor I can undertake to say that there were not two other ships of those names at Rio—the <hi rend="italic">John Bibby</hi> is the only ship of that name on the Mercantile List—I was examined about this matter at the Law Institution in 1868, and on 23rd May last I was examined at the Queen's Bench, as a witness for the prosecution as to the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>, and as to the stowing this young man away—I was not in the gallery with a lady on 8th October, I was in Hull—I left London on the 1st, and did not return again till the 17th or 18th.</p>

That could be easily found at Washington, but it could only be got from the Secretary of State at Washington. I have no doubt the prosecution know that but they won't own it.</p>

On the evening of March 12th I was in Bishopsgate Street with Cross at 5.45, and saw Steele at the corner of Wormwood Street—we watched him an hour and a half, and saw him go into the Bell public-house, Aldgate, he came out and met Wilde, who handed him this bag—they both went into the Bell, Steele went into the taproom and examined the contents of the bag—I went in and told him we were police officers, and should take him in custody for receiving the bag well knowing it to be stolen—he was emptying the small bag into a large one, shaking it; I think the small bag had been in the large one—at the police-station Steele dropped in the dock a list of Messrs. Hewlett's prices, and said that he had bought this cream of tartar at various little shops—I found nothing on him but a pocket-book and some papers relating to drugs.</p>

Pynot—the signature to this letter, signed "Debreville for Blumberg" is in the same writing as the signature to the translations, but I cannot say as to the body—I cannot tell whether the person signing wrote the letters, because it is a quaint signature, but the bodies are in the same writing, and the signatures are in the same writing—I believe this signature "Larrys &amp; Co." to be in the same writing as this Debreville—this paper found in the key-hole, signed Brunneau, is also in the same writing—I believe the prisoner wrote this signature and also this for "Blumberg &amp; Co."—and I have no doubt that this Debreville is his—I could form a better opinion if I sat down and inspected it.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the Old Catherine Wheel Inn, Bishops-gate Street—I know the two prisoners as customers there—on Thursday evening, 26th March, between 8 and 9 o'clock, Brown came in and asked me whether I would kindly favour him by taking care of some pictures till the morning, and he would fetch them—I knew him by the name of Kemp—ho wished them to be taken particular care of, because he had lent some money on them—I was rather surprised to find six pictures, because I had scarcely room in the bar for them—Smith brought thorn in—these are three of the paintings—they were left that night—the prisoners went away together—they came again the next day, between 2 and 3 o'clock, and brought a cab and took the pictures away.</p>

On the afternoon of Friday, 27th March, I was called into the shop of Mr. Attenborough, pawnbroker, 72, Strand—I found Brown there, with the manager, who said ho had an officer come from the City in the morning, and let him know about some paintings which had been stolen—these three pictures were there—the manager said "This man has brought these three pictures, so I sent for you"—the prisoner said nothing—I took him and the pictures to Bow Street, and from there to Fleet Street, where I searched him, and found in bronze—he refused to give his name and address—the pictures were tied up in the cloth.</p>

He also stated that he wished to call Detective Hawkins as a witness.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 40, Chancery Lane—Mary Elizabeth Stokes is my sister—in January 1872 I sued the defendant for a debt due to my sister—he was then living in Richmond Road, Bays-water—an appearance was put in to the writ, and Mr. Alfred Watson was the attorney acting for the prisoner—I produce the judgment dated 26th February, 1872, for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. debt, and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. costs—I also produce a letter from Mr. Watson—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 29th February</hi>, 1872, <hi rend="italic">and stated that the defendant had no means of paying the debt or costs, and asked for time that an arrangement might be made which was the only way in which the plaintiff could get anything</hi>)—I went to Richmond Road in March, 1872, a few days after the judgment, and the defendant had left—in consequence of something I heard I went to 2, Chichester Road, Maida Vale, within a day or two, and the defendant had been there but had left—I do not know where he was between February 1872, and March 1873—he made no com<lb/>munication to me—in March 1873 I found him at 138, Finborough Road, West Brompton, upon which I took out a summons before a Judge at Chambers on the Judgment—I saw Milhardo on the subject before the return of the summons—Mr. Henry Phillips, who was then acting as his solicitor, asked me a day or two before March 27, 1873, if my client was willing to entertain the proposal he had made for settling the matter—I said "Well, you have said that the furniture in the house at Finborough Road, belongs to Gertrude Milhardo, the daughter, and that if my client takes her collateral security she will get her money"—to that, both the prisoner, who was present, and Mr. Phillips assented, and we then had a discussion as to how the amount was to be cut up—that resulted in a con<lb/>sent order—this is it "I do order the judgment debtor to pay the judgment creditor 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in four instalments of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each"—I also re<lb/>ceived this promissory note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), from Gertrude Milhardo as colla<lb/>teral security—the first instalment was due on 10th July, 1873, which was paid—the costs at the time of drawing up that order were 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with interest—the second instalment was not paid, and I wrote to Finborougb Road—I had leave to substitute service and serve a writ on Miss Gertrude Milhardo—there was no defence to the action against Gertrude, and I got</p>

               <p>judgment, and levied execution on the furniture at Finborough Road, but got no proceeds, because a claim was made to the furniture by Mrs. Milhardo, the mother, the prisoner's wife—when I was told in March, 1873, that the furniture was Gertrude's, I believed the statement, and that was the only reason I had for taking the security—on 17th January, 1874, an inter<lb/>pleader action was tried before Mr. Justice Brett, Mrs. Milhardo was the plaintiff. (The Court <hi rend="italic">considered that this had nothing to do with the case</hi>)—a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> days after judgment had been signed against the debtor Mrs. Mil<lb/>hardo came to my office with some papers which she said were shares, but I did not have them in my hands until the trial—I knew nothing about details of the shares or the Company in which they were—the prisoner was present at the trial, and Gertrude Milhardo was called as a witness for her mother—as soon as I found out what the particulars were I applied at Hammer<lb/>smith for a summons against the prisoner for this offence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 3 &amp; 4, King William Street—I have been acting for the prisoner since Mr. Alfred Watson ceased—in the autumn of 1873 his daughter was in Wales when the second instalment became due—I recollect the payment by Mr. De Costa—the two trustees Mr. Michael Milhardo and Mr. De Costa came and consulted me upon it—I received my costs from Mr. Milhardo, they were 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he paid me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I took—I know that he paid Mr. Tingay, and the witnesses are here to speak for themselves—I recollect going down with the mother to Mr. Stoke's office—she took the three certificates of these very shares with her, and sought to induce him to take them (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Besley objected that this was not evidence, and it was not proceeded with</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was the solicitor at the time of the judgment summons in March, 1873, I was then first employed—I never knew anything of it till the judgment summons was brought.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by my brother, George Taylor, at his Photographic establishment in Crown Buildings, Queen Victoria Street—he also has an establishment at Forest Lodge, Forest Hill—up to 19th March, the prisoner was in his employment as chief operator, it was his duty to take photographs at Crown buildings; the negatives were then intensified, and sent to Forest Lodge to be printed—the portraits were mounted and completed there, and returned to Crown buildings to be rolled—the prisoner had access to the room where they were rolled—they then passed into the hands of Miss McDonough, who duty it was to sort them and send them out—we have had repeated complaints of photographs being missed—on 17th March, a lady called and made a complaint—in consequence of that, on 19th March I went to 89, Park Street, Camden Town—I there saw the frames produced, bearing the name of R. Stuart, photographer to the Queen—I recognised all the photographs in those frames, with the exception of four or five; there were nearly 200 altogether exhibited—I went inside, and saw a boy named Bertrand Gidney, who had been in our employment, and had left the Christmas before—he is about 18 years of age, his duty was to assist the prisoner—I saw Mrs. Turnbull as well—it was about 11 o'clock in the morning—I returned about 3 o'clock in the afternoon and spoke to my brother, he sent for the prisoner—I was not present at the interview—I saw him next morning, and told him not to resume his duties until he saw my brother—he laughed and said it was quite a mistake to suppose that he had anything to do with the business, that the business was Gidneys, he had got a very nice place and was likely to do well—I told him that Mrs. Turnbull was there; he said that was a mistake, Mrs. Turnbull was then in Rochdale—he left our employment that morning—I know his handwriting—my brother communicated with Mr. Cox the attorney, and this letter was written by Mr. Cox to the prisoner, and on the other side is an answer from the prisoner, addressed from Vauxhall Bridge Road—(<hi rend="italic">Letters read—from Mr. Cox to lie prisoner</hi>. "20th March, 1874. Sir, I have been consulted by Messrs. A, and G. Taylor, of Crown 1875.

               <p>reason to believe that you are identical with the person named Stuart, in which name the premises of Park Street is carried on, they request you to give me before 12 o'clock on Monday, a satisfactory explanation upon the subject, and failing the same, my clients instruct me to say that they will immediately take such course as they may be advised.")—(<hi rend="italic">From the prisoner to Mr. Cox</hi>: "Sir; I have just received yours from my tenant, I beg to say in reply that your client is both a liar and a fool, which I trust you will duly record to him, adding at the same time that he would be employing himself much more laudably by purchasing some yellow soap, and having a few gallons of clean water, and so thoroughly cleansing himself, thus removing a stinking nuisance to everyone who comes near him.")—After that letter I obtained a warrant for the prisoner's apprehension, and with my brother, Sergeant Bull, and Detective Outram, went to Park Street on 25th March—Outram went in and came out with the prisoner looking at the photographs and then we all four went in—we went into the first floor front room—I saw chemicals and photographs there (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are taken from negatives belonging to my brother—the cards bear his name at the back, but I am referring more to the enlarged ones, there is no name on them; the greater part of the small ones have our firm's name at the back—I saw thirty or forty negatives that were our property; there were one or two without our number, but I knew them all as negatives taken by the prisoner—I think there are one or two duplicates—the prisoner had no right to take those—all the others bear the stock number, and one or two have got the printer's mark in pencil; that shows the number printed off—we had a boy named Andrews in our employ as carrier, it was his duty to take things to and from Forest Lodge to Crown Buildings—Thomas Andrews, his brother, took his place for a short time.</p>

I am the prosecutor—on 19th March, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon my brother made a communication to me—I sent for the prisoner and asked if he knew anything about this place at Park Street, Camden Town; he said "No"—I accused him of being the person carrying on that business—he denied it—I afterwards went with my brother and the two detectives to Park Street, and saw my property there which is pro<lb/>duced and many other things—I saw some pure spirit, it is the same I use, some part of the label had been scratched off—Mr. Cook, of Hoxton, supplies us with it—I saw some cyanide of potassium—Mr. Cook also supplies us with that, we had only two bottles of it of that size in stock at the time I believe, it contains 2lbs.—there is one bottle here and I produce the other from Forest Lodge—I saw some nitrate of silver which I left there—it was similar to what I use—I recognised the bottle as mine—it was a small stout bottle and contained about 8oz. of silver, worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a few days before the prisoner left my employment I sent the boy James for some nitrate of silver to Cox of Ludgate Hill—he brought back one bottle of 7oz., and one of 5oz.—I handed the 7oz. bottle to the prisoner—I missed some of it—we were always missing silver—I saw some patent</p>

               <p>glass—it was very similar to what I use—I believe there was a gross of it there—it was left behind—it was more than was necessary for carrying on a business of that sort, and not the quality; it was the best we use—the prisoner would use common glass in his business at Park Street—it is very unusual to use patent plate—it would before or five times the price of common glass—the prices charged by him there would not warrant the use of it—I saw some paper, but did not look at it—I recognised an amount of old bottles, dusters and other things, and in fact mostly everything we use—it was a repetition of Crown Buildings, in fact—I saw some negatives which I identified, and all our usual chemicals for carrying on a very large business—about a month ago I saw the boy Andrews hand a bottle to the prisoner—I don't know what was in it—here is an enlargement from a negative that I took myself three or four years ago, and there are others—I never gave the prisoner permission to take any of these chemicals or negatives, or any of the property—I once gave him twelve small cartes, which I found in his house—there are some photographs here of the Albert memorial—those were taken at my establishment, our best pictures—the prisoner had no right to take those.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The name of Cook, of Hoxton, is on the bottle of cyanide, and it is the form of bottle that we always have it in—if you were to buy 2lbs. of cyanide I don't think you would get it in a bottle like that, you might—it was your duty to take home the negatives and retouch them and bring them back in the morning—if you had a good duplicate negative you would retouch both—we very rarely had the two retouched—just before the photographic exhibition you had twelve negatives to retouch, extra well for exhibition—I told you to select twelve, and no more—we did not print more copies than were ordered—you had no authority to take any of these negatives, they are stock negatives, and ought to be at Forest Hill, at the present time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the principal clerks in the long room at the Custom House—the amounts paid by the prosecutors for duty would be payable in the treasury—the tobacco sheet of the 3rd December contains the items paid by Messrs. Bramble, Wilkins &amp; Co.—there is no entry of any sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on their behalf—there is no entry on the 11th of the same month of the payment of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in their favour—nor is there any entry on the 7th January, of the payment of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the receipt for the money paid, is signed by the cashier, and kept in the department—I have searched for six days after each of the dates named, and I have not found the receipts for any of those sums.</p>

I live at 4, Finch Street, Prick Lane, and am the wife of Thomas Mathews—on the evening of 11th September, I was sitting at my work, when the prisoner walked into the room, caught hold of me by the throat, and said "You b----thing I have got you, and I will do for you," and he fired a pistol at me as I sat in my chair; I could not in my fright tell how he pointed it; he fired at my head, he still had me by the throat with one hand—I dodged my head and screamed, and slipped down—I then got up and struggled with him into the middle of the room, when he fired again—I got away from him and ran down stairs, and fired at me again as I was going down the stairs—he did not hit me—I ran into the front parlour, Mr. Horton, the shoe maker, was there—the prisoner followed me and gave me several kicks and blows, he caught hold of me and threw her down, and then kicked me—he gave me blows on the head and body with a shoe maker's last and a hammer—I became insensible; when I came to my senses I was in the street—I was wounded in my arm and finger, and likewise my head—I was bleeding—I was taken to the hospital—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner married by daughter—I had not had any quarrel with him that day, I had not seen him since I had him up at Wor<lb/>ship Street, two mouths before; that was for attempting his wife's life—the magistrate dismissed that case, he did nothing to him; I did not give evi<lb/>dence, my daughter did—he pretends to be a teetotaller; I do not, nor my daughter—this happened at 7.45 in the evening—I had not been drinking that day, I was hard at work, my husband was at home all day, he is at night work—I believe the pistol is a single barrelled one—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pistol I saw after I came from the hospital—he rushed into the room, rushed up to me at once and put the pistol quite close to my face and fired it—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070089"/>
               <p>I saw fire come from it, I saw the flash quite distinctly—I got up, he still having hold of me by the throat with one hand, and struggled into the middle of the room, and he put the pistol close to my head again and fired again; I saw the flash again—and as I was running down stairs he fired a third time, almost directly—our house is in a street, there is a paved yard to the house, no garden—there are no small stones underneath the window of my room, the yard goes into the stable—five persons live in the house; none of them went into the stable yard after the pistol had been fired, they could not get in, it is locked up, partitioned off from the yard: they could not get into the yard where the small stones are, there is a gate to it—there are no small stones in our yard, there are plenty in the street—no one ran into the street after the firing—I was kicked about my legs and body—I was not so much hurt by the kicking, but I was bruised all over—I did not show the doctor the bruises, or say anything about them—I was not long in the hospital, only to have my head dressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had the prisoner up at Arbour Square once, that was for something done to my daughter—he attempted to cut my throat once—I went to Dr. Squires—that is better than twelve months ago—he has been married to my daughter about eighteen months, but she has been parted from him twelve months, and is at service—he got off at Worship Street by his false tongue—he was charged with trying to break into my room to kill his wife, but he did not succeed in breaking in—he had not touched her, but she was in danger of her life.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He put the pistol as close as he could to her head and fired twice, the second time almost directly after the first, and as close to her face as it could be, and without loosing her throat—I distinctly heard a third report as he was going down stairs—I did not see the child find the pistol, she said she found it, and she gave it to me—I don't know whether there are any small stones about there, there is a long passage be<lb/>tween the street-door and the yard—the prisoner was not in the house when the pistol was given to me—Mrs. Matthews was in Horton's room bleeding when I went down, she was saturated; all her dress—there was a vast quantity of blood, an enormous quantity; floor and all.</p>

               <p>to come from the street-door at first—I next heard Mrs. Matthews in the passage calling for my protection—I let her into the parlour—I did not hear any reports of a pistol—I had not time to shut the door before the prisoner came to the door with a hatchet or plasterer's hammer in his hand—he is a costermonger—I took the hammer out of his hand—he then took my knife off my seat—I took that away from him—he was trying to get at the woman—I was weak and could not do any more, and I went to the door to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> some of the people outside to help me—there was a great crowd outside—Mrs. Coxford and the children up stairs were shouting murder and screaming police all over the place—no one would come to help me and I went into the parlour again—the prisoner was then lying on the prosecutrix in the corner, stooping over her, between my seat and the cupboard—she was crouching down and he was kneeling like in front of her—I could hardly tell whether he was doing anything or not—a mob came in to the assistance—he had one of my lasts in his left hand under her head—I could not exactly say that he was striking her with it—I don't recollect having stated that he was beating her about the head with it—if it is stated there it is quite right—some of the neighbours came and assisted me in getting him off the woman and into the passage—I received a kick in the stomach and was obliged to let go my hold of him, and I recollect nothing afterwards—there was blood running down the woman's neck when she came into my parlour, and when she was in the corner her arm was as if it had been pinched, she was smothered with blood in different places, spots all over—whether it was from her head or not I don't know—there was blood on the floor in the corner, not a great quantity, only drops.</p>

I was surgeon at the London Hospital on 11th September, when the prosecutrix was brought there—I examined her—she was suffering from a small laceration of the scalp at the back of the head, and was bleeding profusely—it was dressed, and I gave her a ticket to attend as an out-patient, but I never saw her again—the wound was about the size of a fourpenny piece or a sixpence; it was an irregular laceration, not quite round—it might have been caused by some blunt instrument—it was just such a wound as one would expect if she had fallen on the back of her head on a macadamized road—it might possibly have been caused by the roughest part of this last.</p>

I was called to the police-station to dress the prosecutrix's wound—it was about two inches in extent, jagged circular wound, between the index finger and thumb of the left-hand, it was a superficial cut, not dangerous unless erysipelas supervened—it was evidently done with a knife—this knife was shown me at the time.</p>

I had had something to drink certainly. <hi rend="italic">My</hi> wife came on the other side of the road and sung out to mo. I did not like it; I wanted her to come across and speak to me.

I thought of frightening her. Directly I saw the blood I was frightened, and I was very sorry. I hardly know what I did. She is a good woman.</p>

               <p>L. J. H. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILKINS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). The prisoner never made me aware of any irregularities at the Customs—he was not authorized to open or accept any letter directed to me—I received no letter from the Custom House—if received it should have been properly endorsed and placed before myself or my partner—the irregularities were to our credit—if an amount was short paid some warrants must have been kept back because they do not give credit, and therefore the last warrant would be kept back because there was not money to meet it, and when a cheque for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent down next day that would cover it, and the warrant might be in the prisoner's pocket, so that day by day there might be a small" balance in our favour, but when the small amounts of credit reached a large amount, it got beyond the transfer and then the difficulty occurred—our customers complained most seriously, but they complained to the prisoner, and he might say "I am very sorry, but don't say anything to the governor about it"—I did not say anything to the prisoner about it because I have only heard it since, and I found in the prisoner's drawer a letter complaining of goods not being sent.</p>

Ashhurst, Morris &amp; Co., and they took out an attachment—I called with them at the Mayor's Court—that was with reference to the account at the City and County Bank—I made an affidavit in that case—I understood it was for an attachment against the banking account of this man—that was my object in going there—I had a bill from him showing that he had an account at the City and County Bank—this letter is in the handwriting of one of our clerks—it is dated 9th March, 1874, addressed to Moss, Ryland &amp; Co.: "Dear Sirs,—We are in receipt of your favour of the 7th instant, enclosing 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., placed to the credit of the account, with thanks.

                  </hi>. I was clerk to the Camberwell Depot of the Coal Consumer's Association under the prisoner—it was my duty to receive money paid by the Carmen for coals delivered when the prisoner was absent, and to initial the carmen's cards—I see my initials for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on this card, dated December 25th—I received that sum from Taylor, the carman, otherwise I should not have signed it. I handed over that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., with other moneys, to Rawlings, but not the card—I received further moneys from him on the 23rd for the prisoner, and they are initialled by me—whenever I received money I handed it over to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant superintendent of the Coal Consumers' Association—in the early part of this year I was ordered to go through the books of the Camberwell Depot, kept by the prisoner—there was an order-book, a delivery-note book, and a stock-book—an order would be first entered in the order-book, the number, the date, the name and address of the party ordering, the quantity ordered, and the number of the coupon or delivery-note which would be presented—when the coals were sent out the carman would have an invoice given to him, and the order should be marked off as sent, with the name of the carman who took it—the delivery-notes have a cheque and a counterfoil—attached to the invoice is a receipt which the party receiving the coals signs and gives to the carman—a card is also received by the carman to deliver; it contains the particulars of the coals he is to deliver—the number of the invoice would be put on the card, by which we can identify the customer—it was the prisoner's duty to receive the money brought by the carman to the office, and the delivery-note, turned into a receipt, would be given to him, which he would paste in the delivery-book on the counterfoil from which it was torn—he would enter the receipt of the money in the stock-book—he entered the whole transaction, and there the matter would end—he would pay the money into the Kennington Butts Branch of the London and County Bank daily, and send up a weekly return—I have selected the weekly sheets sent in by the prisoner to the head office—I find 2 tons of coal ordered on 12th October by Mr. Edwards, of the Beresford Arms—they were not delivered till 23rd December—the order is No. 514—I am not certain whether it is the prisoner's writing or his assistant's—I have got the counterfoil, which is pasted in. (<hi rend="italic">This was for two tons of coal, at</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 44,693 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 44,694, <hi rend="italic">signed "Thomas Rawlings, E.S.</hi>") Then follows the receipt for two tons of coal, signed "James L. Edwards"—the entry in the stock-book is "24th December, two tons;" the date is in the prisoner's writing—there appears to have been a mistake; it is two tons, invoice No. 514, 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the entries are correct, except that 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is put down instead of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., excepting the case of Mr. Fuell—Bond's order is for two tons, delivered on December 23rd, and the delivery-book says "Two tons, 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," signed by Thomas Rawlings—it is enclosed again in the stock-book, "Two-tons, 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—on the same date is "Mr. Fuell, two tons ordered December 11th, delivered December 23rd"—here is a note in the margin, "One ton only sent, T.R."—the counterfoil is "Fuell, 114, High Street, Peckham," "1" ton altered to "2," a "2" altered to "1;" 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the prisoner's writiug—two tons are signed for—in the stock-book here is "One ton at 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—here is Mr. Russell, of Leipsic Road; one ton Silkstone ordered on 28th October, and sent on December 24th, 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and here is Mr. Russell's receipt—there is no entry of that in the stock-book; it, is not accounted for—on 5th June two tons of small coal are ordered by Buzzuy &amp; Co., and sent</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070112"/>
               <p>on the same day—the invoice-book says "Two tons at 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and is signed "F.R.," which appears to be in the prisoner's writing, and then there is "Two tons small, per G. G. Buzzey. J. White."—there is no entry in the stock-book at all—in each of those instances, Edwards, Bowden, and Fuell, he has only accounted for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. instead of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he has not accounted for Russell or Buzzey's order at all—these documents, called "Expenditure accounts," were sent in weekly by the prisoner—I have gone through the amounts, and find cheques from the Directors paying for them which are all here, so that each of these expenditure accounts was satisfied each week by cheque—these two signatures (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are those of the directors.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JONES</hi>. I live at Maida Hill, and am manager of depots in the Metropolitan District of the Coal Consumers Association—we had a depot at Camberwell in October last, and the prisoner was employed to superintend it—it was his duty to keep certain books and to receive money for coals delivered—he had not to look after any other depots, but he had to go round to see the Kensington and Finchley Road Depots at times, to see that my system was carried out—he was my assistant—there are twelve depots, he was depot clerk at Camberwell, and when the other clerk left, I added other duties and increased his salary to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week—I opened an account at the Newington Butts branch bank for the current expenses of the Camberwell Depot—the prisoner sent in every week to the head office an account of his expenses, and they were paid by cheque ordinarily—he had not, to my knowledge, made any charge against the Company for expenses, beyond what had been paid, nor had he complained—he commenced his double duty in September—I saw him on the day he was taken in custody—the week's sheets showing money received by him, came up to me to be initialled before they were paid—those are the sheets which have been handed to Mr. Norris.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in the employ of the Company when Mr. Peter Martin was there—we had not always sufficient coals to supply our customers and then we could not deliver them—the banking account for expenses was opened on November 14th, 1873—I am not aware that Mr. Peter Martin did not hand in two cheques in August, amounting to 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to open this account for expenses—I did not tell him that I could not open the account with those two cheques, because I owed Mr. Tilley, the contractor 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no recollection of handing him back one of the cheques for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and asking him to change it as it was payable to his order—will not swear that I did not—cannot tell you whether he cashed it for me, and whether I paid Tilley 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it—I paid Tilley over 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070113"/>
               <p>did not retain the balance myself—I do not recollect handing him back the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque and telling him to pay the week's expenditure out of it—he is here—I do not remember whether the week's expenditure came to 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or whether he handed me back 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I did not open the account at the bank till November, because I did not think proper to do so—it was left to my discretion by the directors to open it when I pleased—I did not use the two cheques to open the account in August, because Mr. Martin was about to leave the depot—I kept the money because it was required to pay the expenses of the depot; I kept the balance in hand—the weekly sheets were made up from Thursday morning to Wednesday evening, and I generally come on Thursday or Friday morning to examine the sheets—I used to pay Martin the amount of the expenditure sheet while he was there, and when he received the cheque on the following Wednesday, he sometimes handed it to me—he left the depot to go to the head office, and a man named Blake took his place—Blake was there more than three weeks—he got a small sum to the bad; I can't say whether it was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he may have said that he had handed to me whatever amount he was wrong, but I don't remember it—how can I swear what I don't know anything about—there was no dispute between us as to whether he had handed it to me—if there had been I should have recollected it—there was a little arrear in Blake's account, but he did not say that it was through me, or that he had handed the sum to me—I never heard Rawlings say in my presence and Martin's, that owing to his having received no cheque from the office or cash from me—he had had to pay the men and trades people out of the money he had received for coal, but in my infirmity of deafness I cannot say—Martin is not deaf—I have given Rawlings papers authorising him to pay out of the accounts—I sanctioned his doing so when by any hitch I had not got the money—I did that twice, and you have got the two papers by which I sanctioned it—one was about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I cannot tell the amount of the other—that was not about the time I neglected to pay the 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the bank—it was before the banking account was opened, but I cannot say whether it was before I got the cheques in August.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I cannot fix any date for this affair with Martin, and the two cheques—if I had known you would ask me I would have refreshed my memory—it was during Mr. Martin's time, and the prisoner was not employed at Camberwell during Martin's time; he succeeded Blake—I did not think it prudent to open a banking account when there were charges at the depot—the account was opened on 4th November by 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being paid in, and it was always kept at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after the account was opened Rawlings always received sufficient to make up for his expenditure—it was opened in the name of Jones and Rawlings—I only gave Rawlings authority on two occasions to pay expenses out of money received.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jones that he had received no cheque, and that he had paid expenses amounting to 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd out of the coal money, Mr. Jones said "I will give you a receipt for the money, stating that the pay sheet will owe that amount of money"—this is the paper Jones handed to him, with his signature to it; this other paper is also in Jones's writing.

On Monday, 23rd March, I was on duty near the Victoria Theatre, Lambeth—I saw the prisoner throw a knife away, and I pursued her—she stopped when I got within about a dozen yards of her, and picked it up again 'and closed a blade—she had the knife in her left hand when I took her—she said she wished she had cut his throat.</p>
