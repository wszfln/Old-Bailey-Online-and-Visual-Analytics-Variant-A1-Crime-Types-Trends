(<hi rend="italic">In this affidavit the prisoner stated that he was not indebted to the plaintiff, that the promissory note for</hi> £500 <hi rend="italic">had never been presented to him for payment, and that the plaintiffs claim was barred by the Statute of Limitations; that he (the prisoner) had made the promissory note for the accommodation of the plaintiff without considera<lb/>tion, and he denied that the plaintiff was the holder for value, as at the time of making it and since he did not owe the plaintiff any money</hi>). The Master read it, and, then the summons was adjourned for me to consider what to do—at the second hearing an order was made that the whole amount should be paid into Court in seven days, and if not judgment with costs to be taxed—this judgment recites the order—the prisone was present when the affidavit was produced in the Master's room—I do not know his writing.</p>

               <p>in July, 1893—Mr. Grant has not been acting for Watson in any matters recently, that I am aware of—I have no knowledge of this pro<lb/>missory note, only that it was handed to me to issue a writ on it—when the affidavit was made in answer to the application under Order 14, the matter was adjourned, and a fresh affidavit in reply was sworn by Watson and by Grant—I attended the hearing before the Master when that fresh affidavit was used—the prisoner's solicitor was there, and he said that the prisoner was away somewhere—I don't think he said that these matters alleged in this fresh affidavit required explanation, and that he wanted an opportunity of consulting him; I will swear he did not—I suppose he told the Master his client was away, because he could not answer the affidavit in time—I believe he got the fresh affidavit just before the matter came on; I sent it as soon as I got it sworn—I think Mr. Fearn said something about the circumstances with regard to the dissolution not being within his knowledge—I cannot remember the exact words he used—the matters with regard to the business were known to Mr. Grant and Mr. Watson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 41, Norfolk Street, Strand—in 1887 the prisoner was a client of mine—he introduced Mr. Watson to me as a client—I think I had acted for the prisoner for a short time before the matter of the dissolution of the partnership—in 1887 I knew they were partners—for two or three months before the dissolution negotiations were going on—I acted for them in the dissolu<lb/>tion—I prepared this deed of dissolution and this assignment and release, which were signed on August 24th by the two parties in my office in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">The deeds of dissolution and release were read. The deed of dissolution recited that Letts was to carry on the business and pay Watson</hi> £500 <hi rend="italic">as his share of the business. The release stated that a valuation having been made of all moneys, stock, trade debts and other effects of the partnership, an the parties admitting that Watson's share of the business amounted to</hi> £500, <hi rend="italic">Watson agreed to execute the deed upon receipt from Letts of his not of hand for</hi> £500 <hi rend="italic">with</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">per cent, interest, and assign to Letts his share and interest, Letts to collect all debts owing, and discharge all liabilities due by the firm and to indemnify Watson</hi>)—am the attesting witness—I have no doubt the documents were read over to them—I had frequently seen them during the negotiations—on the day of the signing of the deed of dissolution this promissory note in the prisoner's writing was signed—the signatures on all three documents and on this affidavit the his—I believed I retained the promissory note—between that time and the time the action was brought I saw the prisoner several times—I spoke to him, more particularly about the payment of the interest on the pro<lb/>missory note—that may have been half a dozen times—he never paid me any interest up it; he used to shrug his shoulders and say, "I am not in a position yet to pay anything; as you know, I am only now in a berth"—he meant he was in a situation—he never suggested that he had made the promissory note for Watson's accommodation and without con<lb/>sideration, or that he did not owe the money—in 1893 Mr. Watson instructed me to bring an action upon the note—the writ in the action was issued on 15th August, 1893—I entrusted the service of the writ to one of my clerks—it was not served for some months, as the prisoner was not living at the address which I knew him at—after issuing the writ I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100005"/>
               <p>left the matter in Mr. Cooper's hands, and lie attended the summons and so on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When this writ was issued Watson owed me money for costs, nothing else—it was something under £100—the costs had been incurred before the dissolution, more than six years ago, and after—we had seen one another once or twice about it—I had not applied to him specifically for the money; I had not delivered a detailed bill and applied for payment—I knew him too well to be a gentleman who would pay if he could—I had not lent him money—at the time of the dissolution some of the business books were handed to us for the purpose of sueing—I never looked into them personally, and could not tell you what books they were, except that there were three—we have had those books from that day to this; we have never been applied to for them—I believe they were ledger, day-book, and cash-book—I never looked at them—it is not true that I knew this deed was a mere sham, and that the business was absolutely worthless; the suggestion is abso<lb/>lutely untrue—I did not know anything about the business; I was not to know it was worthless; it was not my business to know—I did not know that months before the dissolution no business had been done; I believed that business had been done, because the prisoner suggested that new money should be introduced into it, as it was a developing business, and I can produce a letter to corroborate that—I may have been at the business premises once; I am not quite sure; it is seven years ago—I don't believe any executions were put into the place before the dissolution—I don't know how many times the landlord had distrained for rent—I think I heard once something about the landlord, but I certainly did not hear that he had been in several times—I was only engaged for two months before the dissolution—I do not know the landlord—I did not know that he took the furniture for the rent; or that when executions where put in they were withdrawn because there was nothing to take—I do not believe the landlord took the furniture till after the dissolution—I never saw the banking account—I had no knowledge of the condition of this business got from the books—I think it ceased to exist some months after the dissolution; I cannot fix the time at all—I speak to the best of my belief—I do not know that the landlord had possession of the premises in August—I had no actual knowledge of the financial position of the business, except from what the parties told me, and that Mr. Watson had put in something like £1,100, I think—I never saw the pass book—the suggestion is absolutely untrue that this was not a real deed of dissolution—I cannot tell who made the valuation; the parties agreed between them; we were discussing it for two months—I never saw a valuation-the parties went into the figures and did it themselves, so far as I know—it was my suggestion that the books should be gone through and a statement got out, and Mr. Moody called on me at the instance of the partners—the deed recites that a valuation has been made of all the moneys, stock-in-trade, and so on—I took no steps to ascertain, what money was at the bank—the parties themselves went into the figures, as far as I know, at my suggestion, and agreed then—it was my suggestion that a third person should be employed, but they saved the ex<lb/>pense and went into the matter themselves—I cannot say what the stock-in trade was—I do not know that there was nothing on the premises</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100006"/>
               <p>—they may have been stationers as well as printers and publishers—I kept no memorandum showing what the money and what the stock-in-trade was; I took it from instructions—I was seeing them pretty well every day at that time—the books came into my possession afterwards, to take action on certain debts due to the firm, not at the time of the dis<lb/>solution—I recovered some debts; I cannot tell you how much; we retained money—I am not sure the prisoner did not have some, but considerable sums were due to us for costs for actions brought against Mr. Watson and the prisoner before and after the dissolution—the deed was not an answer to them so far as Mr. Watson was concerned; they could not dissolve the partnership and denude themselves of all liability—I don't think more than three actions were brought after the dissolution; we successfully defended in two cases—I don't believe we allowed judgment to go against Mr. Watson—probably a dozen actions were brought on behalf of the firm; I cannot tell you how much was recovered—we can send for our ledger, which would show how much we re<lb/>covered and passed to the credit of A. W. Letts and Co.—I cannot remember how soon after the dissolution I knew that the prisoner was in employment, several months—I have asked him about six times for the money—two or three times of the six times were in the Strand; once in Queen Victoria Street, and at my office; I cannot tell you the date I asked him at my office—I acted for him for some time after that—I asked him for the money several times within a period of two years afterwards—I saw him at the Lancaster Club in the Savoy—we had a conversation—I did not tell him I had that promissory note, and that he could have it for £50—we spoke about the promissory note; I don't think I mentioned it first—probably I told him I had it—I had it—it had been endorsed to me generally; I could not negotiate or deal with it—I got Watson's endorsement at the time of the partnership deed; the whole thing took place together—I did not know that the prisoner was in employment from some months after the transaction till now—after some time he seemed to keep out of my way, and I had no opportu<lb/>nity of inquiring—a few months after I heard he was in employment I do not know where he is employed now—I don't think I ever inquired—I knew his father lived at St. Ann's Vicarage, Stamford Hill; he is the vicar there, and has lived there all these years—this writ was not left there, I think; I think it was served at his own residence—I don't think I wrote to his father's house; I won't say for certain—his solicitor called on me after I issued the writ—I object to give our con<lb/>versation, as, at his suggestion, it was to be strictly without prejudice—I think we have made inquiries where he is, and as to his position to pay the money under the judgment—before applying for a summons I wrote him this letter, asking for an explanation. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was read. It called on the prisoner for an explanation of the statements in his affidavit, and stated that if the explanation were not satisfactory they would have to take steps</hi>)—I wanted to know whether the prisoner was in a position to ex<lb/>plain the statements contained in his affidavit, which had taken us altogether by surprise—according to us it was a tissue of lies, but he might have refreshed his memory in the meantime, and tried to excuse himself—nothing passed between me and my client with regard to getting money by means of a summons at the Police-court</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100007"/>
               <p>—I have heard of such a thing being done—I received this reply to my letter. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the witness acted for both parties when the deed of dissolution was drawn up; that the prisoner did not remember any valuation being made, and that as at the time of dissolution the business was moribund, and the capital practically lost, the prisoner was under the impression that he got no consideration for the promissory note for</hi> £500)—the statement that the business was moribund is untrue; it is only the statement of the solicitor who is now acting for him—I have not since that letter seen the man who was in the firm's employment, or the landlord—I was a party to the swearing of the information, as I was a witness to the deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After the dissolution the prisoner was seeking a new partner—this is the letter the prisoner wrote me on 28th June, 1887, two months before the dissolution. (<hi rend="italic">This confirmed the offer he had made to let Watson give up his share in the business and receive</hi> £500, <hi rend="italic">Letts taking over all liabilities and assets; or if Watson preferred to remain as a sleeping partner, Letts would pay him</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">per cent, of the net profits; and it stated that it was to be clearly understood that Watson was not to have any legal claim on Letts or the business for any sum until Watson could clearly show that Letts or the business could pay him the full amount with-out damaging the business</hi>)—in drawing up the deed of dissolution I got the figure £500 from both partners—the prisoner was the acting partner, and appeared to understand the business—I never heard, till the prisoner was at the Police-court, a suggestion that this deed was not intended to be a real deed—the prisoner was represented by Counsel at the Police-court, and we caused inquiries to be made as to his ability to pay—I think that was after judgment was obtained—I cannot say that I made inquiries before the writ was issued and served as to his ability to pay; Mr. Watson had thrown the responsibility on me—I should think my conversation with the prisoner at the Lancaster Club was in 1888—only he and I were present—he referred to the subject matter of the promissory note, and put it to me that as he was not now in a posi<lb/>tion to pay the principal moneys, would I use my influence with Mr. Watson to get him to take £50 in discharge of it—I said that I thought the proposition was too absurd—I don't think I ever submitted it to Mr. Watson—this is our ledger for County Court work at that period—there is no truth in the suggestion that I took out a summons at the Police-court in order to get money, or that Mr. Watson instructed me to do so.</p>

               <p>have no recollection—we talked of it for some months—I went to Mr. Grant as my solicitor—I believe Mr. Letts had been to him before; I am not certain—Mr. Letts introduced me to Mr. Grant, and he acted in the dissolution for both parties—I have been with Mr. Letts to see him—I believe Mr. Grant drew up the instruction, and we agreed to it—I signed this deed of dissolution on 24th August, and the assignment, too—I had agreed to pay £500 as my share—Letts agreed to give me a note of hand for £500 and £1,000 In cash, and I agreed to take it—he had not the cash, I suppose, to give me, and he gave me that note—the £500 was for my share of the business—the promissory note was not made for my ac<lb/>commodation—I don't know what the endorsement on it was—I endorsed it generally; I left it with Mr. Grant; he continued to be my solicitor—I saw him several times from time to time between 1887 and 1893, when the action was brought—I think I only saw Letts twice or three times—in 1893 I instructed Mr. Grant to bring an action—on 17th August, 1894, I swore an affidavit; this is it—I was the holder of the promissory note; I suppose it was for value—at the time of the making of the note Letts owed me £500.</p>

I arrested the prisoner at 11 a.m. at Christian Street, Commercial Road, on the information of Israel Sanderwick and Frederick Fraser—the prisoner said he could not speak English, would I interpret to him what Sanderwick said?—I did so—I read Sander<lb/>wick's statement to him; it was as follows "About 11 a.m. a countryman of mine (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) came to my house, 21, Filbert Street, with a watch, and said, How much is that watch worth? I said, "25s.; he said, I have paid a deposit on it, but the man wants 27s. for it; he then went away; on Tuesday, 16th, at 6 p.m., I was at 21, Greenfield Street. The prisoner came and said, 'Will you buy this ticket, as I have pawned the watch I showed you yesterday, as I require the money urgently?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100015"/>
               <p>I asked where it was pawned, and he replied, 'at Mr. Fisher's, in Com<lb/>mercial Road, for 8s.; the prisoner then said, 'if you will give me 8s. for the ticket you can get the watch out of pawn when you like.' I then gave him 8s. for the ticket; about six p.m., on the 14th, I went to Mr. Fisher's to get the watch out of pawn. Mrs. Fisher endorsed the ticket, and gave it up on affidavit."—Then came the statement of Frederick Fisher, assistant pawnbroker—I read that, and interpreted it to him: "About 8.30 a.m. on the 14th November the prisoner came to my shop, 116, Commercial Road, and informed me that he was made drunk or drugged, and robbed of the ticket of his watch, and he applied to me for a declara<lb/>tion form for an affidavit, which was granted by the Magistrate at Thames Police-court; the prisoner brought back the declaration form; he asked whether he would require to take the watch out of pawn at the same time; the prisoner said, 'No, I will pay the interest and take a new ticket"—I then told him I should take him into custody on the charge—he replied, "All right, all right"—at the station he was told that he would be detained for perjury and obtaining money by false pretences—he said, "All right, I will stop here"—when I read the charge to him he made no answer—on the way to the Police-court he said, "Well, if I get a few months I suppose I shall have to do it and put up with it"—he said that in English.</p>

I am assistant to Louisa Funnell Fisher, pawn-broker—on 13th November the prisoner pledged a watch for 8s. in the name of John Jacobs, 13, Princes Square—I issued a pawn-ticket, No. 1720—I had seen the prisoner before; I knew his face well—on the 14th the prisoner came again, about 8.30 a.m., and said he had lost his pawnticket, and it must have been stolen from him—he then said he had been made drunk, and the ticket had been stolen from him in the club—he asked for a form of declaration, which I gave him—about nine he brought it back, and asked for a new ticket—he paid the interest, and had a new ticket—this is the declaration; I saw him make a X on it, in the shop—he spoke in Yeddish—on the first occasion he brought a little girl with him—she said the same as he did, that he had had the ticket stolen from him—he spoke a little English; I could understand what he said without an interpreter—the watch was worth about 17s. or 18s.—this is the second ticket I gave him, No. 1877.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder living at 42, Oxford Road, Baling—on Sunday night, November 25th, about live or ten minutes to eleven, I was in Brunswick Place when the prisoner and four others came up and asked me to pay for drink—I said, No, I was in a hurry, I wanted to get home—they said if I did not pay for drink they would make me—they surrounded me; I felt a hand in my pocket; another one had his arm round my waist, and another had his arm round my neck—then I received a blow on the temple, and one on the forehead, and one on the nose—the second blow on the temple stunned me, and I fell down—when I was on the ground several men were kneeling over me searching and rifling my pockets and taking possession of all I had—I had 13s. or 14s. in my pocket—I was kicked on different parts of my body—I became insensible—I am certain the prisoner was in the company of the men when they asked me for drink—I was taken to the station and my wounds were dressed—when I came to myself I felt in my pockets and missed all my 13s. or 14s.—about four or five next morning I saw the prisoner at the station by himself and I recognised him as one of the men who assaulted me—I am in fairly good health now, but I am not in such good health as I was before this took place—I was the worse for drink on this night—besides my money I missed two keys and a silver scarfpin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-laster—I live at 15, Simon Street, Bethnal Green—on Sunday night, 25th November, I was in Brunswick Place, which leads from Pitfield Street to City Road, and I saw the prosecutor being molested by three or four lads, one of whom took some instrument or other from his inside pocket and struck the prosecutor about the head and face—the prosecutor fell—two men went on to the ground with him,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100018"/>
               <p>and shortly after they ran away—the prisoner was one of them—I halloaed out—a policeman came up, and I said something to him—I did not lose sight of the prisoner—I afterwards saw him in custody—I went and fetched an ambulance, and the prosecutor was taken to the station—he was insensible, and bleeding very much—I am quite sure the prisoner was one of the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prosecutor was attacked a few yards from the public-house—two men ran towards Pitfield Street and two towards City Road—the prisoner was one of the two who went towards City Road—I saw two men kneeling over the prosecutor when he was on the ground—they both ran off in the same direction, towards the City Road—I was near the City Road end of Brunswick Place, and they passed me; one was the prisoner—the second two, who were kneeling down, got away—I saw the policeman coming down with the man in custody—I did not actually see him stop either of the men—they did not get as far as the end of Brunswick Place—to the best of my belief, the prisoner was under the influence of drink—I did not hear him say that he had just come up and went to look at the man on the ground—since his committal for trial he has been on bail—I do not know that he has been a stall-keeper for ten years in that neighbourhood—my mother lives in that neighbourhood, and I know it very well—I have seen the prisoner at a stall there, I cannot say whether he keeps it; I believe he is a very respectable man—I believe for three or four years I have seen him at the stall.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not see the prisoner before the prosecutor was knocked down—I first noticed him as he and another ran by me—the only thing I knew him by was his dress—as far as I know I believe he has been misled into it by a gang—I should think he got about thirty yards from me before the policeman caught him—it was 11 15 or 11.20 when it took place; no one came out of the public-house at that time so far as I know—the prisoner was one of the two men who ran towards the City Road.</p>

I was on duty on Sunday night, 25th Novem<lb/>ber, near Brunswick Place—I heard a noise, and ran in the direction of it, and saw a crowd of nine or ten, who ran away—I next saw two men get up from what appeared to be a man, and run towards the City Road—I went and saw the prisoner, who was leaning over the feet of the man, get up and run away towards the City Road—I caught him after chasing him for twelve or fifteen yards, and brought him back—I asked him what he was doing; he said, "I will come back with you, but I did not do any<lb/>thing"—I saw the prosecutor there lying insensible on the pavement in a pool of blood—I sent Bevan for an ambulance, and took the prosecutor on it to the station—I sent for a doctor, who dressed the prosecutor's wounds—the prisoner was picked out by prosecutor the next day, and by Bevan the same night—the prosecutor was insensible from 11.20 or 11.30 till five a.m.—the men I saw stooping over the prosecutor were from ten to fifteen yards from me when I first saw them—two of them got away before the prisoner got up—the prisoner was standing at the man's feet, and there was the difference of the length of the prosecutor's body between the two men who escaped and the prisoner—I had to go twelve or fifteen yards before I caught the prisoner; he was running.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 2, Kingsland Road—on this Sun<lb/>day night I was sent for to the Hoxton Station shortly after midnight to examine the prosecutor—I found him in a stunned condition, insensible—he was suffering from several injuries" about the head and face—he had several contused wounds on the bridge of his nose with fracture of the nasal bone; a wound on the forehead and another on the top of his head—he was suffering from shock, and also from drink—the injuries were inflicted with a loaded stick or blunt piece of iron—I think the injury to the nasal bone was too severe to have been caused by a kick—I think it must have been caused by some blunt instrument—he began to recover after half or three-quarters of an hour, but he still suffered from the effects of drink, and was not able to give an account of himself—I think a blow on the head would be quite sufficient to account for that if he had not been drinking.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">MEREDITH</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector G</hi>). I took the charge against the prisoner of being concerned, with others not in custody, in stealing about 14s. from Thomas Need, and also being concerned with assaulting him by striking him on the head with some blunt instrument—his reply was, "Me, Higgy, and Jack were there; I did not strike a blow, neither did I have any of his money."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not put into writing what the prisoner said—he did not say, "Me, Higgy, and Jack were together"—my deposition was read to and signed by me—he may have said, "Me, Higgy, and Jack were there together"—he said "there"—he was there from twelve till about five before he was charged, and he made several remarks at different times, but I took no notice of those—when the assault was being dealt with I said, "Who was with you?"—he did not then say, "Me, Higgy, and Jack were together"—at five o'clock, when the charge was formally entered on the charge-sheet, he made the observation about himself,</p>

               <p>Higgy, and Jack—he had not said anything before that as to whom he was with, but I had asked him in whose company he was.</p>

I understand English a little—I live at 4, Bath Court, Clerkenwell—I am an Italian, and am an artist's model—about eight on the evening of 12th November I was in the Crown public-house in Back Hill, Holborn, in the bagatelle-room—several others were there, amongst them the three prisoners—we were playing a game called <hi rend="italic">mora;</hi> it is played as "master and foreman," with the fingers—six of us were play<lb/>ing; the prisoners and two others—I don't know their names—we were playing for beer—Forti was foreman, and Bianci was master—we had had the beer on my side—the mister and foreman did what they liked with it—Mezza was not anything; he wanted two glasses of beer—I told him it was none of his business, because when he was master and foreman he had done as he liked—he said, "Well, I want two glasses of beer," and he got up from the seat, and was going out at the back, and I saw him leaning up against the bagatelle board in the room—as I was passing he called me something; I don't know what it was—I turned round, and asked him what he meant—we had a few words, and then he had his hand in his pockets, and he took it out, and up with his hand, and hit me on the head—I don't know whether it was a knife or a razor that he took put—I did not see what it was, but it cut my right hand—I stepped back, and looked at my hand and when I looked up he was gone—I heard someone struggling behind me, and as I went to turn round I heard Salvatore say that the three had been waiting for me for five or six days, and as he said that he hit me on the neck with a razor—I did not see him then, but as I finished to turn round I saw him running out of the door with the razor in his hand—I did not exactly see him strike me, he was right at the back of me—I was struck from behind the ear on the left side—for the moment I was still, I did not move at all—I asked someone that was near to take me to the hospital—the blood was squirting out from my throat like a fountain—I walked three or four yards and then had a cab—I remained in the hospital till the 5th of December.</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior partner of the firm of Durant and Co., silk brokers, at Dash wood House, New Broad Street—I have known the prisoner for a great many years—I knew him when he carried on business with Kilburn as Kilburn, Kershaw, and Co.—after that he carried on business as John Kershaw and Co., piece brokers, in Bishops<lb/>gate Street—in April, 1893, he came to see me at Dash wood House, and told me that he had got to the end of his tether, that the worry and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100028"/>
               <p>anxiety were more than he could bear any longer, and said he should be glad if I would take him and his business—I had some conversation with him about it—I asked him what the profits would be, and he said about £1,200 per annum—I asked him if that was nett—he said, "Yes"—I said then I would talk the matter over with my son Francis, and give him an answer in two or three days—my son Francis is engaged in the business at Dashwood House—he was not taking so active a part at that time, but since my illness he has been practically the sole person conducting the business—I talked over the matter with him, and a few days afterwards I saw the prisoner and asked him what was about the turnover of his business; and he told me, and I took down the figures he gave me for three years on this scrap of paper—I handed that to Mr. Perry for verification—nothing was said as to the assets or liabilities of Kershaw and Co.—having considered the matter with my son we agreed to take over the business, and my son instructed my solicitors, Messrs. Thorowgood, Tabor and Hardcastle, with regard to embodying in an agree<lb/>ment the terms upon which we intended to take the business over—I then sent out this circular to our customers. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that in addition to their present business they should future carry on the business of piece brokers, and that they had secured the services of Mr. John Kershaw as manager</hi>)—when this agreement was being prepared there was no question of the liabilities or assets of the prisoner's business—he asked me if I would lend Trim £500, and I sent for my cheque book, and wrote out the cheque, and gave it to him—I signed the agreement. (<hi rend="italic">The effect of this agreement was that the prisoner was to be manager for the prosecutors of the New Street business giving them his whole lime, and obeying all their reasonable commands; to render accounts and pay over all moneys and securities to them or their bankers; to receive an remuneration</hi> 50 <hi rend="italic">per cent, of the net profits; to render a balance-sheet on the</hi> 31<hi rend="italic">st December in each year; that he was not to enter into contracts or pledge their credit without their consent; and that if at the end of three years they desired to dismiss him he could carry on the business in his own name</hi>)—after his business was taken over our name was put up at New Street, a set of books was supplied, and all necessary steps taken for starting this business—I did not attend to it in any way; I was in the counting-house from the day it started—my son went there constantly—after the business was started in May my attention was drawn to the fact that he had barrowed £850 during that month—I spoke to Perry, my confidential clerk, and in the result I wrote to the prisoner—I got from him this letter, dated 8th July. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he was giving his serious attention to the</hi> £850 <hi rend="italic">standing against him; that he was getting rid of his old accounts as far as possible, and that now he had only the bank to settle with, and that he had reduced their account by</hi> £2,000 <hi rend="italic">since</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st May; that had he been able to yet in two accounts owing to him</hi>, £458 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> £500, <hi rend="italic">both of which he should get, tike above amount would not have been outstanding; that he asked his forbearance, and thanked him for his great kindness</hi>)—in November I was ill and away from business, and from that time my son took a very active part in the management of the Dashwood House business, and that occupied his time—at the time I employed the prisoner I had implicit confidence in him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known him about twenty-five years—I cannot say that everything I had heard of him combined to give me confidence in him—I don't think he had always during those twenty-five years borne quite the character of a honourable man—at the time of his brother's failure in 1874 or 1875, it was supposed that he knew what had been going on in that firm, though he was not a partner in it, but was employed by it—his brother, who was a partner, disappeared—from that time, in 1874, the prisoner had carried on business on his own account in London, first in partnership with Kilburn, and subsequently on his own account, in the same business in which his brother's old firm had been engaged—nothing more occurred, to ray knowledge, to impair my confi<lb/>dence in his honesty—we now carry on at Dashwood House the piece broker's business which belonged to John Kershaw and Co.—my son, Mr. Francis, and my partner, Mr. Cumming, manage it—there is no one in our employment in the same position as that which the prisoner held—we have had the whole business since September last, but I have not observed the benefit of it; we have made no profit—I cannot tell you if we have made any profit; I do not attend to the business at all—whatever the business may be worth we have the advantage of it—when the prisoner gave me figures I put them down, and I sent my clerk to examine them, and he said they were substantially correct; there was no material difference—as a business man all I asked was the annual turnover and the profits—it did not matter to me what the business owed—I was going to acquire the business, but not the debts, if there were any—I thought that a busi<lb/>ness that brought in £1,200 a year net profit, of which I should get half, would be a valuable property—I did not expect to pay anything for the business; we were to find all the capital required; it was to become our business from that time—I did not know at that time that the prisoner had creditors who were pressing him—he did not tell me there were business debts coming to be paid for which he wanted the £500—I did not think about whether he was not able to meet the liabilities of his business—I thought he had probably lost all his capital, and could not carry on business without it—I did not understand him to mean, when he told me he was at the end of the tether and could not go on longer, that he was not able to meet his business liabilities; I never gave it a thought as to whether he had business creditors or not, or, if he had, how those business creditors were to be paid off; it did not concern me—the result, according to my view, was that the business creditors would never have been paid, because I was not called on to find the capital for that, while I should have half the business perfectly clear—from May, 1893, till my illness in December Mr. Francis Durant used to go from Dashwood House to New Street—I did not pay much attention to where he went; I did not know when he was not in the counting house where he was; but he went to New Street every day to see how the business was going on—he was not acquainted with the business himself in the least—he went to learn it—he manages our business now; he is not a partner—I was ill in December—I have practically never come back to the active work of our business—I came hack to the office two or three days before Easter—the question of taking accounts of this New Street business never came before me at all until September this year—that matter I left to my partner</p>

               <p>and son—I left with them the agreement; they knew its terms—when I came back to business I did not ask why no balance-sheet had been prepared in December, 1893; I don't see how we could prepare it, as the books were in his custody—I don't say there would be any diffi<lb/>culty in carrying out the clause of the agreement as to making out a balance-sheet, by obtaining the books from the prisoner—the books were not under my control, but they were at my office, the rent of which we were paying, and the manager of which was our servant, and the books were kept in our name—we have four or five, or perhaps more, clerks and accountants in our business—I did not think there was any necessity for sending an accountant over to inspect the books—I was not there; but if I had been it would not have occurred to me to make out the balance-sheet; I should not have remembered there was such a stipulation in the agreement, I attached so little importance to it—I had nothing to do with fixing the terms of the agreement, beyond telling my son that I had agreed to half nett profits; I left it to my son—when the prisoner applied at our office for cheques, those applications were substantially never brought under my notice—I left it to Perry and my son—I cannot say whether my son would be at Dashwood House when those claims for cheques came in—Perry and my son would be responsible in this matter—I was not cognizant of the account kept in our Dashwood House books as against the piece goods department, I never troubled to look at it—I had nothing personally to do with the communications made to the prisoner between June and October, 1894—I authorised this prosecution, I cannot give the date.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of Durant and Company's business—I was a party to this agreement of 29th April, 1893—I instructed Mr. Tabor to prepare it—with regard to the New Street business about fifteen or sixteen sales were held every year—the entire manage<lb/>ment of the New Street branch was left to the prisoner—I had no know<lb/>ledge of this class of business before—I used to go there almost daily from the time it started, more with the idea of picking up how the business was done—I had nothing to do with the books; I never examined them—we act as brokers for piece goods between buyer and seller; we sell from one party to another—payment is usually made by the buyer within three months, sometimes before—goods can be taken away at any time, and when they are taken they must be paid for, but none need be taken away before three months—a deposit must be paid at the time, and then, if you want to take some away, you must pay for them when the sale is by public auction, all the goods are on show—when the purchase-money is paid, warrants are given—the prisoner did not sign cheques on behalf of the firm—after November, 1893, I ceased to attend at New Street, and devoted my attention to Dashwood House—when a year's trading had expired, by May, 1894, I gave instructions to Mr. Brewer, our cashier, with a view to preparing a balance-sheet of the branch—I did not receive that balance-sheet till about the beginning of June I think—I then received from Mr. Brewer what purported to be a balance-sheet of the year's trading, and also a profit-and-loss account for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100031"/>
               <p>the same period—these are the documents—they are in the prisoner's writing—I observed by the balance-sheet a debit balance of £6,500 against the branch—in the following August would be the prompt day—I should expect large amounts to be paid off then by buyers—advances would have been made to sellers, and they would be paid off by the buyers in August—I did not draw attention to it at the time, but waited till after the prompt in August, and then I gave Brewer instructions with regard to the indebtedness, and subsequently received from him a list in the prisoner's writing of the securities held by the branch, of the value of £2,897, and at that time the indebtedness of the branch to the business was about £4,000, I think, so that after the prompt day there was a de<lb/>ficiency of £14,31—I gave further instructions to Brewer, and subse<lb/>quently got another document in the prisoner's writing, purporting to be a list of debts due to the firm and of the securities held in respect of them, showing what debts were secured, and to what extent, and which were unsecured—in consequence of what Brewer told me I instructed Mr. Leake, an accountant, to examine the books at New Street—at the time I did that I told the prisoner that we could not understand his account, and he would make up his books to 31st August, and I should send an accountant to go through the accounts, and make out a balance-sheet for me—by the 26th September I had received from Mr. Leake this provisonal balance-sheet—on 26th September I sent for the prisoner and had an interview with him at Dash wood House—this document was before us—there is in it a suspense account, showing a total of £856—I took the prisoner into the cashier's room, when he arrived, and I said to him at once, "I am going to accuse you of having issued a false balance-sheet; I wish you to explain this suspense account"—he said he was unable to do so, and that if I would give him three weeks he would repay the money—the suspense account was the only item I referred to on that occasion—I said I should immediately have the name of the firm taken off the branch office at New Street, and that I should report the matter to Messrs. Durant and Co., and see what proceedings they would take, and then I told him he could go—I looked into the debtor's account of Mr. Leake's balance-sheet, and in consequence of what I saw there, I sent for the prisoner on 27th September—Mr. Tabor was present—I had this balance-sheet in front of me, and I put my finger on these debtors' accounts, and asked the prisoner as to these debts of Brunschweiler and Graham, whether those people really owed us the money—the prisoner said he could not tell me without his books—I said "It is nonsense; I insist on having an answer"—he then said they did not owe us the money—then I went to Bassoon's account, among others, and Salenger's, and I asked the prisoner if those people owed us money, and he said they did, and that we should be paid—the interview went on for some time, and then the prisoner came up to me and said, "You seem to think that I do not feel this position"—I said "I don't think about it at all; I only think you are a very wicked man; you can go"—Mr. Tabor, in the course of the interview, said to him, "Do you know you are making very serious admissions?" and I fancy the prisoner said, "Yes"; I understood, at all events, that he did—he also suggested again that if I would give him three weeks he would replace all the moneys, as on the former occasion—on 29th September, I think</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100032"/>
               <p>Saturday morning, I had the books removed early in the morning from the New Street office to our office, and our name was taken off the door, and since then it has not been up at that branch—since that time the business has been carried on at Dashwood House—I instructed Mr. Tabor to inquire into the matter; I believe the prisoner saw him the following day after our interview—subsequently I transferred the matter to Messrs. Wontner's hands—on September 29th we issued a circular to the trade declaring that the prisoner was no longer in our employment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the New Street place for several hours each day from May to November—there were there a clerks' room and a principals' room, where the prisoner and I sat together—the books were in that room so far as I know; I am not sure—I never saw them—I never noticed the prisoner making entries in them, or referring to them from May to November—I saw the persons who came in on business; very few came, but I heard what took place between the prisoner and those who did come—I never asked for any information—I went there to see how the business was conducted, and what sort of business it was—I talked to people and went to see some of the customers, and I have been to the docks to see different goods being sold, and see what they were like; that was the sort of inspection of the business which I was able to make—I knew there were payments to be made by the prisoner, and I knew he was making some payments on his own account; I presume they were payments on account of Kershaw and Co.; I knew his old accounts were going on, and that he had to make payments—I do not remember that he ever mentioned to me what sums of money would be required for particular dates—I do not remember his ever mentioning a sum of £3,000 for payments on a particular date; or his afterwards telling me that with the moneys that' were coming in £500 would be enough—I saw Mr. Brunschweiler several times while I was there—I do not remember his coming with regard to the payment of £610; I did not hear the conversation about it—I did not know there was a sum due from him to Kershaw and Co., and also a sum due to Durant and Co.—I know it was the prisoner's duty to take in to our cashier in the morn<lb/>ing a piece of paper for what cheques he required, and those cheques would be taken over to him in the afternoon—I don't think he conversed with me about those matters, and about the cheques he wanted—we used to talk together—I was not there till after eleven in the morning, and I was not long there—I always went to the other business place before going to New Street—I don't quite know what time the slips were brought in by the prisoner—they were brought in when he knew what cheques he wanted—he could not draw a cheque himself nor endorse one, so that all the cheques he wanted he had to go to Dashwood House for, specifying the amounts and the names, and the cheques he received were paid over to us—I did not know of his making up in the afternoon a list of the cheques he had received and paid—I may have been either at New Street or Dashwood House in the afternoon; I had the correspondence to do at Dashwood House—there are fifteen or sixteen sales a year—brokers make advances to sellers if they ask for it as a favour; it is not obligatory—it is the business custom of the broker to make advances to sellers—it is done if it is asked for; it is not usually asked for—it is usually part of a broker's business</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100033"/>
               <p>to advance money, and those advances would be repaid out of money coming from the buyers when the goods are delivered—I never heard of a broker advancing for the buyer the deposit upon goods—I believe it was early in June that the balance-sheet was given to me—I noticed that it was all in the prisoner's writing—it came through the office to me—I first asked him for an explanation of it after the prompt, after 30th August, nearly three months after it came to me—when I spoke to him about it I had before me the balance-sheet and the debts and securities accounts, so far as I know—I asked for most of the expla<lb/>nation through Brewer; it was not done directly—I first asked the prisoner about these accounts at the beginning of September, and asked him to make his books up to 31st August, and said I should instruct Mr. Leake to go through the books—Mr. Leake went through them, and got out a provisional balance-sheet to the end of August—the prisoner's balance-sheet went to the end of April; that was the only one we had I from him—I had his balance-sheet with me when I spoke to him—I think the prisoner had his own papers in his hands on the second occasion, the 27th—immediately after the 27th we transferred the business to Dash<lb/>wood House—he suggested that in three weeks he might be able to repay the money—the summons was taken out on 19th October—I know that on 18th October he was adjudicated bankrupt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I went to New Street I never looked into the books—he never suggested to me that he was paying his accounts with Durant and Co.'s moneys—I had not the slightest idea of it—he made no suggestion that a balance-sheet should be got at the end of December, 1893—the prosecution was hot in any way affected by the question of his paying the money in three weeks—we were not influenced in the slightest degree by his bankruptcy—we did not bring it about in any way—I did not hear of his going into bankruptcy or filing a petition till we got the bankruptcy papers—I think we laid an information on 16th—Messrs. Wontner had been consulted some days before that.</p>

               <p>produced to me this balance-sheet with a profit and loss account—looking at that I noticed that the nett profits appeared to be £750 6s. 1d.—his share of that would be £375—I said that he did not show where the other £375 was—he took the documents away and came back afterwards and suggested that the explanation was that the profits and loss which was put down at £1,361 should have been put down as £1,562—he then handed me what he called a stock account—handed those documents to Mr. Francis Durant, and he having looked at them waited till after the August prompt day; and then from instructions received from Mr. Francis Durant I asked the prisoner for a list of securities—he gave me this list showing securities at £2,897 against a very much large indebtedness of over £4,000—I asked him for an explanation of the difference between the value of the securities and the amount of our advances—in the result he gave me this document showing the debts on one side and the securities held by the firm on the other—it shows a deficiency of about £1,450—at that time the only documents that came into our possession were those with which he supplied us; we had not got the books, they were in the prisoners possession—I showed this list of debits and securities to Mr. Francis Durant, and I was present on September 10th when the prisoner was asked some questions with regard to the Sassoon's, Cole and Walker's, and Munsie's accounts, why those three firms should owe us money—he said they were deposits—I asked whether those deposits had been received from the buyers—he said, "Yes"—I said, "They have been received from the buyers and handed over to the sellers, they are no longer an asset"—he went away—I had no means of making a close examination of the document as I had no books—Mr. Francis continued the inquiry into the matter; he brought Mr. Leake into it, and in the result the books were brought from New Street on September 29th—after Durant and Co. took over the prisoner's business the first sale was held on 25th May—I find that Brunschweiler is debited in his account in the ledger with £303 for goods—on the other side, where cash payments are shown, there is no payment of £303 shown—I find the balance of £303 at the end of 1893 is carried on to the 1st January, 1894, and down to 1st May, when there is still that indebtedness of £303—the ledger is entirely made up of entries in the prisoner's writing—among the assets in his balance-sheet is a sum of £208 from Graham and Co.—on 2nd June a sum of £228 4s. 10d. is entered in the ledger as paid by Graham and Co—the entries on that side refer to payments made with' respect of goods, and the goods are shown on the other side—£228 15s. 2d. is shown as the balance at the end of that year, and the beginning of 1894 and down to 30th April as an asset—I drew a cheque myself for £228 4s. 10d. on 7th June, and it was given to him for Graham's amount in the ordinary course of business—it is entered in the ledger on 2nd June, but I drew it on the 7th—it is payable to order, and is en<lb/>dorsed by Graham—originally in his balance-sheet the prisoner showed Sassoon as debtor to the extent of £76 odd—Sassoons are sellers only, and ought to receive money instead of paying it—I find in the ledger an entry on September 8th of the payment of £76 9s. 7d.—when the account is worked out they are apparently, on the face of the account, debtors to Durant to the amount of £71 17s. 6d.—in the ledger, under date 8th September, there appears the entry of £110 19s. 7d., and on the other side</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100035"/>
               <p>I find the only goods in respect of that are on September 8th, £49 14s. 9d.—I drew the cheque myself, in the ordinary course of business, as the result of one of the slips supplied to me, to the order of Sassoon—it is en<lb/>dorsed by them, and has been paid through the bank—we did no business with Sassoon and Graham except through the prisoner—I find the ledger account of Salenger was, January 17th, £50—this is the cheque drawn in the same way to Salenger or order, and endorsed by him—it has been paid through the bank—that appears as an asset in the balance-sheet—we had no dealings with them from the head office—I find that the balance of the suspense account in the balance-sheet of May appears as an asset of £163 2s.—the suspense account, like the whole of the ledger, is in the prisoner's writing—the first four items amount to £40 14s. 5d., and the next four items make a total of £856 9s. 6d.—the cheques for three of those four items, £166 10s. 6d., £287 16s. 9d., and £281 2s. 3d., are in my writing, and were applied for in the ordinary course of business—the payees of two of those cheques are the National Bank of India, and the third is Hopkins—those amounts should not have appeared in the suspense account—on the credit side I see the entry, "Deposit Account, £460," and an entry before that of "G. Coley, £237 15s. 4d."—those two matters are transferred from one suspense account to another—they were genuine liabilities of the firm—the entry of them reduces the debit balance to £162—application was made on one of these slips in the ordinary course for a cheque for Kahn and Kahn for £506 0s. 3d.—the cheque was paid into their account at the London and County Bank—I find by Kahn and Kahn's account in our ledger that the amount due from Durant's was £385 0s. 3d. on 17th February—I find by the entry that three cash pay<lb/>ments make up the cheque for £506, £256, £128, and £120; the two former sums make up £385—on the other side is "Goods, £385"—I see an entry on the other side of £121 without any date; there is a pencil memoran<lb/>dum, "S. Account, folio 932," which is the folio of the suspense account—that balances Kahn and Kahn's account—that is the last item in the suspense account, which makes up the £897, and gives the material for arriving at what is the credit—on 21st February, 1894, the prisoner brought me a warrant for a case of silk, marked "W.P. 1,160"—he said, "Here is a warrant for a case of silk, which I have sold, and the prompt will be due on 10th May; will you let me have £100 advance?"—upon that warrant and his statement with regard to it he got a cheque for £100; I spoke to Mr. Francis Durant, and he agreed under the circum<lb/>stances to lend him £100 until 10th May—I spoke to him afterwards as to who the buyer was, and after some time I got the £100 back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The warrant was lodged as security; we got £100 back eventually after trouble, and the warrant was given up—I was the clerk who principally dealt with the piece goods department—the course of business was that every day the prisoner either came with or sent a slip of paper with the names of the firms for whom he wanted cheques; this is one of the slips—on having the slip I made out the cheques to the orders of the firms for whom the cheques were required, and entered them in a book, which is not here—all the amounts are in the ledger—they are postings from our cash book made from day to day—on the other side of the ledger are entries of cash we received—the ledger, and also the prisoner's monthly lists, would enable us to see from time to time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100036"/>
               <p>exactly how the cash account of Durant with the piece goods department stood—these are the lists which the prisoner supplied us with every month showing the cheques that had been received, and cheques we had paid to sellers, and cheques he had paid to us which he had received from buyers—from May 31st to June 30th he brought these accounts of the transac<lb/>tions between Durant and the piece goods department, and in our own books we had the means of checking them—Mr. Perry checked then month by month—I cannot say positively whether there was any com<lb/>plaint of the entries—we had many lists of securities, not monthly—we kept no account of the securities in our own book—we kept the securities themselves, and the lists he furnished us with—at any time we could have compared the lists with the securities—whenever we received a list we compared it with the securities—a monthly check of all the accounts passed before us, not of all the business, but of all the cash that went out and came in—I can hardly give the opinion that the condition of things dis<lb/>closed by his books is correctly represented by his balance-sheet; the figures that are in his books are in the balance-sheet—I said before the Magistrate, "If a stranger had gone to those books to make up that balance-sheet he would have put into it all the items that have been put into it"—I merely expressed my opinion that that balance-sheet was drawn up correctly; I am not an accountant—I said, "The evidence I have given here to-day is the result of my examination of Mr. Kershaw's own entries"—I verified them by this ledger—it was from his own entries that I gave evidence with regard to the different items—I believe that no cheque I have given to the prisoner has not been recorded in his accounts and lists—he put on papers which I retained the amount of the cheque, and the name of the person in whose name he wanted it drawn, and I made it out to the order of that firm, and kept a note in our books of the issuing of the cheque—I have had the list all checked, and they were correct—Graham's cheque for £228 4s. 10d. is entered in my list, and the prisoner's list, and in the ledger he kept—with regard to the balance-sheet I only called attention to the £1,361, because the figures would not tally—the figures shown on that balance-sheet would make out that our firm were only to get £175, while the prisoner got £375—I called attention to that, and he said there was a mistake of £200—the account from which the £1,361 purports to be taken is in this ledger—according to the figures it ought to be £1,562—no doubt it was by a mistake in carrying out the figures from his ledger that he made that mistake of £200—the question about that was raised the day after the balance-sheet was put before me, I think—I think I never asked the prisoner anything about the balance sheet—I did ask for more information—I got the list of securities; I saw that the warrants stated on it were in our possession—I next asked the prisoner for another document early in September, and then the account showing the debts and securities was given to me—it was in that list that the three items, Sassoon, Cole, and Walker Munsie, were—Walker Munsie's account was £226; I asked why they should be owing us money—he said they were deposits—I said, "Very well, have we received these deposits from the buyers?"—he said, "Yes"—I saw, "Then, if we have received deposits from the buyer, and handed then over to the seller, they are no longer an asset"—I cannot tell you if Walker Munsie were debtors at that time; I do not say that entry is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100037"/>
               <p>wrong—so far as I know the entry "Cole, £388," is correct—I might have judged who were sellers and who were buyers, but I never had any notice which they were—Mr. Francis was frequently at New Street—people from whom we received money we should consider buyers, and people to whom we paid money sellers, but there was nothing to show what any particular firms were; sometimes they might be buyers and sometimes sellers—we had one ledger for bought and sold, not separate ledgers.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Thorowgood, Tabor, and Hardcastle, solicitors—on September 27th I attended at Dashwood House—I saw in the partners' room Mr. Francis Durant and Mr. Cumming sitting at one table, and the prisoner in the middle of the room—I sat at another table—Mr. Francis Durant had before him a balance-sheet—he pointed to several items in it (Brunschweiler, Graham, and Co., and Sassoon's, and others), and called the prisoner's attention to them, and asked him as to certain of them, whether the money was owing or not—the prisoner said he could not say without looking at the books—Mr. Francis Durant said that was absurd—the prisoner got up from his seat and came to the table, and looked more closely at the balance-sheet, and Francis Durant pointed to other items, and the prisoner said, "These are not owing"—Mr. Durant said, "How can you say some are owing and some are not without giving the excuse of looking at your books?" and then the prisoner said the money was not owing, and that he had received the money, and that he intended to replace it, but that times had been so bad he had not been able to do so—I walked up to the table, and looked at the items, and said to the prisoner, "Do you understand the serious position in which you are placing yourself by these admissions?"—he bowed—I said the matter was placed in my hands, and I could not form any hasty conclusion; I should like to investigate the matter further, and I asked him to come and see me next day at three o'clock—he came and went into it, and he practically denied everything he had admitted the day before—he asked me not to repeat what he said in confidence, as he did not wish to give himself away.</p>

I am a cashier in Mr. Durant's employment—I have been forty-eight years with them—several times during April, 1893, I saw the prisoner at the office when he came there to see Mr. Durant, senior, who afterwards spoke to me about checking the turn-over in the I cash-book—I went to New Street and did so, taking the figures which the prisoner had given Mr. Durant—I went over month by month with the prisoner at his office, and found the figures he had given were fairly correct—I drew this cheque for £500, which Mr. Durant signed and gave to the prisoner on April 25th—on May 4th, after the business was taken over, the prisoner spoke to me about wanting an advance of £250 till May 26th—he had a cheque for it on that day—on May 19th he had £150, which he said he would pay within a week—after that he spoke about wanting £500, and I spoke to Mr. Durant about it, and I went to the prisoner's office to tell him he did not understand that he had given those securities, as he understood that sellers, if they had advances, gave warrants in the same way that buyers would if they cleared—the prisoner said that was a thin quite distinct from the piece goods; that he found the day before he should be £500 short, and he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant, of 25, Abchurch Lane—for some time past I have audited Durant and Co.'s books—on 13th September I received instructions from Mr. Francis Durant with these exhibits, and on the 15th, in consequence of these instructions, I went to 15, New Street, and saw the prisoner—I spent some days in examining the books, and I took notes of certain things that seemed to require explanation, as I could not understand them—I saw the prisoner several times, and occasionally asked him questions—I asked him whether the arrangement was that any of the assets and liabilities of his old busi<lb/>ness were to be taken over, and he said, "No, it has nothing whatever to do with the old business"—on 21st September I asked him for an explana<lb/>tion of the suspense account, and whether it represented an asset, and also as to the entries on the credit side, but the prisoner said he would go into the assets with me in detail when I had prepared my provisional balance-sheet—on 24th September he saw my provisional balance-sheet—he said, as to Brunschweiler's account, £303, that that was due from them, and was an asset—I said, looking at the ledger, "Is that asset the amount which appears to the debit of the ledger account?" it is the first entry, as far back as 1893—he said, "That is the same amount"—I marked down some of his answers—he said, with regard to Brunschweiler, that it was an unsecured debt, and was a good asset—I said it was a very old debt—I did not understand it, but he assured me it was all right—I went down the list of debtors with him—I referred to Graham and Co., and he said that was an unsecured debt, but properly included among the list of debtors as an asset—I referred to the entry in the ledger; that was June, 1893—I said, "Here is the amount, dated June, 1893; is that the amount brought down as owing at the present time?"—he said, "It is the amount, yes"—he said, as to Salenger's, £50, that was an unsecured debt—the ledger before me showed apparently that the debt was contracted on 17th June, 1894—the prisoner said, "Salenger will pay interest at 5 per cent on that; it is an unsecured debt"—I drew attention to Sassoon's account; they in the ledger appeared debited with £71 16s. 6d.—I asked if it was due—he said it was—it was on unsecured debt, and would be settled on 19th October prompt; that was, I believe, a date when other amounts were falling due in connection with a certain sale—I asked him for an ex<lb/>planation of suspense account No. 2 in the ledger, and he answered, "I will explain it to Mr. Francis Durant"—I asked him about the first four items in the account, and he explained that they represented cash received</p>

               <p>by him in the ordinary course of business, and which he had expended on the business expenses instead of paying it into the head office—I asked him for the petty cash book in which I thought the expenditure would appear, and he said he had not got it for the moment, but he would look it up—afterwards I understood he had mislaid it, and could not find it—I should say that those items should not appear in the suspense account, they would go in the ordinary course among the trade expenses to reduce the profit of the year's trading—the three items that appear on the other side of the account, reducing the suspense balance, were liabilities so far as I could see from the books—there was no reason why they should be inserted in the suspense account to reduce the amount—if they had not been inserted the amount in the balance-sheet would stand at about £856, after eliminating the £40 which I was told was for business expenses—that was the amount I inserted in my balance-sheet—it seems to me it should have been so inserted in my balance-sheet he rendered, but in fact it was inserted as £162, because by introducing those actual liabilities he concealed the greater part of what seemed to me to be fictitious assets—I showed the prisoner his statement of securities and debts—he said "They should not have given that to you; that is nothing"—on the face of the ledger I cannot see anything to account for the entry Brun<lb/>schweiler £54—I have never found any receipts for that figure—Graham's amount douse not appear in the books—I find in the statement of debts and securities as an asset of the firm "interest account £106"—no such amount was due to the firm for interest according to the books.</p>

Graham and Co., East India merchants—I had transactions for that firm with the prisoner when he traded as John Kershaw and Co., before May, 1893, and after that with Durant and Co.—we were sellers—the prisoner while carrying on his own business had sold for us goods in October, 1891, on which £188 6s. 1d. was due to us—that should have been paid within three months according to the usual terms—in March, 1893, he sold goods for us which left him indebted to us £188 13s. 9d., and he owed us altogether £228 4s. 10d. at the beginning of June, 1893—on 7th June we were paid this cheque for £228 4s. 10d.—that did not represent any transaction we had had with Durant and Co.—we got statements and gave a receipt to the prisoner personally—there was no ground for suggesting that we owed Durant and Co. £228, or any sum—I think in September, this year, we were applied to for the money.</p>

Smith has been a neighbour of mine some time—I always knew him as a respectable man—I did not tell him that Jinks was my brother—I spoke of him as my stepbrother, and I believe Smith knew that as long ago as April last—he went by the name of Adams at that time, and till the end of October—the cob was offered to me, and I said I could not afford it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fish curer, of 134, Elan Street, Limehouse—on October 30th, about 10.30, I was at the Gallant Hussars, and Smith pulled up with a horse and cart, and asked the landlord to come and see them—he said he had given £16 10s. for the horse—I said, "How much will you take for it?"—he said, "The harness also belongs to me; I will take £20 for the horse and harness"—I offered him £19—he said, "No; £20"—I am not a judge of horses; that was the first I had ever bought—he said he would see me in the morning, and see if we could come to an arrangement—next morning I went to the public-house with Mr.</p>

               <p>Smith and Mr. Mitchell, and said, "Now, what about that horse?"—he said, "I have told you £20"—I said, "Say £19"—he got the horse out, and ran him about, and I bought him for £19 15s., and went back into his house, and paid the money—he said, "You can have the receipt made out for £22, if you like"—I said, "Make my receipt for what I give you," and handed him the money, had a drink, and went out—on the Friday night I said, "Who did you buy that horse of?"—he said, of Mr. Adams's brother, who keeps the beerhouse close to him, and if anything was to happen I should have my money returned—he said that on both occasions—I said, "I hope I am dealing with a straightforward, honest man"—he said, "Yes; you are"—Fulcher afterwards came to me, and I gave up the cob to him, and I went to Smith and told him it was a stolen horse, but did not tell him what the detective had told me—he went with me and saw my father-in-law—the detective had not come then—he said, "You will have to give it up"—I said, "I gave you £19 15s. for it"—he said, "I have not got the money, you shall hold my cab as security," and I have got it still.</p>

On October 25th I accompanied Mr. Bush to his stable, and he showed me a bay mare which answered the descrip<lb/>tion of a horse stolen at Harrow, and Thompson, the prosecutor's coach<lb/>man, identified her, and I handed her over—Smith was there, and said that he bought her of a man known to him as Adams, for £20, and showed me the receipt—on November 23rd I took Ashton at Sugar Loaf Walk, Bethnal Green—I said I was a police officer, and was going to take him in custody for stealing some horses—he said, "Well, I was only employed by two men, Foster and Williams, or Adams; I might be very useful to you later"—we went to the station; he refused his name and address but eventually gave it and said he withheld it because his mother was ill—Foster was at the Court-house, Edgware, and Ashton was put with him—he spoke to Smith on the platform and said, "Halloa, Fred, are you here?" and Adams said in their hearing, "That is two of the men."</p>

On October 27th I went to Mr. Bush's and saw the horse—Smith was there, and Mr. Bush said, "That is the man I bought the horse of"—Smith said, "That is quite correct, I bought it of two men; one keeps a beer-house; I thought it was straight"—I went to Arbour Square and saw the property handed to the coachman—on October 8th I went to the Salisbury public-house and told Smith I should take him for being concerned with others in stealing a horse and cart and a set of harness—he said, "What about Percival and Bush?"—I said, "I have no doubt they will be at the station by the time we arrive"—he said, "I bought the horse knowing that his brother kept a house next door, and I believed it was all right."</p>

On November 12th, at 6.15 p.m., I was on duty with a constable in Camomile Street, and saw the prisoners and other men—George Hawkins came up with a horse, and van outside the Salisbury Anns—I was watching something else in the house; it was a very wet night; George Hawkins was walking about, and looking about in an anxious way, which attracted my suspicions—I went in a warehouse to get out of his way—he went away a few minutes before seven, returned, gave a signal, a van came up, and three men commenced putting lead from an unfinished building into the van; 12 cwt. was put in in less than five minutes—I got into a dark door-way, and saw George Hawkins walk towards the van; I stopped him in Houndstitch, and said, "I am a police officer; what have you got in the van?"—he said, "I don't know; I am hired to do the job"—I told him to get down—he refused, and I pulled him down—he struggled, and I had to call for assistance—he was taken to the station—I cautioned him that I should have to repeat what he said—he said that he was hired by his brother James, and gave his address, and also the address of his brother Joseph—he said he was playing at skittles all day, and was asked to remove some coal, and thought this was a similar job—I said, "I suppose it was not"—he said, "No, it looks more serious"—I took Joseph Hawkins next day, and Goodwin surrendered, saving that he knew I was after him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tanner and general manufacturer, of 292, Kingsland Road, London, and Sittingbourne, in Kent—the prisoner has been a customer of mine three or four years, and got in my debt £1,100 for goods and money, and there were £300 worth of bills dishonoured—I issued a writ, got judgment, and put in an execution, but instead of pushing the judgment we executed this agreement, and I with-drew the Sheriff—it is dated September 26th and signed by us both, and by it, for the consideration of £300, he assigns to me the lease and stock of 292, Kingsland Road—I arranged that he was to become manager of the manufactory at £3 a week—he was to pay the workmen their wages on Saturday and come to me on Friday with the wages-sheet to show me the amount of money required, including Saturday—I had no London banking account then, I banked at the London and County at Sitting-bourne—the prisoner had told me in a letter that his account was closed, but I was aware from my past transactions that the London and South-Western Bank treated my cheques as cash—I went to the prisoner's bank with him, the London and South-Western, and the manager said that he owed them £10; I wrote a cheque for it, and opened a fresh account in my own name, and the Sittingbourne cheques would be honoured there—that was about the 26th—the name of the firm at Kingsland was Powell and Co., but I altered the facia about October 16th to "The Kingsland Boot Manufacturing Company"—on Friday night, November 3rd, the prisoner presented this wages sheet, amounting to £16 6s. 11d.—he told me that in addition to the wages there were some trifling expenses, and that £2 10s. was due to Powell and Co., which ought to be paid, for writing up the name—I gave him a cheque for £18 18s. 1d.—there was another little sheet, containing some petty cash, which made up the difference—this cheque has gone through my bank, and has been returned as honoured—I asked the prisoner for Powell's account—he said, "I have not got one," and the matter passed from my mind till Nuttrell, who is in my service, gave me this receipt on the 19th, from Powell and Co., for £2 10s., purporting to be nettled on November 2nd—there is a dash under the 10s., showing that was £2 originally, and not £2 10s.—I recognised the signature, "Powell and Co.," and the figures as the prisoner's writing—before Nuttall brought me the receipt I had spoken to the prisoner about other matters, and the police had seen him—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), dated November 7th, 1894, "Pay Powell and Co., or Order," is in the prisoner's writing, and the endorsement, "Powell and Co." is his—it was passed through the bank and cancelled—on 20th November I asked the prisoner for an explanation of the altered account; Finnucane was with me—the prisoner said, "I altered the receipt because it ought to have been £2 10s."—I believe he said he had paid it—the detective asked him to say definitely who signed it—he said, "I signed it; I am in the habit of doing so"—I understood him to say that he was in the habit</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Before I took over the assignment of the prisoner's business I had been assisting him largely—he had not been assisting me—I commenced to deal with him about 1891, and very soon after December, 1891, he commenced to sign bills—I supplied him with leather and money and he supplied me with boots—we had cross, accounts—the account between us between April 2nd, 1891, and August 3rd, 1894, amounted to, I think, £1,700—it is extremely probable that he gave me bills during the same period for an amount exceeding £4,000, but I totally deny that any of them were for my accommodation—I had to renew bills constantly at his request—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the statements of the business before I took it over—I received various customers' bills, which are included in the £1,700—I do not think I was paid any cash by the prisoner; not £100 in cash the whole time—there were occasional cheques—I do not mean to tell the Jury I allowed him to continue my debtor in £1,700; it was £1,100—I do not admit that a considerable amount of cash was paid me during those years—this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a correct one of the bills given in September, 1891"—they were given for four months—they were new bills to enable him to execute an order, and in no case were they accommodation bills—it would take three days to clear my cheques with a stranger—I deny that I sent my crossed cheque, he sending his bill the same day and so be in funds to meet my own crossed cheque—his stock-in-trade that I took was valued by the Sheriff at £290, but Ayres made it £700—it is utterly false that before I entered into this agreement with him, I arranged to give him a partnership in the business to the amount of £500—I deny that I con<lb/>templated partnership with him—I did not give him details of a proposed partnership—the prisoner showed me this draft deed (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) last July—I was pressing him for a settlement of my account, and he said if he had a considerably increased stock he could increase the business—he would see his solicitor and see if I could not be secured—he afterwards produced this; I opened it and found it was a deed of partnership—I did not know that he had a banking account—I did not draw my cheques to bearer because they Were made out to the Kingsland Boot Co.; and I saw a gentleman at the bank, and asked him to pay cash; if they objected he should have told me of it—they did object to cashing one cheque, because he owed them £2 19s., which I gave him—I say that his having a banking account was done to deceive me—I objected to his paying it in to his account—he had not to give me a rough sketch on Friday, and the accurate amount on Monday; but on one or two occasions he gave me an account on Monday of amounts which could not be collected on Friday—he may have paid money out of his own pocket; he would charge that in his accounts—I know nothing about Mr. Wright—that matter occurred on a Monday, and my pay day is Friday—I do not know whether he paid one of the carpenters 9s.; I know I paid it—I did not want him to pay; I had a cashier there—I did not trust him with money; he was manager of the manufactory—he possibly paid Mr. Davis 10s.; Davis denied it—I have made an investigation, and cannot trace it—the prisoner's writing on the</p>

               <p>back of the cheque for £210s. is perfectly undisguised, and I should recognise it at once—I never expected to see the cheque—I was shown the counter<lb/>foil at the Police-court—he was represented there by a solicitor—I really mean to suggest that there was an attempt at the Police-court to deceive me—I actually saw the receipt for £2 from Mr. Powell the day before his arrest, and when he was arrested he said, "I thought Powell's bill was £2 10s., and I put the 10s. there"—he told the Magistrate he had paid £2 10s., and the counterfoil is made out for £2 10s.—I do not know why that was not put in my depositions—he said that it was a mistake, he had paid £2, and referred to the counterfoil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> "Powell and Co.," in the prisoner's undisguised writing, would be on the cheque, which would remain with the bank—the entry in the pass-book would not be in his writing—this is his writing, "Not able to keep my engagement with you"—he also says, "Whereas in an action for £300 and costs an execution has been levied, and whereas the vendor is indebted to the purchaser in the further sum of £700," and he signs that—all that time the Sheriff was in possession—I might have made him a bankrupt—the valuation of stock is signed "C. Evans"—at the time he made the statement about the £2 10s. and the counterfoil he was represented by a solicitor.</p>

I am accustomed to the making of plans—on the 15th October I examined the offices on the second floor of No. 12, Walbrook, and took measurements of them, and the contents, from which I made the plan produced—it is accurate and to scale—in the empty room there were two heaps of loose paper, with a line of loose paper running between them, and connecting them—one heap was leaning against the partition; that heap was about four feet six long, one foot nine wide, and about twenty inches high; the other was three feet in diameter, and two feet six high—the distance between the two heaps was about six feet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer's labourer, living at 12, Walbrook, with my wife and two children and my mother—we have the top floor immediately above the offices occupied by the prisoner—I am also the housekeeper of the premises, and have been so for two years—during that time the prisoner has occupied the offices on the second floor—I slept there with my wife and family up to the night of October 9th, and we were going to sleep there on that flight—on that day I was standing at the street door smoking my pipe, and about half-past eight I saw the prisoner leave the offices; he came downstairs and passed me, as I was standing at the front door—he was alone when he locked his door and came down, but a gentleman friend came down before him smoking a cigar—the pri<lb/>soner came down directly after him; I heard him lock his door—he pulled out his watch and looked at the time, and then looked up, and said, "If Mrs. Cattermoul comes, tell her that I am gone"—he said nothing more, nothing about coming back—when he looked at his watch I looked at mine; it was half-past eight by mine—he then went away and the gentleman with him—they went towards the Mansion House—I remained standing at the door—after a short time, soon after the prisoner had left, my attention was attracted by the reflection of a body of flame in the win<lb/>dow of a second floor opposite—I went out into the road and looked, and saw the reflection of a fire in Mr. Cattermoul's front office—I ran upstairs to the second floor; I heard the crackling of wood—I tried to get his doors open—there were two, one leading on to the landing and into a little hall, and one from the hall into the front office—I could not get them to open, they were locked—I had to break open the one leading into the general office—from that there is a door leading into the empty room—that door was not locked; I opened it—turning to the right I got to another door which leads into the little hall; that was shut, but not locked—I unlatched it and went into the small hall, and then into the private office, and there I saw a body of fire. (<hi rend="italic">The witness pointed out on the model the position of the various doors and rooms</hi>)—the fire was coming out of a large drawer at the bottom of the drawers; it was drawn three parts out—in front of the drawers was a Windsor chair, with a coat hanging on the back of it, close against the drawer where the fire was, about two inches from it—the seat of the chair was towards the door—I did not touch or move the drawer; I left it as it was—the blinds of the windows towards Walbrook were all down—I had never noticed them down before during the two years I was there—they were white blinds—there were two small drawers above the</p>

               <p>under one; one of them was open about three or four inches, and the other was open about four inches—I did not interfere with them at all—I went and got a pail of water—to get out I had to go through Mr. Cattermoul's side door—I had to burst that open from the inside; it opened outwards—that was one of the doors I had found locked—I went upstairs to my place to get the pail of water—I brought it down to the office, and threw it into the drawer on the body of the fire—it had no effect—I went upstairs, and got another pail of water, and threw that on—it had no effect at all—I then took a large mat which I found in the front office, close to Mr. Cattermoul's desk, and threw that over the top of the drawer that was on fire—the flames came over the top of the drawer round the mat—I then took off my own coat, and threw that right in between the flap where the flames were coming up, to damp it and put it out—I then noticed what was in the drawer; I believe it was tow, and it smelt very strongly of paraffin—having got out the fire, I went into the empty room—I there saw a great pile of paper at the back of the partition, where the fire was, close to it—I felt the partition; it was quite hot—I then went downstairs, saw a constable, and spoke to him—after that the members of the Fire Brigade came—as near as possible, there was about a quarter of an hour between the time of my going down and their coming—I then went upstairs again—up to the arrival of the brigade I did not touch the drawers, the chair or the coat—Mrs. Cattermoul did call that night; I saw her—that was after I had put the fire out and before the Fire Brigade came—I went with her upstairs to the second floor; I took her into the private office, and showed it to her—after that I remained downstairs till twenty minutes to one in the morning—I did not see anybody up to that time the prisoner did not come—I saw him next morning, the 10th, just before eleven, in his private office—I came down to him from my rooms upstairs and found him there—I said, "Good morning, Mr. Cattermoul"—I showed him where the tire was—I said the place was afire, and I stopped till twenty minutes to one in the morning for him, having sent him a message through Mrs. Cattermoul—he said he could not get up; he was too late for the train—when I showed him where the fire was he took it in good part—he said he could not help me in regard to this matter—I then left him with his son Tom—the drawers had been closed at that time—the next morning I saw the prisoner at the premises a little before eleven—he ordinarily came there at 8.45—I cannot say what time he came on the 10th—after showing him where the fire had been I went downstairs—I saw him about a quarter of an hour after that at the door—a gentleman friend, whom I had not seen before, was with him—the prisoner asked me to go and have a drink with him and the friend—I said, "No, sir"—he then offered me 2d. and said, "Go and have a drink yourself"—I said, "No thank you, sir"—he and his friend went away and I remained at the premises—on the Saturday before last Bank Holiday he got me to bring half a gallon of ale from the public-house to the office—I did not drink with him then—I used to drink a glass of ale, but I find myself better in health without it—he had never offered me a drink or money to get drink More that morning—when I went upstairs to put the fire out my wife and family were upstairs.</p>

I have carried on business there since Christmas, 1893. It is a fairly extensive business. I was on the premises on Tuesday last, about a quarter to ten. I left altogether at twenty to eight at night. I have about seven clerks, including one boy and my son. My manager, Mr. Barnes, left just before me. I locked up, and took the keys. Everything was straight when I left, no smell of tire. I did not burn paraffin. As far as I know I did not have any oil on the premises. There was no tow on the premises. I do not know of tow saturated with paraffin oil in one of the drawers. If there was, it was unknown to me. There was no can of oil, to my knowledge. I was on good terms with all the persons in my employ. I learnt of the fire when I got home after twelve o'clock, and my wife informed me of it. I could not get up; it was too late. I came to the premises on the following morning about ten o'clock. I saw a gentleman representing the Salvage Corps. He asked me if I knew of any tow saturated with petroleum. I said, 'No.' The fire appeared to have originated in a drawer in my private room in the front. The drawers were quite open; they are never locked. I had not</p>

               <p>been to the drawers that day. My stock consists of different-sized cut cords, silks, China silks, and paper. There were some account-books, and the total of the stationery was worth about £50. Taking the stock alto<lb/>gather in both rooms, it would be worth about £100. This is the usual average of the stock. I was insured in the Norwich Union for £550, under policy dated the 25th January, 1886. Stock transferred from 3, Bucklersbury to 12, Walbrook, on 19th January, 1893. There are two piles of waste-paper in the adjoining room, which is otherwise unoccupied. It may have been there a month. I was not in difficulties. <hi rend="italic">By the</hi>

When I left the office, there was my coat in my own office; it was on the chair. Mr. Hurst came in with a cigar; he had been with me about three quarters of an hour outside. The partition between the two rooms is only match boarding. My drawers go right flat against the partition. I cannot account for the paper being swept up against the drawer where the paraffin was, in the empty room. There were some shavings piled up in the empty room.

               <p>Sons, solicitors, of 19, Ludgate Hill—on July 12th, 1893, Mrs. Anderson consulted me in reference to the prisoner's conduct towards her, and on July 15th I wrote a letter to him. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner did not product the letter and a copy was read; this cautioned the prisoner that if he in any way molested, spoke to, or wrote to Mrs. Anderson, proceedings would im<lb/>mediately be taken before a police Magistrate</hi>)—I followed that up by this letter of July 17th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the prisoner's letter was unsatis<lb/>factory, but if he would communicate through a solicitor the form of Declaration he required, Mrs. Anderson would make it, as far as she could, consistently with truth; and repeating the caution not to communicate with her personally</hi>,)—at our first interview Mrs. Anderson placed in my possession a document which he had signed on 13th July, in which he undertakes to cease molesting her, and she sent me in July a large number of letters from the prisoner—here is one of August 19th, 1893. (<hi rend="italic">From the prisoner to Mrs. Anderson, dated from the Charing Cross Post Office, asking her to return him</hi> £1,000 <hi rend="italic">which he said he had deposited with her, and of which he said she admitted the receipt on July</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1890, <hi rend="italic">as he had promised to transfer the debt on the following Tuesday to a man of whom he had borrowed money; if not, the man would commence an action against her for the</hi> £ 1,000 <hi rend="italic">and costs.</hi>)—on September 2nd I wrote to the prisoner, or to Mr. Holt, his solicitor, and told him that the document was a fabrication, and on November 11th I received this writ claiming £1,000—this is the document on which the action was brought:—"Harrogate, July 15th. I promise most solemnly to be true, and whatever will happen, to stick to Ivan de Puchalsky. If I should ever deceive him or separate from him, I hereby authorise him to act with me in any way he likes, and I will never have any right to reproach him. Besides, in case of our separation or after the expiration of twelve months, I promise to give him back at any time he likes the sum of £1,000 sterling, which he has deposited with me." That purports to be signed by Mrs. Anderson—an application was made by the plaintiff under Clause 14, and this affidavit was filed. (<hi rend="italic">In this Mrs. Anderson swore that she had never received the</hi> £1,000 <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner or any other sum, and that she was informed that Mr. Lindon, to whom the prisoner stated he had transferred the debt for</hi> £920, <hi rend="italic">had offered to sell his interest in it for</hi> £135, <hi rend="italic">the sum he alleged that he had actually paid the prisoner; and further that he had endeavoured to induce her to sign a declaration as to his whereabouts on certain dates, and state that she paid him</hi> £80 <hi rend="italic">in order to prove an alibi in a charge made against him in Vienna, of which he was convicted and underwent eighteen months' the im<lb/>prisonment, and she refused to do so</hi>)—we got leave to defend; we applied for security for costs, and the order was made—no security was forth coming, and the action dropped—Mr. Holt did not act as his solici<lb/>tor on that occasion; Harris and Cheetham did, but afterwards Mr. Holt called, and after they had dropped the matter the prisoner himself started this action for £980—document No. 8 is in the prisoner's writing, all except the date and the signature, "Gertrude Anderson," which Mrs. Anderson repudiated—while the action was going on Mrs. Anderson was h alone, till June this year, and in July she came and handed me letters rich she had received from the prisoner, and others by post as she received them—I informed the prisoner that I had received them, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100065"/>
               <p>Mr. Holt called on me—the prisoner called several times at my office during July, but I declined to see him while the correspondence was going on—the matter culminated by this bill for £100 being presented at the bank, upon which I applied, with Mrs. Anderson, for a warrant for his arrest—it was obtained on the 28th and executed on November 1st—while the warrant was out Mrs. Anderson sent me by post this last letter, in which the prisoner states what the consequences will be to her if she goes on.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Grosvenor Mansions, Victoria Street, and am the widow of Arthur Anderson, who died this year—we made the prisoner's acquaintance at Mentone some years ago, and remained on terms of great friendship till he went abroad in, I think, November, 1890—while he was out of England information with regard to him reached us—he wrote to me from Breslau in 1892, and early in 1893 he tried to speak to me in London in the street, and in different places, but I declined to have any conversation with him—I saw him very often when I went out—he wrote letters to me, and I had one from Paris—he came up to me in the street when I was with Mr. Clark, and offered to cease annoying me if I would allow him to speak to me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a document promising to abstain from molesting me if I would hear what he had to say—he continued writing letters, and I consulted Mr. Blanchard Wontner, and from that time I have acted under his advice—he wrote me three or four letters in one day, which I handed to Mr. Wontner—I have had no interview with him since June 13th—he tried to speak to me in the street about a year ago, but not since—I took steps to prevent his coming into the building where my flat is—towards the end of the year I received a letter from him in which he said that I owed him £1,000; that was the first intimation I had of it; I handed it to Mr. Wontner—I afterwards Heard that an action was being brought on some document which I was supposed to have signed—none of this document is in my writing—there is not the slightest pretence that he ever deposited £1,000 with me; it is an absolute falsehood—I have my principal account at the Lothbury office of the London Joint Stock Bank, and I had about £4,000 there in July this year—after my husband's death I received a letter from the prisoner, saying that in doing what he had done he had been instigated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100066"/>
               <p>by other people—I also kept a small account at the bank in Victoria Street—I have never signed a bill in my life; I never even saw one till I saw these four bills with my name written across, and I never signed them—the first bill being paid at the bank my account became overdrawn immediately afterwards, and a warrant was applied for, and this prosecu<lb/>tion commenced—I then received a letter from the prisoner saying what was to happen to me if I went on with the prosecution—all these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in the prisoner's writing.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Four of the witness's letters to the prisoner were read at his request, in which she expostulated with him as to the way in which he spent his money, and enclosed a draft, which he had sent her to take care of.</hi>)—the draft was for £100, which he had left with me to take care of.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This proposed declaration stated that Mrs. Anderson met the prisoner at Mentone in</hi> 1885, <hi rend="italic">and that he afterwards visited her and her husband at their house in London, and became a close friend; that they were again at Mentone in</hi> 1890, <hi rend="italic">and that the prisoner was their guest during January and die first half of February, and was at the Hotel Metropole after that till she left in March, and that he was never in London during that time; it denied that lie was in London or Koln or Konigsberg at certain dates, as she saw him everyday, and that on November</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1890, <hi rend="italic">she attended at her bankers, the Imperial Bank, Wigmore Street, and handed the prisoner eight £10 Bank of England notes, Nos.</hi> 48763 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 48770)—that was not true, and therefore she refused to sign it, she was extremely anxious to make any affidavit for him that he wished.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting, of Holborn Viaduct, and have been employed by the authorities of Scotland Yard and the Treasury—Messrs. Wontner showed me the signatures on these four bills of exchange, purporting to be signed by Mrs. Anderson, and supplied me with a large number of her cheques, and my opinion is that the signatures to the bills are not her writing—I have seen the prisoner's admitted writing, and believe them to be his—it is an exceedingly good imitation of her writing; one is so good that it deceived the clerk—it could not be detected without careful examination—they are not tracings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had twenty of Mrs. Anderson's cheques before me—I made tracings of every one, and found them wonderfully uniform, both as regards the style of the "G" and the slope of the writing—I next tested the five disputed signatures by comparing them with the admitted signa<lb/>tures—the first difference was in the style of the "G"—many of the admitted "G's" are only half the size of the "G "on the bill; and the smallness of the "G" in the admitted signatures also applies to two signatures written in the witness-box (<hi rend="italic">At the Police-court</hi>) on this piece of paper—the next point is the slope of the writing—on an envelope addressed by you I find the words "Gertrude Anderson"; I made a tracing of them, and applied it to one of the admitted signatures, and when I got the "G" to correspond with the "G" underneath, the rest of the writing runs out of the line and every signature showed that the slope was not the natural slope—I next placed the tracings over the disputed signature, four on the bills and one on the document, and then I found that the slope of the writing corre<lb/>sponded—in all the admitted signatures the "s" in "Anderson" is much more sloping than in the alleged forgeries, and the loop at the bottom of the "s" in the admitted signatures is a plain loop, but in the alleged forgeries it is made like an abbreviated "and" with a double loop.

Waring must cover the insurance and make themselves responsible—he said he would see Messrs.

Waring—that was said when I asked him whether the business would be closed, as the 31st October was near at hand, that being the day fixed for payment—he said he had no doubt he would conclude the business with Messrs. Waring, and said, "You may be sure of your cheque on the 31st"—he said dis<lb/>tinctly that the goods were still at Messrs. Waring's, who would be the buyers—that was the last time I saw him—I don't recollect that he stated anything as to his having been to Messrs. Waring's himself—he made no statement on that occasion as to having sold any part of the things; he said he had not closed the bargain—early in November I had to go to Antwerp, but I was back in my office by the 5th November—I did not see the prisoner on that day; I did not see him again—immediately after the 5th November I had to go to Antwerp again, and I was there when the warrant was applied for—Mr. Sutcliffe has been some years in my employ<lb/>ment as a clerk; he was shorthand clerk, and generally attended to the correspondence—he writes Spanish, which is very useful in my business with Mexico.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Sutcliffe is my clerk—I entrusted a good deal to him—I did not entrust him entirely with the management of the business; when anything is introduced it is brought to me—any conversation was between the prisoner and myself, not between myself and Sutcliffe—on 29th October, the prisoner had a conversation with me—I am the prosecutor in this case—I got these vestments from the owner from Mexico—Dr. Schmidt sent them to me—I am not aware I that according to the law of Morocco there is no private property in things of this nature—I know as a fact that they are not stolen goods—Mr. Schmidt is a highly respectable man in Mexico—my clerk, Mr. Sutcliffe, introduced the prisoner to me—there were no terms arranged, he was to find a buyer; he did not bring an order—he tried to find a buyer, but did not—he offered me £600 in the first instance—out of that £6001 think I was to have 75 per cent, for my<lb/>self—I got £5 for the remnants; that was their value—I am not aware that Mr. Sutcliffe got a commission on that transaction—I was present at the Mansion House when Mr. Sutcliffe gave his evidence—I don't re<lb/>member his saying there that he got a commission—I was never under the impression that the prisoner was a principal—I do not know a Mr. Tallet personally—I know of him—he is a dealer—I wrote a letter to him on 31st July, 1894; this is the letter—I had not regarded the prisoner as a principal up to that time—I don't remember writing a letter to that effect—I cabled an offer to Mexico—I was not getting commission from the other side—me arrangement with the prisoner was that I was to run the risk of getting commission out of what he made—he was to pay me £75 for £500—I wrote to the prisoner that I would place the matter in the hands of my solicitors—I dictated my letters to Sutcliffe, who type-wrote them—I did not see all the letters that Sutcliffe wrote—I first became aware that these goods had been taken away from my premises on October 17th; they had disappeared—I could not help see<lb/>ing they were gone—I was informed they were gone—I never complained to the prisoner about his leaving the goods on my premises; they were not his goods, but mine—I never complained to the prisoner about people going to my premises to view those goods—I did not sell those goods out and out to the prisoner—it was not arranged that as he had not proper premises to take them to he should leave them on my premises—I never complained about his not having got rid of them—I did not see him on October 19th—he mentioned Waring's name to me, not Duveen's—I am a naturalised Englishman; I have been here on and off for over twenty-five years—Waring's place is somewhere in the same neighbourhood as Duveen's—Sutcliffe would not do anything without my special authority in my absence—I do not know that he did anything without my authority—these things were parted with with my authority—Sutcliffe reported to me, and after that I saw the prisoner—the prisoner did not say that he told Sutcliffe he was negotiating with Waring for the sale of the goods, but that the</p>

               <p>price was too high, or that they were going to have an exhibition at Liverpool of certain goods, and were willing to take these goods and dis<lb/>play them there, with a view to selling them—Duveen came to my place on 5th November, and after that I had a conversation with Sutcliffe, who told me that Duveen wanted to know whether the prisoner was authorised to sell a lot of goods; he did not like to deal with people who had no address—I then knew for the first time that the goods were not at the prisoner's, but at Duveen's, and I gave Sutcliffe immediate in<lb/>structions to telephone to Duveen to stop the cheque—Sutcliffe told me he gave Duveen an evasive answer to the question whether the prisoner had authority to sell, as he did not know what to say in my absence—I will swear he did not say he answered "Yes"—I tried to ascertain from Duveen the number of pieces that were being sold—Sutcliffe said Duveen asked him whether it was all right, and that he answered that the prisoner had some arrangement with me, but he could not give a decided answer in my absence—Sutcliffe reported briefly to me—he told me Duveen said, "I have given him a crossed cheque," that was why we tried to stop it—he did not report that he had told Duveen it was all right.</p>
               <p>

The effect of Sutcliffe's report was that I immediately told him to telephone and stop the cheque—the prisoner never told me that he had taken these things to Messrs. Duveen's, in Bond Street—their name was never mentioned by him as the persons who had the things in their possession—Waring was the only name he mentioned—the arrangement as to the retention of the things by me was that they should remain on my premises until either the prisoner paid for them or brought me a buyer whom I approved—that arrangement was never departed from—I never heard Tullet's name, or met him until within the last ten days, when he came to my office to offer his services as a witness—he was a friend of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I am an artists' dealer, and live at Leyton Road, Kentish Town—in September I met the prisoner, and he told me he had some embroidery to sell—I told him that I could not do any business with him on Saturday at two o'clock, when all business shops in the West-end were closed—he asked me if I could find any money to be lent on it—I said, "Yes, you can go to a pawnshop where I sometimes put my pictures, and you can obtain money there. I will go with you"—I went with the prisoner to Mr. Walters, a pawnbroker, at 51, City Road, and in my presence the prisoner pawned the piece of embroidery and he asked £4; £2 was advanced on it—he gave me 2s. for my trouble—I cannot tell by the pattern if this is a photograph of that piece—I believe I have seen the prisoner since, but I do not remember.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known him for some time, but only since just the beginning of this business—I saw all the vestments three times—I have been about with the prisoner endeavouring to sell them—I remember his selling a portion—I knew Sutcliffe as Mr. Weiner's servant—I saw</p>

               <p>money pass between the prisoner and Sutcliffe several times—he gave Sutcliffe money coming from Duveen; I believe it was £10; I don't know how much, but I saw gold pieces—Sutcliffe returned him some silver pieces—the prisoner gave me 10s. on that occasion for my trouble—I had 10 per cent, on the £10—I did not see the prisoner hand Sutcliffe any<lb/>thing on Saturday, the day of the pawning—I heard the prisoner say he had to take a sovereign to Sutcliffe because he was in want of money—I knew Sutcliffe then—I don't recollect hearing Sutcliffe say he had not had his wages from Mr. Weiner, or anything of that sort—Sutcliffe told me the goods belonged to the prisoner; that was why I began to work for him—Sutcliffe told me that in the prisoner's presence, and when the prisoner had all the goods in his possession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I cannot recollect if that conversation with Sutcliffe, when the prisoner had a number of things in his possession, was before the pawning on the Saturday, 22nd September—it must have been after it, because he wrote to me on 24th September—I cannot swear if it was before or after—I cannot tell if I saw the prisoner at all after going to the pawnbroker's—I am in great trouble; I have lost my wife, and am in distress at home, and am almost out of my mind.</p>

Walters and Son, pawnbrokers, of 51, City Road—Vignon is known to us as a customer—on Saturday, 22nd September, he came with the prisoner, bringing a piece of tapestry, which they offered in pledge—Vignon said it was his, speaking in English—he said he was going to sell it to the prisoner, and that the prisoner had not any money to pay, him a deposit, and that he wanted to pawn it for £2 to pay the deposit—I advanced £2 on it—this photograph, No. 40, represents the piece—this is the duplicate ticket; it was pledged in the name of Newnham, 16, Barnsbury Road, N.—it was redeemed on 5th November; we do not know by whom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think I remember all that was said—Vignon had come to our place about some pictures we had for sale, ranging from £10 to £25—the prisoner pledged this piece; Vignon merely introduced him to us—this was about mid-day on the Saturday—we do not often have articles of this sort brought to our shop—I think if the prisoner had come alone I should have taken the piece if I was satisfied with him—if he had asked me to lend him £8 or £9 on it I should have done so; he asked £2—the object of Vignon's coming was to introduce the prisoner, and satisfy any inquiries I might have been disposed to make—Vignon said it was his—I don't remember if I was present when it was redeemed; I may have been in another part of the shop.</p>

I am a dealer in antiquities at 164, Wardour Street—in August I saw the prisoner, but I did not buy anything from him then—early in October he brought me this vestment, which is generally called a Virgin's dress, and he sold it outright for £1—he asked a great deal more, but I did not think it was worth more than £1; he was con<lb/>tent to take that—we sell such things for covering chairs or lining screens, or something of that kind—No. 25 is the photograph which represents it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Waring and Sons, of 181, Oxford I Street, dealers in antiquities—some time prior to 11th October the prisoner called and showed me an album of photographs of religious vest<lb/>ments, and asked me to inspect the goods—I called at Fenchurch Street and looked at them—on 11th October I wrote this memorandum to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he should not be able to mention the matter to Mr. Waring till the next day</hi>)—the price suggested for them was £600—I had not examined them in detail to be able to form any opinion—having spoken to my principals on 12th and 13th, I wrote this memorandum to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Regretting that they were unable to make an offer in accord<lb/>ance with his suggestion, but that perhaps he would call on Monday if he were passing</hi>)—I think the suggestion was that if we would buy a portion of them, he would send the remainder on sale or return—we were unable to do that—he suggested bringing the things to Oxford Street for our inspection—I said if he brought them, I would examine them—I did not see or hear of him again after that—the things never came, and were never on our premises.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> From first to last he told me they were at Weiner's—the offer to bring them to us came from the prisoner—he did not say it would be necessary to pay something on account before leaving them with me—he suggested that if we bought a certain quantity, the remainder could remain for sale—£200 was named for some, I think—we did not feel inclined to entertain the offer at that price—we were going to have an exhibition at Liverpool, and were anxious to make it a success—I said we were not disposed to buy them, but, if placed in our hands, we might be able to dispose of them—I have seen these things; I say nothing about their value.</p>

               <p>4, Fenchurch Street, and I there examined some religious vestments and other things; the prisoner was there and showed me the things—he said he wanted £600, I think, for them—I said the price was far too high, and that it was no good making any offer at all—he came again on 16th or 17th, and asked me if we would buy the embroidery—I said, "No; the things are much too high in price. If you like to ask a much lower price we might entertain them"—he mentioned £400—I said that was still much too high—I wanted to cut them up, and use them in various ways, and not keep them as historical curiosities; we might have kept them as that for a great while—my father afterwards bought them, because my brother, who attends to the New York business, was in London, and he said, "If you can buy them very cheaply, have them"—my father arrived from Paris on Saturday, 13th, and was in town when the prisoner came on the Tuesday—the prisoner said he would bring the goods to Bond Street for my father to see—next day, 17th October, I saw the goods at our premises; that was the day they arrived—I examined them again—the prisoner was not there then—they had not then been bought, or any offer made for them, so far as I know—they remained on our premises till Monday, 5th November—I was present then, when my father bought and paid £200 for them—on 19th October we had bought six pieces for £11, and on 22nd October one piece for £1—the matter was completed on 5th November by the pay<lb/>ment of £188 to the prisoner, by three cheques, two to order, and crossed, for £168 and £15, and one open, for £5, which we cashed for the prisoner—these are the £5 and £168 cheques on Sir Samuel Scott's Bank—payment of the £15 cheque was stopped—we tried to stop payment of the £168, but it had been cashed, and we were too late—I bought, on 26th September, one vestment for £3 (No. 22 in the photographs), which is altogether outside the £200 transaction—No. 40 was sold to us, with the others, on 5th November—it was not in the box with the others, and the prisoner said he would bring it, and we kept back the £15 cheque till he brought it.</p>

               <p>paid the prisoner the £168 cheque I had occasion to go to the City to see about some property I had taught—I cannot remember what time I gave the prisoner the cheque, or what time I arrived At the City; it was before the banks were closed—I went to 4, Fenchurch Street, and there had a conversation with Mr. Sutcliffe—coming back, I made no effort to stop the £168 cheque; I was quite satisfied that everything was right—I did not stop the £15 cheque; my son Joseph did so—I went to Paris the next morning, the 6th—I only heard by letter of the stopping of the £15 cheque—up to the time I purchased these things I believed they belonged to the prisoner—on 5th November I asked him, "Are these goods yours?" and he said, "Yes, I bought them"—I never heard from anyone that the goods did not belong to him—when I was doing the business with the prisoner and giving him the cheque he seemed a little timid, and I said I would go to Fenchurch Street to see if they were all right, and I asked him if they were his, and he said "Yes," and produced an invoice or letter for £400—he produced that to my clerk, for whom I sent—I thought it best to call at 4, Fenchurch Street, as I was in the City—I did not go on purpose; I went to see a surveyor about some property—I asked the prisoner where the goods came from, and he said, "Mr. Weiner's," and I went there and asked if Mr. Weiner was in, and saw Sutcliffe, and from what passed between me and him I was satisfied, and went to Paris with a peaceful mind next morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I asked the prisoner for his evidence of title he produced to my clerk an invoice, or some document—I did not see it; as I looked at it the prisoner pulled the corner over and said I must not see the price, or something like that—my book-keeper looked at it; I did not—the prisoner told me he bought the goods from Mr. Weiner—I am a Dutchman; I understand English very well—the whole lot were at our place—I said I should give him a crossed cheque, and he said, "You can do as you like about that"—he must have said that I could make every inquiry for the reason that I asked the question—I told Sutcliffe at 4, Fenchurch Street that I had bought some goods from the prisoner, and Sutcliffe said, "It is all right; Mr. Weiner has got some understanding with the prisoner"—I asked him," Can he (the prisoner) sell me these goods," and Sutcliffe said, "Yes"—I told Sutcliffe I had given him a crossed cheque; I don't recollect that he made any answer to that—I believe my sons afterwards did the transaction with the piece in con<lb/>nection with the £15 cheque—Sutcliffe said nothing about his relation to Mr. Weiner—I asked if Mr. Weiner was in, and he said, "No, he is not in, but I can do just the same."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think Sutcliffe asked me how many pieces I had bought—I think I said I could not say—I don't think he said he could not tell me whether the price was a good one unless I knew how many pieces I had bought—I was in a hurry, and only wanted to know that the goods were right—nothing was said about it being wrong—I did not go straight back to Bond Street—I was not there when the telephone was going, or when the £15 cheque was stopped; I had gone home.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was present when the prisoner came first on November 5th at 12.30—Mr. Duveen sent for me to come upstairs at that time, and said to the prisoner, "Show Mr. Bell the letter you have shown me. I have asked him if he is the owner of the goods, and has power to sell them," and I saw a type-written letter from Weiner and Co.—the prisoner did not say he had bought the goods, but he produced the letter to me—I believe I crossed this £168 cheque with the India-rubber stamp, as I do all cheques.</p>

I am manager of the Tottenham Court Road and Shaftesbury Avenue branches of the London and Midland Bank—on the morning of November 6th, Marshall, whom I knew as in the employ of a club which kept its account at our bank, called at our Tottenham Court Road branch, accompanied by the prisoner, whom he introduced as Mr. Newnham—he said Mr. Newnham wished to open an account at our Shaftesbury Avenue branch—I said, "Certainly"—he paid in this cheque for £168, and another for £15,1 think; it was crossed to another bank, I think, and I could not take it—he wished to have the £168 cheque presented at once, and I immediately sent one of my clerks with it—it was on Lloyd's Bank, Hanover Square, which was formerly Sir Samuel Scott's, and that branch is not a member of the Clearing House—in the ordinary course I should have sent it to our head office next morning for them to clear—the cheque was cashed; we received the money, and opened the account at Shaftesbury Avenue—I went to that branch later the same day, I found the entry in our signature book, "November</p>

A. A. Newnham, 3, Queen's Square Place, Bloomsbury. Private"—that is all in one writing, and then the manager wrote underneath, "Out of business. Introducer, H. C.

I am the wife of Richard Parfitt, of 23, Stanhope Street, Clare Market—the prisoner is my youngest sister—she is twenty-three years old—she has been a general servant, but ceased to be so five or six years ago—about two or three years since she came to see her fellow servants; she occasionally visited us—I first saw her baby about three weeks before the Sunday in question—she brought it with her—I don't know how old it was then; it was in arms—I saw her on Sunday, November 11th, about half-past six in the evening—she was in the street, near our house—she had the baby with her—it seemed well—I asked her what she had been doing to herself to keep away so long—she said, "Nothing"—I asked how she was in her health—she said, "All right"—we went and had a glass of whisky in the Yacht public-house in Stan<lb/>hope Street—she seemed sober—the gentleman who was supposed to be her husband came in, and she and the baby went away with him—I next saw her on Tuesday evening, November 13th, about twenty minutes to seven, in the same street, outside our door—she had not the baby with her then—I noticed that she seemed strange about her eyes—she seemed as if she was intoxicated, and yet she did not appear so—I asked her where was the baby—she said, "The landlady has got it"—I asked her whether the landlady always took her like that, free, for her—she said, "Yes"—I asked her when she was going to shorten it, to take it out of long clothes—she said, "Between this and Sunday"—she had let me know when it was born, by letter—I knew it was going on for three months old—she said two or three times that she saw my sister's boy—she said so on the second night, that she was going home with her husband and baby—it was my eldest sister's, Mary Ann Corcoran's, boy—that was on the Sunday night—she left me about a quarter to ten, as near as I could say—I asked her w hen I should see her again—she said, "To-morrow"—</p>

I am the wife of John Brown, of 65, Kennington Road—the prisoner occupied two rooms on the first floor of my house since August, 1893, in the name of Mrs. Williams—she took the rooms herself, and brought the furniture and paid 9s. 6d. a week rent—a gentle<lb/>man used to visit her who I knew as Mr. Williams—she paid her rent regularly up to the time she was arrested—Mr. Williams did not live in the house; he used to come there two or three times a week—she was confined there three months previous to the child's death; it was a girl—the vaccination paper was sent in in the name of Florence Williams—Dr. Reid attended her in her confinement, and she had a nurse for three weeks; she was very well attended to—I saw the child once in two months—after the first month I saw her take it in and out, not to look at it; I saw her with it in her arms from time to time—I saw her on Tuesday, the 13th November, in the morning, three times going in and out of the house; she came downstairs into the kitchen—</p>

               <p>I asked her if she was going to wash on that day, as it was her washing day—she said "No"—that was about one as near as I could state—she appeared well at that time—there was nothing unusual about her that I could see—I saw her again about half-past one that same day; I took her some dinner up and knocked at her door—I heard the baby crying in the front room at that time, and she said, "Hark at Dorothy"—that was the only time I heard her say that word—I said, "What is the matter with it?"—she said, "It is trying to have a cry," or something to that effect—that was all I saw of her at that time—I saw her go out at the front door as near four as possible—I could not see whether she had the child; I only saw the top part of her head and shoulders—she had a latch-key—I could not tell whether she came back that night; she could not have come in after half-past twelve—I don't know if she did come home; I did not see her—I did not see her again till next day, Wednesday, when the police came—that was about five or six in the evening—I did not make any effort to see whether she was in her room, or whether she had come home—I never knew her to stop out—some weeks I did not see her once in a week; she kept herself to herself so much—she cooked for herself in her own room—on the Wednesday I pointed out to Sergeant Ward the rooms she occupied—I went with him into the bedroom, and saw him find the dead body of the child between the mattresses on the bed—it was the same child that I had known as hers—Mr. Williams was there on Monday evening, the 12th—he came about seven and knocked, and I let him in, and he left about eight or nine—I was standing at the front door at the time he went out—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I have had a letter from her—I went to see her in the prison—she wished to see me, and I went on Monday week, 3rd December, and after I had been I received this letter from her. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Remand Hospital, Monday, 3rd December, 1894. To Mrs. Brown,—I am grateful to you for coming this morning to see me. You say that Mr. Clifford has been and have taken some things away. I left my diamond earrings and two diamond rings and brooch in a bag on the sideboard, and you say that he has taken them away. They were all presents from him to me on my birthdays; and the furniture he bought for me, so that if ever I left him, or anything happened, that I should not be without a home. The things are not troubling me, but I did not expect him to act in the manner which you say he has. I want my sister Eliza to take care of them for me. He does not even wait until I am tried. There are a lot of the things which I bought out of my own savings. The money what I first had in the Post Office he made me draw out just before I come to your place, to buy the carpet and rug. Oh, I hope God will forgive me for what I have done to my little child. Oh, I wish that I had never seen him; he was always taunting me that the child was not his, just because of the drink. He led me on the same as he did his first wife—led her on with the drink until it killed her; and now I am worse than being dead, for pray I cannot just yet, for my brain seems to go round and round. Why did not he send a letter in to tell ire that he was going to take the things? He gave them to me: but when he comes you tell him that I want my sister to look after them. I hope that God will leave me my senses, so that I may repent of this most terrible sin.—<hi rend="smallCaps">JULIA LEE</hi>")—I had told</p>

I shall have again to caution you, as it will be now my duty to charge you with wilful murder"—she made no reply, but burst into tears—I then conveyed her to Kennington Road Station—on the way she said, "There is no one to blame for this but myself.

(<hi rend="italic">The deposition of Dr. George Nicholl Henry was put in and read</hi>: "At a quarter to seven on the night of the 14th, I was called to 65, Kennington Road. In a bedroom on the first floor back I saw a female child lying on the bed on its left side, at the top end of the bed, between two mattresses; a bolster, two pillows, and the bedclothes lying over the top mattress, the child lying under them, across the bed. Completely cover<lb/>ing over its head was a bath towel; part of the towel was in the child's mouth, moistened with mucus, slightly tinged with blood; there was bloody and frothy mucus in the mouth and nostrils; the tongue was slightly protruded, and of a purplish red colour. There was some blood on the right cheek. There was another reddish mark about the size of a penny on the right side of the chin. There was another reddish mark, with the skin rubbed off, under the chin on the right side. The right ear was doubled on itself from pressure; The skin on the buttock was red, and abraded. There was post-mortem stiffening in the upper and lower limbs. Post-mortem lividity was well marked on the left side of the knee and next left side of the chest and abdomen, the outer side of the left arm and leg, and under side of the left arm and leg. The skin of the lower part of the belly was of a greenish due, due to putrefaction. The child had been dead from twenty-five to thirty-six hours. It was dressed in a night-gown, flannel, and shirt, a binder round the body, with a napkin round the buttock; the gown, flannel, and napkin were moist with urine. Underneath the child, lying on the mattress, was a red shawl. In the sitting room, in front, on the table, I saw two feeding-bottles; one had some milk in it, the other was in water, with a brush in it. I saw the prisoner at the Police-station, Kennington Road, the same night; she was in a dazed, stupid, and vacant condition, required to have our questions repeated, as if she did not comprehend them. She looked to me as if she was just recovering from a heavy bout of drinking. On the 16th I made a post-mortem ex<lb/>amination. The child was about three months old, its body poorly, but not badly, nourished, clean; it weighed eight pounds, considerably under the usual, but it was a small child; the cause of death was asphyxia,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189412100089"/>
               <p>from suffocation. Considerable pressure must have been used to cause the effect. The clothes of the child, as described, with the towel in its mouth, was sufficient to cause asphyxia. I examined the left chest and abdomen. The appearance of the lungs, thymus, gland, and brain all point to death from suffocation. In the stomach I found a quantity of milk, partially digested. I am of opinion that the child was fed shortly before it was suffocated.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior medical officer of Holloway Prison—the prisoner came there on 15th October—she has been under my observation ever since—she was suffering from great mental depression—the first day she came she was very vacant in her manner, and I had great difficulty in getting an answer to any question I put to her—that was all I noticed about her the first day—she had no sleep that night, and she was reported to me to have delu<lb/>sions—I saw her the following morning—she told me she thought some man had been trying to get in at the window—she also said she thought she heard voices saying, "That is the mother"—I considered those were delusions—she has continued very much in the same condition with regard to her mental state—I have always had great difficulty in getting answers to my questions—she never spoke to anyone unless spoken to, and although supplied with books she never read them—she frequently sits down, and is observed to be crying—she has spoken to me about her child—she appeared to be fond of it—as far as I could gather, I should say she was not of a very strong intellect; she was of a weak intellect—I think she was suffering from melancholia—I have been in Court this morning, and have heard the evidence—I believe that she was suffering from melancholia from the time she first came under my observation—I should say she would not know the nature and quality of the act she did—she was suffering from melancholia—that is not always accompanied by mania—it is a distinct disease by itself—it would have sudden impulses—you can have sudden impulse in melancholia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is a difference between melancholia and melan<lb/>choly—melancholia, in a characteristic sense of the word, would mean some affection of the brain, a diseased condition of the brain—we can only tell the distinction by our constant experience of such cases—there is such a thing as conscience in the sane, and remorse and sorrow—I should certainly expect a sane woman who had killed her child to feel remorse and sorrow afterwards, and to be very melancholy, and, to a certain extent, reserved and not inclined to talk—I don't think I should expect such a person to imagine that people were pointing at her and saying, "She has killed her</p>

I have had very little experience in the treatment of the insane—I have seen an immense number of insane person—some<lb/>times all traces of insanity may depart in a very short time; it might disappear in a few minutes, it might be very transitory indeed—there are many instances where children have been destroyed immediately after birth; that is generally in cases of puerperal mania, which mania may pass away—alcohol will produce the same thing—I do not say that a person coming raging drunk out of a public-house is insane, but his mind would be in abeyance at the time: he had lost his reason; he is mad for the time being—there is such a thing as alcoholic insanity; there is delirium tremens—extreme depression may be accounted for either by insanity or drink; but considering that in this case it has continued dur<lb/>ing all the time the prisoner has been under my observation, I am the more inclined to think it due to mental depression—if in a state of drunkenness she had caused death without contemplating a fatal result that would cause great depression; but that would not cause all I saw; there was the difficulty of getting answers to questions—that is certainly not uncommon even with sane persons; stupidity might cause the—the books she had were supplied to her by the school-mistress—she was in a ward, not in a cell—she would open a book and sit with it on her lap, not looking at it.</p>

I live at 49, Dorset Road, Clapham—on Novem<lb/>ber 8th, 1892, I was married to the prisoner at the Registry Office, Lavender Gardens—this is the certificate—he describes himself as a captain, retired from the Royal Marine Artillery—he said he was a widower—a day or two after the marriage he said he was divorced from his first wife—I asked him why he did not tell me before that his wife was living—he said she was dead and cold to him absolutely, and it was all the same, just the same as if she was really dead, and that he was legally and pro<lb/>perly divorced from her, just as if he had never been married—he said something about Captain Fenton, and that the suit was Dighton <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Digh<lb/>ton and Dunbar, Dunbar being the co-respondent, and that he had divorced her—he said she was alive, but that he should never feel any<lb/>thing for her or see her, and that I was his wife—late this year I ascer<lb/>tained there had not been a divorce, through a letter sent from my home to Whitehall to make inquiries how it could be found out—I re<lb/>ceived this letter from him in February, 1894. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he knew he had committed a breach of the law, but that it was through ignorance when he read the deed of separation</hi>)—after we were married he brought me papers in his own writing to show that he had gone through the service honourably, and that he had been a good man—the divorce paper was shown to me separately afterwards; it was a sheet of foolscap in his own writing, and he read it to me himself—I don't know what it was, but he told me it was a copy of his wife's divorce—there was some<lb/>thing in it about two children, and their brother being the guardian for them—this letter is in his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The document was read to me a few days after the ceremony in my shop parlour—I am sure it was not read before—I believed it was a divorce when he read it—I looked at the paper; it did not read only like a separation—I forget how it read now—I lived with him after November, 1892, until October this year—his mother lived with us from April, 1893, to October this year, when I left him, with the excep<lb/>tion of eight weeks in the summer—a young woman, who was represented as his daughter, also came in June, 1894, and stayed till October—she was supposed to be between sixteen and seventeen—I never sent presents to her, mother by her, but I believe money was sent through the prisoner to his children.</p>
