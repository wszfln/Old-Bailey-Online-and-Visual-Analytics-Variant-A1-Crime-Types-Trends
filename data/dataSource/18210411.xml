I told him I would see him safe out. My wife was before me with a light, the prisoner stood in the passage with a sword, he made towards me, and made a blow at me with it, my wife put her hand up, and received the blow on her hand - it cut her fingers - he made a second blow, and cut my head; he rose his hand, and struck again, I ran up, and caught him - we struggled and fell, the light was put out, my wife went and got another, and as soon as she brought it it was put out again; she fetched some people to my assistance, and we took the prisoner to the watchman.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. There were a great many people - A. Yes; some were tipsy, I was sober.

The company were all gone when he cut my head with the sword. I did not throw a quart pot at him.

            . I live in Calmell-buildings, and was at this wedding. I was there until two o'clock in the morning. They were going to dance on the first floor, but the prisoner told them it would injure the building, and they might dance in the kitchen. Lucett offered to bet the prisoner 5 l., and the prisoner said he would give him 20 l. if he could produce 5 l. His wife said if my husband has not got 5 l. I have 10 l., and more. One word produced another, and Lucett took up an empty pot, and told the prisoner to get out of the kitchen immediately, or he would strike him with it. I took him by the breast, and said it was a shame to strike the man - he got angry with me, and got from me, then his wife took up a candlestick, and said she would let him know she had got some blood. They collared Shehee, and turned him out of the room. I went to bed in about five minutes, and saw no more. Lucett was a little in liquor, when he first came in he took up a glass, and said it was the thirteenth he had had that day.</p>

In the February following I discovered that he had another wife, went to Ramsgate, and made enquiry about it; I then returned, and lived with him from the 10th of June till the 8th of August, when his wife came and demanded him, and 5 l. which he had promised her as a bribe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not part by mutual consent, and he was to allow 10 s. 6 d. a week - A. No; when I returned to live with him in June, a paper was drawn up for him to allow it to me, but I never asked him for it. I only asked him to buy the baby clothes. I left him when his wife demanded him, but before I did not know whether I was his lawful wife or no. He told me his wife had another husband, and that he was not lawfully married.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did you say about a bribe - A. When his wife demanded him, he said he had promised her 5 l. not to answer any questions I put to her at Greenwich. When I refused to live with him, he removed close by my father's, and then right opposite, so that he could see into my room.</p>

I married this woman. went into the country for eight or ten days, and on returning she had made off with my property. I demanded her; they went and found out the woman - she told them she was married, and had another husband. On the 8th of December she came to me, and wanted me to let her lay in at her father's, and to allow him so much a week. I said if she came back to me I would do all I could.</p>

We had no orders to leave any hay there. The price was about 2 s. 6 d. a truss. Knight knew whose service we were in. I had known him from the Monday morning, had called at his house every morning for four days, and had spoken to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. No money was given to Dutton - A. Not to my knowledge. I saw Knight take the hay out of the cart and put it in the stable. We were going further. It was not loose hay, it was a regular truss.</p>

I took up Knight on the 23d of January, and told him what he was charged with; he was examined before the magistrate. On the 26th of January he called on me - he was hostler at the house - his master asked me, in his presence, to settle the business without going before the magistrate - I declined. I allowed the man half a truss of hay for the horses.</p>

               <p>DUTTON'S Defence. I called my fellow-servant up to go to Northall, and put a truss and about 6 lbs. of hay in the cart, for the horses; when I got to the watering-house I took one truss out to bait the horses, took as much as I thought necessary, and left the rest with the hostler till I returned; he gave my fellow-servant a shilling to get some ale. Next morning we were going for another load, he said he had no food for his horses, and I gave him some chaff for them. My master asked what I had in my cart, I said there was a little for my fellow-servant; on searching his cart two trusses were found. I declare I know nothing of it - they made him drunk to get him to say bad things against me.</p>

I locked it and put the key into my pocket - the prisoners were all in the house in the course of the day, but whether they were there when I went out, I do not know. I returned about twelve o'clock at night. Before I went out I was in the taproom - there was a great quantity of people there, smoking, I suppose twenty, or more. There was upwards of two dozen of Port, and two dozen of Sherry in the cellar - I saw it in the course of the day - there was some shrub and cloves also, On my return I found the brandy cask in the cellar turned upside down, and the bung out.

            . I am the mother of Blythe's wife, and was at his house on the 27th of February. I had lodged there for two months. I was in the bar in the evening - the prisoners were all there in the course of the day. Trumble and another man, who is not here, quarrelled and fought -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110006"/>they began fighting, and I sent them out, but they went over to the skittle-ground, and so did several others. While they were there I saw a man come out of the cellar; I laid hold of him - he is not here - he denied being in the cellar; he was just pushing the cellar door to when I laid hold of him. He had a chisel in his hand. He got from me, and ran away. There had been dancing and singing, and a great noise before the scuffle. I sent for Gilmore, who came and cleared the house - most of them were intoxicated. The gas light in the room was put out twice, but it was burning when the man came out of the cellar. I found a cask of shrub or cloves under the taproom table - it was taken out of the cellar.</p>

When I went to light the gas Trumble knocked me away from it, and prevented my lighting it. I usually sat in the box by the gas light, but was prevented by the dancing and disturbance. If I sat there I could see persons come out of the cellar - I saw nobody go there; I had no key. My master was not at home.</p>

               <p>"Now!" and then they all got up and danced. I saw Mrs. Acome lay hold of a person by the cellar door, which was partly open; I examined it, and found the lock wrenched off, and hanging by one nail - the bolt was not shot back. I saw Blyth lock the door before he went out, and put the key in his coat pocket, which hung up in a little room - the cellar door is in the corner of the taproom; they danced between the cellar door and the bar, so that while they danced we could not see the cellar door. Trumble was very much intoxicated. I saw Ward and Murphy there, in the course of the evening. All that were in the taproom were dancing, they made a very great noise, and jumped very high.</p>

The prisoner has come for the last two or three months to teach my daughter French, she is nine years old. On a Friday, I missed this watch off the dressing table in the bed room, I had seen it a day or two before; she had been to my house on the Tuesday or Wednesday; she usually gave her lessons in the parlour below stairs, I do not know that she was in the habit of going up stairs. I went to Bow-street, and had hand-bills distributed - the watch was produced by Cowlishaw. I then went to the prisoner's lodgings and had her apprehended. At her second examination, I saw her in the cell and she delivered me the chain, which was attached to the watch; I have not brought it here.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Wilkinson, a silversmith, in Piccadilly. About the 17th of February, the prisoner came to the shop and offered a watch for sale, I offered her six guineas for it, she said she was to have six guineas and a half for it, but I said I could give no more. I afterwards shewed it to Mr. Less. (I produce it.) I am sure she is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. There is nothing very particular in the watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. LEES. The watch is mine, I know it by its general appearance, the face is chased off just above the figure 12 - it is my wife's watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.- You know it by its being chased - A. Yes, by its general appearance, there was nothing very particular in it. I saw it on the Tuesday previous to the Friday it was produced. I have seven or eight female servants, my wife is a millener; the prisoner understands English very imperfectly. I should imagine she does not understand what is going on now. I did not buy it. I know the maker of the watch lived in Frith-street.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 3d of April, about a quarter before six, I was going down Dowgate-hill and saw Kerslake coming out of my place; he had a knot and prickle basket of bottles; when he got about twelve yards from the place I stopped him, took him back, and asked where he got them, he said he was taking them for Williams, I called Williams up, and I think he repeated it in his presence - Williams denied that he had given them to him. I took one bottle out of the prickle, I do not know how many there were, it appeared full - a prickle usually holds seventy-two bottles, which were worth about 24 s. I gave him in charge, and the officer thought it necessary to take Williams, I said I would answer for his appearance to-morrow; there were no other servants on the premises. Williams appeared intoxicated - he said Kerslake was frequently about there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. - Q. What sort of a place is it. - A. It was a place by itself, there are rooms above it. I found a vacancy were the bottles were taken from, the bottles were packed in hay, which is unusual; my horse was kept in the stable. Williams had a wound in his head, and is deaf, I think he must know they were taken - he sometimes has fits.</p>

My partner's hand-writing is on it, with the name of the person he took it from. I had not paid it away. I am certain it is the note - I kept it in a drawer, which I kept locked. I never paid the prisoner any money - her wages were not due.</p>

On the 6th of April, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, we missed a box, containing 20 lbs. of candles. I was passing through the warehouse, and saw a man take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110009"/>up a box, and run out with it. I immediately pursued, came up with him, and found it in his possession - it was the prisoner. It is worth 15 s.</p>

            . On the 13th of March I was in Cranbourne-passage a few minutes after twelve o'clock at night, and met the prisoner, Watson - I did not know her before; she came up, spoke to me, and requested me to go with her to her private lodging, which she said she had in Long-acre. I said as they were her private lodgings I would go. When I met her I was going towards Long-acre. I walked with her to Long-acre, we turned up <placeName id="t18210411-16-crimeloc98">Legg-alley, in Long-acre</placeName>

I said I do not think this is a private lodging, and I had rather not go in. She insisted that it was, and I went in with her, and followed her up stairs. When I saw the room I felt certain that it was not a private lodging, and said I would leave the room, for she had deceived me. She said</p>
               <p>"If you leave the house you must give me some liquor first, likewise pay for the use of the room, and give me some money." I refused - she went to the top of the stairs, and called,</p>
               <p>"Betty, fasten the door, and let no one out." She went down stairs, I followed her, and found she and the other woman had placed themselves against the door to prevent my going out. I asked why they would not let me out - she then pushed me back, and said, if I offered to stir, or to open the door, she would tear all my clothes to pieces; a man then made his appearance at the further end of the passage; she called, to him</p>
               <p>"Ned, come and see me righted." He came forward, and asked what the row was, and said he was the master of the house (it was the prisoner Garratt.) I said, if you are the master of the house, you had better let me out - these women are detaining me against my will, and if you suffer me to be detained it will be at your peril. He said, you had better pay, Sir; you must know before you came into the house, it was nothing more nor less than a b - dy house. I said I would not pay; he said, if that was the case he must go, and leave us to settle it among ourselves. He then turned away. I endeavoured to make my way between the two women, to get out, but they both pushed me back with their hands. I turned my head, and saw Garratt standing by my side - he then said</p>
               <p>"You will not pay, Sir, will you?" I said</p>
               <p>"No, I will not;" he struck me a violent blow on my body, which stopped my breath, and I fell speechless against the wall; he caught me by the arms, and forced me along the passage to the further end, when one of the women opened a back door, and I was forced through it into a back yard, the door was bolted after us. He then endeavoured to push me down - I said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake do not murder me;" and as soon as I found I had recovered my strength I called out Watch and murder! as loud as I could. He put up his hand to my mouth, and said</p>
               <p>"I will soon stop your calling." I pushed his hand from my mouth, and called out, a second time, Watch and murder! and directly after a watchman came at the door I was pushed through, and took him into custody. I found my hat was gone off my head, and told the watchman of it, and on searching for it, found it concealed under a water butt, in the back yard - I believe it went off in the scuffle. It was on my head when the scuffle began.</p>
               <p>COURT. This is not a robbery, your hat fell off.</p>

             BURCHALL. I am an officer of the Refuge for the Houseless, in Bishopsgate-street - the prisoner lodged there about ten nights. On the 7th of March the prosecutor came in, and said he had seen a man come out who had robbed him. On the 8th I sent for the prosecutor - he said the prisoner was the man, and claimed the shirt which he had on. I gave him in charge, and took the shirt off, when his friends supplied him with another; I produce it. I also produce a shirt which I got from the pawnbroker, in Drury-lane, he gave it up before the Magistrate, and a handkerchief, which I had from a pawnbroker's, at Brentford. The prosecutor gave me three duplicates.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. I got up about twelve o'clock on Monday night to come to London (I had gone to bed about seven.) I was getting something to eat before I went out, I was in the kitchen and heard a noise in the pantry, I went in and found the prisoner there; I had not been in the pantry before - it is part of the dwelling-house. I secured him but found nothing on him - he had got in through the iron bars of the pantry window. A pane of glass was taken out of the window near the handle, he could then reach and open the window, the bars were wide enough a-part to let a person of his size through. When the constable took him, I went outside and found the fat and suet under his great coat; I suppose he must have reached them out before he got in - I found a hat and coat under the pantry window, and under them a tin pan with the dripping and 2 lbs. of suet - he had no hat on when I found him - he claimed the hat and coat, there was an iron wrench on the suet. My mother was the last that went to bed that night - she is not here. I had been in the pantry a little before seven o'clock in the evening to get my supper, the window was then shut, the pane of glass safe, the pan of dripping and suet stood within reach of the window.</p>

               <p>"Yes, it is, it belongs to my master who is a pawnbroker;" and that he was carrying them home for his master, who had bought them of another pawnbroker who was selling off; that his master lived in East-street, and he was before him going home with another bundle; I took him to the watch-house with the bundle, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110011"/>attempted to get away from me, but I secured him, he was searched at the watch-house, and the flute found - I delivered the bundle to Coates.

I went with Payne to the Jacob's Well, public-house, in Charlotte-street, the landlord produced some spoons to me which Coates has.</p>

            . I now live in Beaumont-street, and am a shoemaker. At this time I lived at No. 29, Marylebone-lane, directly opposite the prosecutor's shop, which is at the corner of William-street. On Tuesday afternoon, the 6th of March, I took Jordan to his house. I had seen the three prisoner's in company about his house, I saw Jordan and Donald stand opposite a square of glass. I saw Jordan take an instrument from his pocket and do something to the glass; Steers stood four houses off. Jordan looked a little about him and walked a pace or two, and then came back and put his fingers through a hole he had made in the window and took six silver spoons out, then all three ran away, Jordan and Donald turned the corner, and I think Steers took an opposite direction. I ran after them, knocked Donald down, followed Jordan, he fell down by the Jacob's Well, public-house, and threw the spoons down into the cellar, the flap of which was open. I laid hold of him as he threw them down, took him into the public-house, and told the landlord, in his presence, that he had thrown the spoons into the cellar. I then took Jordan to Mr. Harris, and he was sent to the watch-house; I returned to the public-house with Harris, and the landlord produced the spoons. I took Donald two days after, I knew them all before by seeing them about - I had seen them all three together on the Sunday night, and on Monday morning, and on Monday afternoon I saw them together standing by Harris's window looking about, watching the shop. On the Wednesday morning, about ten o'clock, I and Coates followed Steers into a coffee-shop and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. On Tuesday afternoon when the spoons were taken, where was Steers. - A. Standing four doors off, I observed him for about ten minutes; I saw them all three come up together from Oxford-street way. I was standing at my father's door, they passed Harris's door two or three times before they stopped. Steers did not stop at the Oxford-street side of the house, but the other way.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On Wednesday, the 7th of March, I saw my mistress put the things into the window, the glass was whole and safe; at half-past eight o'clock in the morning. After the window was set out, I was going in to breakfast about nine o'clock, my mistress had gone to breakfast - my master was up stairs in his dressing-room. I was coming out of the kitchen, and looked in the shop as I passed through it, and saw the prisoner with another man at the window, I went down the shop nearer to the window and saw the prisoner in the act of pulling the muslin out of the window, and tucking it under his coat - he dragged it through a broken pane of glass. I ran to the door and cried Stop thief! they separated and ran off - I followed the prisoner. A man at a building stopped him, and took him to the Black Boy, public-house - he had got about a hundred yards, he was searched there; when he was first taken I saw him drop a piece of handkerchiefs in the dirt, I did not pick them up. When I got to the house I saw another piece of handkerchiefs and a piece of muslin taken from under his coat by Taylor.</p>

             re-examined. I know them by the private mark - I missed other things from the window, some Mecklin net and ribbon; my mistress told me the lace was missing - she is not here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. - Q. Did the person turn the corner, so that you might lose sight of him. - A. No, I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>MR. BOMMENAER. The three pieces of muslin cost me above 30 s.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was taken into the public-house, that man was there - the muslin was dropped in the street, how could he see me drop it; I was running after the thief, and got the muslin from him, they took me because I had the property. A carman came by who knew the man that took it.</p>

On Tuesday morning I saw Moores - he saw the mare, it remained at the stable till Tuesday, I was never with him when he saw the mare - it was in Harold's stable. There were more horses there - she was a dark brown Welch mare, fourteen hands and a half high, heavy in fold, had a star on her forehead, and a cut tail - I am sure it was my mothers. The prisoner lived for sixteen years very near our house, and has been about the place from time to time ever since; he was never absent above a month or two, I had seen him at Wooburn not long before.</p>

            . The prisoner and last witness came into Berkley-mews with the mare, the prisoner said he had got the mare for sale. I asked him the price, he said 6 l. - I asked if he would take less, he said No, that he had been offered 4 l. for her. I asked where he brought her from, he said from Wickham, that his uncle was dead, and had left him a cart, horse and harness, he had sold the cart and harness, and he wanted to sell the mare, being distressed for rent. I had him taken up, and put the mare in Harold's stable - she was a dark brown mare, and heavy in fold. I thought her worth 12 l., I was present when she was delivered to Mr. Rance - I saw him take her away after he had sworn to her.</p>

I owed the gentleman some money, his wife asked me many times for it; when I went out, I said I should get some money, I could not get it, and did not like to return, and went to lodge at another place, I soon found the officers were after me. I said I had only left my lodgings in debt; I got ill and went to the London hospital, I was in there the day that the prosecutrix says she met me, and was not able to move.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often have you seen the prisoner. - A. Four or five times. I do not know whether it was pawned by day or night - I am certain he pawned this seal. I know it was on the 2d of May, by the date of the duplicate; he usually came to me on a Saturday, he might come on other days - 26 s. is a fair price to lend on it.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and live in Brewhouse-yard, Shoe-lane, with my father, who is an upholsterer. I have known the prisoner about three months; in February last, I saw him in Fetter-lane, he asked me to pawn a set of fire-irons for him - he had them with him; he did not direct me to any particular pawnbroker's, I took them to Flemming's in Fleet-market, and pawned them in my own name for 5 s., and took him the money - he gave me 3 d. for my trouble. I found him still in Fetter-lane, at the corner of Greystoke-place, where I left him - I had known him about a month before that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What is your employment. - A. I had no employ, I was charged with this, and put in prison. I now live with Mr. Burton - I never left him. I knew the prisoner lived with Mr. Denham, but did not know that he stole them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you did not know what you were about. - A. I knew I was pawning fire-irons - I did not know I was doing wrong. I know a boy named Spires, he was taken to gaol also.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get out of custody, - A. I was bound over to appear against the prisoner - I was imprisoned about four days.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you suppose he came honestly by them. - A. I did not suppose any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODERICK. - Q. Where did you first become acquainted with him. - A. In Fetter-lane; there was a boy named Winston, who the prisoner knew, and he was acquainted with Spires - I have seen them together in Shoe-lane.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Denham, who lives at 102, Fetter-lane. I believe the irons to be the prosecutor's, there is no mark on them, but the paper has our<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110015"/>private mark on it, in the hand-writing of Mr. Wiltshire, who was formerly in the employ of Mr. Carter, whom Mr. Denham succeeded in business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was shopman when Mr. Carter had the business. - A. Yes, he was never in partnership with Denham. I know the paper was once in the possession of Mr. Denham, or Mr. Carter, and was used to wrap irons in; if they have good paper round them, we probably send them out in it when we sell them, we perhaps sell fifty pair in a year - they may have been sold, I did not miss any, I cannot say what number the stock consists of. I never saw Smith in the shop - the shop joins Greystoke-place.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODERICK. Q. Have the irons been used at all. - A. They are quite new. The prisoner was in Mr. Denham's employ for about three months as errand boy, since Christmas, he had access to the stock - we have five servants.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You only swear to the paper. - A. No, the irons are quite new; they may have been two or three years in the shop for what I know. I should think they must have been two years, as they are not modern.</p>

            . I am ward beadle. On the 15th of March, I was fetched, and took the prisoner in custody. He was called into his master's room, and charged with dishonesty, which he denied for a long time; I left the room with a friend of the prosecutor's to consult about it, the prosecutor then said he had confessed it - I heard no confession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. - Q. Why were you sent out of the room. - A. I was not sent out, I went out to consult about it, as the prisoner denied it. Mr. Denham told me, in the prisoner's hearing, that he had confessed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prosecutor tell you he was desirous of getting a confession, as he had no other means, not being able to swear to them - A. He said no such thing - he said he did not know he was robbed till he was told of it - the prisoner did not deny having confessed it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he request you to be present at any time or place - A. No.</p>

On arriving at the end of the lane leading to Chalk Farm, about eight or half-past eight o'clock, we went towards the fields - it was moonlight.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you arrived at the spot you afterwards reached, did you hear the report of a pistol - A. I did not; I reached the top of the hill, and saw four gentlemen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110016"/>in the neighbouring field, two of them were walking back wards, and the two others by the side of the hedge, between the bill and the field. I heard the knocking of pistols, the priming of pistols, and the shutting of the pan - soon after shots were exchanged.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean - A. Both pistols were fired. I heard the sound, and saw the flash; I then heard an exclamation from one of the gentlemen on the ground, as if wounded. I got over the hedge, and found Mr. Scott on his knees, on the ground - he pointed out to me that he was wounded on the right side - the other gentlemen were supporting him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation between them - A. Not till I had examined Mr. Scott. I partly undressed him, and examined the wound - Mr. Scott was fainting. One of the gentlemen came up to him, and took him by hand - I cannot say which gentleman it was; he expressed a wish that he had himself been in his situation rather that Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>Q. On Mr. Scott's recovery, did he say any thing - A. He addressed those around him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Whatever may be the result of this case, I beg you all to bear in remembrance that every thing has been fair and honourable." During the time I was making further examination of the wound, an altercation commenced between two other gentlemen on the ground, one of them was Mr. Patmore. I am not at all acquainted with the person of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you state what passed - A. I did not distinctly hear the whole of the conversation. I heard Mr. Patmore exclaim,</p>
               <p>"Then why was it not communicated to me - I knew nothing of it." During the altercation between the other two, the third, which was the person who first addressed Mr. Scott, came up and enquired what I thought of the wound, whether I regarded it as fatal. Mr. Scott was at that time in a state of fainting. I replied,</p>
               <p>"That conceiving the ball to have perforated the cavity of the abdomen, I feared it was mortal." The gentleman was in great agony, wringing his hands, and exclaimed, in words, as nearly as I can recollect,</p>
               <p>"Good God, why was I permitted to fire a second time, I fired down the field, and could do no more." I cannot recollect any thing else that passed on the spot. I had examined the wound on his recovery from fainting. I thought it best that he should be removed to town, gave orders to that effect, and went to prepare for his reception. I saw him again next day, and every day till his death. In my judgment the wound was the cause of his death. He was not brought to London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. You mentioned that the gentleman said, Good God, &amp;c. did he not add,</p>
               <p>"When I fired down the field, the first time I was compelled to fire in my own defence" - A. He said words to that effect, but the precise words I cannot state. He appeared in the greatest agony that a man could; the attention that all the gentlemen paid to the deceased was all that kind and humane friends could do - it was as great as it possibly could be. I placed him on the shutter, and the gentlemen conveyed him down the field to the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I observe in your deposition you mentioned the gentlemens' names, had you any knowledge of either of them - A. I had not; the night, though moonlight, was particularly foggy. I stated their names from what I understood. On my oath, I have no knowledge of either of the two persons in the field.</p>

             MORRIS. I am pupil to Mr. Pettigrew. I accompanied him to Chalk farm. As we went towards the bill I distinctly heard the report of a pistol - I only heard one sound; I went to the spot from whence it came, and reached the hedge before Mr. Pettigrew, but not the spot in question, till after. I pursued a tract by the side of the hedge, Mr. Pettigrew went on an eminence - I did not arrive on the spot until after him; I heard a noise, like the ramming of pistols, and saw two heads above the hedge; I ascended the hill, and observed two gentlemen at a distance presenting a pistol at each other; at that moment they fired, and the gentleman nearest to me on the left, fell on his knees - I assisted to raise him up with Mr. Pettigrew, and Mr. Pettigrew examined his wound; a gentleman came up at that time, took Mr. Scott's hand, and exclaimed, that he wished he was in Mr. Scott's situation - I should not know that gentleman again, I am certain of it. A conversation ensued between two gentlemen, one of whom was Mr. Patmore, the other I do not know. Mr. Pettigrew ordered me to run and get the postchaise brought up; I brought the chaise - I had to pass the farm, and was there stopped. I remained there sometime, then returned, and found them bringing the deceased on a shutter - there were four or five bringing him - I cannot say who they were; I can only recognize one, and that is Mr. Christie; I recognize him as having been in the room at the house after Mr. Scott was brought in - he must have accompanied Mr. Scott on the shutter; I cannot say whether he was one of the gentlemen in the field. I attended Mr. Scott till further assistance came.</p>

            . I am the landlord of Chalk Farm tavern. On the evening this affair happened, about a quarter past nine o'clock, two gentlemen called, and had a bottle of wine in the parlour. I should not know them again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they disguised - A. No, my Lord; I did not go into the parlour while they were there. I did not serve them.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. Very little of the wine was drank - A. Oh, yes; near two-thirds of it; they went away, and went down the lane, towards the Hampstead road, which is the main road to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect after this an alarm being given of an accident happening - A. Yes, it was a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the two gentlemen left - Smith, Rutherford, and I think Ryan, the hostler, were in my house at this time; I desired them to take a shutter to assist the gentlemen - the wounded gentleman was afterwards brought to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any persons accompany him, who had been at your house before. - A. I cannot say whether either of them were the two who had the wine, I remember that these gentlemen, the prisoners, were two who accompanied Mr. Scott into my house, and stopped to assist in getting him into bed, and Mr. Christie soon after went away. They most certainly conducted themselves with the greatest humanity towards Mr. Scott. Mr. Traile went away I think in an hour or more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards hear an alarm of an accident in the field. - A. Yes, it might be a quarter of an hour after. I went to the field with a shutter; I found Mr. Scott there, and four or five more gentlemen stood together about thirty yards off, I called to them, they came up directly, I put him on a shutter with their assistance, he was taken to Chalk Farm, one or two of the gentlemen held his feet, and I had hold of his shoulder; we conveyed him to the Farm, the gentlemen I found in the field all went with me. I believe every one went into the house.</p>

            . I am a physician, and reside in Brunswick-square. I was called on by Mrs. Scott, to attend Mr. Scott, between twelve and one o'clock on Saturday, in the middle of the night. Mr. Scott's Christian name was John. I found him suffering from the wound he had received; he was sensible, he was certainly in great danger. I communicated my opinion to him, he asked if his wound was necessarily mortal - he was told that it was not necessarily mortal, but it was next to that; he was informed that it was just possible, that his intestines had not been perforated by the ball, in which case there might be a recovery, otherwise there was little hope.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The enquiry now is directed particularly to the communication made to him, not to the opinion you formed. - A. I communicated to him, that it was possible the ball might have passed, without perforating the intestines, in which case, a recovery was possible; he afterwards enquired of Mr. Guthrie, the surgeon, in my presence, his words as near as I can recollect were</p>
               <p>"I have only one question to ask, is my wound necessarily mortal?" Mr. Guthrie answered not necessarily (this was before the ball was extracted). Mr. Guthrie added, that it was a case necessarily of the greatest danger, but he had seen a recovery from similar wounds. Mr. Scott replied</p>
               <p>"I am satisfied," and laid down.</p>
               <p>Q. He had raised himself up then. - A. He had just raised himself up from the pillow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any further communication made by yourself or Mr. Guthrie, to Mr. Scott, as to the condition he was in. - A. To the best of my knowledge not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some conversation with Mr. Scott, on the subject of what passed in the field. - A. After that I had - he made a statement on that subject to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the statement made immediately after your conversation, or subsequent. - A. My conversation to him was when I first called to see him, and on my visit next morning, he made the statement to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any further conversation relating to the danger of his situation. - A. Nothing that I know of, this was on Saturday - the ball was extracted on Sunday.</p>
               <p>The Court ruled, that Mr. Scott's statement could not be given in evidence, as it was uncertain that he considered himself at the point of death.</p>
               <p>MR. CHRISTIE. My counsel will call some witnesses who will say, whether through life, from my habits or character, I am likely to have committed murder.</p>
               <p>MR. TRAILL. I am represented by two gentlemen far more experienced than myself, who I shall leave it to.</p>
               <p>(A numerous body of most respectable witnesses gave both the gentlemen an unusually excellent character, for humanity and good temper through life.</p>

I saw three horses coming up the road, two men were on two of them, the other was led horse, the prisoner was leading it, and riding another, galloping up the road. I saw him fifteen or twenty yards from the old gentleman - the other man passed him without hurting him; the prisoner came up, and the chest of the horse he was riding, ran against the man and knocked him down, that caused the horse and the prisoner to fall together.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body called to the old man - A. Several people called to him - so did the prisoner, and tried to stop his horse, but he could not - he sung out</p>
               <p>"Hoy," for the man to get out of the way - I do not think the old man heard him - he was about fifteen yards off when he called.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he try to pull up, when he was fifteen yards off - A. He tried but could not. I ran to the old gentleman and helped him on a shutter - he was very badly wounded on the temple - his head was fractured very much. We took him to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, I remained there half an hour - he never spoke, I saw his body the next night - he was then dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. How far were the horses from you when you first saw them - A. About twenty yards, the man had a cap on - I do not know whether it prevented his hearing, the prisoner did all he could to pull up, he was very much hurt himself, and it was ten to one he was not killed - he was leaning on his right hand, and had only the left to pull with.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The other man was galloping too - A. Yes, it is a populous neighbourhood.</p>

            . I saw the accident. Three horses were galloping on a-breast, and were about twenty yards from the deceased when I first saw them; the horse knocked him down - I picked him up - he was laying almost double, and bleeding at the nose very bad, his temple was fractured and his eye bruised. I carried him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110018"/>to the hospital, he died in about three quarters of an hour - he never spoke after he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the passenger's call to him to stop - A. Yes, and I think one of the men on the horses called, he endeavoured to stop his horse just as he came abreast of Cromer-street, but could not; the prisoner was hurt very much, it is a wonder he was not killed himself - the old man fell, and then the horse and prisoner fell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Another man was riding with me, the horse the other man was riding slipped and ran away with him, then my led horse began galloping, which caused the other to start as well; I kept pulling them as hard as I could, but the more I pulled, the more they ran. I never saw the man till I got within three or four yards of him, as I was noticing the horses all the time; when I saw what danger I was in, I called out stop as well as I could.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On Sunday morning, the 11th of March, the prisoner came to clean the boots, as he was accustomed - it was about half-past ten o'clock. I took the boot to him in the workshop, in the yard, and laid them down at the door for him. I saw him take them up, and go into the workshop; he did not sleep in the house at that time. I did not see him again until I saw him at Marlborough-street. I went into the workshop to send him on an errand, about a quarter of an hour after I took the boots, but he was gone - the four pair of boots were gone also. Nobody had been in the shop that morning. I have not seen them since - they had been worn; and repaired. I should have given about 4 s. for them, if I was to buy them. Nothing else was missed that morning.</p>
               <p>MR. TURNERELLI re-examined. My boots were worth about 30 s. altogether. A suit of livery was missed that morning, but I do not know when it was taken. There is a back door to the shop, which he might unbolt and let himself out. I never saw the livery after it was in the press.</p>
               <p>JOHN MURTY. I work for the prosecutor. I met the prisoner about a week after he left, and asked him why he did not come to the shop to work - he said he would not come again, because he had taken some clothes and boots.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HARMAM. I was present when the prosecutor gave a suit of livery into the care of the prisoner. It was about a fortnight before he left the house. I saw the prisoner put them into a press in the prosecutor's study.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was cast away on the coast of Cornwall. I walked to town, and applied to the prosecutor for work, which he gave me, at 1 s. a day. I came on this day as usual, the maid brought me four pair of boots; I laid them on the bench in the back shop, and went out to breakfast; I met a friend, who told me of a better place, at Greenwich, where I could get more wages. My master had told me to leave if I could better myself. I went to Greenwich about it, and did not return to clean the boots. I did not succeed, and did not like to return, thinking he would not employ me. I shut the door when I left, and did not steal the boots. I have been fourteen years in his Majesty's service.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 8th of April, I rose about six o'clock, and found the tiles taken off the wash-house, and the plaister broken through - it is a low building in the yard, enclosed with the dwelling house, and a door leads from the dwelling house to it. I was the last person up that night, and went to bed a quarter before eleven - I am sure the house was all shut up and fastened. I have two sons and two daughters, they were all a-bed before me; the hole was made large enough to admit a person's body. I missed five papers of halfpence, each containing five shillings, and a few loose halfpence, which were tied up in a seive cloth, and about a pound of tobacco, worth 5 s. per pound at the selling price - the cloth was worth 6 d.</p>

We walked together to Liquorpond-street - I called on a coachmaker, a customer, in Lamb's Conduit-street, he waited at the door the while - I knocked at the coachmaker's door, he came out, and we went to a public-house, at the corner of Great Ormond-street, close by - I asked the prisoner to come in with us, and he did - I had some cloves and gin, and paid for all that we had - I then proceeded on with the prisoner, (the person I called on went home,) we went on talking together till we got to Tottenham Court-road - he said he was unfortunate and out of employment, or, as I had treated him, he would treat me, but he had no money. We went into the Black-horse, Tottenham Court-road - I had some cloves and gin, and he had a glass of rum - I paid for it, and we went on - I was going to Clements's New Inn-yard, Tottenham Court-road, to carry a message from Mr. Pointer, (the coach-maker I had called on) to a wheeler in the yard. I pulled out my watch, found it was late, and would not go - I turned up Goodge-street to go home - I went on till I came to <placeName id="t18210411-34-crimeloc210">Upper Rathbone-place</placeName>

When I fell, I called Watch and Stop thief! a young man assisted me up, and said the man was taken - I went to Mr. Fountain's public-house, at the corner of Rathbone-place - I believe it is the Marquis of Granby. I found the prisoner there, he was taken to the watch-house - I saw my watch in the possession of the watch-house keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man who came up to you in Hatton Garden, walked on with you, and had hold of your arm when you received the blow - A. Yes; I cannot swear that he gave me the blow, but I am sure he had hold of my arm at the time - he took hold of my arm before I received the blow (in Tottenham Court-road) and had hold of it when I received the blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were walking arm-in-arm, as any two men might be - A. Yes; I had been drinking, and was inebriated, I was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not fall down once or twice during your walk - A. Not to my knowledge; I did not fall in Hatton-garden, my foot slipped; he walked with me all the way - I halloed out instantly on receiving the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. You went down Goodge-street into Upper Rathbone-place; if you meant to have gone home through Rathbone-place, you might have gone through Charlotte-street - A. People do not always go the nearest way; Upper Rathbone-place is darker than Charlotte-street; Fountain's is a very few yards from where I received the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say when you saw him, that is not the man that struck me, I am sure - A. Not that I know - I was in liquor. I said I could not believe he was the man who could do it. I received the blow on my right eye, on the edge of the bone - he stood on my right side, his arm being within mine. It was after nine o'clock when I looked at my watch.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say he was with you up to the instant you received the blow - A. He was; and when I recovered and rose, he was gone.</p>

            . I was sergeant of the watch, and was stationed in Charles-street, Rathbone-place; I heard a cry of Watch! when I was at the corner of Rathbone-place, and Percy-street, and I went towards the cry - heard a call of Stop thief! and in hardly half a minute I saw the prisoner running by Fountain's, as fast as he could go - a man was close behind him, and tried to stop him - he swung round his arm, and I collared him; a person came out of Fountain's and said he had broken a window - we took him into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110020"/>the bar - a young woman went out and brought in a watch, which she put into Fountain's hand - a young man came in, and desired me to detain the prisoner, for he had knocked a man down, and robbed him of his watch; he went out and said he would help the prosecutor in, as he was so much hurt, he was hardly able to come along; he went out, and brought the prosecutor in; directly he came in, he looked at the prisoner, doubled his fist and said,</p>
               <p>"you are the man that knocked me down, and robbed me of my watch." Fountain, at this time, had the watch in the bar - it was not shewn to him till he got to the atch-house - he then claimed it.</p>
               <p>Q. You met him running; before you stopped him, had you met or seen any other person - A. Not a soul; I did not hear the prisoner say any thing - there was a cry of Stop thief! behind him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You crossed diagonally from one pavement to the other - A. Yes; when I came up, the prisoner was half way between Fountain's and Percy coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not another person have been before him, and you not see him - A. The street was quite clear, my face was towards Fountain's, I know nobody passed before him; the young man who tried to lay hold of him was not above two yards from him when I came up. He went to the door of the public-house - whether he went in or not, I cannot say; somebody came out, and said the window was broken before I took him into the house, but the watch was found afterwards.</p>

Muers came in after the watch was brought in - he saw the prisoner, and said, you are the man who knocked me down and robbed me.

It was about thirty feet from me - I am sure the prosecutor said the prisoner was the man, but when he was going to sign the charge at the watch-house, the prisoner said, you are not going to sign a charge against me, I am not the man; he said, I know you are not; he afterwards said he was - he was so intoxicated, he hardly knew what he said.</p>

            . I am a constable; about seven o'clock on the 12th of March, I was at the corner of Paul's-alley. The prosecutor had hold of Lynch - he said he was robbed of his chain and seals - I took the prisoner to the Compter, where I searched him, and found no chain on him. The prosecutor said the prisoner was the person who prevented his taking the thief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner say, he ran against him, and so he laid hold of him - A. I did not hear it at all - I heard him say, what did you lay hold of me for?</p>

My mother sent me to my aunt's about seven o'clock - she lay dangerously ill, in Paul's-alley - on my arriving at the corner of the alley, the prosecutor was walking by me - he turned round, and accused me of running against him. He said, have you seen what has happened? I said No. He said, I beg your pardon for running against you. He stopped a few minutes, then said I am robbed of my chain by a boy, and I imagine you was in his company. I said no, there was no person in company with me - I gave him my address, he collared me, and I submitted, without the least resistance, knowing my innocence.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser, and live in Leadenhall-street; at past seven o'clock on Thursday morning, the 5th of April, I was going up the street, to dress a gentleman, and saw the prisoner Richard standing at Mrs. Cartwright's door; before I came up to him, I suspected him, and directly I came up to him, he stepped into the shop, and took a paper bag - the other prisoner was in the shop at the time; I turned round, and Richard kept turning round, and looking at me, quite agitated. At the time he took the bag Charles stood on the mat, within a yard of him - it could not have been done without his seeing him. I went into the shop immediately Richard was gone, and enquired of Charles what man that was who took the parcel out of the shop? He said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, There has nobody taken any thing, I have seen nobody." I said</p>
               <p>"There has, and I know the person." He said</p>
               <p>"There was a parcel on the counter, and it is gone - but I did not see any person take it." I told him I should return after I dressed a gentleman, and I would see to the bottom of it, as I had been often robbed myself. I told the servant - she went to fetch her mistress down. After I had been on my business, I returned to the shop, saw Mrs. Cartwright, and told her, in his hearing, what had been done - I told her to keep him, and I would return. I went again at half past ten o'clock, found Richard there, and said, he was the man.</p>

            . I am an officer; I apprehended Richard at his father's house, in Colchester-street, Whitechapel - he was in bed. I said I wanted him for stealing a bag of wafers that morning - he got up, and took me to a house in Lambert-street, Goodman's-fields - he went into the parlour, and asked for the bag he had left there that morning. The bag was produced, containing 5 lbs. of wafers.</p>

My watch was then in my fob, I saw the prisoner advancing towards me, at a quick pace, and when he came even with me, I felt my watch going very gently - he hardly made any stop - I had hold of my wife's arm, and had an umbrella in my other hand. I turned round and saw the back of the case of my watch in the prisoner's hand; he darted away; I went after him, and cried Stop Thief! There was a great noise of carriages. I saw him for several yards, but could not come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110022"/>up with him. I did not see him stopped, he got out of my sight as the carriages intervened; I ran round the carriages, and found him in custody of the next witness, who had my watch. I am quite sure it was the prisoner who took it.</p>

            . I am a carver and gilder; I was at the head of the procession, it was the Society of Odd Fellows, going to the East London Theatre. I saw the prisoner running, two others were running behind him; the others tried to obstruct me in pursuing the prisoner. I directly got between them and shoved them away, and pursued the prisoner. He ran backwards and forwards several times. I at last stopped him, near the bridge; he had his left hand in his left hand breeches pocket, part of the watch chain was out of his pocket; I shoved him back on the pavement, he fell, and the watch fell out of his hand. I picked it up, Byron came up in a minute or two, and asked if I had got the watch. I said I had - he claimed it, and said the prisoner was the person, but he did not wish to prosecute him.</p>

I heard a strange foot coming down stairs, I got up as quick as possible to see who it was, but before I got to the door, the street door was opened and shut. I opened it and went out, and saw the prisoner going through a court opposite my door. I overtook her, I said,</p>
               <p>"Ma'am, who did you want in the house you have just come out of?" she said she only went into the passage, to tie up her stocking, I asked what she had in her apron, she said Nothing; I pulled it open and found the articles stated in the indictment. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have been robbing my house of them;" she gave different accounts. I took her back to the house, and sent for an officer who took her.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Harlington, near Harmondsworth. On the 1st of April, between four and five in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner with a live duck in his apron, about 100 yards from Mr. Sadler's. I went after my brother's horse, and as I returned, I found him breaking the duck's neck; I passed him, looked back and saw him going towards the dung heap. I went home and told my brother, and told White; we went together to the dung-heap, and found the duck concealed there - it was the same I saw him with - it was not quite cold then. I had known the prisoner five or six years; he was taken up the same evening. I am certain it was the same sort of duck as that I saw him with.</p>

On the 24th of March, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to the coach-office, and brought the box containing this money home. I opened the box in the shop and took it into the back room, to count ready for the clerk when he came - the room joins the shop. I have a little warehouse behind. I found it all right, and put it in separate papers, and put it in a chest in the middle room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put it in the box in which it came - A. No, I put it in a chest, my wife came in the room at the time I was counting it. Johnson and the other prisoner, who is my son, were in the house at the time, passing backwards and forwards; they were filling a water butt, which my son had asked him to assist in filling - he was an acquaintance of my son's; his father is in the spinning way. I went up stairs for five minutes or more, as I had left a glue pot on the fire. When I came down, I believe they were still in the house, but cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them after you came down - A. Yes, I saw them several times in the course of the morning, going backwards and forwards; then both went away before the clerk came, which was about eleven o'clock. I do not think they left half an hour before that; when they left, one went to the right and the other to the left; they did not go out at the same time. I think my son went out first, the other about a quarter of an hour afterwards. When the clerk came for the money, I went to the chest, and found it was gone. I had left the key in the box; I wrote to inform the prosecutors of the loss - there was nobody in the house except them and my wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Who came in or went out while you was up stairs, you cannot tell - A. Nobody came in to my knowledge. I opened the box on the shop-board, any one passing might see it, but I did not undo the papers till I got into the room; they were wrapped up in paper, and string round them. I did not shut the back room door - the clerk came about eleven o'clock. My son left the house about an hour and a half after the parcel arrived. They surrendered themselves before the Magistrate. My wife told my son of the loss immediately as we missed it - he declared he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the room was the chest - A. Close by the door leading from the shop - the shop door was open.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Could any one in the street have seen you put the property in the chest in the back room - A. I should think not.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoners into custody. I found Walker at his father's house, on Saturday, the 31st of March - he was in his business. I examined the lower room, the chest was pointed out to me; I observed its situation, and think it was not possible to be seen from the street - I did not go into the street to look; it was placed in a nook on the left hand of the door. I believe the hinges of the door are on the right.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was the extremity of the box from the door - A. About nine inches. I should think there was not more than sufficient room for a person to stand between the box and the opening of the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the shop door in the middle - A. The shop door is on the left hand, and the room door on the right; there is not a direct view through the two doors. a person looking through the window, can see into the shop.</p>

I marked them myself; I am not certain whether it was a cross, or down the nose. After searching the hedges and ditches, we found the skin and a head under a hedge; in the ditch of the same field, in consequence of the rain we bad had two or three days previous, I was enabled to trace footsteps from the field the sheep were in, across the farm, on the road which leads from Bull's-cross to Cotton-gate, and down by the side of the road, then across three or four other fields, to the back of some cottages, in one of which the prisoner lives. I cut up one of the footsteps, so as to preserve it; I have the sod here. I compared it with the rest - they were all like it. I also compared it with the prisoner's shoe, before the magistrate; I have his shoe here - I think it exactly fits it. I did not attempt to trace the footsteps farther than his house. I traced them to his house. I missed the sheep on Sunday. Jessopp and Shearing were with me. The prisoner was not at home, his wife was there - I knew her before. We found half a sheep in a closet under the stairs, covered with fire wood; it was cut up in joints; the entrails and feet were left in the skin; the joints of meat were compared with the feet, before the magistrate (Mr. Harvey), on the Monday - they exactly corresponded. The prisoner was taken up directly. We found him in an adjoining cottage, standing talking to his neighbour.</p>

            . I am a constable; I went to search the house, with a warrant, on Sunday, with Mr. Bottomley. I know it to be the prisoner's house. I found half a sheep in the cupboard under the stairs, it was in separate joints. All was wrapped up in a piece of cloth and fire wood put on them. It was not warm, but it had been killed a very short time - the blood was scarcely drained from it. I compared the joints with the skin; the head and feet were left in the skin - the joints answered to the feet. I have the joints here, and produce them. I believe them to belong to the same animal. Some of the bones were split, they were not jointed well. I am convinced it was the same animal. I produce his shoe.</p>

On Monday evening, the 5th of March, about eight o'clock, I was down in the kitchen, my mistress was sitting in the parlour, my fellow-servant was in the kitchen with me; there was a fire in the neighbourhood, and my mistress ran up stairs to see it; she called me, and I ran up to the two pair of stairs, I perceived the trap-door thrown down, which led to my room - we go up a step-ladder to it, there was a tiling over the trap door; I could have opened the trap-door. My mistress's is a corner house, at the end of the row, it joins the next house; a person could come from one roof to the other; the next house was uninhabited. I ran down stairs into the street, and called out there were thieves in the house. I saw Mr. Raccine, who was coming to our house, to spend the evening. I and Mr. Raccine went up stairs into the rooms, and saw the clothes laying on the top of the tiles - they were my clothes and my fellow servant's. They were in drawers under my box. The constable took them. I saw two men come out of the empty house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this - After I came down stairs with Mr. Raccine. We went out into the street, and saw two men come out of the empty house, it was about five minutes after I heard the trap-door shut. Mr. Raccine took the first that came out, it was the prisoner. I did not know him before, the other ran away. I lost eight gowns, eight pair of stockings, three petticoats, and some caps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What communication was there between this and the next house - A. There are trap-doors on the roof. I was up stairs ten minutes before. The trap-door leads to our bed-room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Nobody at the top of the house could get to the trap-door without breaking in - A. They must break our bed-room window to get in. I was in the room between four and five o'clock; the window was then fastened with a bolt, as usual. I found it open after the alarm. Nobody was up stairs after I saw it bolted. They did not break the window, but forced it open.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You saw it fastened between four and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110025"/>and five o'clock - A. Yes; nobody went up afterwards, except my fellow-servant. My mistress is an old lady - she never goes up there - the ladder leads to it. The bundle of clothes was given in at the window to me - I gave it to the constable, without opening it.</p>

On Wednesday, the 7th of March, about half past six o'clock in the evening - it was rather dusky - I found my shop window either cut or broken, and about thirty volumes of books stolen. There were three volumes of Lord Byron's Works, octavo, bound in green morocco, gilt leaves, which cost me 4 l. 4 s.; one octavo, and two minion Bibles, bound - the first worth 1 l. and the two others 7 s. each; also part of a set of Lord Bacon's Works, six volumes, worth 3 l. 3 s.; - four were left; I lost other books. I do not suppose they could carry away all at once. I was in the shop at the time, and heard a noise, but as it rained I thought it was the umbrellas knocking against the window. I was alarmed ten minutes after, they were all taken, at one time, I had seen them safe, and the window quite perfect, about half past four o'clock. Next day I saw part of them at Bow-street. They had my mark in them, in my own writing. I have recovered all but one Bible. I received the octavo Bible, and Hoyle's Games, from Ackerman on the night of the robbery.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On Wednesday evening, the 7th of March, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner Davis in Oxford-street, near Chapel-street, on the opposite side to Rathbone-place, near the Pantheon, coming from that way - he had some bound books under his arm - he passed me. A short time after I saw him again without them. I passed on and spoke to two brother officers - I then crossed over the street, and saw Davis come from Chapel-street again. He crossed the street, as if going towards Rathbone-place. He was hardly out of my sight a moment, before he returned with Pickering. They both ran into Chapel-street again - they had nothing with them then. We followed them, and saw them go into Ackerman's, which is a rag shop - and as soon as he went in, the door was pulled to, and Ackerman stood outside of it. Read rushed by him, and got into the shop, and there we found the two prisoners. Ackerman said to me,</p>
               <p>"Take these fellows away, and them books," pointing down to the same books, which laid on some rags, all loose on the counter. We then secured the prisoners. I produce the books. Pickering denied any knowledge of them, and Davis said, he had been employed to bring them there, at three different times, by a man on the other side of the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Davis was alone when he had the books - A. He was.</p>

               <p>THOMAS ROBERTS. I am a carpenter - I was with Davis, and saw the prisoner, with a parcel of books under his arm. I afterwards saw him and Pickering cross from Rathbone-place way. They ran across - Davis was first, and Pickering followed him to Chapel-street. They were about half a yard apart - they appeared together. I saw them both go into Chapel-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Davis was alone when he had the books - Yes, it had been raining, and looked heavy, when they were running. I saw them together in the shop.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>DAVIS'S Defence. I was going down Oxford-street, about six o'clock, and met a genteel looking man, who asked me to carry the parcel. I carried it to this house as he told me. I untied the handkerchief, and took it back to him. He gave me another parcel - I took three in all. I then went back, but could not find him - I returned back to the shop, to know where I was to be paid - the officers came in and took me.</p>

I asked him for the money for the bed - he said he should not go to bed, he should sit down and write. I went to the room about ten o'clock next morning, the sheets were then gone, and the key of the bed-room door; he had locked it, and taken the key with him - we opened it with another key. He slept in the room No. 24.</p>

It was not the prisoner, another person picked it up and ran away. I do not believe he is the person. Some person had got hold of my coat. I made a grasp with my right hand, but could not hold him. I struck at him with my stick - I think I marked him with the blow.</p>

He brought a black coat tied up in a shawl, I asked if he knew what he had left in the pocket of the trowsers which he sold to me? He said he did not know he had left any thing - and he would thank me for it. He had left two duplicates and a letter directed to the prosecutor. I said I could not buy the coat till I knew whether he got it honestly - and asked if he knew the Jolly Butchers, in Warwick-lane - as the letter was directed there. I took him to the Jolly Butchers.</p>

            , I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 21st of February, about half-past nine o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in Capel-street, St. George's in the East, with a bag on his shoulder. I untied it, and found two loaves of sugar. I asked him where he got it - he said he kept a shop, and I should find it all right. He equivocated, and I took him to the watch-house. He said he had it from Macdougal, in Charlotte-street, Whitechapel. Gooding went and enquired - he returned, and told the prisoner Macdougal denied his buying any sugar of him. After some conversation, he said he found it in Thornhaugh-street - there was a brown paper on the sugar - the direction on it led me to Mr. Capel's. There was also 7 lbs. of salt.</p>

I called him aside into the pantry with me - I said I had come on very unpleasant business, and asked him if he had any of his master's property - He said he had nothing. I searched, and found in a cupboard over where he slept, a box containing twelve bottles of wine, each had a napkin round it. I afterwards found ten more, in all twenty-two bottles - and two of brandy, and some tea. Mr. Capel asked how he could do such a thing - he said he was very sorry for it. I searched here and found two bunches of keys.</p>

The prisoner lived with us six or seven months, and left on the 26th of February. I believe my father gave him warning. I know King, her father is a silk dresser in our neighbourhood. On the 1st of December last, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, she came to our house for change for a 25 l. note - I gave her change. I was in the bar, and went up stairs to my mother, and got change. I wrote her father's name on the face of the note -</p>
               <p>"Mr. King, Worship-street, December 1, 1820," - and put it in the till, which I did not lock. The bar will not hold above two or three people - Our friends sometimes go in. My mother came into the bar at three o'clock - I had been out of the bar into the tap-room, several times before that, I do not know whether any one went in while I was absent, as I cannot see the bar from the tap-room. The prisoner and female servant used to go into the bar, to draw beer, and fill pipes of tobacco. When my mother came at three o'clock, she looked in the till I looked also, and found the note was gone. I do not recollect asking the prisoner about it. He remained in my father's service till the 21st of February.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Clifton-street, Finsbury-market. The prisoner used to bring me beer from the prosecutor's. About the 1st of February he had a pair of boots of me. He came to pay me for them one day, I cannot tell the day - he put his hand in his pocket, pulled something out, and then paid me 16 s. or 18 s. in silver. He pulled out at the same time, what appeared to me to be a piece of an old newspaper, which he left on my floor, and went away. He returned in about fifteen or twenty minutes, and said he had lost something - and then looking towards the place, said,</p>
               <p>"Here it is" - taking up the paper, he opened it. I was sitting at dinner, and could not see whether it was a 25 l. note, or what, but he said it was a 25 l. note. I could see it was neither a 1 l. 5 l. or 10 l.</p>

I went and apprehended the prisoner, in company with Attfield and another person, on the 13th of March, at No. 1, Luke-street, about two hundred yards from Weston's house. We found him there. I told him what I wanted him for. I was searching his box - he said, there was no occasion to search his box. One of his sisters said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, if you know any thing about it, tell Mr. Weston." I said nothing to induce him to say anything. One of his sisters wanted to go out. I told Mr. Weston to let no one out. He then said the boy at the White Hart, Clifton-street, had got the 25 l. note. He did not say who the boy was. I left him in Attfield's care, went to the White Hart, and found Charles Paveley there, and told him what the prisoner had said. He pulled out his pocket-book and gave me this 25 l. note. He said he could not read, and had never looked at it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know he cannot read - Q. I do not know. We missed the note on the 1st of December, and found it about the 13th of March. He left me in February. I keep the house myself - it is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch.</p>

               <p>"I will give you 2 l. 10 s. more for these things than I offered you before," they talked together about clothes for some time. I was behind the counter, he told the Jew to go about his business, he would have no concern with him. He and the Jew both stepped out, leaving the bundle on the counter; the Jew came in alone, and asked me to try to buy them for him, (the prisoner was dressed as a footman) he directed me to give him 7 l. for them, and gave me a dollar as earnest; the prisoner came in and met the Jew at the door, and said to him</p>

               <p>"I have come to sit down to get rid of that Jew, for if any of our family saw me with that Jew, I should be discharged directly, though I have been fifteen years in my place;" he then said,</p>
               <p>"My good woman, will you have these things, I had sooner you should have them for 7 l., than that rascally jew for 10 l." he said they were three superfine coats, that his master gave the butler, and the butler asked him to bring them out to sell, as his master had died suddenly. I never looked at them, but bought them of him for 6 l. 10 s. I took out of a chest, a pocket-book containing three 1 l. notes, which I gave him, and a single 1 l. note from my pocket; I then went to the further end of the room, and unlocked a tea-chest, and in taking out my keys, I took out a small red pocket-book, which I laid on the counter, near to where the prisoner sat. I gave him four dollars and the Jew's dollar, he went away - I then missed my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You thought you were buying a bargain for the Jew - A. Yes, the Jew said he would give me 30 s. to buy them, but I said no, I would not take 30 s. for the use of my money. I did not offer to sell them to Mr. Cohen for eight guineas. I asked him the value of them, I asked him to buy them, but do not think I asked any price. I said I was afraid when my husband came home I should be murdered.</p>

On Saturday, the 16th of September, about five o'clock, I left the warehouse - there was silk there. On the Monday, about nine o'clock, I went to the warehouse, and missed four bales of silk, worth about 620 l.; the bales and package were all gone. I had seen the top of the bales opened. The silk stood with its ends upwards. It was raw Reggio silk, mixed white and yellow, which is very unusual. I could not see the way it was tied. At the latter part of Monday, we discovered in an empty house the four packages, which had contained the silk. The back part of the house joins the passage leading to the Quaker's Meeting-house, on which passage the prosecutors premises abut. I discovered every thing there which had covered the silk, even the paper. I carried two of these packages and locked them in a closet. Mr. Caples carried the other two. Mr.

             kept the key of the closet. In February last, I saw part of the silk at Coventry, in the office of the magistrate, and part at Mr. Rawlinson's, a throwster, in the same state it would have been in the package, there was about 20 lbs.; the rest was throwing. I saw rather more than 200 lbs. at the magistrate's office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How was it packed - A. With canvass, oil-cloths, canvas again, and then paper next to the silk, which is the usual way it was sent; the four bales each contained the same sort of silk. Reggio silk is died in a particular way, and it is long reiled silk. A small part of the silk was left in the package.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What parts of the packages were open - A. The upper part - the length of the skein is the length of the bail. It was opened as we open them to shew the merchants.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. You saw some of the silk before you saw any at Coventry - A. Yes, some was left in the package.</p>

            . I saw the tops of the packages. It was Reggio raw silk, principally yellow; but there is a mixture of white, which is unusual; it was tied in a particular way, and was very scarce in the market. On the Monday evening after the robbery, I observed the packages in an empty house, and on the 11th of January I discovered about 1 lb. of the silk among the paper of the package. I had locked them up myself, and kept the key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. This silk you did not see till the 11th of January - A. No, it had been locked up and I kept the key all the time. I have seen white and yellow silk mixed before, but it is a very rare occurrence. I know it from its quality, and the description of the skein. I only had these four bales in the house at the time, and to the best of my knowledge there was no other in the hands of any other merchant.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does your seeing the top of the package give you a full view of the whole - A. It does, I have no doubt of its identity.</p>

            . I am a coach-master and live at Stoke, near Coventry, and have been in the silk trade. I have known Ford fourteen years - he lived at Coventry till within the last four years - he is a bead-maker. I received a letter from him in December, which I burnt - it came from Birmingham to me at Stoke, and stated, that there was about 5 cwt. of raw silk to be sold worth the money, in consequence of this I called on Ford, at Birmingham, and asked if I could have a sample of the silk, he said he could get one and would send to me - he said it was smuggled. I got a sample and came to London with him to the Oxford Arms, Warwick-lane. I went to Mr. Palmer's, in Gutter-lane, who I had before seen at Coventry, and shewed him the sample - he agreed to buy it when I came to London, at 13 s. per lb. We staid at the Oxford Arms about eight days, and breakfasted together most days. We met at the Mitre, in Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who met - A. Ford, his son, and myself. The meeting was by Ford's appointment. We all three went from there to a public house, near the City-road, and there found five others; White was one of them. I and Ford's son, and two others (neither of the prisoners) went there to a house near Hackney-road; to a private house, which I shewed the officers - we met at the Mitre for the silk, and to pay the men for it. I had told Ford I would find the money for it. Ford said he was to pay 200 l. for it, and I gave him 200 l., supposing it to be 5 cwt.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the Mitre, what did you go to the other public-house for - A. Ford took me there to pay the men who were the owners of the silk. I had no conversation with the men there. Ford conversed with them. I did not hear what was said. I and Ford's son, and two of the men them came to the house in Hackney-road, for the silk; the two men who went with us went up stairs and fetched down the silk. We took some wrapper to pack it in, and after we had packed it up, young Ford fetched a cart. I remained in the lower part of the house - the men brought it down in seven bags - we undrawed the bags, took the silk out, and packed it in the packages - we put it into five packages.

             went and fetched a cart and we all helped to put it in. I then went with the carman (who was the prisoner Wells) to the Oxford Arms. I had not seen him before the cart came. I went to the Oxford Arms, and on the road, Wells said it was very singular that he should take it to the place and fetch it away. The packages were put into my bed-room in the Oxford Arms. I treated Wells with a glass of rum and water, which was charged to the joint bill of Ford and myself.</p>

I sent two packages of it next morning to the Cross Keys, Wood-street, directed to Mr. Palmer, Coventry - it was about 2 cwt. I sent the other three to Mr. Palmer's house, in Gutter-lane - he had paid me 250 l. before; I went with Ford to the Mitre - he gave it to me in five 50 l. Bank notes; I gave three of them to Ford, in part payment, before I got the silk. I gave him another of the notes that night, or next morning, being in all 200 l. I did not see any thing paid to the five men at the public-house, Ford, Sen. told me he was to pay them for the silk.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you been a dealer in any thing you could get - A. Nearly all my life; any thing I could get in a fair way. I never dealt in any thing that I knew was wrong. I thought this silk was smuggled.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not touch it if you thought it was stolen A. Not at that risk. I should not like to have bought such an amasing quantity, if I had known it was stolen. I would not buy a small quantity, knowing it to be stolen, I did not think Old Ford would be engaged in any thing but smuggling. I did not doubt its being smuggled till I got to Hackney. I then thought it had been stolen.</p>

               <p>Q. Why then did you receive it at the Oxford Arms - A. I had parted with my money - I did not go to Mr. Palmer and tell him I believed it was stolen, I told him so at Coventry, three or four days after I sent for the silk,</p>
               <p>Q. You paid the rest of the money after you was satisfied of its being stolen - A. Yes, I never saw White before I got to the public-house; we left him and old Ford there, while we went to Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. You made the seven parcels into five, being fully convinced that they were stolen - A. Not at that time, I suspected it, but did not ask the question. The tavern bill at the Warwick Arms, was made out in our joint names, and I paid it. I believe Mr. Palmer came to town about the same time, but arrived a day or two before me, I was apprehended about a month ago; I had been advertised in the Hue and Cry, about a month before I was taken. I never told any one what had happened - I advised Mr. Palmer about it once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever borrowed money of old Ford - A. I may, there were several money transactions between us. Ford lives at Birmingham, which is eighteen miles from Coventry.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you got to goal, did you offer yourself as a witness - A. No, they asked me to speak the truth, and I said</p>
               <p>"I should." I was in Coventry the whole of September - I only drove my coach to Daventry, and was not nearer to town than that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What time were the goods moved from Hackney - A. I think on the 1st of January.</p>

            . I live at Toll-hill, near Coventry, and have a warehouse in Gutter-lane. About the 23d of December, I agreed to buy a quantity of silk of the last witness. I was to have 5 cwt. at 13 s. a lb. which would amount to 229 l. if it had all been delivered; three bags were sent to my warehouse, and two to Coventry, by the Shamrock-coach. I found them at Coventry, it was Reggio silk; I unpacked the two bags at Coventry, and sent it to Mr. Haywood, to be delivered to a throwster, named Rawlinson, they weighed 180 or 200 lbs. I took the silk out of two of the bags in town, and put it in boxes, and the other, bag and all, into a tin case. I saw only one tin case at Coventry, it was the one which had the silk only in it; it was afterwards taken by Goodhall, the constable, to the Mayor of Coventry, and is now in the same state - some of the silk I sent to Rawlinson is also here. I paid Thorp five 50 l. notes on account, I got them from a cheque of Messrs. Smith and Rackster, the bill-brokers, on Messrs. Williams and Co. the bankers. I sent Williams, my servant. to receive the cheque, he brought me back five 50 l. notes, which I gave Thorp.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had you known Thorp - A. Ever since I was born, I have employed him as a manufacturer, but never bought silk of him before. I was very ill and confined to my bed in Gutter-lane, when the silk was sent to Coventry - Thorp told me of it, and charged me with the carriage - I was confined for about eight days after; it was fourteen days after the silk was sent to Coventry, that I went myself, and saw Thorp there five or six days after that, or more; I think. He never at any time, communicated to me, the least suspicion that the silk had been stolen - he never told me so in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the police taking the silk - A. Yes, I did not see Thorp after that, except at the Mansion-house, and had no communication with him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after some part of it was seized - A. I did, I went down to Coventry on Thursday, the 6th of February; I think (I had been twice in London,) I returned to Coventry by the mail, about the 6th of February. I saw Thorp directly I got in, and communicated to him what I had heard unpleasant about the silk - he said it was all right; he never told me he believed it to be smuggled, If he had ever given me the least idea that it was stolen, I should certainly have informed the police. I was held in recognisance of 1000 l. myself on the 7th of February, and did not see the Thorp after I had told him what I had heard, till I saw him at the Mansion-house - the silk weighed 422 lb. 8 oz.</p>

               <p>JOSIAH EAMES. I live in Tower-street, Birmingham, and am a jeweller. I went to Bristol about the 3d or 4th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110035"/>of September last, and remained there a month or five weeks, and saw Ford there at my own lodging, in Bristol. I had known him for years. I believe he came from Birmingham to Bristol on the 12th of March, I am quite sure I saw him every day, from the 13th to the 16th. I was in his company each of these days, on business and pleasure. I saw him at the White Hart coach-office, Bristol, on Saturday, the 16th, when he left, I think it was between six and eight o'clock in the morning. I saw him get on the Hero coach, which goes to Birmingham. I saw it set off with him on it. I am certain it was Saturday, the 16th.</p>

               <p>Q. What makes you recollect it as from the 13th to the 16th that you saw him - A. Because I waited on him at the coffee-house, to take me a parcel when he got home, and I received the answer to that parcel on Monday following. I believe I left Birmingham about the 1st or 3d. The fair begins on the 1st. I remember this, because it brought me a parcel to Bristol on the 13th. I particularly recollect it was that day from several circumstances. I recommended him to a place to sell some goods.</p>
               <p>Q. He might sell goods any day. I want to know what makes you recollect it was from the 12th to the 16th. A. I recollect it perfectly well; one circumstance is, that Doncaster races happened on Monday following, the 18th. I received an oil bottle, and some beads of his in the parcel, which I had to deliver to a customer of his at Bristol.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that - A. I cannot challenge my memory, but I think the very man lives in London now. I cannot tell where the man lived at Bristol.</p>

I think Doncaster races began on the 16th, but I have a card of them (looks at it), read, September 16. I am sure I saw him there that night. I was also there the next night, Sunday, and saw him in the parlour between nine and ten o'clock. On the Saturday he appeared as if he had just come off a journey. The Hero, Bristol coach, comes in about eight or nine o'clock - it is very uncertain. I saw him on the Monday at his own house; I went there for a watch which he had repaired for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Doncaster races a subject of conversation at your house - A. Yes, we had a steak at our house.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you been in Court during the examination of the last witness - A. Yes; I am intimate with Ford, he has children grown up, they are not here. I was first desired to come here about a week ago. I was in Ford's company most days, but I can speak to the 16th because of the Doncaster races. I will not say I did not see him on the 12th or 13th.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did he appear to have been travelling - A. He had dirty boots, and a great coat. I cannot say what weather it was; they get dirty in travelling, whether it is dirty or clean.</p>

               <p>Q. What makes you recollect his being there on that day - A. Because on the 17th I observed to him that Wilde, Barton, and some other gentlemen, were gone to Doncaster races - he said he had heard them talking about it. I kept the paper about the races in my drawer till I was subpoened here, I then put it in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive this weigh bill at Worcester - (looking at it) - A. Yes; Ford's name is on it, and I found him on the coach when I took it at Worcester, and drove him to Birmingham; we got there about nine o'clock. He paid the full fare from Bristol. I am certain it was on Saturday, the 16th.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Can you tell, without the weigh bill, that it was on the 16th - A. Yes; it was on a Saturday. I was desired to come here eight or nine days ago. I ordered a new watch of him on that Saturday. It was a wet afternoon - he rode on the box with me.</p>

It was a white frost, and there were prints of the feet of a grown person on the grass plat leading from the window to the river, and finger marks on the window frame, and marks on the grass, as if a bundle had been laid there.

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On Tuesday, the 27th of February I examined the drawers, and found they were forced by a small gimblet and a chisel. I saw the mark of the worm of a small gimblet and chisel - there were finger marks, as if they had got out at the window, and closed it after them. They could then get through a wharf, as there were craft laying there. I searched the prisoner's lodging, pointed out by Pace, and found a chisel and gimblet there, which I compared with the drawers. They exactly fitted the impressions.</p>

We were stationed at Thanet watch-house, about five miles west of Londoness light-house. I had the charge of the watch on land at the Thanet watch-house.

               <p>Q. What does that mean - A. To go straight by land, instead of going by the coast, to intercept any smugglers they might fall in with. I and Treader ran to the place from whence we had seen the flash. I fired pistols off twice, to extend the alarm, having observed more firing to the westward. I met A. Motts and

            , two of our party, near Harvey's watch-house, and cut inland. Motts and Treader accompanied me to the spot where I had seen the flash, towards the north. On our reaching the spot where I cut in, I observed a large body of men apparently covering another body, who were retreating inland - and at the same time a volley of musquetry was fired from this body of men. Before they fired I called to them to stop - they answered by firing. We laid down to avoid the fire, and could hear the balls pass over our heads. Several guns were fired, I am certain. We were at that time about 200 yards from the sea.</p>
               <p>Q. After the musquetry was fired at you, did you fire your pistol - A. Yes, I did. After our firing the two pistols I mentioned, I fired a third, to extend the alarm, and in a short interval called to them to stop - and then they fired. They then proceeded in a direct line from the sea. I and the two men with me followed them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what direction did you fire, towards the noise, or how - A. I really cannot recollect, I only fired to give the alarm - not at them - my pistol would not reach them. We pursued, and from time to time fired our pistols, to extend the alarm and at one time we aimed at the party, but could never get near enough, for they kept up a continual fire. The wind was about north, and that was the direction they fired, that would enable me better to hear their steps - and at one time we heard them talk very plainly. In the course of our pursuit we were joined by Mr. Jones, an Admiralty midshipman, of the Severn, and four or five men with him, belonging to the Severn. We all pursued the party, and kept them in sight - they were not out of sight at that time. We fired at them, but we had only pistols, and could not take a direct aim with them - and we wanted to take them, but their numbers were so great, and they kept up a continual fire. There was a very large body of them - I should suppose between two and three hundred men.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean both parties were of that number - A. Yes; I should suppose the covering party were nearly one hundred men.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your pursuit, when the smugglers fired, were any of your party wounded - A. Yes; one Crockford. Digby had joined us. I was at the head of my men, and did not know that any were wounded, till after the conflict. I then found

Digby and Mackenzle, and several men, and our party then consisted of twenty-four or twenty-five. We pursued the party to Scotley-cut farm, which is a great distance from Lidd. The smugglers halted there, and fired on our party. We laid down to avoid the fire, and heard the balls or slugs passing round. They halted, and formed a direct line, at the time we were laying down, and fired a quick fire, one after the other - and at that time I heard some of them complain of being short of ammunition. After firing they retreated - we pursued, and heard their voices - we afterwards laid down for nearly ten minutes. We fancied we heard them again - we heard a great shouting - the moon was under a cloud, and we thought they would lay in ambush for us. We afterwards pursued them for two miles or more - we were in the marshes, and obliged to pass through all the ditches. We then came up to a farm where one Lee lived - in consequence of information we received there, we got into a public road. I there saw two men, on the left side of the road, apparently with muskets presented at us - it was rather dark then, it might be nearly five o'clock - we were close to them - I am certain they had muskets in their hands, apparently presented - we ran after them to catch them, but they escaped. In the course of the pursuit, several muskets were fired at us. I observed the man nearest to me run into a field, near the body of men. The men among whom he ran were firing from a field on the left hand side of the road. I saw five or seven men on the right side of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was disguised - A. I was dressed in a white Guernsey frock and thick blue Flushing trowsers. I stood near our party, and one of the men on the right ran down to me, and shoved a musket into my hand - he appeared much agitated, and said twice</p>

            , who was close to me. The man was going to make a noise at the time, and my party being all round me, I gave him to them - it was the prisoner Quested. In the confusion our parties divided - there was at this time firing from both sides of the road, right and left. I endeavoured to join Messrs. Digby and Mackenzie, who had charge of Quested - I had been separated from them. I mistook the armed party of smugglers for my own party, and was walking towards them. They called out</p>
               <p>"Who are you?" I fired off my pistol for assistance, and then a volley of muskets were fired at me. One ball came in contact with the metal button on the waistband of my trowsers - it broke the button, drove it through my trowsers, cut my skin, and I fell. A ball came through my frock, and grazed the skin of my left shoulder. I was knocked down by the ball that struck me on my stomach, and as I fell they called out,</p>
               <p>"There the d - d *** drops; there he drops." It was said exultingly. They fancied fancied they had shot me. I got up almost immediately, and succeeded in joining Mr. Jones, and some men who were with him, and we laid down to conceal ourselves till day-light was coming on. In about an hour, on day-light coming, I saw two men - one of them had two tubs on his back - we ran after him, he dropped the tubs, and escaped towards Brockland, and was followed by Mr. Jones and some of his men. The other, who had no tubs, took the direction towards Lee's, and I followed him, but he escaped. He got into Lee's house. I afterwards found the body of a dead man of their party. I sent for a cart, to take the body and the two tubs away, which had been picked up. We could not get one.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did you meet with any other party of smugglers - A. Yes; about twenty - some on foot, and some on horses, came out of Brockland. Three or four of them were armed with muskets - this was about eight o'clock in the morning. As we were waiting at Lee's house for the cart, one man rode to us and challenged us to fight. The rest of the party were standing near where I found the dead body. A gun was fired at us as one of our men, named Holt, who I sent to make enquiry, was returning, he appeared to have mistaken these men for us - and on discovering his mistake, he ran away, and a gun was fired at him.</p>
               <p>Q. A man ran towards you - A. Yes; apparently to ascertain our strength. He challenged us to fight, and said,</p>
               <p>"Come along, we will see what we can make of you." Our ammunition was wholly expended then - we had two pistols, loaded, and two cartridges, that was all that was left. I, Jones, and the party, retired to a watch-house called Jew's-gut. We took the five tubs with us, which had been seized - they were given in charge of Mr. Digby. I could tell by their smell that they contained either spirits of gin or brandy, much above proof.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The third shot you fired was at them, and before they fired at you. A. I cannot say. I took no aim. When the two first pistols were fired, it was merely for alarm. I could not see the smugglers. I very likely fired the third in a direction towards them. I am certain Quested is the man who gave me the musket. I never doubted about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no tubs for an hour after you yourself had been wounded - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I believe it was about two o'clock when you first saw cause for alarm - A. I think it was about half-past. At that time I was on the beach. The firing took up aconsiderable time. I dare say Lee's house is about five miles from the beach. It took some time to get through the marshes. We walked quickly - I dare say it might take us two hours. The party came out of Brockland after day-light, about eight o'clock in the morning - we were then about five miles from the coast. Lee's farm is about a mile from Brockland.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this plan, and say if it is correct - A. It does not appear correct.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at this, is it correct - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was the latest firing from the smugglers - A. I think the conflict took place about five o'clock I merely go by the moon. We were then near Lee's house, about a mile from Brockland.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You went up this marshy way towards Lee's farm. You followed the smugglers' noise, and therefore supposed they went that road - A. They were north, and we went in that direction. We supposed we were following their steps, as we frequently heard them.</p>
               <p>MR. JARVIS. Q. About what time did you see the two men, one of whom had the tubs - A. Daylight had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110039"/>broken, it might be about seven o'clock. I saw the party come from Brockland about eight o'clock.</p>

            , the deceased officer. About a quarter before three o'clock in the morning, I heard a firing. I was about a mile to the westward of my watch-house. The firing was eastward - supposing a smuggling transaction was going forward, I pursued east, in company with Mr. Mackenzie, and finding it was east of my watch-house, I pursued inland, to intercept them.

            , a seaman, was in company with us. I observed a considerable deal of firing, still going inland. It was further east. Proceeding inland, about a mile and a half, I perceived the firing did not proceed from pistols - I supposed it to be musket shots, from the report, it was not pistols. I used the Lidd-road as my guide, and heard distinctly a company of men using the most opprobious and disgraceful language, to excite others of their gang to fire on the blockade party. There was a considerable firing on both sides. I fancy the firing of our party was for the purpose of strengthening the alarm. I joined Mr. Newton and Mr. Jones, and their party. Mr. Mackenzie was with me. Our force then consisted of about twenty-five. We followed the smugglers. I should think there was two or three hundred, or two hundred and fifty. There was a cart with them. I observed cart wheels.</p>
               <p>Q. As you approached, did they fire on you - A. They halted, and exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Come on." We collected our men together, and halted - while we were doing this they fired on us, and wounded W. Crockford, and I was wounded in the belly, only skin deep - it went along, about four inches.

             was wounded there in the arm and legs - we laid down and received their fire for about ten minutes. They again retreated, we followed - and I believe, from the road we took, that they retreated by a private cart road, through all the marshes; we at times heard them, and proceeded in the direction of the voices, and came out in the public road, between Lidd and Rye, about a quarter of a mile east of a finger post, pointing to the Romney, Lidd and Rye roads, and not knowing our position, we obtained information from a house where we were. I supposed the smugglers to be going towards Brockland; we proceeded that way - Lee's house was in our way there. About half a mile on the east side of Lee's house I perceived a man on the road, with a musket in his hand, holding it downwards - he saw me - we were a head of our own men, and we all (I and four others), pursued him, supposing him to be one of the gang. I got ahead of them all, overtook the man, and collared him; at this time men were rising both on my right and left, flashing and shouting - two or three muskets were discharged, the balls of which passed me on my left. A scuffle ensued between this man and me, he extricated himself from me, and endeavoured to get the muzzle of his musket to my body, but I pushed him off, and discharged a pistol at him. I perceived four or six men about eight yards on my right from me, with muskets in their hands, apparently in confusion, one of the four or six men, which was Quested, came from them, and I saw him go into custody of Mr. Newton - he was taken by Mr. Newton. I now heard Mr. Mackenzie calling to me to come and assist him. I went, and observed him in contact with a tall man, with a musket in his hand, I went, wrenched the musket out of the smuggler's hand - we each laid hold of his hands - and hauled him away, when a musket ball or balls shot our prisoner (the smuggler), and Mr. Mackenzie; they both fell at the same time. I know it was a musket ball that shot Mr. Mackenzie - he died the midnight following.</p>
               <p>Q. The man died immediately - A. Mr, Mackenzie just said to him</p>
               <p>"You are shamming;" and he just had life to say No, and died, I believe, for I left him there. At this time there were bodies of men in the field on each side of the road, firing - the fields are divided from the road there by a ditch. My own party at this time were both behind and before me. Mr. Mackenzie was fainting, I caught him in my arms, and supported him, eastward, about two hundred yards, then left him to fetch men to his assistance, to carry him off the field, as I could only carry him upright myself. I pursued eastward, and saw Quested in the custody of James Hill, a seaman; Hill said he was stubborn, and we each laid hold of his collar; he had not been out of custody since. I am sure he is the man. Perceiving that he was intoxicated, he had been drinking by the smell of his breath, I thought a ducking would do him good. I threw him across a ditch, and went down to the watch-house at Jew's-gut. I afterwards examined his person, and took some swan shot from his trowsers pocket - it was but a few grains - it appeared that his pockets had been emptied, for they were black. I also found a fowling-piece flint on him. On arriving at the watch-house I found the prisoner, Wraight, there - it was between seven and eight o'clock, and was daylight.

             and Nicholl had him in custody. On searching him I found a knife in his pocket, the crevices of which between the blades were full of wet powder. I took a quantity of wet powder out of his pocket - it was not so wet but what it would burn - he was wet himself. I also took about a charge of shot from him, but no pistols or arms; his hands and face were black with gunpowder, down the right side of his mouth or chin; the inside of his pockets were also black with gunpowder; I might almost say plaistered with it. I saw Mr. Wood, the surgeon, put his finger on the black upon his face, and take it off. I observed Wraight's frock tucked up under his arms, apparently, for the purpose of getting at his jacket pockets more easy, both of which were plaistered with gunpowder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. How far were you from the coast when you fell in with Newton and his party - A. About a mile. It was a dark night, but not so dark but what I could see twenty yards. When I first saw Quested distinct enough to speak to him, he was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110040"/>Hill's custody; that was not five minutes after Mr. Mackenzie was killed.</p>
               <p>Q. You found swan shot on him, such as would be used in killing wild fowls - A. Yes; he was intoxicated, but he had his wits about as much as I had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Your wound I believe was caused by a ball or slug - A. Yes; small shot could not have occasioned it. When I laid down I heard balls and slugs distinctly pass over me. Mr. Mackenzie was killed by a ball, it was impossible from the position of our party, that the ball could come from them. I should think a quarter of a pound of powder was found on Wriaght, it stuck over his pockets. I produced what powder and shot I selected. I found no cartridge on him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could that shot do harm to an individual - A. Certainly, if they were fired at him.</p>

            . I am a petty officer of his Majesty's ship Severn. On the 11th of February I was near the beach - the moon was up. I saw some bodies of men some distance from the beach; one body appeared higher than the other. The highest body were in advance in-land, the other body behind were armed. I joined my own party.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember coming up to the finger post - A. Yes; a little distance from there several flashes were observed. Mr. Newton seized a man alongside by his frock. I was alongside the man when he put a fowling-piece into the hands of Mr. Newton, (he had seized him first) then the man seemed to go a few paces back, when Mr. Jones came forward and said,</p>
               <p>"If you offer to resist, I'll blow your brains out;" he said he would give himself up, he was done, it was the prisoner Quested. He was secured, and the musket given in my charge. I kept it till daylight, then delivered it to Mr. Jones. Just at the break of day I went towards Lee's house, and saw two men together, one carrying two tubs slung across his shoulder, which, on giving pursuit, he threw down. I saw them picked up by Holt, they appeared the usual contraband spirit casks, and smelt of spirits. I tasted it afterwards, on Tuesday, the 13th. I had delivered them to Mr. Jones, at Jew's-gut watch-house. I saw three more tubs, two in one field and one in the other. The two were fastened together by a small-cord, so as to enable a person to sling them across his shoulder.</p>

            . In February I was a seaman of the Severn, stationed at the westermost station of the Thanet watch-house, a quarter of a mile from Moot's post - he is the next. Between two and three o'clock I observed a pistol fired, proceeded to the spot, and heard several pistol fired as I went along the coast. I observed several men ranged from the top of the beach down to a white boat, which laid just on the beach; they were taking some tubs out of the boat. I suppose there were two or three hundred men - they saw me, turned round immediately, and fired at me, and said</p>
               <p>"Come along you black *** we are ready for you." I returned, and as I was going back met Hill, we both returned to the smugglers, and fired our pistols, they returned our fire directly, and fired a good many paces at us. I then saw the boat of the Rose, which is a King's ship, pulling in, some men landed from her. The smugglers were then all over the full of the beach, and when we got on the top they fired at us, and wounded two or three of our people. Clark and another were shot. We followed the smugglers, and were at times within one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards of them. I could not see whether they had anything with them - there might be nearly three hundred of them. We were joined afterwards by Messrs. Newton, Treader and others. I did not get quite to Dowell's farm - there was some firing. I was wounded with a slug in my right arm, which is there now. I was then taken back to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. The transaction had began when you were first alarmed - A. Yes; I went down to the beach between two and three o'clock, and saw a white boat, it was close by Harvey's watch-house. I know by the tide that it was not later than three o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw them taking tubs out of the boat; could you tell that part, or all of those men went on to the place where you was wounded - A. Yes; they all kept together. The firing I first heard was a pistol - it was an alarm to us. I was on the watch when I heard it - it was after I heard the pistol fire that the men fired at me.</p>

            . I am a seaman belonging to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110041"/>Severn. On the morning of the 11th of February, I was stationed on the beach by Harvey's watch-house, I saw a boat between two and three o'clock in the morning, plying into the shore. I walked towards her as she pulled in, as soon as she touched the beach, two men jumped out of her, dressed in long frocks, they immediately ran up the beach, and the boat shoved off about her own length. I ran after the men, and as soon as I got to the top of the beach, I saw a great body of men (two or three hundred), some of them appeared to be armed. I ran back over the full towards the sea, ran along and fired my pistol in the air, as a signal of alarm; as soon as I fired, they fired a volley at me. I suppose nine or ten pieces were fired. I heard the shot, it passed very close to me. I waited there, and saw the body of men go down to the boat and come back again, with packages on their shoulders. I could not see what the packages were, but I saw something on their backs, one before and the other behind, in the way smuggled spirits are carried. There was two or three hundred men running, I stood there, charged my pistol again, and by that time Mr. Newton came up; he and I pursued together on the beach, within about fifty yards of them, then he fired his pistol, and they immediately gave us a volley. We followed them, Treader and Motts joined us. We all four followed the party over the shingles, and now and then fired an alarm, and when we fired they fired at us. We pursued them till about five o'clock. I saw a man drop two tubs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue to follow the same party that you originally saw - A. Yes; but the tubs were not dropped till after daylight. I was present when Quested was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you never loose sight of them - A. Yes; they gave us two or three vollies, and so we laid down - they were out of sight half an hour or more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was firing going on during that half hour. - A. Yes; when we came in sight of them, they appeared about the same quantity of men. We travelled five miles.</p>

            . I am a seaman of the Severn. On the 11th of February, I was on the beach, and heard an alarm between two and three o'clock in the morning, I went from my station to Jews-gut watch-house, found nobody there; I proceeded up the Lidd-road towards the firing, and met Jackson and Churcher both wounded, and returning to the watch-house. In consequence of information they gave, I proceeded up the road to Dowell's farm. I never overtook the party - I stopped there. I afterwards met Nichol, one of our party; he and I waited some minutes and laid down on the ground, and saw about six men moving at Dowell's farm, at the east end of the building; we could see them better laying down than standing up; we could see the figures of men above us, and hear them talking, but could not hear what they said. As we lay in that situation, a man came within two yards, I rose and stopped him, and asked who he was - he answered, a friend - we asked where he was going, he said to Rye, and had come from Hythe; I told him it was the wrong road, and asked what time he left Hythe; it was the wrong road - he was coming to the sea coast, and going in a direction to Dungeness light-house, from Dowell's farm; we stopped him in a field about ten yards off the cart-road, leading from Lidd. I searched him, but found nothing on him. I said I should take him to the watch-house, he said he would go with me, but I had no business with him. I asked if he had heard or seen any firing, he said No. I had heard firing a quarter of an hour or ten minutes before. I took him to the watch-house, he stopped twice as we went along, and would not go in till I threatened to shoot him. It was about twenty minutes before four o'clock when I first took him, he had a grey coat and a long frock underneath, tucked close up under his arms. I saw Mr. Digby search him; a knife with wet powder sticking about it, and some small shot were found in his breeches pocket, and marks of gunpowder were on his face; his pockets were black, and powder in one; his right hand was black, particularly between his fingers, and his finger ends were black with powder; there were marks of powder on his nose and mouth. Hemmings, the quarter-master, tasted it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was near four o'clock when you met him - A. It wanted twenty minutes. I had heard firing about twenty minutes before; I was then three quarters of a mile from where I met him; the voices I heard, did not appear to be the voices of above half a dozen men. I and Nichols were the only King's men there; I should think those persons were within hail when I took Wraight, he made no noise - I was armed with a cutlas and pistols, I presented my pistol immediately as I saw him.</p>

            . I am a seaman on board the Severn. I was centry on the beach between two or three o'clock, and saw pistols fired to the eastward; I ran and saw a boat on the beach belonging to the Rose - I saw no others. When I got there, I saw Clark, the officer, one of the Rose's galley - I found Clark and two more men had been wounded. I ran about half a mile over the beach, and joined Newton and his men; there was firing as we went along - Jackson and Churcher were wounded. I went on till we got to Dowell's farm - Crockford was wounded there; we went to Dowell's farm, they came upon us, and we all retreated. I lost my party, and fell in with Mockford, we both laid down on the grass, and saw six or seven people moving at the east end of the barn - the firing had then ceased about ten minutes. A man came towards us from the east end of the barn, where I had observed the others, we both jumped up, Mockford searched him to see if he was armed, he merely rubbed him down, but did not examine his pockets; he said he came from Hythe, and was bound for Rye - we were then between Dungeness light-house and Dowell's farm - that is not the way from Hythe to Rye; the Dungeness light was burning and visible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. It was very dark - A. Yes, the east end of the farm was about sixty yards from us.</p>

I saw about half a dozen men a-shore, two of them were of the Severn's crew, we landed and joined them; went to the full of the beach, and saw a great number of people over the full - there might be sixty or seventy, or more. After Paramour (one of the Rose's crew) fired a pistol in the air, they fired a volley at us; they fired fifteen or twenty guns at us.

            . I am a seaman on board the Severn. On the 11th of February, I was stationed at Carrick watch-house, heard an alarm, went westward, and joined Newton and Treader; we went on, and when we came to the finger-post, we went towards Brockland, and saw Newton seize Quested - Treader received a musket from Mr. Newton. At daylight I saw two men, one of them had two tubs slung across his shoulder; on seeing us he hove them off, and they escaped; the tubs were secured by one the other party - three more of the same kind was picked up afterwards; one of them leaked, I put my finger to it and tasted it, it was foreign spirits - I believe brandy; we saw a dead body in the road, about fifty yards from where the tubs were found, which was in the direction the party had gone. I picked a musket up twenty or thirty yards from the dead body, and a cutlas along side of it, which belonged to one of the other party - none of us had muskets - the dead man was one of the shore people, and had a smock frock on. I carried one the tubs to the watch-house - it was marked SS. which I believe means spirits of brandy - another was marked S.G.</p>

            's, at Fairfield, on Sunday evening, and return home on the Monday following - and had preceeded as far as West Hythe, which is about two miles from my house, when I stopped at a public-house, and had some beer, and a pipe of tobacco to smoke on the road. I then pursued my way through Dimchurch and Romney (which is eight miles and a half from West Hythe,) and having passed through Romney, I turned over into the fields, with an intention to go to North-land, which lies between Lydd and the coast, as I thought I knew the road that way - but I took the wrong footpath, and had proceeded near to the beach before I discovered the mistake; I turned off again to the right, and kept on walking until I felt convinced that I must have got considerably beyond Northland, I determined not to go back at an uncertainty whether I could find it or not, but to make the best of my way to Rye, which I supposed laid before me - but coming up to a shepherd's house, belonging to a man named Dowell, I knocked him up and inquired the road to Rye, which he told me - but finding that it was a considerable distance, and feeling myself sleepy and tired, I laid down to sleep by the side of a hay stack, and continued so for some time, until I was awakened by hearing some men talking who went past where I lay, to whom I did not speak, but feeling very cold I got up, and thought I would proceed to Rye, - but I had not proceeded far, when I was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>As to the circumstance of my having a little powder and shot in my pocket, and my face and hand being smeared as if with gunpowder, I can only say that I am in the constant habit of going out with a gun on my mother's farm, for the purpose of shooting rooks and other birds, that destroy the seed corn, for which purpose I am very seldom without a little powder and shot in my pockets - and that the loose gunpowder that was found in my pocket, had worked out of a paper containing a small quantity of gunpowder, which I had put in that pocket a day or two before, and which had become damp through the accidental breaking of a vial which I had carried in that pocket afterwards - and I have no doubt the fact of my face and hand being smeared, was occasioned by my sometimes carrying my hands in my jacket pockets, as I was walking along on the night in question, and then wiping my nose with my hand, without thinking at the time of the damp powder being in my pocket.</p>
               <p>I shall now leave my case in the hands of my Counsel, to call witnesses on my behalf - but if there should be any whom you may think material to the case not called, I trust you will give me credit when I say, that if I had been tried in the county where I was apprehended, I could have had the attendance of ten times the number of witnesses to my character, than I can possibly expect to be in attendance here to-day.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother, and live at Pedlinge, near Hythe. My son is married, and has seven children. He is my bailiff. I am a widow. I know Mr. Baker, of Northland, and Mr. Baker, of Fair-field. On Saturday, the 10th of February, my son left my house to exchange some corn for seed, with Mr. Baker. He went away in the afternoon or the evening. He has exchanged corn with Baker several times. My son was to give him corn for beans. The beans were for seed for my land. He left my house after he had done work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he ever shoots rooks on your land - A. Yes; and carried ammunition with him for that purpose. I used to provide it for him. I do not know where he kept it.</p>
               <p>MR. JARVIS. Q. To which of the Baker's did you send your son. - To Fairfield, not to Northland. My son's house is under the same roof as mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your son take any corn to Fairfield with him - A. Not to my knowledge. I had had a sample of beans from Baker about a month before. I had a little in a sample bag. The beans were sent in after the barley was carried away - that was a week after my son went away. I sent five quarters of barley to Baker. I did not hear where my son was for a week after he left. I live about a mile from Hythe. I sent my waggoner with twenty quarters, a week after him, on the Monday, and he brought back the beans in the waggon. I had sent the barley in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought you the sample of beans - A. My son.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner - (hesitating) A. Mr. Baker. He brought it himself in a little bag. Baker had a sample of my barley two months before, I sent it to him by my son.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether this sample was sent or taken by your son. - A. I do not know any thing about it. My business was carried on unknown to me sometimes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110044"/>Q. You have sworn that Baker had a sample from you two months before - A. Yes; I recollect now, he had a sample from me - he came to me for it. He came alone. I saw him, but did not see the sample given to him. I recollect his going to the barn to my son. The barley was threshed.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you seen any written defence that was to be put in for your son - A. No; I have not seen any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any paper read over to you, as your son's defence - (hesitating) A. No; I do not remember any; none has been read to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your son been out shooting that day - A. He might possibly go out while he was threshing - he had been threshing in the barn all the day. I did not see him with a gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what time he returned from this journey - A. Possibly about five o'clock. He knew the road pretty well.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Let me quite understand you, be attentive - are you quite sure it was a sample of beans that Baker brought you - A. Yes. I am certain he was to let me have beans.</p>

            , Esq. of Dover, who is now deceased. He had land at Fairfield. I have exchanged corn several times with Wraight. I paid him for some corn in November, and told him I should want some barley seed - he said he had some which would suit me, and he should like beans in exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give a sample of beans, or receive one of barley - A. No doubt samples passed, and I think I do recollect that I carried a sample with me. I went to their house, and looked at the barley in the barn - it was about January. I was to give him beans in exchange. I received a letter from Wraight about the 1st or 2d of February. I have not got the letter, I destroyed it. In consequence of that letter, I expected to see him on the 10th of February. I live about eighteen miles from him. I expected him to come to my house, but he did not. I have since perfected the exchange - I think it was on the Monday week following.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How soon after this business happened did you hear of it - A. On the Tuesday. I live six or seven miles from Dowell's farm, and about two miles and a half from Brockland. I heard of the affair the next day, but not about the prisoner. I have seen him at Fairfield a great many times. The road is sometimes difficult at night. There are many turnings.</p>
               <p>Q. Your expression just now was,</p>
               <p>"I do think I carried the sample;" had any one told you what Mrs. Wraight had been saying - A. No.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say you have dealt with her before; was it by exchange - A. Yes; I always dealt by exchange - our waggons used to meet at St. Mary's. What I expected him about on the 10th, was to appoint where they were to meet. I should think Dowell's farm is fifteen miles from his house.</p>

I went with him to the ruins in Foster-lane, where the new post office is building, we found the gate locked; we went round to Bell-square, and found that gate locked also, so that nobody could have been in the ruins. We got over the hoard, looked about for some half crowns, and in about ten minutes my father picked up one, and called me to look at it before he picked it up - it was bad; I found in a piece of paper two more half crowns, about a yard from where the first was found - they were folded with a piece of paper between them; they were marked, and then given to my father.</p>

            , I am the father of the last witness. I came in and found a little girl in the shop; from what she told me, I went out, and found the prisoner about seven or eight houses off, on the other side of the way, in Noble-street, he was walking to and fro. Taylor was with the little girl, he stopped and spoke to her, the prisoner saw her, and went on very quick; I followed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110045"/>him into Foster-lane, and he turned up a court, not a thoroughfare - I went up to him, looked him in the face, and said</p>
               <p>"I believe you are one of the men I want." He said,</p>
               <p>"No, I am not." I told him I was sure of it. I laid hold of both his hands, one hand was in his right hand breeches pocket - he struggled very much to get his right hand from mine, and then he threw two parcels from him over the board, in St. Martin's-le-Grand; the wind blew the paper of one of them back on the ground. I called Mr. Lobb to pick it up - Taylor came up at the time and took the prisoner into a baker's shop; he took a pocket-book from him, in which I found three good half-crowns, a good five shilling piece, and five-pence half-penny in copper. I returned to my house and took my son to the spot where he threw the parcel over. We got there in ten minutes. I saw a half-crown, and called my son to look at it, he picked up a paper about a yard off, containing two more in the direction in which the man threw it. I produce them, my son gave them to me, and I marked them before I lost sight of them. I produced one half-crown, the one found upon the ruins and the one found by my son. I saw the prisoner and the girl together, they recognized each other - he was very resolute, and very unwilling to be secured; we were obliged to tie him, and she said</p>
               <p>"You shall not tie my father."</p>

On the 10th of April, about five minutes before eight o'clock, I came home to breakfast and opened the door with a key which I keep in my pocket, and found the prisoner at the foot of the stairs, the door was always kept shut; he was a perfect stranger. I asked what he did there, he said he had two boys sweeping the chimnies - he was dressed as a sweep. I called the servant up and asked if any sweeps were below; she said No, nor had she sent for any. I asked what business he had there; he said he came in after the boys. I desired him to turn out his pockets; he said, he had but one, he turned that out, and out fell a key, which I tried to my door, and it opened it; he said, he hoped I would forgive him. I gave him in charge. I went out at six o'clock in the morning and closed the outer door.</p>

I had received the notes on the Monday before, and made a memorandum of the notes and dates. I made a noise and the prisoner came up. I asked if he belonged to the house, he said he did, and his name was Arnold; he said he neither knew the woman or me. I went and got Brown, the officer, returned, and found the house locked up. I went to the Bank and stopped the notes, the prisoner was taken next morning.</p>

            . I am accountant and principal officer in the Victualling Board Department. It is the custom for pursers in the navy to send us accounts of the provisions received by them, and the manner they are disposed of. The provisions are supplied agreeable to the demand which the captain may make. The purser usually writes the demand and the captain approves of it - it should be proportioned according to the number of men on board. The savings accounts are divided into messes - it is an account of such part of the provisions each mess takes up less than the proportion which is allowed.</p>
               <p>Q. What is done with these savings - A. When the purser renders an account of savings, the amount in money is placed to his credit in his account, in another department.</p>

            . I am post messenger to the Victualling-board, my business is to receive packets and letters passing through the post-office. I received a package<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110047"/>dated the 20th of April, 1819, directed to the Commissioners of the Victualing-board. I made a memorandum of it at the time - it was in a square deal box. I received it at the post-office, and took it to Somerset-house. I opened the box myself, and saw the contents were the Purser's account of the Spartan. I paid twelve pounds fifteen shillings for the postage, on the 22d. When I opened the box, I took it to Mr. Geoghegan.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You received it at the post-office in the city - A. Yes; I did not make my memorandum from what is written on the outside of the box, but from the schedule of the accounts. I always look at the accounts myself, they are frequently in different parcels, and sometimes in one. The outside of the parcel generally has the contents written on it. It was done so in this instance, or I could not have taken the memorandum. I never recollect accounts being directed to be left at the post-office. The course of business is for me to go daily and fetch all the letters for the board - they are not sent.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. - You have heard the charge on the part of the prosecution, I have therefore only to hope that upon mature deliberation you will clearly perceive, that no frand could have been contemplated on my part. First, as it regards the individuals in question, and next as it relates to my King. If these are forgeries my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, they are in their tendency, of a most innocent and singular nature; Mr. Tills, Mr. Bell, and Mr. Gray, admit that they have not been defrauded; and that one member of their mess, has at different periods received various sums. Having said so much, and I trust carried conviction to your mind upon this part; I shall endeavour to shew, that so far from my King having been defrauded, the public have been benefited, in as much that by the documents in question I was returning to my country, a quantity of provisions at a lower rate than they could be procured under any other circumstances; at a lower rate than the government pay me upon the balance of my account, and thereby subjecting myself if in debt to the Crown, to four, five, and in some instances, six times the amount of the benefit I could possibly derive to be levied upon me, and my securities, to the extent of twelve hundred pounds, at any time the Commissioners for Victualling His Majesty's Navy might think proper. It now behoves me, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, to substantiate these assertions, by official documents under the different heads, to which I have alluded; in so doing it may be necessary to state for your information, the mode adopted for the renumeration of Purser's, which I am in hopes will more readily convey to you, an adequate feeling of the benefit derived by His Majesty's Government in a transaction of this nature; supposing for instance, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, there is one pound of bread due to any mess, I pay them one penny halfpenny; one gallon of rum, 2 s.; one piece of beef of 8 lb. 1 s. 6 d.; one piece of pork 4 1/2 d.; one pound of sugar, 4 d., and one pound of cocoa, 4 d. If I had a desire my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, to defraud my country, I would pay this sum myself, and the Government must repay me 1/2 per pound in addition for bread, 4 d. per gallon in addition for rum; 2 d. per piece in addition for beef; 1 d. per piece in addition for pork 2 d. per pound in addition for butter as sugar, and 2 d. per pound in addition for cocoa, as cheese. If on the other hand my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have drawn this money with a nefarious intent, I subject myself to be charged in place of one penny halfpenny for bread, four pence halfpenny; in place of 2 s. per gallon for rum, 12 s.; in place of 1 s. 6 d. per piece for beef 4 s. 8 d.; in place of 1 s. 3 d. per piece for pork, 3 s. 6 d.; in place of 4 d. per pound for sugar as butter, 1 s., and in place of 4 d. perpound for cocoa, as cheese, 1 s., or such other price as the several species may have cost His Majesty, in any part of the world. I beg most respectfully to state, that I have a wife with six children, dependent upon my personal exertion for support; I have received many wounds in defence of my country, and I trust that your verdict of this day, will be tempered with that humanity, which is so predominant in the breast of every English Judge and Juryman.</p>

            . I was on board the Spartan, and at the head of the carpenter's mess. I did not receive this sum of 2 l. 4 s. 8 d. The receipt is not my writing. He never paid me that money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you ever receive an equivalent - A. Not to my knowledge. I was in the habit of receiving one species of provisions for another. I am not indebted to him. He never made any demand on me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever authorize him to put your name to this receipt - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How do you settle the difference between a superior and an inferior article - A. If I take more than the portion allowed, he would have a demand on me; but I took a less quantity. If I wanted wine instead of gin, the quantity of wine would be equal in value to the gin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe you admit that, at various times, you were creditor to different species of provisions - A. I kept no account.</p>
               <p>Q. I could have charged for the provisions you had, a higher price than what I should have to charge for the savings - A. Yes. One member of my mess was a boy, in the early part of the time, I believe he received sums from the steward, as savings for rum, but that is a separate account altogether.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There are numerous documents taken to different officers to sign, when it is almost impossible for them to tell what they are. At times they write when the ship is reeling to and fro, and they sign them on their knees - and a few hours after, would say they had not signed them. I have sent Government regular accounts, and they have debited me with provisions, thereby subjecting myself to five or six times the amount I should be able to realize - they cannot be injured. The midshipmens' mess and the gun-room mess generously gave me leave to take what was due to them, in lieu of my contributing to their comforts. There are books in the office to prove the Government could not be injured.</p>

On the morning of the 15th of February, before eight o'clock, I missed the plate mentioned in the indictment, which was in use. I had seen it at ten o'clock the night before. It was in a japanned bread basket - the steel was ivory handled, bound with silver. Two metal spoons were found in the road, but nearly a month elapsed before I heard any thing of the rest. I found parts of them broken, in the possession of the prisoner. On the Monday before the prisoner was committed, I got a search-warrant, and went with an officer to the prisoner's parents' house, at Kensington Gravel-pits. He was at my house at the time. I found nothing there Before the constable took him into custody he most positively denied all knowledge of it. In consequence of my having produced to him the broken pieces which were actually in his possession, he took me and the officer into a stable, where he worked and dug up two of the pieces of a silver table-spoon. It was a very little depth under the manger. On the officer's proceeding to handcuff him, he stated there was some more property under the tiling of his mother's wash-house, and the other parts of it were sold at a pawnbroker's and a watchmaker's, at Kensington. I went with the prisoner and the officer to the pawnbroker's and watchmaker's, and received from them portions of two table spoons, broken. He stated he had thrown the knife into a field, and the two castor tops and two salt spoons, into some lime, where some bricklayers were building. He said that he had accomplished the robbery by getting over the front railing, getting round the house, and opening the passage door, after the servants had come down - that he had come to the back of the house, having buried the property, and called at the outside of the gate, as was his custom, for admission. He denied having any participators in the robbery, till he came before the magistrate - he then said a boy, whose name he did not know, received the things from him over the back gate, and assisted him to bury them.</p>

               <p>"He took me to the stable, and shewed me two parts of the spoon under the manger, covered over with straw. I searched his mother's wash-house, and found this gravy spoon, and two parts of a tables-poon. I went to a pawnbroker's in Kensington, and found the bowl of a tablespoon. And at the watchmaker's I found two pieces of a table-spoon.</p>

               <p>"Mr. Lovell - I think I should not be acting correctly, if I did not tell you my intentions towards your daughter - I have a fortune of 500 l. a year."

            . I served the defendant with notice to produce this and other letters, on Saturday, between six and seven o'clock in the evening. I served him with another notice to the same effect, on the 13th of February.</p>

               <p>(notice read.)</p>
               <p>MR. LOVELL (continued.) Q. You communicated by letter, your determination - A. Yes; my letter was to this effect - that I had considered the subject, and my present resolution was, that nothing more should take place between him and my daughter - and concluded by stating I should always be glad to see him as an acquaintance. I afterwards received this letter from him (looking at it), I believe it to be his writing. -</p>
               <p>(The letter was here produced, stating the defendant's regret at Mr. Lovell's decision, and offered to satisfy him on every point. Signed E. M. JONES.)</p>
               <p>Q. After the receipt of this letter, when did you see Mr. Jones - A. I think accidentally, at some races, near Swinbourn, in Wiltshire, on the 1st of September. I had my daughters Charlotte, Jane, and Fanny there with me. Mr. Jones came and asked me how I did. I talked with him civilly, that was all. I think after that I saw him at Bath, probably about three weeks after - it was about the latter end of October.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see him at Bath, in company with your solicitor - A. I did. That was after I had heard something about my daughter. I had seen him in London about three weeks before that.</p>
               <p>Q. State what passed when you saw him in town - A. I asked if he was married to my daughter - he said he was; I enquired at what place, and by what clergyman - he said he would not tell me. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jones, my daughter being under age, you must be well aware that the marriage cannot be valid." - There was then a proposal made of re-marriage, and money was talked of. I said I would go down into the country, and consult my wife about that. I went down, and a few weeks after met him at Bath, on the subject of the marriage - he wished me to deposit money - then he talked of terms, and something about a settlement. He said there was 1000 l. in his power, and he must talk to his mother - but I have a confused recollection of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the treaty come to any thing - A. No. I had information where my daughter was.</p>
               <p>Q. From the first time you saw him, till the present, did you ever consent to your daughter becoming his wife - A. We talked of terms. I consented to his marrying her, on his making a certain settlement - that settlement was never made. I heard where my daughter was, and went to the house where she resided. She came away with me willingly. Her clothes were detained at her lodging, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110052"/>have never been able to get them. She was 19 years of age last April.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. A good full-grown girl, is not she - A. Pretty well.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean any thing offensive - but many a girl of twenty-five looks quite as young as she does - A. Appearances vary.</p>

               <p>Q. When the defendant said they were married, did he not offer to marry her again, if you thought fit to give your consent - A. On my giving some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him, if he settled 1000 l. in the stocks, which he expected from his mother, that you would give another 1000 l. and they should be married again - A. On my oath I really do not recollect. We did talk about terms. Nothing was finally settled - but really I do not recollect whether I agreed to settle 1000 l. on his doing the same. I think I remember proposing that he should marry her, on my giving him 1000 l. - I think that was at Bath. He talked about terms, and I referred him to my solicitor, who said he was not competent to make the settlement.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect saying to Mr. Walker, I shall be happy if he marries her, and add</p>
               <p>"blessed be the peace maker" - A. I did not, after I heard where she was; I said, blessed be the peace maker when I talked about the re-marriage. Until I saw my solicitor I had made up the differences, and consented, but after I saw him he declined.</p>
               <p>Q. When he first proposed to marry your daughter, did you not tell him she would have a fortune of 5000 l. - A. On my oath, I did not. I have heard he is the possessor Lincoln house - his mother lives there; he said his estate there was worth about 500 l. a year. I did not tell him Archdeacon Wells had left 20,000 l. among my daughters, I said it was among my grand-children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the defendant accompany your daughter to the balls at Bath, and to the races, and parade the ballrooms with her on his arm - A. No: on my oath, he never went to Bath with her once to my knowledge. I never said I believed he thought my daughter twenty years of age.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The defendant applied to you as a suitor to your daughter, to which you gave a negative answer - A. Yes; I never saw him at my house afterwards. I did not invite him to join us at the races. My daughter was with me in the carriage, she did not join him without my being with her. I heard of her going away with him about the latter end of November, and had an interview with him in London five or six days after, and saw him at Bath in about three weeks. I did not then know where my daughter was.</p>
               <p>Q. At Bath there was a talk about your each giving 1000 l. - A. Yes, Mr. Jones's solicitor was present, and mine was not, and not having seen my attorney I would have consented to the marriage if terms had been settled; the settlement never was made, nor any agreement for it. I never consented to a marriage without a settlement. I found her at Islington - she is here to day.</p>

            . I am daughter of the last witness, and have a sister named Charlotte. Lady Gould is my aunt. My sister and I went on a visit to Sir Davidge and Lady Gould's, at Orkshead, in Hertfordshire; we travelled from my father's house to Chippenham, in his carriage, and from there to London in the stage coach; the defendant joined us in the morning at Calne - he came into the stage coach. I knew it was not my father's wish that he should associate with my sister; he travelled to London in the same coach with us. In the course of the journey we were speaking of ages, he said he should take me for the eldest of the three sisters - he thought me older than either my sisters, Charlotte or Jane; I said Charlotte was the eldest, Jane and myself the youngest. I told him Charlotte was not nineteen till the February following, which was last February, and told him the ages of my other sisters; he parted with us on arriving in town. We stated in conversation with him, that we were going to Lady Gould's - we parted at Hatchett's hotel; a carriage conveyed us to Jermyn-street, where Sir D. Gould was waiting for us; the defendant knew where Sir D. Gould lived; we went to Hertfordshire a day or two afterwards, and about ten days after, I saw the defendant - he rode by the lane fronting the house; I saw him many times - he was never admitted into the house on any footing whatever. We generally took a drive every day in Sir Davidge Gould's carriage, and once met the defendant in the lane on horseback, Lady Gould was with us - he did not join us.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the appearance of this gentleman, had Sir D. and Lady Gould said any thing - A. They had written to Papa, and in consequence of that I had an interview with defendant at the gate of Sir D. Gould's garden (we had been there about three weeks) I told him Sir Davidge had written home, to say that he was constantly riding by, and that we had received an answer, to say they should fetch us home, if he appeared again before the window. I entreated him to leave the neighbourhood. he requested an interview with Charlotte, which I told him was impossible, and after some slight conversation, I left him; he renewed his appearance, in consequence of which, I wrote a letter, and got my sister to sign it - it was dictated by Sir Davidge.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Adolphus here called for the letter, for the production of which notice had been served on the defendant. Mr. Alley refused it.)</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MISS F. LOVELL. Q. What was the contents of your letter - A. That his appearance before the window, was extremely disagreeable to Charlotte; that we had received a letter, saying we should be fetched home, and that she was determined not to marry him, without her friends consent, and entreating him not to make his appearance again; we received this letter in answer; (looking at it) the writing on the third leaf, was not discovered till about a month ago - I believe it was produced by holding it to the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the defendant, after the receipt of this letter - A. On the Sunday morning, about ten days after; Sir D. and Lady Gould were gone to church, and all the men servants; we were left at home, sitting in the drawing-room, when we heard the sound of wheels; Charlotte first went out, and when I came out, I found her in conversation with Mr. Jones at the gate, he was asking her to elope with him, the gig had then passed on out of sight - a man named Rawlins was with it. The defendant said he had got every thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110053"/>prepared, with a licence in his pocket, which he produced - I saw the outside of it; he said he had every thing ready to be married at St. Martin's church, next morning; she begged him to go away, saying, she never would have him, without her friends consent. I remonstrated with him, and requested some private conversation, and told him, if he would desist from taking her away, I would write to my father, and ask his consent, he said he never should have such an opportunity again, and no earthly being should ever make him give it up; he appeared in great agitation, when she moved down the walk as I was conversing with him; she went up one of the gravel walks towards the house, and I believe entered the house; he appeared extremely agitated, and went to her in the gravel walk, met her and siezed her by the arm, and said nothing should make him give it up; he said to me</p>
               <p>"If you will only let me take her down the lane for five minutes, on my soul, I'll bring her back again." I said,</p>
               <p>"No, he might speak to her inside the gate, but not down the lane;" he dragged her down the lane, partly by force, and I followed her; when I saw he was using force, I tried what strength I had, I took her by the other arm and pulled the other way, and said</p>
               <p>"Charlotte, is it of your own consent you are going away?" she said,</p>
               <p>"No, go I entreat you, Mr. Jones, the carriage will be come from church;" he said he was determined never to stir from the spot without her, and called me harbarous and inhuman; he then beckoned to the gig, which came up, and attempted to lift her into it - and once I completely pulled her out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she struggle against your pulling her out, or in favour of it - A. I hardly know, I was in such agitation, she resolutely said she would not go to the last moment. He lifted her into the gig - Rawlins still holding the horse. I appealed to him, and asked if he could see a lady taken away against her consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your sister appeal to him - A. I do not recollect, but she intreated Mr. Jones to go away, and said she never would go with him. He succeeded in getting her from me - put her her in the gig and drove off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out and raise the neighbourhood - A. There was no neighbourhood to raise. I did not run after the carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned you to stay from church - A. We both had the hooping cough, she had it slighter than myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you a grandmother living in Milson-street, Bath - A. I had; my sister was there six days, I was not with her, it was after Mr. Jones had been rejected by my father as a suitor; the visit was very sudden - she went to purchase clothes - it is twenty-one miles from home - she did not propose going herself.</p>
               <p>Q. On going to town you knew you should meet Mr. Jones somewhere - A. I did not know it till I met him.</p>
               <p>Q. On the road you learnt he was to meet you - A. Yes, I heard it at Chippenham - we slept there - my brothers came with us to Chippenham.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your brothers left you before you learnt the defendant was to meet you - A. Yes; my eldest brother that was with me, is thirteen years old, and the other is eleven. I knew my father had forbidden his seeing my sister, and perhaps I acted foolish in getting into the stage coach. Mr. Jones appeared to know we were going to Sir Davidge Gould, he generally rode by Sir Davidge's twice a week, and sometimes every day. I did not meet him at the gate by appointment - I went to tell him how angry the family were - I did not know he was coming on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you expected that he would come some time or other and take your sister away - A. I had suspicions - I did not actually know it - I rather expected it - I did not tell Sir Davidge.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I beg you to recollect, when you sister was going off with Mr. Jones, did not you appeal to her and say</p>
               <p>"Will you leave me;" and did she not say,</p>
               <p>"I am determined to go;" - A. Never, she certainly was not sufficiently firm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she do every thing to resist your attempts to prevent her going - A. She made no resistance, one way or the other - she appeared frightened. We heard she kept the house for a week, with the hooping cough, except going into the garden now and then.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is it not inconvenient to go to church with the hooping cough - A. Yes, there are many charity children who might be affected by it.</p>
               <p>The following is the letter referred to in evidence -</p>
               <p>HATFIELD, NOV. 1820.</p>
               <p>Nothing was wanting but your letter of yesterday to complete the misery you have from time to time heaped upon me; however, your commands, as for as regards me, shall be obeyed. I will give up the only ray of comfort I have known since I left Bath, that of seeing you for a moment as I pass; and cease to appear before that house that holds every thing that is dear to me, but when you bid me think no more of you, you ask a thing out of my power to comply with, as it rests with you alone. Give me back that happiness you have robbed me off - restore that heart which you alone possess, and take from me the remembrance that I have ever seen or loved you, and then I will think of you no more.</p>
               <p>The sanction of your father I once gained, but he withdrew it from me without a reason; or if he had one, without allowing me a chance of an explanation. I addressed a letter to him couched in terms that could not offend; in as much as it breathed the most fervent respect for him, and the most ardent affection for you. I only entreated, that should my endeavours to satisfy him on every point succeed, he would no longer withhold his approbation, but he rather choose to increase the anguish he was conscious I must feel, by leaving my letter entirely unanswered.</p>
               <p>The cutting style in which your letter is written, particularly its conclusion, is a cruelty I have not deserved; what conduct of mine has tended to lesson your esteem for me I know not. I have uniformly studied to preserve that interest I thought I possessed in your heart; and to loose it will constitute the greatest affliction in my life: and, remembering as I do, that happiness was almost in my grasp till removed by an invisable* hand is another aggravation to my sufferings. Believe me then Charlotte, I will ever strive to deserve you, and therefore bid you adieu; with feeling, that the love I have for you will never know a change, except by increase of affection.</p>
               <p>I have put a dash under invisable, to give you a hint.</p>
               <p>(Signed)</p>

            . I was present at a conversation between Mr. Lovell's brother and the defendant, on the 14th of December last, at Chippenham. I went to Cole Park, by desire of the defendant, and offered to take a letter to Mr. Lovell, to let him know the state his daughter was in. The defendant had informed me she was in London, and unmarried. I had an interview with Mr. Lovell, and delivered him the letter, and broke this unpleasant business to him, and in consequence of this, I and Mr. Lovell's brother met the defendant at Chippenham. Mr. Lovell's brother requested Mr. Jones to give up his niece, and if he would do so, or say where she was in London, that he might fetch her, Mr. Lovell would enter no proceedings against him, as he wished to have his daughter. Mr. Jones refused to give her up; without Mr. Lovell came down with a settlement to pay his debts. He said he would marry her providing his debts were paid, and Mr. Lovel came down with a settlement, but he would not give her up without. Mr. Lovell returned to Cole Park. The defendant called on me on his way to town from Bath, and said he had seen Mr. Lovell with both their solicitors but they could not settle any thing, and he was on his way to town by the mail. The defendant told me he was a man of very little property, and that he had incurred some debts by this running off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. He is a brother officer in your regiment - A. Yes; he served with me in Ireland. I understand his mother to be a respectable lady.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this lady's mother requested you to introduce him to her family - A. She did afterwards. I never met him at any balls.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Pray how did the defendant's introduction happen - A. He wished me to introduce him at Cirencester, which I declined, and he called on me at Chippenham, to desire me to go over with him to introduce him, which I declined. I met him at Bath races, and he wished me to introduce him. I felt a delicacy at doing so without applying to Mrs. Lovell, and I applied to her on the race course; I told her I knew very little of him, and wished to ask her permission before I introduced him. He was introduced on the race course.</p>

            . I am solicitor to Mr. Lovell. I have heard him examined. I was present at the interview at Bath. I met the defendant and Messrs. Walker and Lovell. I pointed out to the defendant the crime he had been guilty of in swearing a false affidavit; he said he had sworn to the best of his belief. I told him he must have made a positive affidavit that she was of age. We then entered into conversation respecting matters being arranged. Mr. Walker, the defendant's solicitor stated what I consider to be the real situation of the defendant. The property was stated to be at 500 l. per annum; consisting of a large old mansion, and a few acres of land, which a gentleman that fancied such a thing would give any thing for. I happened to know the property I believe it is let at two hundred and seventy pounds a year; and I believe there is forty or fifty acres of land, let at about two hundred pounds more, and that he had one thousand pounds more in the funds. On farther enquiry, it appeared his mother had an annuity of above one hundred and thirty pounds, payable out of the property for life. The defendant stated that his mother would wave that. I said it was necessary that it should be done in writing. On further enquiry, it turned out that Jones was only tenant for life. Mr. Lovell consented to his daughter marrying the defendant on the settlement being made, which never was done, he said he could not settle it without going to his mother.</p>
               <p>The paragraph enclosed was produced by holding the letter to the fire.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. All this passed while Mr. Lovell was ignorant where his daughter was - A. Yes, he certainly talked coolly about it. If the settlement had been made he would not have objected to it.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY addressed the Jury at considerable length on behalf of the defendant, pointing out the evident consent of Miss Lovell to elope with him, and the consent of Mr. Lovell to arrange the matter subsequent.</p>

On the 19th of March, about one o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to buy ribbons - I did not hear her ask for them. I observed her speaking to a young man; she was about leaving the shop, I heard her say she would not buy the ribbons unless he would agree to take them back again after they were cut off, if not approved of. I suspected her, and perceived a piece of ribbon concealed in the palm of her hand; she saw that I saw it, and immediately threw it down - I seized her arm, she was very much agitated, and drew another piece from her pocket. I afterwards found another piece near her. She begged pardon, and requested we would not send for any body. She was taken into custody. The pieces of ribbon she took from her pocket were worth 5 s. 9 d.</p>

               <p>"You are the very chaps I have been looking for all the morning," Adams had passed me. I said to Hughes, I want you - he said to Adams,</p>
               <p>"This man wants you" - Adams turned round and said he would be d - d if I should not carry the lead myself - he threw his basket of lead down and ran away - I followed him - he got away, Hughes escaped up Saville-row; next day he was brought to Malborough-street. I took Adams on the Friday following. I am sure they are the men, I knew them before, both the bag and basket contained lead. I took it to the watch-house and marked it. I was present when it was fitted to the larder - it corresponded exactly. I had left it at the watch-house with Pepper.</p>

I desired him to leave them alone, before he had got his hand on it, he took them off the board, and I got within a yard or two of him - he attempted to run out - he then ran, I followed and took him about twenty-five yards from the door. He threw them down. I brought him back and gave him in charge - he was never out of my sight.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at No. 25, Cornwall-place. On Saturday morning, the 7th of April, the prisoner was brought to my door - the person who brought him charged him with this robbery. I searched him and found the duplicate of a coat, pawned for 15 s., and one pair of trowsers pawned on the 5th of April. I asked if the duplicates were his own, he said they did not belong to the prosecutor. I brought him to town and found the waistcoat and trowsers at the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . I am watchman to Messrs. Curling. I remember the boom being on their premises. I saw it last a little past five o'clock in the afternoon, of the 8th of March. She was made fast at both ends to our yard gate, leading to our dry dock, and was quite safe. I missed it about eleven o'clock at night, the ropes were untied, they were cast off - it must have been done designedly. I have not seen it since.</p>

            . I am foreman to Messrs. Curling and Co. The boom was worth about 7 l. I found it at Greenwich, in the possession of one Allen, cut into pieces, it was an old ship's mast, but perfectly serviceable - when cut up it would not be worth half that. I am sure the pieces I saw were pieces of it - there were several ring belts and other marks by which I knew them.</p>

On the morning of the 24th of November, I was at work in a garden, in Wheatley-lane, about eight o'clock. I saw the prisoner and another man come down the lane, with each a sack on his shoulder, which appeared very heavy. I watched the prisoner to the corner of the lane, he put his bag down and looked about - then took it up, and both went together towards Brentford. I followed them and sent for assistance - he stopped to rest. I followed them to Iseleworth Park - when they saw me following them, they took towards Isleworth they saw me - then threw down the bag and ran away. I did not see him again till he was taken up. I am sure the prisoner is one of the men. I knew him before. I followed them to the lodge - Neal came out and overtook the other man who has been convicted. I did not see the prisoner again till about a fortnight ago, when I took him myself, at Mr. Hunt's, a chimney-sweeper's, at Brentford. When I went to enquire for him he was denied - I found him in a bed-room. I left the bags with Winkworth.</p>

On this morning I was going home to my breakfast, about half-past eight o'clock, and met two men in the lane heavily laden, with each a bag. I will not swear the prisoner is one of them. When they came opposite me, they threw the bags down, and ran away, one was secured, and the other escaped. I fitted the lead to the staircase - it fitted the edge and was quite fresh cut - it was stolen from those premises. It is worth about 25 s. per cwt. and would take much more to repair it.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 7th of March, at a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners near Hackney new church, coming in a direct line from Clapton, towards London; they passed me, I observed they had a bundle, I returned and asked what they had, Clear said he had a bag of tools, and produced a hammer from the bag - Titmouse said nothing; he had another bag - I stopped them, put my hand to the bag, found a book and two bottles in it, there were tools besides; I then took them to a public-house, and found one book in Clear's coat, and a small book in his coat pocket. I found two small books in Titmouse's coat pocket; they were dressed as working men, and said they had been at work were the fire happened. I took them both to Mr. Hamilton - he claimed the books.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You found they had been at work at the ruins of the fire - A. Yes, Mr. Hamilton said no doubt the books were his. I did not hear him say he could not swear to them - Titmouse gave me no account where he got them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Clear said he saved the things out of the rubbish to take care of them - A. He said so before the magistrate.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer. On Tuesday, the 6th of March, I was employed to go to Clapton, by the Hand in Hand fire-office, to estimate the loss of Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Judson; Titmouse met me at Clapton by my order, and we there met Mr. Rubens, who informed me where the furniture was put. Titmouse accompanied me to take an inventory of them; we found the furniture and property, in five or six different houses. On the following morning, the prisoners went with a small caravan to collect the different articles of Mr. Judson's, to a place of safety, which they did, and in the evening of Wednesday, I saw what property of Mr. Hamilton's was saved in the opposite house; some furniture and about 100 volumes were in the green house. When they finished their work, I told them they might go; the books had not then been removed from the green-house. I left the prisoners there between five and six o'clock, and told them to go, as they had nothing more to do - they said nothing about finding any books or wine - what property was found, was to be deposited in the neighbourhood, not taken to town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time in the evening would the green-house be locked - A. I do not know that there was a lock on it, the property was under the protection of the fireman - I told them they might go - Titmouse was very active.</p>

Between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was up in the room, the sheets were then on the bed, and the shoes by the bed side; I locked the stable door - I returned at seven o'clock, and found the sheets gone. I suspected the prisoner, as he was lurking about the gate in the day-time. I got information on Sunday, and in the evening I took him at his lodgings at Shadwell, with the shoes on his feet. I asked what he had done with the sheets, he said he had pawned them, and gave me the duplicate - I gave him in charge.</p>

I desired her to walk in the parlour, as she would soon be in. She did so - she sat on the left hand side of the fire-place. A few minutes after a person came in and paid me 1 l. 15 s., I left the money on the table, while I shewed him to the door. I returned and took the money off the table, and placed it on the mantle-piece, in a mug. A person then came in, and while I was attending him, I saw her move from the left side of the fire to the right. She then took the opportunity of taking the money out of the mug.

On Friday morning, the 2d of March, about eight o'clock, Bradley came to me, and said, two boys were stealing my pots. I came up with the prisoners about half a mile from my house, going into Somers-town. They both had pots. Just before I came up with them, I saw Gilbert give a string of pots to Hill to carry. I took hold of Hill, and asked what he was going to do with the pots - he said to take them home to scour them. I never employed him to do it - he had seventeen in all.

I watched, and saw them go to No. 28, a private house, and take a pint pot off the rails - they then went to No. 30, where there were three pots on the rails - they took one of them. They then went to No. 35. and took one pot from there - then to No. 37, and took one. I saw the road they took, and told Butt what I had seen. We followed them to several houses in Somers town. They were secured - they had seventeen pots in all. They said they were going to take them to scour them.</p>

I went with the watchman by his direction to a house in Upper Norton-street, and found the coat. I found it so altered I could not swear to it, but he told me he had taken it to a tailor, and had a velvet collar put on and other buttons - I never gave him the coat.</p>

            . I am a tailor; the prisoner brought me the coat about the 8th or the 9th of February; it had been very little worn - he was then living with Mr. Young. I put new buttons to it, and a velvet collar; the buttons on it before were plain gilt, I put the same sort on, and altered it to fit him - he said he bought it for about 30 s. but did not say of whom - I saw the coat at Marlborough-street - it is the same.</p>

It was a silver hunting watch, I gave seven guineas for it, it is worth 5 l. I had three gold seals worth 1 l., and a gold key. I followed in an instant, he turned down Calmell-buildings, and got to the bottom; I saw a woman in the court - I saw his hand go towards her hand, and at the moment I was in the act of seizing him, we both fell. I got up and collared him, a watchman came up, and immediately as I collared him, the female prisoner came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"what are you at? that is my husband, I have not left him ten minutes;" she was dressed the same, and was the same in appearance as the woman. I have never seen my watch since.

I took Knight by the watchman's assistance, but the woman was not taken till Monday; she followed us to the watch-house, and was searched there that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she follow you instantly - A. She got there nearly as soon as us, but which way she came I cannot say. On the Monday following, I had occasion to go to Portman-square, and met her - she stopped me herself; I was not aware that she was by me, she said,</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, Sir - are you not the gentleman who lost the watch on Saturday night" - I said I was; she asked if I would persevere in prosecuting the prisoner, if I got the watch restored to me; I said I would make no proposals, till I saw the watch. She then asked where I lived - I told her; she said she would bring it me in half an hour, that she had got 14 s. of a person, and that would obtain it - she left me. I then went to the watch-house to tell them, and just as we got near the watch-house, Coates took her.</p>
               <p>KNIGHT. Q. Did you not say I put my hand out to to the woman, at the time I was on the ground - A. I said, just in the act of falling, he put his hand out to her before he fell.</p>

            . I am a constable of the night; both the prisoners were brought to the watch-house. I searched, but found nothing on them - we let the woman go. On the Monday, she came to me again, and asked, if I thought the prosecutor would make it up, if she could get the watch, as she had heard, somebody had picked it up. I told her to get it; she came back without it, and said she could not find the person, but she would go again. I followed her to Gee's-court, and into Henrietta-street. I saw her stop with a man - I suspected something, and apprehended her.</p>

Lewis said when I came here, I should be hung, and that greatly alarmed me; he said if the watch was brought forward, I should be discharged; so I sent this woman to enquire for it, that I might be saved from condign punishment - I gave her what money I had to get it.</p>

             was a debtor of mine, of 6 l. 10 s. 10 d. I never received that sum - it was due to the partnership. Coakley never interfered in the concern; I never received this money, nor any draft for it, either from Mr. Stodhart or the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter, and tell me whose writing it is - A. It is the prisoner's. I know it well, he left me very unwell. I received this letter on the 27th of June, 1820, and took out a warrant against him about that time. When he left me, I had a Mr. Smart to succeed him, for a short time.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this receipt - whose writing is it - A. The prisoner's, Mr. Stodhart shewed it to me, about the time that I took out the warrant, and after the prisoner left me. I am not indebted to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110062"/>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is Mr. Coakley alive or dead - A. He died about six months ago. There was a dispute between us at one time, but a dissolution took place - we had nothing to do with law after the dissolution.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that Mr. Coakley warned the prisoner not to pay over any money, till the dispute was ended - A. I never knew it; he never interfered. When the dispute happened, Mr. Coakley consulted a Mr. Bull - I believe he demanded 300 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I put it to you again, and desire you will never cautiously. Did not Mr. Coakley and his solicitor, tell you, no more money should be paid to you by the collector, till you satisfied his demand - A. Never, Mr. Bull is not carrying on a lawsuit against me now. There was an arrangement when the dissolution took place - 100 l. was paid over.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the prisoner a person who went backwards and forwards between you, Coakley, and Mr. Bull - A. I do not know that ever he went.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you aware that you are a witness on your oath - A. Yes; the unpleasant manner in which you put your questions, induces me to say I will not answer any more.</p>
               <p>COURT. The Court will decide what are legal questions, and if they are legal, you are bound to answer; the Counsel has a right to pursue his instructions - if questions are illegal the Court will interfere.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Now, Sir, was not the prisoner sent again, and again, between you and Mr. Coakley, to the solicitor who arranged the business between you - A. I do not recollect ever sending him, the business was arranged by my solicitor. I kept the books. Kirby sometimes made an entry, he was the only person appointed to collect booksellers' bills. Mr. Stodhart is a bookseller. When the prisoner received money, it was his duty to enter it - if I was there he sometimes gave the money to me. I have the cash-book here, there is no entry of this money in it. When I observed the money unpaid, I credited Mr. Stodhart in my ledger in these words,</p>
               <p>"Cash paid to Kirby."</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the pocket-ledger which the prisoner used to carry about to collect it - A. I believe it is in the library, it is a book of no consequence - I have brought all the books that are necessary. I have not got it here.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it happened to you to burn any books, or were they burnt by accident - A. No; no book has been burnt by accident or design. The receipt is dated the 16th of October, 1819. Coakley was alive when I discovered this money was paid. I did not go to Mr. Coakley to represent to him any thing about debts being stopped in the hands of the collector. I took out a warrant against the prisoner shortly after I discovered it. Lavender or Bishop had it to execute - I do not know when he was taken. I went before the Grand Jury last Sessions - I was not aware that I could go before the Grand Jury till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on your oath, did you not know where to find the prisoner from the time he left you as well as you knew where to find the Sessions-house, in the Old Bailey - A. On my solemn oath I did not - his letter was dated from Lumber-court. On my oath I do not know where he lived, I never met him to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q.Was Coakley an acting or sleeping partner - A. A sleeping partner. The prisoner was to account to me and not to him - the book is one he entered names in of persons he had to collect from - it was his own memorandum book. This was discovered subsequent to the dissolution. I kept the partnership's book - Coakley had nothing to do with them.</p>
               <p>The receipt was then put in and read, dated the 16th of October, 1819, and signed

My proposals are as follows: in the first month (or at least the expiration of) I will give Mr. Fearman from five to ten pounds, and then I will give him half a guinea per week until the whole is paid or my own bills for the account. I beg to observe that I do not limit myself exactly to the above sums as probably I can pay more, but depend on it, I declare most solemnly that I will pay the above, should it meet Mr. Fearman's kind approbation. I must beg pardon for not giving a correct statement of the accounts at first, but I hope you will make some allowance for the state my mind was in at the time.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Lubbocks. I turned to Mr. Stodhart's account, and found, on the 16th of October, 1819, an entry of a draft for 6 l. 10 s. 1 d. paid in the name of Kirby. I gave him six 1 l. notes, 10 s. 1 d. that is the entry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have no recollection of the person who received it - A. Not the smallest - Kirby is the name the person gave. I made the entry myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg to say I particularly wished Mr. Fearman to bring all his books, and sent him a letter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110063"/>to that effect, telling him they were necessary to establish my innocence, particularly a red book which he well knows that he burnt before me, with an intent to defraud his partner, and laughed at the idea of it; also a green book in which I entered money I received. I frequently collected perhaps 29 l. in a day, and laid out 25 l. All the money in the concern was Mr. Coakley's. I kept the business together - I wanted 100 l. a year, he gave me 30 s. a week. I was to be advanced as business increased, but I never had that honour, though I made his business to exceed 1000 l. a year, and was always considered to be Mr. Fearman, and was sent by him to attend the opera, and visited every place of amusement with him, and he promised me part of his business. When I left him I was confined by illness, and I told him I was going to live with Mr. Parkes, in Dean-street, Soho; he knew I lived at this house for six months, and never slept from it - I went out every morning to my business. I was told he had a warrant out against me, but knowing my innocence I never absconded. He frequently met me and turned round to look at me, and why not take me, but no, he had not then proved that inveteracy against me which he is so capable of. When his partner died he knew his friends would enter an action against him for burning the old books and making new ones, and at that time I did not countenance him as I did before, and he did not take me to places of amusement as before. I was appointed arbitrator between him and his partner. I met him one night to investigate the books - he bought a new cash book, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now I will do them for all their deepness" - he got me to call over the sums - he entered the large ones in the new book, and left out the small ones, then burnt the book. His poor partner was in a dreadful state of mind and came to the shop - he told him the concern was going to the devil, and the business was worth nothing, when it was worth 1000 l. He frequently told me to turn him out of the shop. When he came to enquire when his partner died, and he found I would not countenance him, he charged me with embezzlement. I trust the Court will see this is as great a conspiracy as was ever heard of. I declare my innocence.</p>

On the 29th of March he was employed in the east warehouse, and had access to what was called the further east warehouse. Some coffee was in the east part of No. 1, warehouse - it had come by the Havannah. I saw the bags perfectly safe in the morning, just before. I examined a bag, and found it had been cut - the cut, which was at the top of the bag, was about six inches long - it appeared to have been plundered. I went to Mr. Royce, and he kept watch. I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody at the front door of the east wing. I said to him</p>

Between one and four o'clock I was placed to watch the warehouse, and saw the prisoner between two and three o'clock coming from the inner east passage; when he came to one of the bags he stopped, turned himself round, leaned over the bag, and appeared to be taking coffee out - he stood there about two minutes, and then returned the same way he came; I then went and examined the bag, it appeared to have been disturbed. I gave information, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many were employed in the warehouse - A. About thirty. I was about eighteen yards from the bags. I saw no coffee on the floor - there was a deficiency of 5 lbs. in the taring weight.</p>

               <p>H. R. REYNOLDS, ESQ. (re-examined.) I selected a cravat of my own, and a handkerchief of my son's, and gave them to Ruthven, and returned to my house with him. The prisoner opened the door to us. I told him Ruthven was an officer, that I suspected him of stealing my linen and wine, and he must search him. He made no objection, but went down with us to his room. Ruthven searched, and somewhere found a third handkerchief, the one I had seen by the bed in the morning was gone. On looking at it, I found it marked H. R. R. I asked him how he came by it - he said I gave it him, which was certainly not so. Ruthven opened his box, and somewhere found a key. He asked the prisoner what key it was; he said it belonged to his son. I tried that key, and found it opened my library table, in which I keep my cellar keys. He knew I kept them there, and has seen me take them out from there. I had missed wine before. I came down and told him it was now clear to me how he had got the wine and spirits, which I had often smelt him to have been drinking. He said,</p>
               <p>"Well, if I have had wine and spirits, it is impossible I could get through the hard work of your place upon small beer." In November last I had fifteen dozen bottles of a particular Port sent into my back cellar, of which I had at that time used but two bottles - it was not the cellar in which the wine in drink was kept. I examined the quantity left, about two days after the prisoner was apprehended, and then found only eight dozen and a half left. I missed about six dozen. That wine could not be got at without a false key to my cellar, or a false key to the drawer in which the cellar key was kept. There was not the least appearance of force being used to the cellar. I attended the examination before the magistrate - what he said was not taken down. After the examination of myself, the magistrate asked if he would put any questions to me - he said,</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for what I have done, but I have not taken so much wine as my master supposes."</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I was fetched to Mr. Reynolds's, and produce two handkerchiefs found at the laundress's. Mr. Reynolds took them off the horse. I then went back, and searched the prisoner's room, in his presence, and found this handkerchief between the mattress and sacking. I found a neckcloth in the dirty clothes bag, in his room. He said the one I found under the bed was his; and when Mr. Reynolds came down he said he gave it him. Mr. Reynolds denied it. I found a key in the prisoner's box, which he said belonged to a box he had in the City. I asked where? - I pressed the question. He then said it belonged to a box of his son's, at No. 16, Castle-street, Southwark. He then said it was No. 26. I went and found his son either at No. 25, or No. 27 - The key would open no box there.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. I found in the back part adjoining the cellar, two or three dozen empty bottles, marked the same as the wine I lost - I had no others marked that way.</p>

I found some slates there - I knew them to be my brother-in-law's. I had loaded them into a cart, to be sent to Jay's - they were the very same sort. When I found them at Davidge's, they were covered over with a kind of shutter - it did not conceal them - he was taken to Bow-street the same day. They might be worth 4 s. or 5 s. - but I have sold them out at my brother's, at 12 s. per 100. There were about one hundred and fifty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Why are they worth only 5 s. - A. They are old.

            . I am sixteen years old, and am apprentice to Mr. Campbell. I was employed in carrying up the slates, in October. The prisoner Holman sat me to work at one end of the roof, and went down the ladder to the other end, and put a tier and a half of slates into Davidge's cart - he lived at Hampstead. I told my master of it in February, when he asked me about it. I had no quarrel with Holman. I went to work with him at Camden-town, and he said if it came to his master's ears he would turn him away, and give him a bad character - and when I came into the shop afterwards, the men would be always drilling me, and I should never learn my trade. He told me not to tell of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Who drove the cart - A. Randall. We had no quarrel at all, he might have been swearing at me, and wanting me to do more work than I ought.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you leave him out of ill will - A. He told the men he would not pay me. I said I would leave - and he said I might. I knew nothing about this till I was fetched to Bow-street.</p>

               <persName id="t18210411-102-person1155">Ellis</persName>
             the watchman. I had reason to suspect one of the boys. I went with Ellis to an old iron shop, kept by the prisoner on Saffron-hill - his name was over the door. Ellis went behind the counter, and handed me up a roll of brass, it weighed about 50 lbs. - and in the parlour another roll was found, about the same weight. It was new brass, and I am certain it is mine - it is worth 1 s. 3 d. per pound. I told him it was mine - he said it was not; that he had bought it of a gentleman who was distressed for money, to make up a bill. He said it was a pity to deprive him of his liberty, and I might take the property back. In consequence of something Ellis asked him if he knew my boy - he said he did not. My boy Warner was there at the time, in custody.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did not the boy say he carried it to the prisoner - A. He said he gave it him in his master's shop.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street. I was employed by Mr. Keats on the 7th of March, in the morning. I followed Warner from Mr. Keats's to the prisoner house, on Saffron-hill. He had made several halts and turns, and looked round as if he thought he was watched. He turned suddenly back on Saffron-hill, and I went into a house, that he might not suspect me. I lost him for about ten minutes - then saw him come out of the prisoner's house. He went a few doors down the street, into a shoemaker's, and the prisoner followed him - and in a few minutes came out. I saw nothing with him. Next day I followed the boy again, from his master's, about half way down Saffron-hill - I there apprehended him. He had nothing with him. I took him to Mr. Keats. I then went to the prisoner's house, and found two rolls of brass, one in the shop, and the other in the parlour. He said he had bought it of a man like a porter, with a white apron on. I understood him to say he gave 12 1/2 d. per pound for it. When he got to the Office he was shewn to the boy, and asked if he knew him, and if he was the person he bought it of? He said No - it was a man much older, and that he never saw the boy before, and that he did not know the prosecutor or his shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Keats present when he said he did not know him - A. He was. I do not believe that he was pointed out to him. He was in the shop, and claimed the brass when I found it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Keats. I lived about two years with him. I first got acquainted with the prisoner about nine months ago - I took him a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110066"/>brass of my own, and sold it to him - he asked how I came by it - I said it was my own - he said I need not mind, for if it was any thing belonging to my master he would buy it of me; he took me into his back parlour and gave me something to drink. I afterwards met him in St. John-street, he took me to a public-house and gave me something to drink again, and said if I would bring any thing belonging to my master he would buy it, and nobody would know any thing of it. I took him three square files, and he bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him on the 6th of March - A. Yes, he asked what time my master would be up in the morning, and what time I went into the shop, and if I served in the shop. He came to the shop on the 6th and 7th of March, both mornings, and I delivered him a roll of brass each morning in the shop - he brought a basket; and came to buy a file, and I put the brass into his basket, he told me they weighed 34 lbs. I was to have 4 d. a lb. for it. I saw them afterwards at Bow-street they were the rolls I delivered him; he paid me 2 s. at a time for it. We tossed for gin, and victuals and things together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been robbing your master - A. Six or eight months. I sold goods to nobody but him - I thought all along it was a shocking thing. I told about it the moment I was taken. Wilson was in the shop on the morning when he came, but did not see it taken. I went to the prisoner's house the same day. I am eighteen years old.</p>

            . I keep an old iron shop in Short's Gardens, Drury-lane. On the 11th of April, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, Ellis and Wildey came to my shop with a quantity of screws, locks, inkstands, horn handles, files, and a dog's collar, which they offered me for sale. I asked who sent them - they said they got them in Regency Park. I said they do not suit me, at the same time a man came in and told me to take them in charge, while he went after more; he brought Brooks in, and took them away with the property.</p>

I missed them, and in a moment or two after I saw them row to the same side.

            . I am seventeen years old. On the 2d of March, about seven o'clock, I locked the pigs up safe. I went there at five o'clock next morning, and found the staple of the middle door drawn, and seven pigs gone. I saw five of them again on the 10th of March, at the prisoner's house - he was a hawking butcher. I know them by the marks on the rump, which I put on them when my father bought them - they were alive; he had them in a dark corner of his shed. I had called at his house on the 8th, and asked his wife if they had any; I went in the yard and looked at two sows. On the 10th, I got a search warrant out and found them.</p>

            . I am a coachman. I was standing by the coach-stand, in Adam-street, West; some men came up, and asked if I had seen a man and boy with each a basket. I had seen a man exactly like the prisoner, pass with a basket, about two minutes before, and heard the rattling of pots in the basket. I then heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running through the mews - I stopped him. I saw the basket thrown down that he had when he passed me - it contained pots. I assisted in taking him - the boy was discharged.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was going up George-street, Portman-square, and saw the prisoner with a frail basket with a cover to it, and saw him take two or three pint pots from the rails and doorway of different houses. I saw him at No. 30, King-street, Portman-square, in company with a boy about eleven years old; the boy took a pint pot off the door, and the prisoner put it in the basket. I went towards Edgware-road, and saw the prisoner coming along with the basket, apparently very heavy. I thought he belonged to a publican, and did not suspect him; he came to Adam's Mews, dropped the basket and ran off. There was a cry of Stop thief! - he joined in the cry, I saw him stopped; some time after, I went to Marlborough-street, and saw him in the middle room - he tried to escape.</p>

               <p>"Where?" He said to the Oval, in Upper Gower-street; that he brought them from his brother's, who was butler to Miss Doughty, in Bedford-row; that the coachman desired him to take them for him, but that he did not know the coachman's name, nor did he know the man's name he was to take them to. Two carriages came by at the time, and he made off with the bundle; I instantly followed, overtook him in about two minutes, and found his account false.</p>

               <p>"Drop it Jones, drop it Jones;" he dropped it directly and was taken, the prisoner escaped, but came again afterwards. I was afraid to touch him, because he caught hold of my shoulders and pinched me, to prevent my running after Jones - he told me to take him if he was guilty, the officer was out and I could not take him. When he heard I had a warrant out against him, he came by about a month after, and said,</p>

I had seen him that night, but did not know he was concerned, he was in the alley standing by, I only came up after Jones was taken by the watchman. I took him on the 27th of March. I had been looking for him several times, and once saw him, but he jumped out of the window in his shirt at one o'clock in the morning and escaped.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was in John-street with Read, and saw the cart, we followed the prisoner and another, all the way from St. Giles's, they were following another cart, they left there and went to Berners-street; we followed them, they came opposite John-street - Splatt and George crossed and went into John-street, and joined Caton. Read went on the left-hand side and I on the right; the moment I got into the street I saw this cart unloading. I saw George go in front and take the basket from the cart - he then walked as if he was going into Oxford-street. I followed him - Caton and Splatt gave him a signal that I was following - he then dropped the basket. I caught hold of him, pulled him across the street, and took Caton. Read picked it up and secured Splatt.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of March, about one o'clock in the morning, I went to the prosecutor's house - I knocked at the prisoner's room door, and went in. He was at home. Mrs. Pounsberry said she suspected her things were taken. She read over an inventory of the things which she let with the room, and she missed these things. He said he had pawned them. I asked for the duplicates. He said he could not produce them, because they were with his brother-in-law. I said if they were not produced I must search him. He then took out a purse containing about fifty duplicates, and selected four from them. One of them was dated the 10th of February. The prosecutrix said she only let him the lodgings on the 9th. His wife is a short woman.</p>

On the 27th of March, about half-past six o'clock in the morning - I had been out all night - I was attending to my business till half-past one o'clock, and fell in company with the prisoner at the Bunch of Grapes, public-house, in Ratliff-highway. There were three or four in company. I had four 1 l. notes and 20 s. in silver, in my breeches pocket. The prisoner was in company with the man who robbed me. We sat on a bench before the fire. I remained there until four o'clock. I was sober. We went from there to the Newcastle coffee-house, Billingsgate. My money was safe when I was at Billingsgate. There were three men in company - the prisoner and the man who robbed me, and a woman. We stopped there till half-past five o'clock, and went from thence to Whitechapel. I paid for four pots of beer for the prisoner, as his share - he had no change, and said he could get change at Whitechapel. We all four went together to a coffee-shop, in Wentworth-street - the master refused to serve us. We left the house altogether, and went to the <placeName id="t18210411-125-crimeloc766">Compasses, in Brick-lane</placeName>

I wished the prisoner to get change, and pay me what I had laid out for him. He said he could not, but he thought I could give him change for a 1 l. note. To satisfy him, I pulled out my silver and four 1 l. notes with it. The other man snatched the notes, and ran away. I ran after the other man - the prisoner followed, and tripped me up in the street, when I was close to the other man. I should have caught him if it had not been for him. They then both ran away together - but Reynolds stopped him. I was quite sober. The woman remained in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were not intoxicated - A. No. We had seven pots of beer at Ratcliff-highway, three at the next place, and one at the last. The woman was tipsy. I am sure the prisoner tripped me up. I perceived him kick my heel up sideways. I am in the habit of drinking a great deal.</p>

He denied it. I had opened the windows to let in the air. The cruets were in May's possession. I had shut the shutter to, and drawn the blind, as a gentleman lay dead in the house.

One of them got over a piece of timber, which I was getting into my gate. I suspected, and ran after them. He was fifteen yards beyond me. As soon as he saw me running, he ran too, and his companion also. Before I overtook them, he dropped the cruets and stand out of his apron. I brought him back, and said,</p>

I got six away, went back again, and the prisoner said two had got down a privy; I looked, but could not find them; we traced footmarks of them from the spot into his yard, listened, and heard pigs grunt: Partridge knocked at the door several times, but got no answer - we found the pigs tied to a table in the front room - Partridge found the prisoner up stairs - he occupied the house.

On the evening of the 19th of March, a little after nine o'clock, the prisoners came to my shop - Daltry asked for half a pound of iron wire. I told the shopman to serve him. Some brass wire was in a kind of cupboard on the counter - they stood close to the cupboard. I saw them shuffling about, and after they were served, he found a piece of brass wire under Hill's apron. I said he should go to the watch-house. Daltry immediately fell on his knees, and begged forgiveness. While the watchman was gone for, Hill produced two more pieces. None was found on Daltry.</p>

I took him, and asked who the other two were - he said one was the coloured boy Williams, and the other was Saucy Jack. I went into Short's-gardens, and found Williams and another in an old iron shop, with the kettle. They threw it down and ran away. I took Williams the same night.</p>

            . I keep a cart of my own. I was drinking with Cavenaugh at a public-house, at Wapping, in the evening. He asked if I would have a bit of flour to take home. He had worked with me about four years ago, at a meal warehouse. I said I did not care. I gave him my handkerchief, and he went and fetched me some. I knew he was in Walter's employ. He brought me back 7 lbs. His wife came in and asked if he was coming home. (The public-house is in front of the prosecutor's) - he asked her to drink some porter; she went on, and he and I came after. There was something under her shawl. I did not see who gave it her.

I went after her, and asked what she had got - she made no answer. I found it was 10 lbs. of flour. Wise had 7 lbs. Russell said she brought her's from St. Catherine's, and Wise said he gave a man two pots of porter for his.</p>

In about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110077"/>an hour and a half, in consequence of what my servant said, I went up, and found this bed tied up, and put into his basket, in his room - he was fast asleep.

Hart came in soon after, I had known him some time about the Mews, he asked me to mind a purse for him till he wanted it, as he was afraid of spending all his money; he put it into my hand - directly after W. Jones, (Mr. Jones's nephew) came in, and Hart gave some loose money into another person's hand to keep for him. Jones told him if he stirred, he would knock him down, and said, he knew what he had done, they sent for an officer - the young man who had the loose money threw it down, and I threw his purse on the table and came out.</p>

            . I live at the Naval school, Blackwall. On the 24th of March, between half-past six and seven o'clock, I had been drinking at a public-house, in Winkfield-street. I had received these notes from Grote and Prescott's, and had it all safe in my pocket-book, which was in my jacket pocket. I was the worse for liquor, but not insensible. I went into a shop for half an ounce of tobacco. Evans came in and asked me to walk up stairs with her. I went to the front room - first floor, and found Simmonds there - I staid about five minutes. Evans went below leaving us together; she said it was her sister's room, but her house was over the way. I went over into <placeName id="t18210411-151-crimeloc932">George-yard</placeName>

               <p>"He will only give me -</p>
               <p>"mentioning some sum, what I forget. I found myself in an awkward predicament - Evans said I will take it, and I gave it her - what it was I cannot say - it was either 18 d. or 2 s. I had given it to Simmonds and she gave it to Evans. Simmonds came and leant over my left shoulder or under my arm, and took my pocket-book from my pocket, and went down stairs immediately - I jumped up and followed her. Evans did not attempt to hinder me - - this was Saturday. I saw her again on Wednesday week following - they were taken in Shire-lane, Temple-bar I have not recovered my property. I am positive of their persons.</p>

I called Stop thief! and they called out also. I saw the prisoner throw some of the property over the rails of a yard; I knew him before, and went to his father's - he was not at home. When I got home, I missed a salt-holder, stand, and tumbler; a man produced the stand from over the rails - It was in my shop just before.</p>

I did not want any thing from his father to settle it. I know where the other boy is, but do not wish to trouble my head about it.</p>

               <p>"Bring that back directly;" he turned round and laughed at me. I saw him with glass in his hand, and told the prosecutor which way he went.</p>

I stood against the corner of the door, and had not been there above two minutes, before I felt a hand in my right hand breeches pocket; I seized it, looked round, and saw a face, but the hand was immediately snatched away. I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or not; I waited there a few minutes, as the company were going into the theatre. When I felt the hand, I found my pocket turned inside out, and three half crowns and 6 d. gone; this was not the pocket in which I felt the hand; they had robbed this first. I saw my money again, and knew one of the half crowns by a mark which I pointed out to the officer - I had taken it in the course of the day; it was one of George IV. and the first I ever saw; it had a scratch on the head from the nose to the four figures of 1 - I found that it corresponded.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I was at the Royalty, as the half-price was going in, and saw the prisoner attempt several people's pockets. I saw him put his hand round Hart, and put his fingers about half way into his pocket, but saw him take something. Presently Hart came back; I went after the prisoner and took him in less than three minutes, under the gallery of the Theatre, at the outer seat. I found three half crowns and 6 d. on him; Hart described a mark on one half crown before I produced it.</p>
               <p>HART. This is the half crown.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Martin's. I was coming off duty at the House of Commons, and saw the prisoner run by my door about seven o'clock with the trunk before him; he came down Coventry-court - the prosecutor's house is at the corner of the court. I thought by his manner, that he had stolen it, and so I went after him - he dropped it, and ran away. I pursued, took him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have taken this trunk, where did you get it from?" He said he had been to the coffee-shop in the court. I found it belonged to Mr. James.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in company with Smith, and followed the prisoners - it was about three hundred yards from Patterson's. I followed them down Howland-street, they turned down John-street, I got close to them, and laid hold of one with each hand - Ewing then had the cock under his jacket - he dropped it, and said he would never do so any more. I gave the cock to Smith. Rushton said he was employed by the other to go with him to the Cock, in Brook-street, and that the cock was laid in the area, so that they could reach it, and he was to have part when it was sold. Rushton afterwards stated that Ewing had lived at the Cock a few days previous, and he had put it there. I took them both into custody.</p>

            . I keep a shop in Baldwin's-gardens, four doors from the prosecutor's; the last witness is my son. I told him to go and watch the prisoners, whom I saw loitering about the prosecutor's house; at first the two prisoners were about, and then a third joined them. I saw the one who has escaped come repeatedly to my shop, and look at my boots, then cross, and speak to the others. The man who has escaped took the fenders from Bishop's shop, I ran out, and saw him with them on his shoulder. I followed all three into Hole-in-the-Wall-passage, when the man gave them to Vaughan, after carrying them some way. After following them altogether some way, I took Jackson, and gave him into custody of a butcher, followed the other, but lost the man who took them, ran round, into Gray's Inn-lane, saw Vaughan, and took him. The man who took the fenders, said to Vaughan,</p>

On the 5th of April, between one and two o'clock in the day, I was going through Seven Dials; the prisoner, with four others, were tossing up with halfpence, a gentleman crossed the Seven Dials, his handkerchief just appeared hanging out of his pocket - I could hardly observe it; the prisoners and the others immediately jumped up from their halfpence and ran after him down <placeName id="t18210411-173-crimeloc1067">Queen-street</placeName>

I saw Kitchen take this handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, and put it into his breast - they all ran away one after the other. I then returned back, they observed me coming back after them. Kitchen ran into a coffee-shop and eating-house, with two others, while Barry, and another, stood at the door to watch me. I thought it unsafe to go into the coffee-shop. Just as I was going in, Kitchen ran out, Barry whistled and he ran into an iron shop. I took him with the handkerchief, and have had it ever since. I took Barry two or three days after, and have never found the gentleman.</p>

I saw Coulton with Kitchen in custody, and about one hundred and fifty or two hundred men after him. I I told him he was charged with stealing a fogle - he said it was through distress. I found 2 s. 11 d. on him - this was Thursday; on the Saturday following, I received Barry in charge.</p>
               <p>JAMES FOWLER. I am an officer. I went with Coulton to Seven Dials, into a coffee-shop, there was nearly twenty bad characters there. Coulton said that was one of the party who robbed the gentleman (it was Barry) I told him I wanted him for robbing a gentleman of his handkerchief, he said he knew no such person as Kitchen, and afterwards, as we came along, he said he did know Kitchen, but he did not know he would split.</p>

               <p>BARRY'S Defence. I never saw these boys till I came to Newgate.</p>

Bank notes, with the landlord and about 7 s.; I asked him to return them - the prisoner was present. The landlord gave me two 1 l. notes, two half-crowns, and two shillings in silver - the prisoner said Wilcock, have you got your money safe. I said Yes, I have got it in my hand, he instantly knocked it out of my hand, snatched it up and ran away with it - the landlord saw it and went after him with me to different public-houses, but could not find him. I did not see him for a month after, when I met him in Cannon-street, and asked his reason for doing it, as he knew I had a wife and family; he said he did not mean to run away with it, but he would make it up if I would take a trifle at the time, as he could get it. I said if he brought it all I did not mind making it up, he said he could not do it, but would meet me on the Saturday night following at the Osborne's Head, Princes-street. I went there at seven o'clock, the time appointed, and stopped till nine. He did not come - he was taken on the 5th of March. I could not find him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long had you known him - A. Twelve months - I knew where he lived, and that he worked at Romford - there was two or three girls in company, but not with me. I paid for part of what they had - I was perfectly sober. I received 10 s. from the landlord when I gave him the notes - the reckoning was 13 s. I took none of the girls out, I went to the prisoner's lodging next day, and saw his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell her you had been in bad company and lost your money. and if her husband did not make it up you would prosecute him - A. I did not. He proposed something about subscribing to make up my loss. I took an officer to find him, but did not go to Romford.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you go to the public-house - A. Between three and four o'clock; this happened about seven o'clock - I paid the landlord 3 s.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Compasses, public-house, the prosecutor came to my house and called for some beer, he had only 3 l. and no change; he gave me the notes about seven o'clock, which was the time he came into my house, and asked me for them about eight o'clock. I gave him two notes, with two half crowns and 2 s. wrapped in them; the prisoner was in the tap-room, I do not know whether he saw it - I gave him the notes just before the bar. I saw him and the prosecutor bustling together, and immediately went and told them to be quiet. I then went into the bar; there was a dispute among them about seeing whether he had the notes, the prisoner said, let us see whether you have got the notes; the prosecutor put his hand in his pocket, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here they are," producing a bit of paper; the prisoner tore it in pieces, and said, that is not a note; the prosecutor then produced them from his pocket, he knocked them out of his hand on the floor, picked them up and ran away with them. We went after him to several houses, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many girls were there there - A. My brother's wife and another married woman - there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110085"/>were no girls of the town; he was quite sober - he came about seven o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>

I asked, what he had there, he said, some chaff, that he bought it at Bow; he would not tell me who he bought it off. I told him to put it down, he did so, and said it was meal. I said that he had stolen it, he said he had; he would not tell me who his master was - I found Mr. Austin out.</p>

            . I am drayman to the prosecutors. On the 1st of March, I took out the beer from the brew-house, Mile-end, and came by Whitechapel church, about ten o'clock in the morning, and put four empty casks down by the church, intending to call for them as I returned. I put them under the rails of the church, in the open street. I returned between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and they were gone. I informed the street-keeper, he said he saw them safe just before. On going home, I told my master, and went that night to look after them, and next morning, about ten o'clock, I went to the prisoner's; he is a cooper, and lives in Wentworth-street, and saw the casks under the shed of his cooperage; I saw them through a hole in the door - he saw me looking through the hole, came out and asked what I wanted there, I said,</p>
               <p>"You have got my master's casks;" he said</p>
               <p>"Hush, hush, let us make it up;" he offered to return them to me - he agreed to leave them at the cobler's in Montague-street. I went home and told my master I had found them - we went to him; he said he bought them of a drayman of Messrs. Cummings, for 14 s. I got an officer, went to the premises, and found three nine-gallon casks and a kilderkin; the kilderkin was on the premises, and the other three at the cobler's - they were those I lost; about two gallons of beer had been left in the kilderkin, and that was in it when I found it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How far is the church from your master's - A. About half a mile - we were in the habit of leaving them there when the horse was overloaded.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner said he saw them laying in the road, and took them home for security - A. No, he lives a mile from my master's. I had a glass of gin with him. I did not propose to send them to the cobler's, I promised to fetch them from there with the dray, as I was afraid he would make away with them. He did not offer to shew them to me. I called out for an officer, he said</p>
               <p>"Hush, Hush, don't make a noise," I do not know why all four were not sent to the coblers.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Was anything done to the cask which was left in his premises - A. Yes, it was all over dirt, and my master's name was defaced - I had examined it in the morning, the mark was chipped off with an adze, the wood was quite fresh chipped - the name Blake and Co. still remained visible.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2d of March, I went with Butlin, with a search-warrant to search the prisoner's house, and found a kilderkin which Butlin identified. I asked the prisoner where he got them, he said, a man dressed as a brewer's servant, left them with him, but he had not bought them; he said he bought some other casks of a man named Dunn. He said he took three of the casks to a shoemaker's shop in Old Montague-street - I took him to the office. As we went along,; I had hold of him by the cuff of his coat, he said,</p>
               <p>"Don't lead me like a dog, I'll go quiet;" I let him walk by my side, and at the corner of Red Lion-street, he ran off - I pursued, called Stop thief! and secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever know a man carry one eighteen and three nine-gallon casks on his back at one time - A. I should think he might, if they were lashed together.</p>

            , the priest. I saw his first wife here about an hour ago - I have been in London two years. When I first saw her in town, she was going up with the Queen's address, one day. I saw them together several times, she lived in Grub-street - the prisoner lived near her I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the marriage ceremony performed - A. I saw them go into the priest's house, and saw them on their knees, and the clergyman in his robes, saying some words. I waited till it was all over, and saw them come away - I saw them married; the prisoner is the man and Smith is the woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What are you - I keep a green-stall in Fuller's-rents - I live in Spread Eagle-court, Gray's Inn-lane. My father farmed some land in Ireland, and lived at Castle Harland. There is a church and chapel there - I am a Catholic. Smith lived about a mile from the priest's, and the prisoner two miles from him - the marriage was about seven or eight o'clock in the evening. I lived near Riley's and knew them both as neighbours. I went in and saw the marriage, the same as another - it was not private, the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you get for coming here - A. Nothing. I saw them married by the laws of God and man, and that is all I know. Mrs. Elliott told me to come here, she never lived with me, nor in the same house. She told me he was living with another woman. Riley, the priest, lived in the town of Crushyfahan (he is dead) the wedding was at the prisoner's father's, about a mile from the priest's. The priest had a robe on, the same as they generally wear - there was a cross on it - about twenty people were present. I believe Smith's father is dead - they do not have marriage lines in Ireland, that I know of. They signed all their names in a book, and the priest wrote his - the service was in English. I saw them lawfully married, according to the laws of God and man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to say that - A. Nobody. I was under no criminal charge before I left Ireland - I was never charged with forgery.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Is there the least reason for saying you were ever charged with any crime - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the marriage being in the afternoon - A. Eating and drinking - they went from the priest's to Smith's father's, and there kept the wedding.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said they were married at the priest's, and then at her father's house - A. They were married at the priest's - they went from the father's to be married.</p>
               <p>(Here the witness, by desire of MR. ANDREWS, was re-sworn, with the book open, and stated all he had before said was true.)</p>

            . I sell herrings and oranges in the country - I saw the prisoner come into the Chaise and Horses, public-house, at Hammersmith, on a Sunday evening, about five or six weeks ago - I never saw him before - I think it was between eleven and twelve o'clock at night. He forced his conversation, and asked where I was going - I said to Windsor - I was travelling with a horse and cart. He asked me if I would earn five shillings, to take this lead to London - he asked the landlord if I could have a bed, and said he would call me at four o'clock in the morning. I had a bed, and the landlord called me at six o'clock. I came down, the prisoner came there, he took me up a lane to a dunghill - he turned some dung off the lead, and told me to fetch the cart. I did so, and brought it to the dunghill - he put the lead in, and I drove off, he said he would follow me. I was to go to Hyde Park Corner, and wait there till he came up to me.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110087"/>He followed the cart, and at Kensington two officers stopped me - one laid hold of the horse, the other told me to get out - I did not see the prisoner then - I saw him following when I started, and missed him as soon as I got out of Hammersmith. The officer took me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where do you live - A. At No. 16, Old Bethlam, Bishopsgate-street, with my mother who is in the bottle trade - she never buys lead, but deals in bottles and rags. I have travelled with oranges about four years, and go through Hammersmith every Tuesday to Brentford market. I stopped at the Chaise and Horses about two months before this - I never slept there before; the lead was in two bags, which were not mine - I did not know the lead was stolen, I was going to Windsor to meet a person who was coming from the country. We left town about nine o'clock at night - I never was in trouble about any thing before.</p>

            . I keep the Chaise and Horses, at Hammersmith - On Sunday morning, the 12th of March, Close came to my house, about one o'clock. When Smith came in, they shook hands together - Smith asked where he was going, and how trade was with oranges. and asked what time he wanted to get to Windsor; he said seven o'clock would be time enough - then Smith told him he was foolish to go on, as he might go to bed, and get up time enough - they agreed for me to take his horses, and for him to go to bed, which he did, and Smith went home - he appointed to come and call Close at four o'clock, but did not come till six o'clock, and sent me to call him - he got up directly; they had a pint of purl - Smith went away first; Close had his horse put in, and he went away. Instead of going to Windsor, they turned towards London, and turned up Bodmen-lane, which was to the left. I immediately sent for an officer, having heard lead was stolen the night before - I know there is a dunghill at the bottom of that lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know Close before - A. I do not know that I ever saw him - he came to my house about one o'clock in the morning, and Smith came five minutes after - they shook hands, like two friends - the prisoner is a labourer, and lived not far off. They did not go out together first. When the cart came out of the lane, Smith came round the other way, and asked if Close was gone - there are footpaths leading from the lane round that way - he did not mention Close's name, he said</p>
               <p>"Is he gone?" - I gave him an answer, and he went away directly.</p>
               <p>COURT Q. Which way did he go - A. He turned towards London. Mine is a night-house - the prisoner's house is half a mile from mine; it is nearer to Smith's house than mine - Smith did not stay above half an hour at night - Close never left my house from the time he came in, till he went away with his cart in the morning.</p>

We overtook the cart just by the iron gates, by the halfway house, about half or three-quarters of a mile from where we saw Smith.

I wished him good-bye, and did not see him any more. Between eleven and twelve o'clock, the officer came and took me out of bed - he took me because he had seen me at the house.</p>

On the 13th of April, about ten minutes before nine o'clock at night, I was about six doors from this house, and saw Lacey go into the garden and go down the area. I had seen the prisoners before, walking up and down, in company with another man and woman. I then saw Jones go in, and in a short time saw him come out with a bundle, and directly after Lacey came out with another bundle. I saw Mr. Cheslin, my master, coming, and I told him. Brown took Jones alongside his bundle. Lacey threw down his bundle and ran away. I and Hunter pursued him to the corner of River terrace, and took him without losing sight of him. His bundle remained where he threw it. Both bundles were taken to the watch-house.</p>

He was taken in my sight, - the bundles were taken to the watch-house. I did not see Jones till he was at the watch-house.</p>

I was up stairs a few minutes; they said they would not have the money till I had tried the potatoes to see if they were good; but when they emptied them, they wanted their money directly: I paid them 18 d. short. After they were gone I missed the spoons, and found them afterwards at the office. The boy asked for the money, the prisoner did not speak; he heard what was said.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ATTFIELD. I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody on the day mentioned in the indictment. was coming from Walthamstow, and received information of some men who were selling potatoes about Hackney being suspected of a robbery. I met the two; I took the other, and left him in care of a gardener while I run after the prisoner. I caught him, and found the spoons wrapped in paper in his pocket.</p>

On the 23d of March I had a message from his lordship, who lodged in Duke-street, St. James's, desiring me to deliver a hamper to the prisoner Dogherty, whom his lordship permitted to live in the house in Berkeley-square out of humanity. These things were taken from the house in Berkeley-square. My wife gave me information, and I missed a bed, a bolster, and two blankets: they were taken while I went with a message to his lordship. I had left Dogherty and my wife in the house. The things were in the room where he slept. I had seen them some time before; he was out when I missed them. He returned in about an hour. I asked him what he had done with the bed and blankets? he said he had sold them; fell on his knees, and begged I would not inform his lordship of the transaction. He was in liquor; it was between one and two o'clock in the day time. He told us where he sold them. I found them at Marlborough-street. I suspected Mackin, as I had seen him three or four times at the house; he came to see Dogherty. Somebody gave me information. I went and found another bed had been taken out backwards; he owned to taking that, fell on his knees again, and begged for mercy.</p>

I ran up and saw Dogherty standing there, and asked him about it. He said he had hid the bed. He took me up into a room where there was some hair, and under the hair was the bed. I suspected Mackin, and saw him about six o'clock, and took him. His lordship came soon after. I heard Mackin tell Dogherty he should not have taken the things away by day-time, but by night.</p>

On Sunday evening the 15th of April, about half past seven o'clock, the watchman came and enquired if I had moved any sashes from my new house; I went round with him to the house, and at the beginning of the street I looked up to the house, and saw the prisoner Newland in the act of taking a sash out of the first floor window of my house; on looking at the other window of the room, I saw Stevenson taking the sash out of that window - I saw them actually doing it; the watchman said,</p>
               <p>"They are now in the house." He ran round to the back of the house - nobody lives in it - it is just finished: I unlocked the door; the watchman said I had better wait outside. I ran out and saw Stevenson attempt to jump out of the window; the watchman went up and took them both in custody in the room. I examined the back door, and found a bolt wrenched off: I had seen the windows safe in the morning. We found a chisel and a bag there.</p>

            . I am a sawyer, and live in Mr. Barker's house to take care of it; he does not reside there. On the 16th of April, about a quarter past nine, my wife awoke me and said she heard a noise in the house: I jumped up and threw up the window, and saw two men in the act of rolling a piece of lead off the water closet. I did not know either of them: the one on my right hand had a blue coat on, and the other had a light fustian jacket. I called out stop thief, they ran and I pursued them; they jumped over the foundation, and I saw Sack taken by a gentleman as he got over the wall; he was one of them. The other in the light jacket got over the other corner and took a different course: in jumping over, I heard and saw him jump into the water. I described Smith to the constable, and in eleven hours found him in custody. I found six pieces of lead moved under a wall rolled up, and the roll that they threw off the water closet; most all of it was taken off the water closet; there was about one hundred weight and a half. I have since fitted it, and it tallies. I believe Smith to be the other man, but cannot swear to him. I saw Sack taken, he had a blue frock on.</p>

On the afternoon of the robbery, I saw three of them in company together; the prisoners were two of them. I saw them by Clerkenwell church, in the neighbourhood of the prosecutor's house. I afterwards, from the description Court gave me, took Smith at eleven o'clock at night in bed; he was going to his chest to take a pair of stockings out; I told him to put on the same that he wore in the day. I took them up and they were wet nearly as high as the calf of the legs. He put on a velveteen jacket; I had seen him in the day time with a white jean jacket, and saw that jacket in the bed he was laying on; his shoes were also wet. I compared them with the marks in the mud in the field where they jumped over; they fitted all the way along from garden to garden.</p>

            . I work at putting down gas pipes, and have slept with Smith every night for two years; he did not have the shoes on which the officer took away: I was in bed when they came. The white jacket on the bed was mine; the shoes belonged to the prisoner, and he did not wear them that day, and I am quite sure they were quite clean, dry, and oiled; he wore them on Sunday, and I never saw them on his feet after - I am perfectly sure they were quite clean, dry, and oiled. We went to bed about 10 o'clock, and the officer came in about twenty minutes: I was asleep when they came in; the officers asked for me, they did not ask for Smith; they took his strong shoes first, and the others next morning.</p>

Nobody was near enough to do it but her. I took her to the watch-house, and gave her in charge, stating what money I had lost. She denied having it, and said she had no money.

She said she had none whatever about her. I searched her, and in her right-hand pocket I found a half crown piece, 2 s. and a 6 d., and down her bosom I found 3 s. and two sixpences.

I went over the way to see if they had any thing; they retreated when I went towards them. I got over the pailing after them, and the shovel and spade were thrown down by one of them, all four ran away. I overtook the prisoner, and asked how he came by them? he said, he had not stolen them, but the boys had, and he was going with them to White-cross-street to sell them. Doe's name was on them.</p>

On arriving there I got out of the gig and rang the bell; it was about half past six o'clock in the evening. When I returned from ringing the bell, I saw the wheel of a cart locked into the wheel of the buggy. It is a wide road. I had drawn up as close as possible to the foot way. There was room for four carriages to pass without touching us. There were at least six persons in the cart; it was full of men and one boy. Master's box coat was in the buggy over his knees; we had the head up, it being a wet night. I saw the prisoner in possession of the coat about ten minutes after I rang the bell. We were expostulating with them for coming in contact with the gig, and begging them to unlock the wheels. Master ordered me to pursue the prisoner; I overtook him about a hundred and twenty yards from the gig, and saw the coat on his arm; he dropped it, and put himself in a fighting posture. I drew back, and stooped to pick up the coat, and he gave me a very severe blow between the two eyes; my hat fell off. The blow knocked me down. Several of the party who had been in the cart were behind, and I received some kicks from them as I lay in the road. The prisoner picked up a silk handkerchief which flew out of my hat, and ran away with it; he came back in about a quarter of an hour, to enquire what was the matter, and was secured.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110095"/>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. - Q. This was about seven o'clock? - A. Yes; I could identify any man's face at the time. The coat was thrown across the road first, and put back in the gig by a gentleman's servant, and put in the gig while I held the horse. There might be thirty people about or more. I heard there had been a bull bait in the neighbourhood. The people in the cart came round and said, I hope you are not hurt; and they felt about my breeches and almost pulled my watch out. I got some severe blows; my nose is all on one side now with it.</p>

On Tuesday evening at 6 o'clock I was in Clarendon-place, and saw the cart locked in the wheel of Mr. Broughton's gig, and saw the prisoner going off with the box coat. I followed him with Reynolds as quick as possible, overtook him, and he dropped it. Reynolds being nearest received a blow as we were both stooping to pick it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. There was great confusion? - A. Four persons were running; I believe all four came out of the cart. I picked up the coat. One of the people in the cart took it, and it was returned. I don't know who took it the second time.</p>

            . I am a hat-maker, and work next door to the house. On the 3d of April, about half past nine at night, I was alarmed by a noise in the next house; I gave the alarm to the person who had the letting of the house. I went into the house, and opened the door myself with the key, and in the top room I found the prisoner alone; I gave him to the watchman.

About 3 o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner came and produced an apron to pawn for 1 s. I refused to take it, as it was not worth that; she left, and in ten minutes I missed the petticoat, and in about a quarter of an hour I was fetched to Mr. Hulme's, the pawnbroker in Museum-street, and found the prisoner there in custody, and 5 yards of printed cotton on the counter; it had the sale ticket on it in my writing, that would not be seen till it was unfolded; it was mine. I then asked what she had got in her apron, she said what was that to me. I opened it, and there was the petticoat; my shop ticket belonging to that was on the floor torn in pieces close to her feet; she was secured. My apprentice had been serving in the shop; he could give me no information about it; he stood about the middle of the shop while the prisoner was there. I was the first person that spoke to her - she was two or three minutes in the shop, and had no conversation with the apprentice; he was ticketing goods. When I gave her her answer I believe I went out to the parlour. The cotton cost me 5 s. and the petticoat 4 s.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Hulme, pawnbroker, No. 53, Museum-street, Bloomsbury. On the 14th of April, the prisoner and another woman came into the shop about 3 o'clock, and offered an apron in pawn for 1 s. the prisoner presented it, I advanced 9 d. on it: they went away, and in a few minutes the prisoner returned alone, and took out of her apron a petticoat, which she put on the counter, and then seeing the shop ticket on it, drew it back; I saw her fumbling down with it, which gave me suspicion. She immediately took the cotton out of her apron and offered that; when she put it on the counter, she saw the ticket on that Mr. Hulme laid hold of it, and she pulled to get it from him, he got it from her and kept it. We examined the ticket and saw it was Brooks's, and sent to him: he claimed it and the petticoat. I have had it ever since.</p>
