I am one of the detective officers of the City police—on 9th August, about twenty minutes to two, I was in company with Legg, another officer, in plain clothes, in Bow Lane, and noticed the prisoner with this parcel on his shoulder—I stopped him and said, "Halloo, Ryan, I need not tell you who I am; what have you here?"—he said, "All right, Mr. Smith, I have some paper; you know I am in the paper-hanging trade"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "From home"—I said, "Where is the receipt?"—he said, "I dare say you will</p>

               <p>find it on the file at home"—I said, "Where are going to take it to?"—he said, "I am going by the boat to Woolwich"—I said, "Don't have a laugh at me if I let you go this time," or words to that effect; "I will give you the benefit of the doubt"—we allowed him to pass, but watched him—he did not go in the direction of the pier from which the boats start, he went in the direction of Cheapside—we followed and stopped him a second time—I said, "This is not the way to Woolwich: where are you going to?"—he said, "To Woolwich"—I said, "What is the man's name?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "What is the name of the street?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "Then where are you going to?"—he said, "I am going home"—I said, "We shall take you to the station, as this is not satisfactory"—we took him to the station and charged him with the unlawful possession of the paper—Legg searched him in my presence, and found in his pocket this piece of paper, of the same pattern as the thirty pieces—we went to search the prisoner's house, it is a leaving shop in Golden Lane—articles of wearing apparel were hanging about, but no paper-hangings, or any receipts relating to any—we traced the paper-hangings to the prosecutor, and their managing man identified them—I know a man named Hooper, and have tried to apprehend him, but he has absconded.</p>

Potter's, I know Hooper—I have frequently seen him and the prisoner drinking together during the last two or three months—I have seen the little girl at those times while the prisoner has been round the corner, and he has been at the warehouse making signs for Hooper to come out—on 9th August I saw the prisoner outside the Skinners' Arms at the corner of Bow Lane, and the girl with him—I went in to the Skinners' Arms at one o'clock to have my dinner, and was there till about twenty minutes to two—the prisoner and Hooper were in the other compartment drinking together—I did not see them leave, but when I came out I saw the officers and the prisoner going down the lane towards the station with the parcel—after the prisoner had gone to the station the little girl came down crying, she went into Mr. Potter's and fetched Hooper out; Hooper stood at the corner of Aldermary Churchyard, the child went towards the police-station—Hooper waited till the officers came out of the station, and then he and the child went away; they were gone about an hour—they came back about three o'clock—Hooper strolled about and at last went into the warehouse, and I saw no more of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer, of 31, Lower Rosoman Street, Clerkenwell—on 23rd August the prisoner and a woman named Stanley came to the front of my shop—I served Stanley with a pound of apples, she gave me a bad sixpence—I bit it, and said, "This is bad, we have been taking a great deal of this money lately, I must know more about it"—Stanley said, "I know where I took it from, we were going to the workhouse to see our mother"—she asked for it back—I said, "No"—Taylor said, "I will pay for the apples," gave me a penny, and made off—I sent Tait after her and detained Stanley—my man came back soon, and almost immediately a young man from the pawnbroker's brought a blue bag, which he said that Taylor, who had a child with her, had left in his shop—I gave them in custody with the sixpence and the bag, which was opened and turned out into a scale—they both tried to get hold of it—I did not see what coin it was, as each was screwed up in tissue paper—they were not undone till the prisoner came.</p>

I am in Mr. Bowdon's employment—he called me on 23rd August, and I saw a mob round the door—Stanley was there, and I went and overtook Taylor, who was going fast in the direction of the workhouse, but she turned to the right—I did not lose sight of her, she went into a pawnbroker's shop in Exmouth Street, Mr. Sill's—I followed her in, and saw her hiding in a dark corner—I called her out, and said, "My master wants you"—she said, "What for? I am going to see my mother at the workhouse, and if I am not there soon I shall be too late"—I took her back; the pawnbroker's assistant came to my master's shop, and said in her presence, "Look what this woman has left," holding a blue bag in his hand—the constable turned it out into the scale, and there was a lot of money in it—Stanley <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> at it, and said, "You shall not have them all, you b----s." <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN GURR</hi>. I am assistant to Sill and Moore's, pawnbrokers, of Exmouth Street—I was there when the woman came in, and saw her put her hand under a petticoat which was on the counter—somebody said, "I want you"—I turned over the petticoat, and saw a little blue bag rolled up—I asked if it belonged to anybody, the officer turned it out, and it was counterfeit coin—I also found two sixpences wrapped in a piece of rag where she had been standing—I handed them to the officer.</p>

I am eleven years old, and live with my parents in Rochdale Rpw—I have known the prisoner three years—on 16th August I was with a boy named Croxon in Sutherland Terrace between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock, going towards Ebury Bridge, and saw the pri<lb/>soner run from Sutherland Street into Sutherland Terrace with his coat and waistcoat off—he had not got his barrow—he put his hand in his pocket and put something down a grating opposite Mr. Pearce's coffee shop—it was like silver, like a half-crown with some sand on it—I heard it drop on the sink from his hand—it jingled like silver—he then ran back the way he came—I was about six yards from the grating—I went to it, and tried to fish up what he had dropped, but could not reach—Mr. Pearce got a pair of tongs and pulled up two half-crowns and two florins—I saw some silver sand about, such as fish-dealers carry with them—I went and looked for the prisoner—Mr. Pearce came round the corner, and when he saw him he ran away from me towards Clarendon Street—I saw no one pass the grating between the time he dropped it and the time we picked it up—there was only one man in the street, standing near the public-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How often were you before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twice—I stated the first time that I saw something like silver down the grating—the investigation did not take place on the day the money was passed—I am quite sure I told the Magistrate right—Mr. Smith cross-examined me—the prisoner was remanded—on the second occasion I said, "I told the Magistrate on the first examination that I did not see what was put down the sink hole"—I did say on the first examination that I saw something the size of a florin drop from his hand, and on the second ex<lb/>amination I said the same—I saw something white—I told the Magistrate I did not think it was money—it looked like silver—I never saw fish scales as large as a half-crown.</p>

I keep a coffee-house at 2, Sutherland Terrace—on 16th August the two boys came to my shop, and in consequence of what they said I went to a grating in front of my house, looked down, and saw part of a florin or half-crown—it was partly covered with sand—I got a pair of tongs and fished up two bad half-crowns and two florins with silver sand on them—I gave them to Spurgeon.</p>

I am a picture-frame dealer, of 12, Gutter Lane, Cheap<lb/>side—up to 20th July I was with Mr. Nottage, of the London Stereo<lb/>scopic Company—I managed the frame department and the wholesale de<lb/>partment as well—I have known the prisoner four or five years—he is a frame-maker—he occasionally supplied the company with goods; when he brought them there was an invoice, which I examined and put my initials to—he could then take it to the cashier and get the cash—the cashier would not pay it without my initials—it was generally the custom to pay him when he delivered the goods—on 5th July the prisoner and I and a gentleman named Way went and dined together at the Bay Tree, in St. Swithin's Lane—as soon as the prisoner had finished his dinner he said, "You must excuse my going; I must go and get some money, and will come back and pay your account"—he said that to me—he owed the company 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then went out—I paid for his dinner—I afterwards returned to the company's place in Cheapside—I went up stairs—when we sell goods up stairs we have a little check-book in which we make entries—I went down stairs about twenty minutes after I had left the prisoner to enter 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and on the fly-leaf I saw a memorandum, "Cohen paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I spoke to the cashier about it, and demanded to see the invoice—the cashier showed me this invoice for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there are the initials <hi rend="largeCaps">H. R</hi>. to it—they are not my writing—I gave no authority to write them—it is ft very good imitation indeed—none of the goods specified in that invoice had been supplied to the company—in consequence of seeing that docu<lb/>ment I made a search into the books for a few days back, and found that an invoice had been presented on the Wednesday before, while I was out of town—this is it, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is dated 3rd July—my initials are on the top line of that invoice—that is my writing—the one below is a forgery—I gave no authority for those initials to be put—the goods men<lb/>tioned in that top line have been supplied to the company—there are two</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230015"/>
               <p>other items: those have not been supplied—I was never more surprised in my life than when I found this invoice—about a week before we were at the Bay Tree the prisoner asked me to be security for a loan of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that he was going to pay the company part of it—he then owed the company 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or I think a little more, at that time—he said part of the loan was to pay the company—I don't know what he was going to do with the remainder—he said he was going to send his wife to Germany—I was in the Dolphin, Milk Street, on 5th July, after I had discovered this—about ten minutes to eight I saw the prisoner—he asked what I was going to take—I said I must run over and see Mr. Nottage, instead of doing so I went to Bow Lane Police Station, and brought a man up and gave him in charge—I tapped the prisoner on the shoulder and said, "Mr. Cohen, I have got a very painful duty to perform, but I must do it; you have brought or you have taken an invoice into Cheapside, forged my initials to it, and got the money;" and I think I said, "There is a policeman before you"—he said, "Oh! yes, I know; but you are not going to look me up; if so, I shall commit suicide"—he put his hands to his head and began to cry—he was charged at the Mansion House on the following morning; while there he said to me that if I pressed the charge he would deny it, that I might have looked over it if I liked, and he would ruin me if possible.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in the service of Mr. Nottage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between six and seven years—the prisoner was employed there some time after, perhaps three years, or it might have been two years—we were upon yery friendly terms—we were often in the habit of dining together, he used to come to my private house to visit me; we were on very friendly terms indeed—I am not in Mr. Nottage's employ<lb/>ment now—I left to go into business on the 20th of the same month—I can't remember the date of the last examination before the Magistrate—I left Mr. Nottage on the 20th—I left of ray own accord—Mr. Nottage is, I believe, in Paris—I was certainly not discharged by Mr. Nottage—I had been looking after premises, and was going into business for myself—I did not give him notice, I left without giving any notice; the reason I left was I had been out an hour or so, and Mr. Nottage was rather cross, and I told him he was not satisfied—he said he would suspend me for a short time, and I told him I would leave at once—he certainly did not discharge me there and then—he had before told me that complaints had been made to him about me; he did not do so on that day; he complained of my being out—I forget what he said—it was perhaps a fortnight before that he had complained of me; I can't recollect what it was he said; I swear that—he was a little cross about something, I can't say what it was; I don't think he made a complaint since—I left on the 20th in consequence of his being cross—one of my fellow clerks is here, who was in the counting-house and heard all that took place, Mr. Clark—I am now in business for myself—I can't say how long Mr. Nottage has been abroad—the body of this invoice is in the prisoner's writing—I do not know what motive he had for paying the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of this 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did pay it; the company was pressing him for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it was my duty to do it—I did press him for it—it was for frames that had been supplied to him by the company—it had been due some months, and it was my duty to press for it—they were supplied on 11th June—I am referring to the day-book; that is in the handwriting of Mr. Heal, the clerk that was up on the first floor with me; he is here—the other invoice, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., is dated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230018"/>
               <p>July 3rd—there are two items in that which the company neverhad from him, a dozen Oxfords at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and three maple frames—he never de<lb/>livered those to the company—we never had them; I swear that—I never sent any body for them, I swear that—I did not on 2nd July go to the prisoner's house in a cab and take away those frames that are charged for in this invoice—I do not know Julia Jameson, Mrs. Nightingale, or Joseph Jameson. (<hi rend="italic">They were here called in.</hi>) I know that man by sight, I may have seen Julia Jameson before, but I could not swear it; I do not know Mrs. Nightingale—I know the prisoner's brother—the prisoner lived at 34, Little Charlotte Street, Blackfriars—I had been to his house some time previously to 2nd July, I can't say exactly the date—I can't recollect whether I saw the prisoner's brother on 1st July—I did not on that day give him an order for one dozen Oxford frames and for three Maple ditto—I did not direct them to be finished by dinner-time on the next day—I did not on the next day go in a cab and in the presence of the prisoner's brother and the three persons just called in, take away the Oxford frames and the three Maples, nor did any body for me by my orders—they were not brought to Cheapside—nobody fetched them froa the prisoner's house by my direction, I swear that—no accident happened in the removal, one of the frames was not broken—I have sent to his house for things a great many times; I have sent perhaps a dozen people at different times—I can't tell when I bad sent before 2nd July—I have gone myself lots of times—I can't recollect how soon before 2nd July I had been—I directed the prisoner to take a frame for a picture to my house; it was for myself—it was charged to the company, and I paid for it about a week after—that was six or seven months ago—it was for a picture of Christ walking on the sea—he took the frame and picture to my house—it was entered in the books of the company when I paid the cash, which was in about a week—it was entered in one of the, very old books, it may be six or eight months ago, I may possibly be able to find it—I did not tell any body in the establishment that he was going to take it to my house—I said what the cash was for when I paid it—I don't know that I had told any body in the establishment that the frame was to be charged to the company—I never used to tell them where the frames were going—I told the prisoner to charge it to the company—I believe it was paid for in the ordinary way, by sending in a bill which was initialed by me before the money was paid—I used to send out hundreds of frames, and no one knew anything about where they were going to—he may have delivered goods at other places for the company, but not for me—I was in authority over him—I directed him to take this frame to my place, and to charge it to the company—I never told him to takes things to other places and charge them to the company—I did not see the prisoner on 3rd July—I did not meet him about twelve o'clock that day and walk with him as far as the Peel statue in Cheapside—I did not see his brother David and his brother-in-law Jameson, and another person with him—I did not tell them that I was going home to Brixion as my children had a holiday—he and I did not walk together down Lud<lb/>gate Hill and go into Lockey's public-house—the prisoner did not ask me what time I should return, as he wanted money of the company—I did not say, "Probably between four and five"—I had told every one that I was going for the day and should not be back—I had told the manager so—I was in town up to one o'clock—the prisoner did not ask me if I would pay him part of the money I owed him—I did not say, "No, but have you got your</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230019"/>
               <p>bill here?"—he did not produce the one for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not read it, and then borrow a pen from somebody at the bar and put my initials to it—I do not know Lockey's public-house by name—there are several public-houses in Farringdon Street opposite the station—I have not to my know<lb/>ledge been in any of them with the prisoner—I may have been, but not that day—I would not swear I may not have been at Lockey's with the prisoner, his brother and Jameson—very likely I may have been—I don't recollect it—I think it is very likely that the prisoner called on me in Cheapside on 4th July—he was there nearly every day—I did not tell him that if he did not pay a bill of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that he owed for goods supplied before Saturday, I should be discharged, as I had no authority to give him credit—I told him I wanted the money and must have it—I meant the, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that he was indebted to the company for some job frames that he had bought of the company—I might have owed him about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at that time, not more—I think if we were to balance up I should owe him about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we had been on very good terms—he had borrowed from me and I from him—I owed him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he owed me about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not say that unless I paid him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I owed him he could not pay in the time—I did not then say, "I must give you an order for some goods"—I did not receive a letter from him next day—I received one about a fortnight ago, which I have here—that is the only letter I have received—it is in the prisoner's writing, his wife brought it, a few, days after he was let out on bail—his brother did not on the 5th bring me a letter and this invoice for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor did I in the brother's presence put my initials to it—I never saw the invoice until it was produced by our cashier—I did not give back the invoice to the prisoner's brother and tell him that his brother must come himself for the money at one o'clock—he was there at one o'clock on the 5th—I saw him—he was not paid until after he returned from the Bay Tree, where he dined with me and Mr. Way, a pictnre-frame maker, of the Edgware Road—the prisoner used to come to the premises very often,'at all hours of the day—he did not show me this invoice when he came at one o'clock—I can't say at what time he was paid on the 5th—it was not paid before we went to dinner—these are very like my initials—it was at the Dolphin that I gave him into custody—I did not tell him there had been a row at the office, and the governor had found out that I had passed bills before the goods were delivered; nothing of the sort—I did not say, "I have been detained for two hours; you know I have a wife and three little children, and I cannot afford to lose my place, and bo I said I did not sign the bill which got paid to-day"—something was said about three little children, but they were his children that I offered to take care of—I have three children—I told him that Mr. Nottage had told me to lock him up—I was the one to find the matter out and put it before Mr. Nottage at once, about an hour after I, returned from dinner—I told him they were not my Initials, and upon that he de sired me to give the prisoner into custody—there is a witness here who was in the counting-house at the time—nothing had happened previously about these invoices to make them the topic of conversation by any of the clerks—this little book (<hi rend="italic">handing it in</hi>) will explain how I came to find this out—I have put my initials to invoices for goods before they were delivered, upon the understanding that they would be in, to accommodate the prisoner, and I have had them—I have done so on two Or three occasions—this, book is the cashier's, Mr. Morrell's writing—you will find the date, of the pay<lb/>ment of the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a few leaves forward—this is not all in the cashier's writing, perhaps a dozen persons—it was quite by accident that I saw this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on seeing it I asked to see the invoice—I was very much astonished—I said, "What! has Cohen paid?" and Morrell said, "Yes, I have taken it out of his account"—I have got the young man here who was sitting just behind Morrell when he gave me the invoice—I told Mr. Nottage of it as soon as he returned, the same day—I told him that the prisoner had received the money and put my initials, which he had no right to do—this 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not due to him at all, none of it—the goods had not been delivered—the three days' work had taken place, but it had been paid for previously; some time before—it might have been a fortnight before; I can't tell when—he generally had his money as soon as his work was done—I never paid him; the cashier, Morrell, did—he would not know whether the work was done or no, so long as the invoice was signed he would pay it—these "twelve Oxfords, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." had not been ordered, not by me—I did not say on this occasion, "Don't say a word about it; I will make it all right with the governor; you will be locked up to-night only, and as no one will appear against you you will be discharged"—I said I would make the case as light as possible for him, because it was not a very pleasant thing to lock up an intimate friend—I did not say, "You don't blame me, Cohen, do you?" nor did he reply, "To-morrow will show"—I don't remember anything of the sort—Heal has never signed my initials—I never authorised him to do so—I may have done so when I have been busy; I would not swear that I have not—I have never authorised the prisoner to do so—Heal was a confidential clerk up stairs, and the prisoner only an outdoor frame joiner—I know Mr. Watson, a frame-maker, he supplies the firm with frames—Heal was in the habit of writing orders to Watson for goods—I can't say whether he has signed my initials to those—I can't say—I know Mr. French, the landlord of the Coachmakers' Arms—I don't know Mr. Newton Wood by name—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Wood was here called in</hi>) I know him very well by sight—I remember French and Wood calling on me in Cheap<lb/>side after Cohen had been locked up—I did not say to them, "I was obliged to lock Cohen up to save myself from being locked up"—I received this letter from the prisoner after he was out on bail.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>they thought it was for selling indecent prints—that was what Mr. French said; the other young man had nothing to say—this interview took place in the frame department in Cheapside—it is false that I said I locked Cohen up to prevent being locked up myself, there is not one word of truth in it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a framemaker and carver, and live at 8, Ashley Crescent—I happened to be present at the Dolphin when Mr. Reed gave the prisoner into custody—he said to him, "Cohen, you have presented a bill over the way and signed my initials to it, for which I must have you taken"—Cohen said, "I know I have, but you won't have me taken up, will you, Harry?"—Mr. Reed said, "I must have you taken," and with that forthwith called a constable in, but before he called him in Cohen put up his hands and made some remark, and nearly fell backwards against the door.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known Reed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four or five years—I make Oxford frames and carved wood frames for the firm—he has been in the habit of signing my bills, that is putting his initials, and I have taken them down stairs to get paid—I have never sent any<lb/>thing to his house to my knowledge—a Mr. Glyn was present at the Dolphin on this occasion—he is a mount-maker—I do not know whether he is here—he was here yesterday morning—I was not examined before</p>

               <p>the Magistrate on the first occasion. I was not subpoenaed between the first and second examinations—I was asked if I knew anything at all about it—I think Mr. Reed asked me; I am not quite positive about that—I had some conversation with him—he asked if I knew anything about it, and I immediately told him all I knew, what I had seen at the Dolphin—he asked if I heard what was said, and I said, "Yes"—he did not positively ask me to go up, but, as the evidence was required, he certainly did ask me to go, and I did—those initials look very much like his, so much so that if I had not heard him say they were not his I should have said they were—I went across to the Dolphin with the prisoner and Mr. Glyn after receiving my money—I stated the same before the Magistrate that I have now.

                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live in Blackfriars—I heard of the prisoner being committed—I know Mr. Reed—I called on him with Mr. Newton Wood—after some conversation he said he was obliged to lock Cohen up, or he should be locked up himself—Mr. Wood was present.</p>

I have had to give him in charge; I was obliged to lock him up; if I had not I should have been locked up myself, so I did it to save myself"—he did not say why he should have been locked up himself—he said Cohen was locked up for a forgery, for signing his name on a bill—I did not ask him what he meant by being locked up himself; that was not my business; all I wanted was to ascertain where Cohen was—I went to Newgate to see Cohen once; that was about a week after that conversation—Mr. Wood was not with me—I did not make any inquiry of Mr. Nottage about this matter.</p>

Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years—I was in the habit of visiting him, and associating with him and French—I missed him for something like a week—I did not know what had become of him until I saw Mr. Reed—I live about four or five minutes' walk from Cohen—I was passing by one day and saw his brother at the door, and asked him how it was we had not seen him, and he said he did not know where he was; it was not good for him to be away—Mr. French and I did not start out on that day for the purpose of making inquiries about him—we went to see the Sultan come, and from there we went to the City to see the Belgian volunteers pass, and while outside, opposite the company's house, he saw Mr. Reed at the window, and we then thought we would go and see where Cohen was—we did not make an arrangement at Charing Cross to go into the City and make the inquiry—Mr. French said, "We will go and see if Mr. Reed knows any<lb/>thing about Cohen;" for we had heard he had gone to the Paris Exhibi<lb/>tion with Reed—I have not been in Court while French was examined—I came in for about two minutes, but was told to go out—I cannot say who spoke first—when we went up we shook hands with Reed—he was at the window, seeing the Belgian soldiers pass—we walked to the staircase together, and French said, "What has become of Cohen?"—Reed said, "You know very well what has become of him"—I said, "No, that we don't; we have come to see"—he said, "Well, he is in Newgate"—I said, "In Newgate? what for?"—he said, "For signing my signature to a bill, aud receiving the money from the cashier"—I said, "Indeed? that is a very serious affair; that is forgery"—he said, "Yes, it is; it went very hard against my feelings to do it, but I was bound to lock him up to save myself," or "to clear myself;" I won't swear which words he made use of—he also said, "As to Cohen's children, I would take them into my own family and see that they are cared for as my own, out of the respect I have for the man."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a die-sinker and engraver, of 4, Upper Smith Street, Northampton Square—on 17th June the prisoner came to my house, accompanied by a man named Zelman—I had never seen the prisoner before—I have known Zelmau for three or four years perhaps—I am not perfectly certain of the time; he introduced the prisoner to me—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230035"/>
               <p>I am referring to some notes which were made at the time, at least two or three days after the prisoner first visited me; they were made under the instructions of Inspector Foulger—Zelman said, "This is a friend of mine, who I think I can introduce to you to do some business"—I asked him what description of business it was—he said it was some engraving—I said, "It is perfectly uncertain whether I can do it or not without you explain yourself more fully and thoroughly"—he said it was to engrave a plate—I asked what for, and Zelman, I think, said, "Show him the note"—the prisoner then handed me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note of the Union Bank of Scotland—(I afterwards gave it back to the prisoner)—I said, "It is a very serious matter, a thing of this sort, not to be undertaken very lightly"—he said there was very little chance of detection in the affair, in fact none, and it was a very good chance of making a deal of money; he said I was to receive 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for engraving the plate in the first instance if I agreed to do it, and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when the plate was finished—he said the reason there was such a slight chance of detection was that there were only four persons in it; they were himself, Zelman, the banker from Australia for whom the notes were intended, and myself—I asked him how many notes he thought of printing if he procured the plate, and he said 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it would be impossible to find it out for twelve months, as the voyage to and from Australia would take that time before it could be detected—I told him I could give him no answer then, but I would see Zelman the next day if he would call at my place—Zelman introduced him by the name of Johnson; at least he was not exactly introduced by name, but it was mentioned incidentally during the evening that his name was Johnson—Zelman called him <hi rend="italic">Charlie</hi> at the time—next day, Tuesday, the 18th, I saw Zelman, but not the prisoner—on the 19th Zelman came to my house and told me I was to meet the prisoner in the City Road, near the Eagle—he went with me and we met the prisoner—he asked me if I would engrave the plates—I said, "Yes"—he asked how long it would take to do them—I said about six weeks, I thought—he said that was too long, I must do it in less time—I said I did not think I possibly could—he asked me if I could get the paper for the notes when the plate was en<lb/>graved—I said I was not quite certain, and he gave me then the size of the sheet required for a double note—they are printed in twos, of which he seemed to be aware—he asked me if I should want some money before I started on the plates—I said yes, and he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold; at the same time he gave me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Scotch note for the purpose of engraving the plate, as a pattern to work to—(that note was afterwards changed by the engraver at a money-changer's at the West End for another more legible)—he asked me if I could do the printing myself, or how it would be best to arrange about the printing—I said it would be dangerous, of course, to employ an ordinary printer in a thing of this sort—he said, "Well, then, we must try and do it ourselves"—I said I could give him no decided answer then whether or no I could do it; that would be an after consideration—I gave Zelman half of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—next day, Thursday, the 20th, I met Zelman at half-past nine in the morning, and we went to the Moor Lane Police Station—I inquired for Inspector Foulger, and was referred to Bow Lane—I went there and saw him, and he gave me directions how to act in this matter—since that time, until the prisoner was apprehended, I have acted entirely under his directions—during that period I saw him nearly every day, and also Mr. Mullens, the solicitor engaged in this case—after leaving the inspector I went to Hughes and Kiraber's, copper plate and printing</p>

               <p>material manufacturers, in Fetter Lane—Zelman was with me, but I forget whether he went into the place or not—I there bought a copper plate, the size of the note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I saw the prisoner afterwards that same day in the neighbourhood of the City Road, close by the Eagle—I showed him the plate and arranged to meet him again on the 22nd—I did not do so—it was afterwards arrauged that I should give Zelnun notice when I wanted to see him—I next saw him on the 24th with Zelman, at my bouse—I showed him the plate, which then had a portion of this ornamental scroll engraved on it—he showed me a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Scotch note on that occasion—he thought the signature of the cashier of the bank was more distinct and easier to copy than that on the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, it being very dirty and rather obliterated—I have not got that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—it was impossible to have copied that, as it was a different size from the one on the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I asked him for some money and he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards gave Zel<lb/>man 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it—I saw the prisoner on Tuesday, 25th June, and on Saturday, the 29th—on 3rd July I saw him again, I then had the plate with me; Zelman was with him—I showed him the plate—it was further advanced not completed—he asked me if it was necessary to have a press for taking the proofs off, and afterwards, of course, for the printing, and I said, "Yes, as soon as possible"—he said he would put an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Clerkenwell News</hi> for one—he asked me if I could get the paper, and I said most likely I could get it at Birmingham—afterwards, on that same day, I went again to Hughes and Kimber's for another plate to engrave the front of the note—this is the plate I bought (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>),—on 4th July I saw the prisoner again—I showed him this plate and the other as well, and he found some fault with the scroll ornament—it was not quite correct, not perfectly agreeing with the pattern note—on 5th July I saw him again in the evening, and he said I was to go to Birmingham the next day, Satur<lb/>day, and he said I was to write to Zelraan's address, 57, Herbert Street, if I wanted to write, and he would hold himself in constant communication with Zelman, and would get the letter immediately—on 6th July I went to Birmingham; the prisoner came to my house with Zelman, and accom<lb/>panied me to the station and saw me go—he gave me 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave Zelman a portion of it—I stayed at Ballivant's Hotel, Carr's Lane, High Street, Bir<lb/>mingham—I wrote a letter to the prisoner, addressed to Zelman, from Bir<lb/>mingham—I have a copy of it. (<hi rend="italic">Read; notice to produce the original had been given</hi>:—"7th July.—I enclose a sample of the goods you require, but I think they are a little too heavy.

On Friday, 13th July, I went with the prisoner to Mr. La Riviere, in Clifton Street, Finsbury—that was in answer to an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Clerke<lb/>nwell News</hi>, and in the prisoner's presence I selected a lithographic press and a copper-plate press—they came to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner paid a sovereign down, and said he would pay the rest when he fetched them away—this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given for the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of Simpson—Mr. La Riviere asked me what name, aud I said Simpson—the presses</p>

Inspector Foulger—this is the letter, it is not my writing—I don't know whose it is, it was given to me by Mr. Foulger—I enclosed it in an envelope directed to myself, inside another envelope, to a person in Birmingham, for the purpose of putting it through the Birmingham post. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Handsworth, Birmingham. Sir,—Please come and see me as soon as you possibly can, as the goods I am making for you are a deal of trouble, and I want your advice about them; there would have been part of them ready but for this difficulty. Yours truly, N.") I showed that letter to the prisoner; he said the delay was very inconvenient, and I had better write again immediately and try and ascer<lb/>tain what the difficulty was—I afterwards wrote another letter to the same person in Birmingham, under Inspector Foulger's direction, to be put through the post in the same way; it was returned to me in the same way, and it was shown to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Bead</hi>: "23rd July, 1867. Dear Sir,—I think a personal interview would-be better, as I can hardly explain by letter what the difficulty is. Hoping to see you soon, I remain, yours truly, N.") I afterwards saw the prisoner at 76, Gray's Inn Road, where the presses had been taken, several times, nearly every day—I saw him take some impressions off the copper plate—I got the engraving of the front plate done—I engraved neither of the plates myself, I got them both done—I last saw the prisoner on 3rd August at 76, Gray's Inn Road, where the presses were—the plates were there then—he was taking some proofs from the plates when I left the room.</p>

               <p>and Smith on several occasions—I have watched Smith's house and seen the prisoner go in and come out of it—on 8th July I saw the prisoner come out of 19, Shaftesbury Street, where he was lodging—from thence he went to Cross Street, City Road, to a coffee-shop—he remained there gome time, and then came out with another man—I saw him in Lombard Street speak to constable Clearing, and then go to a telegraph office in Founder's Court—he stayed there some time and came out—Smith was not there—he joined the other man, who was with him, and they both went to Old Swan Pier, and from there to Chelsea—on 11th July I saw the pri<lb/>soner go to the <hi rend="italic">Clerkenwell News</hi> office, in Myddelton Street, with Zelman—as he came out he was reading a letter, which he tore in pieces and threw away—I picked up the pieces and have put them together—this is it—it is addressed <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Z., Myddelton Street, Clerkenwell—on 17th July I saw the prisoner go to Mr. La Riviere's Bliop, in Clifton Street, Finsbury—he was alone—he then went to Mr. Bailey's, in Hill Street, Finsbury, a car<lb/>man's—I saw him talk to a man in the yard there, and I afterwards saw a cart driven by that man to Mr. La Riviere's door—I saw the prisoner and Smith take out the two presses and load them in the cart—I followed the cart to 76, Gray's Inn Road, and there saw the prisoner take them out and take them into the house—I have seen the prisoner several times since then going in and coming out of that house—I was present when he was apprehended.</p>

I have been watching the prisoner for the last mopth or two, under directions—on 3rd August I appre<lb/>hended him at Finch's public-house, Middle Row, Holborn—when I went in I saw him sitting on a seat there—I said, "What is your name?"—he said, "Johnson; why do you ask?"—at that time Inspector Foulger and Green came in—I told the prisoner we were police officers of the City of London, and we should charge him with being concerned in forging 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes of the Union Bank of Scotland—he at once took from his pocket a parcel and said, "Here are two things I had left with me forhalf-an-hour"—I handed that parcel to Inspector Foulger, and said, "Have you anything else relating to this matter?"—he said, "Yes, I have a piece of paper," taking from his pocket this piece of tracing paper and a specimen taken from the plate—at this time Inspector Foulger opened the parcel—he first asked him if he know what the parcel contained—he said, "Yes"—he then produced these plates from it and asked if he had ever seen them before—he said, "Once or twice, in Smith's possession"—we then conveyed him to the station—I searched him—among other things, I found twenty keys—one of those keys was shown to him, and he was asked what it belonged to, and he said either to his portmanteau or his box, he supposed—I afterwards went with Foulger and Green to 76, Gray's Inn Road, and with that key I opened a padlock on the door of the kitchen or place where the presses were—we found in that room the two presses for printing, and some pieces of paper, the same as this, damped ready for striking off—the prisoner gave his address 19, Shaftesbury Street—we went there and found in a leather case 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Scotch notes, some loose clay, and a piece of newspaper—some of the notes were on the Union Bank of Scotland, and I think 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was of the City of Glasgow Bank—they have since been given up to him—on searching him I found a left-luggage ticket of the North-Western Railway, Euston Square, dated 21st June—I ascertained that three packages had been left there for which this ticket was given.</p>

I am a shoe-maker, of 9, Gee's Court, Oxford Street—on Saturday night, 11th August, after twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Gee's Court, Oxford Street—he said to my mother-in-law that he would kill all the lot, and he came down to my door and made use of the same words, lhat he would kill all the b----lot—I said, "I am a poor weak man, I don't want no fighting; I have nothing to do with you, but you won't kill me," and I struck him—we fought, and he knocked me down three times—my wife came down out of bed and took me away, and shoved me into my landlord's—I was in there between a quarter and half an hour—when I came out I was told that my wife's head was cut open, and I saw her in Oxford Street, standing with her hands up to her head, and the blood running down her back—I said, "Who has done that?"—she said, "George, the man you were fighting with"—the prisoner was not there then—I took her to the hospital—we had not been drinking; all the drink I and my wife had was one half-pint of beer at our supper—we went to bed, but my breath was so bad that I was obliged to go down to the door—I have been ill for three years with diseased heart and con<lb/>sumption, and my wife has been my chief support—the prisoner was sober—I had never spoken to him before.</p>

(Wednesday) at two o'clock—I remember my wife giving me some medicine; I afterwards fell asleep—I heard a hallooing out of "Murder!" and that woke me; it was then between lights—I looked out of the window, which is close to my bed—I saw prisoner's mother, she was, hallooing out, "Murder!"—she came out of the door into the street—she called, "Murder!" two or three times, and then walked in again—she had a knife in her hand, it looked a longish knife; I am sure it was a knife—I observed nothing about her hands or the knife, as it was too dark—it was light enough to see it was a knife, but not to see if anything was on it—prisoner's father then came out, he clapped his hands and said, 'Well, this is a sight'—he then went in—after a little prisoner came out—I did not see him come out of the house, but I saw him sitting opposite my window on a chair—at first he was standing up, and then they fetched the chair, and I saw prisoner sit down—my wife was in bed with me at first, and then she got up and went out—prisoner's mother had her gown on when she came out, she was not in her night-clothes.</p>

It might be ten or fifteen minutes from the time the old woman came out till prisoner came out—my wife was awake when pri<lb/>soner came out—the clock was going, I did not look at it, I do not know why I did not look at it—prisoner's mother had a gown on, not a white nightdress—it was not light enough to see what colour the gown was—I remember Inspector Turner going to me on Thursday last—he asked me if I knew anything about this case—I said I knew very little about it—I did not say my attention was first attracted after five o'clock—I do not bow that I said so—I might have said that the time he was sitting over the way on a chair was about five o'clock—I cannot exactly say what I said to Inspector Turner, I told him there was a noise in the street, and that there was a noise in the street very often—I said I heard nothing unusual—I did not say anything to Mr. Turner about having seen prisoner's mother come out with a knife in her hand—I don't re<lb/>member mentioning half-past five or six to Mr. Turner—I told him that I heard several persons cry out that a young woman's throat was cut—I did not say what time I heard this—I do not recollect saying so—I told him that when I heard the cry I looked out and saw Wiggins sitting in the street—I said William and several others were with prisoner—Mr. Turner asked me to tell him all I saw or heard—the reason why I did not tell him that I saw prisoner's mother with a knife is that I am on my sick bed, and did not want to have anything to do with it, <hi rend="smallCaps">CONRAD LONG</hi>."</p>

I live at 84, Lower North Street, by the side of the prisoner's cottage, and next door to Long's—I live with Elizabeth Johnson; she goes by my name—on Wednesday morning, 24th July, about ten minutes to five o'clock, cries of "Murder!" attracted my attention, proceeding from the opposite side of the road; I got out of bed, opened the window, and saw the prisoner's father in his shirt, with</p>

               <p>a pair of trousers under his arm, and a red night cap on; he was hallooing out "Murder!" on the opposite side of the road, the same side as the cottage—I saw the prisoner going from the cottage next door towards his cottage; he had been to call the shipwright, and was in the middle of the road—he had a blue guernsey on and brown cloth trousers and boots or shoes, and his left hand was up to his neck—I did not notice whether his handkerchief was on—I said from my window, "Jack, what is the matter?"—he said, "She has been and cut her own throat, and cut mine too; for God's sake come down and see what is the matter"—I put my clothes on and went down stairs and went right up to the prisoner's cottage, the first of these two—I went up stairs and saw old Mrs. Wiggins, the mother, on the landing, dressed in her <hi rend="italic">shimmy</hi> and stockings—I went into the first floor room, my wife came up stairs behind me—there is no back room, it is the right-hand oom—when I got in the prisoner was standing opposite the deceased, alongside the table, with a knife in his hand—one part of the deceased was on the hearthrug and another on the floor—her head was under a chair, towards the wall, and her feet were towards the door—part of her body covered the rug—I did not notice whether her feet were beyond the hearthrug—her head was about six or seven inches from the wall—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) shows the position of the room; the window is here and the bedstead is against the window—this is the hearthrug—the head was within seven inches of this wall, resting on a pillow, which was at the back of her neck, and it hung so far back that I could not see her face at first—she was not quite on the back, but a little more on her left side—I noticed afterwards that there was a jacket with a handkerchief in it, under the pillow, but at that time I did not notice what was under the pillow—the underneath rail of the chair touched her chin—I noticed her throat, it was very much cut, and blood was running out of the windpipe, but not in much quantity—it was a bladder about as big as a pigeon's egg—she was dressed in her <hi rend="italic">shimmy</hi>, nothing else; it was torn down in front to within a foot from the bottom, and there was some blood on it, but I did not notice how much—I cannot tell which is the front or the back of it now (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I put my hand to her head and tried to ease her face from the chair, but I thought I was doing wrong and left off—I put my hand as near as I could to the beating of the heart, to see if there was life, and found there was none, and I touched her legs and found they were getting cold—when I felt her heart there was a kind of chill, she was <hi rend="italic">loo</hi> warm—I felt only one leg, just on the shin part, and it was cold—I did not feel or touch any other part of the body—the prisoner was standing opposite the deceased, by her feet, with his back towards the door—he had this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand, he put it on the table—I said, "Jack, for God's sake, what have you been doing of?"—he said, "Bill, she done it herself, and this is what she done it with"—he then put the knife on the table and walked out—I took a sheet off the bed and covered her over—there was no blood on the bed—I went out, leaviug the knife on the table, and went for a constable—when I came out of the room the mother was still on the landing, and my mistress with her—before I left the room I noticed blood on the seat of the chair, and a black apron covered over the chair—I did not lift the apron, but only a portion of it was covered—the blood on the knife was wet—I saw blood about the room, but did not notice it much, whether it was wet or dry—I did not notice the state of the blood anywhere except on the knife—I said to the old lady, "I will go for a constable"—I did not see the</p>

I practise at 12, High Street, Stepney—on the morning of 24th July I was fetched by a constable, and proceeded with him to the prisoner's cottage—when we got to the bottom of Lower North Street I saw the prisoner sitting on a chair—it was about half-past five o'clock—he had a red handkerchief round his neck—I pulled it away and looked at the wound, which was about two inches long, or it might be rather more—it was not very deep—on removing the handkerchief it bled rather freely—I did not take it right off; I merely pulled it away a little—there was blood on that portion of the handkerchief opposite the wound—when I first pulled it away I did not notice the cut on it—I placed the handkerchief against the wound; I saw it was not very dan<lb/>gerous, and left him sitting there and went into the house—I went up stairs into the room—from the time I saw the prisoner to the time I got into the room two or three minutes might have elapsed—I had waited to dress, and it was about half-past five when I arrived—this plan shows the state of the furniture, the bedstead, hearthrug, and the entrance—I went up stairs into a bedroom on the right-hand side, and found the deceased</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230057"/>
               <p>lying on the floor on her back, with her head to the wall, her feet extend<lb/>ing towards the door, and her arms outstretched—one arm was resting on the hearthrug—a sheet was thrown over the body, which was clothed in a shift—the head was lying on a pillow and some other things, and part of the head was resting against the rail of a chair, the back of the head—in the throat was an extensive wound, extending from about two inches below the left ear in a semi-lunar shape across the throat, about an inch behind the windpipe—it was between four and five inches long; it had a jagged appearance, and there were two slight incisions running into the main wound, one above and one below, on the left side of the throat, each about half an inch long—they were not deep: they were quite superficial—the chief wound was about two inches and a half deep, wounding the spine, dividing the carotid artery, the jugular vein, and the nerve en<lb/>closing the sheath—the external jugular vein was cut through; the other jugular vein and the nerve are enclosed in a sheath—the wound extended across the throat, dividing the windpipe—I felt that some of the vertebrae had been wounded—I introduced my finger, and felt distinctly that the bone of the vertebra had been wounded—a wound of that sort would produce death very quickly indeed, within a minute probably, but it might be longer—the windpipe being divided, a person could not call out—the knife was shown to me by the constable; the blood on it was then dry—I took out the blade and examined it—I will not swear whether there was any blood on the handle, as it was very dirty at that time; it has been cleaned since—I think a person inflicting such a wound upon themselves must be in a state amountingsto frenzy or madness—it is possible that such a wound could have been inflicted by the deceased upon herself in a state of extreme excitement amounting to frenzy—the blood in the throat was very dark and coagulated—there was a good deal of blood on the shift—it was dry—I did not turn the body over—I noticed blood towards the corner of the hearthrug, and blood had been spurted on to the lower part of the wall, near the fireplace; there were several large spots, some of them were larger than a shilling—they were dry—there was a consider<lb/>able quantity of blood on the floor, which was dry; there was also a good deal of blood extending into the corner by the door, that was dry—there was no liquid on the floor—the blood was not dry on the hearthrug, but all on the boards was dry—it is difficult to judge of the quantity of dry blood on the floor; it was in a semi-circular shape—there was a good deal of blood on the seat of the chair; it was firmly congested, but not dry like that on the floor; it was covered over with a black handkerchief or apron—I examined the legs and feet, and felt them from the toes up be<lb/>yond the knees—they were cold and becoming rigid—I turned back the sheet and the chemise, and examined the abdomen; it was warm—the arms were outstretched in the cold, and were becoming rigid—they were cold—the hands were covered with blood; there was a good deal of blood on them, smeared; that was dry—from the state of the body and the ap<lb/>pearances I saw, I think death had taken place at least two hours; it might be more—the blood on the shift and in the room was very dark in colour, but I would not give any opinion from the colour; I speak merely from the dryness; you cannot depend upon the colour of the blood.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230058"/>
               <p>—I was the first medical man examined—I heard the evidence of some of the others before the Magistrate, but no one was examined before the Coroner except myself—I heard Dr. Taylor and Dr. Wilkes examined before the Magistrate—when I was giving my evidence before the Coroner, before I heard any of the other medical men, I said, "I think the deceased must have been dead one hour; it might be more"—I adhere to that, but I do not think death had taken place within the hour—I think what I said was in answer to a question; the Coroner asked me whether she might have been dead an hour, and I said, "Yes, an hour, it might be more"—I rather think I said that—she might have been dead an hour of course—the internal carotid artery was divided, all but a small portion of the back of it, which was not cut through.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that a person in a state of frenzy might have inflicted such a wound upon themselves: supposing that to be so, I suppose anybody committing suicide would be in a state of frenzy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a state border<lb/>ing on it—I think a person inflicting such a wound upon herself might shift from the position in which she was when she inflicted it—I believe that is the received medical opinion now—some mistakes have formerly been made by medical men on that very point which recently have been corrected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might a person having inflicted that sort of wound upon herself sitting on a chair, in her struggles have thrown herself on her back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She might fall on her back in her movements after the wound—the blood in the wound was coagulated—there was a little from the different vessels—I do not think one witness said that blood was <hi rend="italic">blubbering</hi> from the wound, I think he said from the windpipe—blood issuing from the living body coagulates very quickly—I felt the abdomen warm—the feet were cold—that might be if a person had gone to sleep with their feet exposed—you might find the coldness in a living body, but not the <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi>; I mean rigidity—there is a difference of opinion as to the time it takes for rigidity to set in—I was down there about half-past five—it would take me two or three minutes to examine the prisoner, and to go up into the room—I know it was half-past five, because I left my house about twenty-five minutes past five—I looked at the clock in my own room, and also at the Church clock—I stopped to examine the prisoner, and sent him immediately to the hospital—he remained there I think till 9th August, more than a week, under the care of a medical man—I should say that his condition was not dangerous, but they would not have kept him there if he had not required medical treatment—I should say that he had not lost a great deal of blood; the external jugular vein was divided—blood might or might not flow from that—I had no difficulty in stopping it with a handkerchief, but if it was not stopped a good deal of blood would flow, and it would become dangerous—I was anxious to get him to the hospital to get him attended to—if he had been left alone and untended by a skilled medical man it is quite possible that he might have died from loss of blood—I cannot say that it is extremely probable—the external jugular vein might be divided without danger to life, because coagula would form, which would stop it—the internal jugular vein is below it, you must cut through another layer of muscle before you get to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Stunt, of 99, Lower North Street, the second house from the gateway—on Wednesday morning, 24th July, I heard a cry of "Oh! oh! Murder! murder!"—I got out of bed, threw up the window, looked out, and saw old Mr. Wiggins in his shirt, with his trousers under his arm, standing outside the gateway in North Street—it was shortly after five o'clock, I know that because my husband had gone to his work, and my clock struck five after he went, but I cannot tell how many minutes—I went down stairs, and saw the prisoner on the opposite side, with his two hands to his throat, going up the street—I went down to the cottage, went into the down stairs room, and old Mrs. Wiggins was there, and Mrs. Dunn—Mrs. Wiggins had blood on her hands and on the feet of her stockings—I did not notice how she was dressed—I went upstairs and noticed foot marks of blood on the stairs—I went into the room where the deceased was; no one was there; a sheet was over her—I saw a pair of women's drawers lying in a corner of the room by the side of the fireplace, with a great quantity of blood on them—they were on the left-hand side going into the room, by this projection by the side of the fire-place—I also saw a new pair of women's boots inside the door going in; there was nothing on them—I saw the wound in the neck—there was a dreadful lot of blood on the shift, and it was torn down the front—I did not feel the body—there was some bread and meat on the table, and a can with part of a pint of beer in it, about half a pint—I did nothing to the drawers, nor did I interfere with the body—I went down stairs, and saw Mrs. Dunn wash old Mrs. Wiggins's hands, and I also noticed a great quantity of blood on the feet of her stockings—Mrs. Dunn took them off of her and put on her boots without her stockings—I did not notice whether the blood was wet or dry—there was more on her right stocking than on the left—it was on the sole of one, but mostly on the ankle of the right foot—I saw Mr. Horton come, I had then been down stairs a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I went up into the room again, and, after Mr. Horton gave his sanction for the body to be moved, I assisted in moving it into the bed—I moved one sleeve of the chemise from the left arm, but could not get the arm straight, as it was stiff and I could not straighten it; and I removed the sleeve and straightened the arm—the sleeve had got down as far as this on the arm.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. On the morning of 24th July I was on duty temporarily at the London Hospital, taking duty for a friend—I was there when the prisoner was brought in, between seven and eight o'clock, I should think nearer seven, but cannot say the exact time—he was dressed, and had this red handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) round his neck—I took it off—it had been worn with this portion where the large mass of blood is, towards the wound, which was on the left side of the throat, a little more than an inch and a half below the left ear and a little behind, and extending across the throat to about an inch or an inch and a quarter past the middle of the throat—the bloody part of the handkerchief covered the wound—it was deepest towards the left extremity; it was through the skin and the tissue immediately beneath the skin, and as it passed forward round the throat it became very superficial, so that when it reached below the middle of the throat it was not through the skin—external jugular vein was divided a little nearer the extremity than the middle of the wound—it was not dangerous under proper care—from its position, I believe he could have inflicted it upon himself—my opinion is that it was inflicted from the left towards the right—there were two slighter wounds on the throat, one was near the middle of the throat, scarcely extending through the skin, and between, the greater wound and the angle of the jaw—it was only supers<lb/>ficial—it was about an inch, or from an inch to a inch and a quarter long—the other was above the greater wound in the angle of the jaw, and was very superficial—it was about three-quarters of an inch long—there were also some slight scratches about the angle of the jaw on the left side—they were exceedingly superficial—on his left thumb was a superficial cut across the palm surface—it could be inflicted by this knife—the prisoner remained there five or six days to my knowledge, but I was only there temporarily—the wound was healing at the end of that time—this handkerchief was taken from his throat—it is in the same state now, with the exception of the blood being dry, but a portion of it has been removed—I noticed that it was cut through these folds when it was taken from him, or rather before I took it off, and that made me take it off carefully—sixteen folds of the handkerchief are cut through—there are one or two exceedingly small spots of blood on the edge of the cuts not penetrating more than one fold—there is a slight spot on the second, but it does not go deeper—all the rest are clean, as far as I can tell by examination—the instrument inflicting the wound must have been bloody, and I should have expected to find blood on the handkerchief—if the knife had commenced with making the wound, then the wound must have bled—it was a wound which would bleed im<lb/>mediately</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230061"/>
               <p>mediately—if that part where the cut is was against that part of the throat where the wound is, I should expect to find a considerable quantity of blood on the handkerchief.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230062"/>
               <p>discover whether the wound was inflicted by the prisoner or by another person; that was in answer to a question—the question was asked me, whether there was anything in the wound which would enable me to say whether it was inflicted by himself or another person, and I said, No, the appearance would be the same—I heard Mr. Horton examined—I never saw the body of the deceased—I understood the questions you put to him—I think a minute is an extreme time for the power of locomotion to continue, supposing the wound to be self-inflicted; I think a minute is an extreme time; I think syncope would follow sooner than that from the loss of blood from the carotid artery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Reading from Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence, p.</hi> 513.) "Wounds of the carotid arteries are often pronounced <hi rend="italic">instantaneously</hi> mortal. A wit<lb/>ness may deliberately state that the person could not possibly have sur<lb/>vived an instant. This is a very hazardous opinion, for it occasionally comes out on inquiry, that if such a wound had been instantaneously mortal, then, in defiance of rational probability or of the strongest pre<lb/>sumptive evidence to the contrary, the deceased must have been murdered. A medical opinion of this kind has not only been refuted by circumstances, but by the evidence of eye-witnesses. A medical witness is then com<lb/>pelled to admit that his rules for judging of the mortality of wounds are wrong, and that the person may have survived for a longer or shorter period. There are several cases on record which show that wounds involving the common carotid artery and its branches, as well as the internal jugular vein, do not prevent a person from exercising voluntary power, and even running a certain distance. Mr. Clegg, Coroner for Boston, informed me that in 1863 he held an inquest on the body of a man who committed suicide by cutting his throat; the common carotid artery and the jugular vein were cut through to the bone; and, in spited the loss of a large quantity of blood, the man lived half an hour. In a case of murder perpetrated at Kingston in March, 1831, it was proved by medical evidence that the deceased died from a wound in the throat which cut through the right carotid artery, jugular vein, and windpipe. The wound had been inflicted while deceased was lying in bed. Her body was found in an adjoining room, and the circumstances showed that after receiving the wound she had been able to rise from her bed and to stagger or run to the distance of about six feet. In the case of Reg. <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Danks, Warwick Lent Assizes, 1832, it was proved that the deceased had died from a wound in the throat inflicted by the prisoner which divided the trunk of the carotid artery, the principal branches of the external carotid, and the jugular veins. The evidence rendered it probable, if not certain, that after the infliction of this wound the deceased had been able to run twenty-three yards and to climb over a gate, the time required for the performance of such acts being at least from fifteen to twenty seconds. Most medical witnesses would have probably given an opinion that the deceased could not have moved from the spot where such a wound had been inflicted; but it was clear that she had gone this distance. There was no dragging of the body, and no motive for its being dragged by the prisoner and exposed in an open road where it was found. Such cases as these show the necessity of caution in giving an opinion respecting imme<lb/>diate death from wounds. When the internal jugular vein has been the principal vessel involved in a wound a similar question has presented itself. The power of moving has been exerted to a considerable extent." I suppose you agree with that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you asked me whether a person</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230063"/>
               <p>might survive a minute, and then you read an extract which says that a person will not die in an instant. I have heard that there are cases on record where both the carotid arteries are cut, that the person has moved to the next room and climbed over a gate, one case says survived half an hour; that I am certain could not have been unless the blood had been stopped, you have read several instances, I cannot give a general answer to them. I agree that the case where a woman had her throat cut and climbed over a low fence and ran twenty-three yards is perfectly authentic; I also believe the case in Regent Street, which is quoted, that is authentic.</p>

I can swear before God and man that I never had the knife in my hand to cut her throat or mine. On the morning of the accident I was lying down asleep when this was done. I rose up at four o'clock and went down stairs to look at the clock; the exact time was five minutes past four. I went up stairs again and told Agnes Oaks the time; she said, 'You are in no hurry; lie down a little bit longer.' I laid down and went off to sleep, and while I was asleep she cut my throat with a knife. I got up and went into the next room, called up my father and mother, and told them that she cut my throat; my mother and father got up. I went down stairs; my mother went into the room, and called out to me, 'My boy, she has cut her throat.' I have nothing more to say.

My mother called me about four o'clock. I went again to sleep. I awoke again and went down stairs and looked at the clock; it was twenty minutes past four by clock.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might it have been that the power of the knife, or of the person using it, being exhausted by so many folds, that when it reached th'e skin it only grazed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Wearing it round the seek, I cannot see how any knife could have produced that cut without cutting the neck—I think he could not have cut through this handkerchief, and yet made a superficial wound; my opinion is that this was cut when it was off the neck, or low down from the neck—these others are cuts which I have made—the plunge of the knife strong enough to have severed these folds must, I think, have penetrated the throat deep enough to draw blood, be<lb/>cause it is cut at the edge of the handkerchief, and there must have been great play of the knife.</p>

POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now look at the boots? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have examined them very closely, and only find some dirty matter on the sole; all the upper leather is free from stains—I have examined the interior of both boots, and can see, upon a general examination, no appearance of blood, but part of the interior has been scraped and removed with the dirt, and a very small quantity of blood was found in tho scrapings derived from both boots; there was only enough to enable me to say that there was blood there—I could only find that by scraping the inside and testing the residue, the greater part of which was dirt and leather, but there was nn indication of blood—I have looked at the inside of the boots as far as I can see, but have not cut them to pieces—as far as I can see, there is no appearance of blood—I did not destroy the boots—the large quantity of blood on the stockings was at the the end, but the heel part is quite stiff with blood—there is not any on the inner heel of the boots, or only a mere trace—I examined the knife, and found blood on both sides of the blade, partly coagulated, and the coogulum carried to the back part of the blade, show<lb/>ing that it had been very deep in the wound—the handle was loose, and there was blood on the iron pin which goes into, the handle, but I could find no blood on the handle.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose if a person walked where there was blood on the floor, their stockings must necessarily gather some of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and in walking in that part of the house where there was no blood, the dust would get on and cause the blood nearly to approach a state of dryness; treading about on the floor would absorb a portion of the blood and dry it, and if the boot was put on after a good deal of walking about it might leave very little trace inside the boot—I never saw the body—I am forming an opinion from the statements which I have heard from the witnesses—the evidence given by Mr. Horton is very clear, but, as a general principle, I am better able to speak from what I see with my own eyes than from trusting to the observation and memory of other people—such cases do not occur very often, but I have some experience in cases of violent death—the last edition of my work was published in 1865.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I read it yesterday, I will read it again: at page 518 you say, "Wounds of the carotid artery," &amp;c. (<hi rend="italic">Reading the former extract as far as</hi> "the person may have survived for a longer or a shorter period")—that was written by you in 1865? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I adhere to it now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Jn the case you were referred to by my learned friend, Mr. Ribton, was the windpipe severed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not—the case was read yesterday—the power of motion a good deal depends upon whether the windpipe is severed, and I believe that every case must be judged by its own special conditions; in that case, too, a medical man was called id and there was no bleeding for a long time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to the artery cut and the windpipe not severed, how long would motion last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not motion, it is merely life; a person can<lb/>not live with the carotid artery cut, beyond a few seconds, and when the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230069"/>
               <p>windpipe is cut, the gush of blood generally gets into the open aperture and the person is suffocated, even if he does not die from loss of blood—I was not examined before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say that if the windpipe is severed death is instantaneous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When the jugular vein and the carotid artery are cut at the same time, generally so; I know of no instance but one where there was a little surviving; one instance I have recorded here, which you read yesterday, where a person moved two yards, a sort of spasmodic motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At page 513 you say, "There is one circumstance which requires notice in relation to severe wounds in the <hi rend="italic">throat</hi>, namely, that although a person may have the power of locomotion he may not be able to use his voice so as to call for assistance. It sometimes excites surprise at an in<lb/>quest how a murder may in this way be quietly committed without persons in an adjoining room hearing any noise, but the fact is well known medi<lb/>cally, that when the windpipe is divided, as it generally is on these occa<lb/>sions, the voice is lost?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is the undoubted distinction which exists, that where the windpipe is cut the voice is lost, provided the jugular vein and carotid arteries are not cut through; this applies to ordinary suicidal wounds, where the carotid artery and jugular vein generally escape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "Such cases as these show the necessity of caution," &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">at before, down</hi> to "considerable extent?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but in that case the windpipe was not wounded, nor the carotid artery cut—I think great caution ought to be used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that the injury to the bone was done first; might not the knife have been plunged into the neck with such violence as to reach the bone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The injury was in a different situation, as I gather, and there had been a stab down there first—the first plunge of the knife might have done it if done by another person—the knife might be plunged in with such force as to injure the bone, which, was injured—when I say that I agree with Mr. Horton that a person in frenzy or delirium might inflict such a wound, I refer to unnatural strength, and to mental infirmity also—such a degree of force was used that nothing but frenzy, delirium, or the act of an insane person would give; in fact delirium and frenzy are kinds of madness; they give spasmodic strength.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In cases of suicide, are not wounds often of a very fearful character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but not involving the spine and vessels.</p>

                  </hi>, M.B.C.P. I am one of the physieians of Guy's Hos<lb/>pital, and professor of medicine at the London University—I, conjointly with Dr. Taylor, gave my special attention to the appearance of the human body after death—I was in Court all day yesterday, and heard Mr. Horton's description of the state in which the deceased was found, and the state of the body—assuming the facts to be correct, I believe she had been dead two or three hours at the time of his examination, and I ought to say that two or three hours is rather under the mark—in forming that opinion, I make allowance for the great loss of blood, and for all the cir<lb/>cumstances described—I might add that I form that conclusion as to two or three hours because I cannot call to mind any case in which I have seen rigidity, <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi>, occur under three hours—I bear in mind the degree the witnesses have spoken to; I have never known the commence<lb/>ment of <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> under three hours—I have heard Mr. Horfera's de<lb/>scription of the wound in the throat; it is barely possible for the woman to have inflicted that wound on herself: my reason for saying that is that</p>

I took my handkerchief off and went out of the room, and I saw her drawers and put them to the wound. I went into my mother and father's room and gave the alarm. When I went into the room again she was sitting against the wall, with blood coming out of her windpipe as thick as my finger. I was in my stocking feet, which is the reason of their being saturated. I put my shoes on, which laid under the table, and went down stairs, went into the street, and Dillon was looking out at the window. The deceased was not laid out on the hearthrug; I will be on my oath before God and man she was lying with her back against the wall, and as the blood came from her so came her body down, and there I left her; her head was at the side of the chair. I went out of the room, and she was sitting on her bottom, her legs not stretched out at all. There was no pillow, only my jacket, which had been on tho hearthrug, with a lot of blood on it. When she got out of bed and asked me to forgive her her shift was not torn. She had pawned and sold every<lb/>thing she could make a penny of. I never accused her of anything, and never struck her till Saturday. When she asked me to forgive her I told her I could not, and she said, "I will tell you all I have done." I can be on my solemn oath I never had the knife in my hand from when I had my supper over night till my mother saw me pick the knife up. I said, "Oh! mother, here is the knife she has done it with," and put it on the table. I can be on my solemn oath, if I die to-morrow, I am not guilty of the death of Agnes Oaks.</p>

I am potman at the Duke of Wellington public-house, Brunswick Street, Hackney Road—about 7.30. p.m. on the 30th August I went to the privy door in the back yard—the prisoner was in the privy standing up, and he appeared to be adjusting his dress—I watched him from the stable, and saw him come out—he threw half of our clothes prop on the ground, and went to the bar and had half a pint of beer—I saw the prop was covered with soil, and I accused him of break<lb/>ing our prop, and with putting it down the privy—he said he was not there, and that I must have made a mistake—I told him I had made no mistake, as I had seen him in there and had seen him come out—he went down the yard again and looked down the closet, and then went out at the back gate—after he had gone I got a candle and looked down the closet—I sew a number of letters, a good many of which were torn in two—I got up some of the letters, about thirty-nine, and put them in a pail—there were four torn in two and thirty-five whole ones—I gave infor<lb/>mation to the Post Office authorities—from the time I saw the prisoner in the closet to the time I found the letters no one else had been in it.</p>

About half-past six on Tues<lb/>day morning, 3rd September, I was called by the last witness—I accom<lb/>panied her to 3, Milstead Terrace, and went to the first-floor back bed-room, where I saw the deceased lying on the bed—the prisoner was stand<lb/>ing over her, his right hand was placed on her forehead, and his left hand on her breast—at that time she was living—I saw that her throat was cut—there was no one else in the room besides the prisoner and the woman—I said, "Who did this?"—the prisoner said, "I did it"—I said, "You will consider yourself in my custody"—he said, "Shall I have to put on my clothes?" I said, "Yes"—he had on a pair of slippers and a pair of light kind of drawers—I then went with him down stairs into the front parlour—I there asked him what he did it with—he said, "I will give it you"—he went to a cupboard at the side of the fireplace, and, taking the knife I now produce from off the top of the cupboard, he said, M That is it," at the same time handing it to me—there was wet blood on the blade at the time—I believe it is a knife used by curriers—I remained with the prisoner in the front parlour until the doctor came—while the doctor wm up stairs the prisoner said he hoped she would die—some one then came down stairs and said that she was dead—the prisoner asked me if I would allow him to go and see her—I allowed him to do so—I went into the room before him—he asked me to stand on one side, so as he could get to the bed, and he leant over the head of the bed and kissed the deceased—I then took him down stairs again into the front parlour—he went to the mantelpiece, took this letter marked A, and handed it to me—there are two letters in one envelope; the envelope was, as it is now, not fastened—when he handed it to me he asked me if I would post it to his brother—he said, "I have not sealed it up, as I thought it might want to be read"—he afterwards said he wrote the letters himself, and they were written in French—I remained there with him ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then took him to the station and charged him with the willful murder of <hi rend="italic">Emma</hi> Snow; that was a mistake in the name—he made some answer, which I did not understand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 759, Old Kent Road—I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons—on the morning in question, about a quarter-past six, I was called to No. 3, Milstead Terrace—I went into the room up stairs where the deceased was living—she was lying on the bed—she was still alive, but insensible—she had an incised wound on the throat, commencing under the angle of the right jaw, and extending down<lb/>wards in a slanting direction to the left side, partly across and dividing the windpipe and several of the blood-vessels—it was about six inches in length, and from one to two inches in depth—she survived about a minute;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230101"/>
               <p>in fact, she was hardly living when I went in—she died from that wound—the knife produced would be likely to produce the wound—I left the room immediately after the deceased died, and upon proceeding down stairs I met the prisoner on the stairs with the constable—the stairs were rather dark, and I said to the constable, "Who is this you have with you?"—he said, "This is the man who did it, sir"—the prisoner from behind the constable said, "Yes, I am the man"—I allowed him to pass me on the staircase—he proceeded up stairs, and I followed him—he went into the room, and said to some one on his way, "Allow me to pass"—he went forward to the bed where the deceased was lying, leant over her, and kissed her—he then went out of the room, and said to some one on the landing, "I have written a letter to my brother, telling him what to do, after I have carried out my plan, with any of the children that may be left; some one (<hi rend="italic">mentioning a name which I forget; indeed, I did not hear it precisely at the time</hi>) will translate the answer"—he then kissed one o£ the children that was brought to him, and walked down stairs—I followed him—he sat down on a chair and took out his pipe—the constable was there all the time—immediately I got into the room I asked the constable where the instrument was with which the crime was committed—the constable took it out of his pocket—it was wrapped in a piece of paper—it was then covered with blood, coagu<lb/>lated, not dry, moist blood—the prisoner immediately got up from his seat, came over to where the policeman and I were standing, the policeman hav<lb/>ing the knife in his hand, and I was looking at it—the prisoner immediately said, "Yes, that is the knife, you know, that I brought home on Saturday on purpose to do it with"—after looking at the knife a little time I went to the bed where the crime was committed, and, as the wound in the throat had rather a peculiar direction, I said, speaking more to myself than any<lb/>body else, "I wonder how the body was lying when the crime was com<lb/>mitted"—the prisoner immediately got up from the chair, where he had sat down again, came over to me, and said, "I will show you all about it, sir"—he then proceeded to tell me how the crime was committed—he said, "I got up about four, it must have been four, but my wife awoke and re<lb/>quested me to come to bed again, as it was too early, she thought; I did so, and waited a little time until she fell asleep again. I then arose cautiously, stood in front of her, kissed her, shook her hand, and drew the knife in this manner," imitating the movement with his hand, from left to right of himself, but from right to left of the body—he drew his hand across a supposititious throat, across the bed, where the neck had been lying—"Then," he said, "the blood came, which I did not expect"—I said to him, "Did not you know that there was blood in a human body?"—he said "Oh yes, I knew that"—I said, "Then did not you expect it from your wife?—he said, "No, I can't say that I did"—he then said, "She looked, towards the door of the room in which the children were lying" (he pointed to the room with his hand as he said this), "as if intending to go there, but of course my plan was that she should die, so I went over to the door," and he proceeded then from the bedside to the door to show me how he preventing her from getting into room, as if Tie were acting it over again—he said, "Then she went up stairs, left the room; I now intended to cut my own throat, but the blood prevented me"—I said, "How? the sight of it?"—he said, "No, it stood up," at the same time putting his hand to his throat, he brought it forward and then took it back again immediately, as if it had come against a supposititious barrier, as if he had come against a pillar of blood that stood up—he then said, "Of course I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230102"/>
               <p>cannot do it now; some one will have to come and cut my throat now because I cannot do it; I ought to have done it in another way, but had no material"—I said, "Fire-arms?"—he said, "Yes, I suppose so," or some<lb/>thing to that effect—I think he said, "Yes, it must have been"—after that he sat down again—I think he said, when drawing the knife, that it was very hard to do—I said, "Whatever made you think of doing such a thing?"—he said, "It was necessity, sir; it was necessary to do it; in fact," he said, and then stopped and hesitated a moment—I said, "You look upon it as a duty, I suppose?"—he said, "Decidedly, it was right, wasn't it?"—I said, "No, I don't think so; how did you consider it a necessity for you to do it?"—he said, "I will not tell you now"—the constable then handed me this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner at that time had sat down—some little time had elapsed—I was speaking to the constable about when the other constables would arrive, the prisoner was smoking, and when he heard the letter mentioned he got up again and said, "Yes, I wrote that letter on Sunday night," and he again repeated what he had said up stairs about what his brother was to do with the children, in fact repeated the contents of the letter shortly—he said, "I only wrote it on Sunday night, although I had made up my mind to kill myself for a fortnight before that, but I could not part from my wife, therefore I determined that she should die too and go along with me, as also the children"—I think that was all that he said—I asked him a little about his health—I made him sit down in a chair, and asked him how he had been for some time—he said, "Bad; very bad"—he did not mention the disease—he said he had been operated upon—I then asked him how he felt his head at the present time—he immediately said, "Oh! You know I am not insane"—I looked at his tongue, and felt his pulse, and asked how lie had been for some months, such questions as a medical man would put—I asked him if he had sweated at night lately—he said, "Well, I think I have"—I asked him how his mouth was in the morning when he got out of bed—he said, "Very dry"—I said, "Parched?"—he said, "Yes, exceedingly so"—I asked him as to the state of his appetite, which he said was bad—I asked if he had any singing noises in his ears—he said he thought he had; he was not very sure about that—I asked how long it was since the operation was performed—he could not tell me the precise time—he told me what the operation was—I mentioned the name of the disease—he did not know the name of it—I said, "It must have been fistula in <hi rend="italic">ano</hi>"—he said, "I think that was it"—I think that was almost all that he said; perhaps he said some other things—several of the deceased's arteries were severed—in a wound of that kind I should think the blood would not spurt, I should say not in the direction of the prisoner, it might spurt out against the chin—I should say it would not spurt out; the veins were separated as well, but the veins do not spurt—the arteries that were severed were the external carotid artery, the lingual artery, the facial artery, and the superior thyroid artery; the edges of the wound might stop the blood from spurting—I examined the body; there was no evidence of spurting—I did not find a spot of blood on the prisoner—there was a little on the sleeve, as if it had been rubbed off on another body with blood on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>years as a science—I am a surgeon and physician likewise—I did not ascertain at that time that the prisoner had been under the care of Dr. Rowland for fistula—I knew that he had been under the care of some one, but not of Dr. Gowland—I have had no communication with Dr. Gowland, or with any medical person—I do not even know him by sight—I do not know that the gentleman sitting near you is Dr. Gowland—fistula is a disease of a very distressing and depressing nature; the state of system upon which it depends is of a very distressing nature; it is connected with the tubercular or consumptive state of system, which is of a very depressing nature—the disease is the result of a state of system; of dis<lb/>organisation of the general system—some diseases have a more depres<lb/>sing effect upon the mental energies than others—it depends upon the time they continue—fistula adds to the already existing depression by being a source of irritation—I trace the disease back to the general system, and this, superadded to the existing irritation, makes it worse: taking the facts of this case as they came within my knowledge, I have formed an opinion as to whether or no they indicate insanity—I have formed the opinion that the prisoner was insane at the time the act was committed; that he was insane at the time I was speaking to him and conversing with him, and I should say insane at the time that he com<lb/>mitted the act.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you say was his delusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That it was ne<lb/>cessary he should die—there is a recognised form of insanity of that kind, and he was distinctly labouring under that at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then is his stating that, the fact which leads you to believe that this man was insane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not his merely stating that; I take a variety of symptoms into consideration, his manner, his appear<lb/>ance—I believe there was in him a complete absence or deficiency of vo<lb/>lition of control over that perverted form of thought; in fact, his will was in abeyance, and his reason had become the advocate of his delusion—there was a complete absence of volition of control over that perverted train of thought, and over the acts which were expressions of that per<lb/>verted form of thought; over those acts, of which this crime was one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me a single fact in the case which you say indicates insanity, with the exception of the one you have mentioned, that it was necessary he should die? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The illusion of the blood standing up as a barrier; that constituted another delusion; it was first a delusion of the senses, and then became a delusion of the mind, because he believed in it—I have met with sane persons who have been dreadfully frightened at the sight of blood, and that have almost fainted at the sight of it; I have done it myself when first brought in contact with it—his appearance also in<lb/>dicated insanity—he did not appear then as he does now; he appeared pretty much the same, but very different in one respect; he had an ab<lb/>stracted appearance, a vacant look, without any moroseness or anything of that kind; I judged from his appearance and manner—his tone of voice was that of a man who was thoroughly satisfied with what he had done,</p>

               <p>and expected to be appreciated for it—his manner was that of a cool man—I could not imagine a sane man smoking a pipe and behaving with the coolness that he did—there was also his previous history—I inquired into that—I inquired into his previous state of health and his then existing state of health; it was that of a man in extremely bad health, a man who was undoubtedly labouring under consumption, and consumptive at the present time—he told me he had written the letters on the Sunday night—the 1st September, the date of the letter, was Sun<lb/>day.

               <p>"My dear Brother Alfred,—Excuse me the writing to trouble you for the last time, after being for nearly four years without giving you any news of me. I have submitted during the last eight months to the greatest miseries, and I cannot withstand them any more. I have taken the resolution during the last fortnight to take away my life, as well as that of my wife, with whom I have been living thirteen years, as also that of my children. I have nothing to reproach her whom I have made to pass as my wife for thirteen years. During the time we have lived together not two women out of a hundred would have done as she has done. We have often had many quarrels together about things that were of no consequence, but always takes care of the children as well as the household as well as I could desire. It is with the greatest regret that I anl about to commit the crime, if in every case I have strength enough for the end, for I have a daughter nearly twelve, another nine, and the last nineteen months old. I am going to try, at all events, to accomplish it, and if there is a God (as many of those Jesuits who live by the sweat of our labours wish us to believe) I believe I shall have an interview with Him, although in spite of my not having confessed myself to them. And I believe He will pardon me for the fault I am about to commit, if in any case one can call it so, to save me from misery as well as my family. I cannot say more, for I should have to go through the whole transactions of the last twelve years, and it would take me the whole night. Forget me for ever; and if my poor mother lives, do not strike her such a blow, for the poor woman has always done all one could to bring us up in the right way. It is now eleven o'clock in the evening. My wife and children are sleeping peaceably. They have no thought of what is going to happen to them. I am writing at the address which you will find below, and you will see how it has all passed; and if there remain one of my children do what you can to have it near you, for I have the conviction 'Thy brother is no more.'") <hi rend="italic">The following was also read</hi>:—"London, September 1,1867. After having tried every means, I have at last decided to take away my life, which my poor mother had so much trouble to preserve. That the gentlemen of the Jury, who will have to make inquiries over me may not return a verdict that this man was insane, as it is said I believe always, I have all my faculties at the moment I write these few lines. As to the past," I have endured the greatest misery for eight months, and I have resigned myself to the fate to which I have condemned myself for the last fort<lb/>night. I desire to have time and thought to accomplish my object, for I desire to leave no one behind whom people may some day reproach that their father was a murderer. If these few lines fall under your eyes' let my comrade at the workshop, Dostel, know that he will gather the few articles which are at the workshop and keep them for himself, as well as a carpet bag, which he can go and get at the Leopard coffee-shop, which I left there last Saturday. <hi rend="smallCaps">LOUIS BORDIER</hi>." <hi rend="italic">Memorandum found on the mantelshelf</hi>:—"Having always been in good fellowship with those with whom I have worked, I think it my duty before quitting this world to address to them one last word."</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger's assistant, and live at 166, High Street, Southwark—about a quarter or half-past twelve on Mon<lb/>day, the 6th August, I was in Blackman Street, with a young lady—the prisoner McDonald rushed out of a court and tore my watch and chain from my waistcoat—I was close by the court—he just came a few steps out—I saw three of them, and they all made up the court—he was the last one, and I followed—at the end of the court I caught McDonald and threw him down—in the struggle I saw the guard in his hand, and heard it rattle—I called for the police, and McDonald for his friends to come and pull me off—I was on the top of him—he held me by the throat with one hand and held the watch away with the other—Jones and the other man came up and the watch and guard changed hands—he handed it to one of them—I did not see who—they both punched me and hit me on the head and all over the body—they then, the two, made off, and got away, just as the witness Ann Hickey, the young lady I was walking with, came up with a policeman—I held McDonald till the police<lb/>man came up—I gave him into his hands and went after the others, but could not find them—I then returned to the policeman, and as I was stand<lb/>ing talking to him McDonald struck me a violent blow in the mouth, which made my nose bleed and swelled my mouth up very much—he was then taken to the station—I was very much knocked about; my knee was injured—I walk with a stick in consequence—I have been in bed ever since—I was attended by Dr. Hart for some time, and then I went to the hospital—I next saw Jones on the morning when the charge against McDonald came on—I saw him among the people standing in the Court—I called the at<lb/>tention of a policeman to him, and had him taken there and then—I have never seen my watch and chain since—there was a gaslight on the pave<lb/>ment at the entrance to the court where this happened, and there was a light up the court at the corner, that shone on the spot where I was pulled down, but very dimly—I did not see Jones's face—I saw him as he was running up the court—he ran first—I can swear to his back—the light was sufficient to enable me to see the figures.</p>

I live at 6, Hands Court, Dorset Street, Clapham Road—the deceased, Benjamin Groves, was my husband—on Saturday night, the 8th September, he came home to have his supper, and he heard Morgan and Mrs. Riley quarrelling—we went out to our gate to listen—we heard Morgan make use of some threats—my husband went down to speak to him—he said he would rip up the first one that came near him—Mrs. Morgan brought out a light, and he told her to take it away, and knocked it out of her hand—my husband went towards him and said, "Morgan, what are you at? go in and go to bed; you are going mad"—I could not hear what he said in reply—my husband pushed the gate open and went in to him, and said, "You won't hurt me, it's only old Ben Groves"—Mrs. Riley was then going up the court into Dorset Street after her brother—I went up the court after my husband, and just as I pushed the gate open he said to Morgan, "Don't hit me again, you have stabbed me"—the prisoner made no reply—I pushed my husband out of the gate before me, and took him up the court into our own house—Morgan had something in his hand—by the shadow of it it looked like a knife—his hand was raised to give him a second blow—I put my husband on the bed—he said, "Let me lie down and die, for my belly is all coming out"—he undid his trousers and I saw all his entrals were protruding from a wound in the stomach—information was given to the police and a surgeon, and he was ultimately taken to St. Thomas's Hospital—I left him there at ten o'clock at night to come home, and when I went next morning he was dead—I did not see any blow given by my husband to the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Until this occurrence had your husband and the prisoner been good friends? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Always; they never had a word—I was not astonished at my husband seeming to think that he had some influence over him—I had not seen the prisoner before that night—I had only heard him—he seemed dreadfully out of temper—Mrs. Riley was having words with him—her brother, a man named Brady, was there—I had heard words between the prisoner Brady and Mrs. Riley, and I heard the prisoner try<lb/>ing to lock his gate—I did not see Mrs. Riley hit the prisoner in the face, or see Brady with a brick in his hand—I heard a noise and scuffle in Riley's house before they came out—I had not previously noticed the prisoner being annoyed by persons in the court—I have several times seen him in<lb/>toxicated on a Saturday night—never at any other time—when not intoxi<lb/>cated he was a very quiet peaceable man, but when intoxicated very quar<lb/>relsome and noisy.</p>

               <p>5, Hands Court—on the morning of the 8th September, about half-past twelve, I saw the prisoner in his own garden—he was having words with Mrs. Riley—he called to her and said, "Mary, come here"—she said, "No, I am not that fool"—he again called her "Mary," and she said, "Have not I got a name? why don't you call me Mrs. Riley? put the knife away, you fool, and come out and fight with your fists like a man"—she was in the court, and he was inside his own gate with the gate shut—his wife came out to endeavour to get him to bed—she had a candle in her hand—he told her to take that light away, or he would serve her the same—he again called Mrs. Riley, and said, "Come here, dear, and I will stab you like that," plunging the knife into the gate—she up with her hand and gave him a clout in the eye, saying, "Take that, you fool, and go in and go to bed"—it was a backhander across the eyes—with that the deceased man got vexed and walked down the court, saying, "I will quiet him," and he said, "Morgan, are you mad? do you know what you are doing?"—the prisoner said, "I will stab the first b----that comes in here"—the deceased said, "You won't stab me, will you, poor Ben Groves?"—he said, "I will rip the guts of the first that comes in here"—Groves opened the gate and went in—I turned to my husband to go and help, and while I was doing so Mrs. Groves ran down to bring her husband back—I said, "Is he stabbed?" and she said, "Yes," and she took him into his own house.</p>

I shall not answer you unless you call me by my proper name; I am a married woman, the same as your wife"—he said, "I have got the knife and I will stab you"—I was about two yards or two yards and a half from him at the time—there was no one near him but myself when he said he would stab me—I up with the back of my hand and gave him a slap in the face, and said, "Go in, you fool; you won't hurt me, for I shan't come as far as your gate"—Brady, my brother, stood behind me—I did not know he was there, but as I turned round I saw him standing there—I pushed him up the court, and as I did so I saw the deceased standing by my shoulder—I said to him, "Mr. Groves, your assistance is not wanted, because he will not hurt me; go back to your apartment," but he shoved me out of his road and went inside Morgan's gate—I came away and did not see anything more.</p>

On the night of the 1st Sep<lb/>tember I was on duty in Brummeirs Buildings, High Street, Clapham, and in consequence of a communication made to me I went into the High Street—I saw the four prisoners there, with a lot more—it was a quarter-past eleven—they were singing and making a noise—Reasy, another police constable, was there—I told them we wanted them to go away quietly, and not have any disturbance at that time of night—we followed them down the street; Taylor said something I could not understand—when we got to Nelson's Row they all stopped; I again said, "I want you to go away quietly"—Gear turned round and said, "What the b----h—is the matter?"—Reasy then took a man into custody, and I went into the road to assist in taking him to the station; as soon as I had got to the prisoner Till rushed upon me and knocked me down with his fist—Gear and Taylor then rushed upon me, and I was up and down five or six times; I drew my truncheon, and we had a tussle—an omnibus came up from London, and several gentlemen came to our assistance—the prisoners all went towards White's Square—Reasy still had the man in custody, and we were taking him towards the station; we had got about 200 yards, and when near Manor Street I turned round and saw fifteen or twenty people coming after us, and among them were the prisoners—some of them were picking up stones—Gear was in his shirt-sleeves—I went to Taylor and said, "Soldier, you are a man different from the rest, you ought to assist us, and not act in the way you are doing"—at that time some one knocked my helmet off—I turned round and Taylor said, "Yes, you b—, I will;" and he struck me on the side of the head with the buckle end of his belt—that staggered me—I stepped back to avoid another blow, and slipped down on the pavement—when on my back Taylor, Gear, and Till rushed upon me—Taylor said, "Kill the b----now he is down"—I was turned over on my belly, and I became insensible—I received several kicks on my back—Taylor had the belt twisted round his hand, it was about three feet long—I distinctly saw it in bis hand—when I recovered from my insensi<lb/>bility I was at the station; Mr. Parrott, the surgeon, was sent for—I have known Till and Martin for years—the whole affair lasted about a quarter of an hour—I had an opportunity of seeing Taylor as this occurred under a lamp—there was only one soldier there, and he had a cap on when in the High Street, but in Manor Street he had no cap.</p>

On Sunday night, the 1st Sep<lb/>tember, I was on duty in Clapham—I saw Taylor, Gear, and John Martin standing on the pavement, using very abusive language—they went towards the Plough, where they commenced hallooing, shouting, and singing—I cautioned them not to make such a noise at that hour of the night—Gear and Taylor said they should do as they liked for all me, they were not insulting any one, and they should not make any difference for me—they again commenced shouting, singing, and using very abusive language—I again cautioned them not to make such a noise, and if they continued I must certainly take one or two into custody; the sailor (Gear) turned round and said, "Put your hand on me; touch me if you dare, and I will soon let you know who you are putting your hand on"—as there was not another constable near then, I did not interfere with them—they went to the top of Park Road, where they stopped several minutes, using very abusive language, loud enough to disturb the people in the street—they then went on towards White's Square, where I saw Stone on the other side of the street—I called him and then I took one man into custody—we went about twenty yards to opposite Nelson's Row, where three of the prisoners were standing; the man I had in custody called out, "Come and help me"—Taylor and Gear came at me—a man with a white slop crossed the road and struck Stone, and they fell together in the road—I cannot say whether that man is here—I was struggling with the man I had in custody—at that time an omnibus came up and several passengers came to our assistance—I was going to the station, and had got about 200 yards down the Manor Road, nearly opposite the Manor Arms, where from fifteen to twenty men came after us—Gear, Taylor, and Martin were there—I can positively swear to them—I heard Stone say to Taylor, "Soldier, you are a different man from any of the rest, you ought to assist us rather than fight against us"—Taylor made use of a very foul expression, and said, "Yes, I will"—he had something in his hand which appeared to me like a belt, with which he struck Stone over the head, and staggered him—Martin was near me with his arm up, and appeared to be throwing stones—some one seized me by the hair of my head, dragged me from one side of the road to the other, struck me violently in my face several times, and I received a kick which rendered me quite insensible, and my prisoner escaped—Martin I have known three or four years, and Taylor I saw iu Brummets Passage on Sunday morning, between four and five, with a female—I haw seen him several times—I had seen Gear several times—I did not see any other soldier there but Taylor.</p>
