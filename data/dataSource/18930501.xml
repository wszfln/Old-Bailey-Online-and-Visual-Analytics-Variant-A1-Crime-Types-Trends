                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I live at 28, Mortimer Market—on the 13th April I was with the prisoner and the witness Bendolf at the Harmonic Club—I was there about half an hour—the prisoner, Bendolf, and I lodged and slept in the same room—I had five German 100-mark notes in my possession—I saw them safe at four the same evening—I had them in a pocket-book in an inner pocket of my coat—when I went to bed I put my clothes on a chair in the same room—I went to sleep—I awoke at two o'clock and went into my own room, and put my clothes on my chair—at six I awoke, and went to the room of my friend Bendolf—the prisoner was then downstairs—I remained in the room two minutes—I then went back to my room and looked at my pocket, and then I dis<lb/>covered that the five 100-mark notes had been taken, and five marks remained in the pocket-book—the prisoner afterwards came into Bendolf a room—I told Bendolf I was robbed, and Bendolf told the prisoner—he said, "You can search me"—Bendolf said I ought to inform the police about it—I then went with the landlady of the house to the police<lb/>station, and gave information of my loss; that was about half-past seven in the morning—I have not recovered my money—no one slept in my room but myself—I locked my door when I went to bed—I had been out that evening with Bendolf to different places; he paid for me—the prisoner was not with us—I had not shown the prisoner my notes, but one day I gave him a leaf out of my pocket-book, and on that occasion he saw them—my pocket-book is at home.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I last saw the prisoner in the forenoon before missing my money, between 10 and 11—I had been out with Bendolf, and met Tryon at the club—I had not been drinking much, perhaps I had a glass more than was good for me—Tryon told me I ought not to live in the</p>

I am a hairdresser, at 68, Cleveland Street—I know the prosecutor and the prisoner—he is a hairdresser; we used to work together two years ago—we had no quarrel, we have been friendly—on the 15th of last month he spoke to me at our club about Humbel's money, that he had from 600 to 700 marks in his pocket, and as soon as he got a chance he would get it—he said he had got a place to bring it to, where nobody could find it—that same night I met him and Humbel leaving together—I did not exactly tell Humbel what the prisoner had said, but I warned him and also Bendolf—the prisoner said at the same time that he took Humbel's money he would take Bendolf a watch and chain; this was the night before at the club—Humbel did not take any notice of it—he had had a glass too much, but Bendolf recollected it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This conversation took place at the club between two and three, in the dining-room—there were five or six other persons present, but they could not hear what was said; we were sitting at another table—I did not mention the prisoner's name to Humbel, I only warned him to be careful—I said, "You are living in a very dangerous house, and you had better look out for another room; something might happen in the house where you are living"—I did not know anything about the house; I had been there the day before the robbery with the prisoner; he took me there—I was not at work at that time—I am now.</p>

I am a hairdresser—at the time of this alleged occur<lb/>rence I lived at 28, Mortimer Market, where the prisoner also occupied a room—on a Friday evening, I don't recollect the date, I was with the pro<lb/>secutor at the Harmonic Club—Tryon made a communication to me there about the prisoner—I left at half-past eleven o'clock and returned home with the prosecutor, who slept in my bed—the prisoner also occupied the same room—at two o'clock in the morning the prosecutor left and went to his own room—I next saw the prosecutor at half-past six in my room—the prisoner got up at six o'clock; I asked him what was the reason he got up so early, there was no newspaper to be got yet—he said he must go downstairs—the prosecutor had not risen then—when the prisoner came back from downstairs I said I was quite astonished at his coming back already, and then the prosecutor came over to my bed and laid down, and the prisoner said to the prosecutor, "It is too early; don't get up yet"—I presume he went downstairs to ease himself; it seemed to me he was away an unreasonably short time—at seven o'clock he went down<lb/>stairs the second time to get a newspaper—the prosecutor came and told me his money was stolen, and I said to the prisoner, "We two only know that Humbel had some money"—the prisoner said, "I don't know that the man had any money"—he offered to be searched, because I said nobody should leave the house before he was searched—the prisoner said he had to leave—he was not searched, I don't know why—I suppose he</p>

               <p>went to get the newspaper; he used to come back with it, but he did not return—at four o'clock we met him at the Harmonic Club—I then said, "Why did you leave? It is very inconvenient to both of us, because we two were sleeping in the same room with the prosecutor"—then the prisoner and Humbel had an altercation, and Humbel said, "I don't mind losing £5 if I only could get the remainder of my money back"—I asked the prisoner why he did not stay in the house in the morning; he ought not to have gone away—he said, "I have nothing to do with the whole matter"—he said first, "I have to mind my business"—I had a watch and chain—I did not lose my watch on this occasion I was out of employment and had to pawn it.</p>

I am divisional surgeon of police, at 56, Albany Street—at 1 o'clock on April 10th I was called to the station—I saw Phœbe Hunt suffering from two wounds on her right hand, one on the back of the middle finger and the other on the palm surface of the ring finger, each about one and a quarter inch long, jagged, incised, and bleeding freely—they might have been done in a struggle—this knife might have caused them—Eliza Hunt was. suffering from a contused wound on the right temple; it must have required some force and could have been done by the blade of a knife—she had another wound on her right shoulder but I did not hear of that for twelve or fifteen hours afterwards, she made no complaint to me at the time; it was a sharp superficial cut, and may not have pained her at first—the wound on Phœbe Hunt's fingers has cut through the nerves of the fingers and has caused inflammation and probably fixation of the fingers for life; one finger will be out of shape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his statement before the Magistrate, said that he had reason to do it, as the girl's father took him to the house for a night's lodging; that the girl accused him of stealing 10s. 6d., and said he was not to come in, and that he saw her cousin lying with her on the bed and could not stand it.</hi>

I lived at 154, Barnsbury Road—I am a draper's assistant—on this night I was with French; we were both sober—we were walking along, and as we got into Parkfield Street, by a lodging house, we saw eight or twelve men standing at the corner—we took no notice, but all of a sudden two men came round, and one deliberately struck French a severe blow on the side of the face and knocked him down, knocking his hat off and his pipe out of his mouth—I went to pick up his hat and pipe when Rose knocked me down—when I got up I saw three or four covering French, who said, "You have not got it?—I said, "Have they taken it?"—he said, "Yes," but instead of taking the watch and chain they had only taken the chain from the bar to the curb—I went to fetch a constable—the man I saw taking French's chain is not in custody—when the chain was stolen Stocks was near French—I did not see him strike him—eight or ten men were round Stocks then, and as soon as the chain was stolen the signal was given and they all made a rush for the door of the lodging-house—Rose struck me near the gas lamp, where French had been knocked down—I saw Rose's face quite distinctly, and I am positive of him—I went for a policeman and met one at the corner of Liverpool Road, and he went with me and two more policemen to this lodging-house—in the kitchen there might have been twenty or thirty men; it was a thorough den of thieves and we were rather nervous—French first identified Stocks, and I turned and saw Rose almost sitting down at my back, and I said, "This is the man that struck me"—I recognised him without any hesitation—he said nothing—when Stocks was identified he only said we had made a mistake.</p>

I am a confectioner, of 77, Cadogan Villas, Victoria Park—on Saturday night, 22nd April, I was at the corner of Tottenham Court Road, about eleven, going to take the omnibus to Broad Street Station—twenty five or thirty people were also waiting for the omnibus—I tried to push onto the omnibus, and I felt a pressure coming round me, and three lingers were put in my pocket—it was an old silver watch which had belonged to my father, and fitted my pocket tightly—I dropped my hand and said, "Scoundrel! what are you trying to do?"—I saw Jones, and was going for him with my stick, and a gentleman put his hand on him—a detective took him into custody—I am sure Jones is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Jones</hi>. There were twenty-five or thirty people all round me; more than ten were on my left hand side—I cannot say exactly how many were on my right; it may have been ten—you were on my right; you touched my pocket to see if I had something—I had two watches, a gold and a silver one—my coat was open—you were next to me—it was very dark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Saville</hi>. I did not see you there—the charge was booked against Jones before you got into the station-house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant E</hi>). On Saturday night, 22nd April, about eleven o'clock, I was at the junction of Tottenham Court Road and New Oxford Street with Sergeant Morgan—I saw the two prisoners standing on the outskirts of a large crowd of persons who were endeavouring to get on to an omnibus going towards the City—I saw Jones feeling the back part of ladies' dresses; there were three or four women and several men there—Saville was standing close behind him, and apparently covering his actions—neither of them made any attempt to get on the omnibus—that omnibus drove away, and another one came up—the prisoners repeated their actions—that omnibus drove away, and another pulled up, and the prisoners repeated their actions—on each occasion Jones was covered by Saville—Saville turned and saw me watching, and I and Morgan walked into Tottenham Court Road and stood in the doorway of the brewery round the corner—I was not in uniform—the prisoners and a third man came to the corner to look after us, but did not see us—they crossed Tottenham Court Road to the west corner, and remained there five minutes—an omnibus came along at a rather rapid rate; a number of persons from the Oxford Music Hall followed it, and the prisoners followed the crowd, and when the omnibus stopped at the east corner of Tottenham Court Road, Jones placed himself on the prosecutor's left side and Saville covered him—I saw Jones put his arm round Denny, and at the same moment someone called out, "You scoundrel! you have attempted to steal my watch," or words to that effect—Saville turned round at the same moment and ran into the road and towards Seven Dials—I caught him; he clung to a lamp-post—I said, "I am an officer; I shall arrest you for attempting to steal a gentleman's watch in the crowd"—I looked round and saw Jones in Morgan's custody, and I said, "I have been watching you for some time"—he refused to let go of the lamp-post, and I had to get assistance—the prisoners were taken to the station—I asked</p>

               <p>Saville for his address—he said, "I have none"—I said, "Where, did you sleep last night?"—he said, "At a common lodging-house in Seven Dials"—I said, "You did not require a City omnibus to take you to Seven Dials"—he said, "I know nothing of that, and I know nothing of that person," pointing to Jones—Jones gave as his address a common lodging house in the Whitechapel Road.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant D</hi>). I was with Caine on this night—I kept observation upon the prisoners—I saw them moving about in a suspicious manner—when an omnibus going eastward pulled up they placed themselves on the outskirts of the crowd as though they were going to get on it, but they made no attempt to do so, and Jones acted in a suspicious manner behind the persons, covered by Saville—afterwards they both crossed to the west side of Tottenham Court Road, and when an omnibus came eastward a number of persons followed it and attempted to get on, and the prisoners, and another man we had seen with them, ran on, and I saw Jones get behind the prosecutor, covered again by Saville, and immediately I heard the prosecutor call out, "You have attempted to take my watch—Jones tried to go eastward—Saville ran into the road—I am sure I saw Jones's arm round the prosecutor—I took Jones, and said, "You will have to go to the station for attempting to steal this gentleman's watch"—he said, "I have done nothing; I was only attempting to get into the omnibus"—lie clung to the rails, and I had considerable difficulty in getting him to the station—he made no effort to get on to the omnibus—when charged at the station he said, "I don't know that man," referring to Saville.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gas stoker, of 48, Winchester Street, Caledonian Road, Islington—on Saturday evening, April 22nd, between six and seven I was in Winchester Street, and saw a four-wheeled wagon with one horse driven by the prisoner; another person was in the van with him—the prisoner appeared to be standing, leaning against the side. of the van—it was going at an ordinary jog-trot, about four miles an hour—as the van was turning the corner a little child about seven or eight crossed the road towards the van, which knocked him down and ran over him; he was right in the middle of the road—it seemed to be darting right under the wheels, and could not get out of the way—there were no other vehicles about—there were people about on the different kerbs—I think it was either the shaft or the fore-wheel that struck the child—the driver did not seem to be aware of what happened; he did not stop till somebody shouted; he drew up at once—I went up and told him to stop, that he had run over a child and must wait till a policeman came—he said "I did not know anything about it; I will stop"—he did stop, and was taken into custody—he had been drinking, but was not drunk; in my opinion he was able to do his work.</p>

I am the wife of David McDonald, of 37, Eresby Road, Kilburn—the prisoner and his wife lodged with me—early in the morning of 11th April I was in bed, and heard the last witness screaming on the stairs, "There is a fire; come quickly!"—my husband ran downstairs and saw smoke coming through the cracks of the front parlour door, and flames coming through the lower panels and over the door—the prisoner had occupied that room—the door was locked and I had the key—I went upstairs for it and opened it, but shut the door directly, the smoke was so dense—my husband got water and threw it in, and when the smoke cleared away I saw behind the door a heap of things piled up, and things about the room—the fire was out when I got in—I saw that the drawers and a desk had been on fire and part of the things on the bed—the flames had come through the door in two separate places—The prisoner was supposed to have left on the previous Saturday, the 8th—he was there on the Sunday, in and out once or twice—his week was out on the Saturday, but his wife was not well, and she asked if I would let her stay till Monday—she then left, and after she had gone the prisoner came in the afternoon—I let him in, and he tried the handle of the door—I said I had the key—he said, "Shall I get it?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I must get in," but he did not—I did not see him again till the following morning, after the fire; he was on the pavement then with three officers and my husband—I said, "You broke in at the window last night and lit the fire in the grate?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You took the drawers and all the inflammable things round the room and piled them in a heap and set them on fire?" and he said, "Yes.</p>

I am a groom, living at 85, York Street, Westminster—about half-past ten p. m. on 18th April I drove home with a friend, Jones, and on reaching my house I got out of the trap to go to the pony's head—there was a row in the street between the prisoners and others—I was standing about a yard from the pony's head when Stanbrook came up to me and used filthy language, and asked me what I wanted—I said, "Nothing"—he said, "Do you want to fight?"—I said, "No"—he put his hands under my coat and threw it back half-way over my shoulders, and then he struck me in the chest—I ran back and took off my coat, and threw it in the trap—Stanbrook ran at me, and caught my legs and threw me to the ground, and while I was on the ground Mahoney came up, and kicked me in the ribs—I felt a snatch at my watch, and I got up and said, "I have lost my watch"—both my watch and chain had gone—I looked at Stanbrook, and saw my chain hanging out of his left-hand trousers pocket—he said, "You can search me—I saw him pass it to Mahoney—I went after Mahoney, and held him with my two hands while my wife took my watch out of his left-hand trousers pocket—then I knocked Mahoney down to keep him quiet, as there was such a rough gang round—the gang took him away—a constable arrived, and I gave him a description of Stanbrook, and accompanied him to the Prince of Wales public-house—he knocked at the door, which was either locked or bolted—it was about a quarter to eleven—they asked who was there; he said "A constable"—the door was opened, and we went in—in the first bar there were about a dozen men—I said Stanbrook was not there—the constable asked the landlord if there were any more in his house—the landlord said "No"—the constable said he would make it his business to look, and went into the second bar; there was no one there—he went into the third bar, a little bar, and there stood Stanbrook alone—I said, "That is the man that took my watch"—the constable took him into custody and told him the charge—I could pick him out of all the men in London—I cannot say if the landlord from where he stood could see the bar where Stanbrook was—he was the only person in that third bar—I saw no sailor in York Street.</p>

I have only got one arm, and you have only got one arm"—you struck the man and knocked him down.</p>

"Do you think the baby will die?"—I said, "I am afraid it will"—she said, "If he does not die, I suppose he will be marked for life"—I said, "I think so"—about five minutes afterwards she put her hand to her chest, and said, "I have been taking some liniment, which is hurting my chest like lead"—I asked her what kind of liniment it was—she said "Such as we use for chilblains"—I then sent for the doctor—she said it was in a white bottle marked "Poison"—she said, "I wish I had not done it now"—the doctor came and treated her, and gave her an emetic.</p>

               <p>with this family on 10th May, 1892—I went there to vaccinate the baby—the next time I called was on 25th July—I then found that the prisoner had her throat cut—the wound was about four inches long and deep on the left side—I put in three stitches—she lost a great quantity of blood—I attended her up to 17th September—I saw her again in October, and attended her from 25th October to the 3rd November.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I went in July I found she had attempted suicide—I thought she was not safe to be at large from that time—I thought she ought to have been put in an asylum at once—I expressed that opinion repeatedly to her husband—in November she was suffering from great depression and melancholia—she appeared very anxious to do everything she could for her children; at the same time she did not feel able to do anything; that was part of her mania—there was no reason for it—she seemed to have the idea to do everything for them, but was not able to do anything, that it was a hopeless case to do anything for them—that increased the melancholia and depression—she was perfectly able to do it, but she had the idea in her own mind that she could not do it; it was purely an idea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. She was very gloomy and always depressed, and she appeared so even before she cut her throat—when I vaccinated the child she was somewhat in that way—she was an affectionate woman, not emotional; there was not much emotion about her, she was too dull—her thoughts seemed always of her children—a confinement sometimes makes a woman liable to mental disorder; it would aggravate anything existing—I know nothing about her last confinement—persons suffering from an attack of melancholy often get homicidal mania.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. WARNER</hi>. I am superintendent of Peckham Asylum—the prisoner was admitted there in November, 1892—I saw her while there—she came as a boarder—it was my duty to examine her, to ascertain if she was sufficiently sane to remain as a boarder or as a patient—I came to the conclusion that she was so insane that it was not safe for her to remain as a boarder, so I wrote to her husband that I could not certify for her—I doubt if he received my letter; but he called, and we had some conversation on the subject—her symptoms were those of melancholia, very pronounced; a dull, depressed condition, very marked—I thought she ought to have been under restraint, and I wrote to that effect to the Commissioners to explain the circumstances of her being there—I stated then that she was suicidally disposed, and I advised her being re-certified—I don't know that I heard much of her history, but it is very common for melancholia to lead to an extreme case—she was not certified when she came, but she came with the consent of the Commissioners of Lunacy as a boarder—I produce the paper on which we received her.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. Coming to the asylum, the Commissioners give their consent without examination; it is our business to certify—this is not a certificate, simply a sanction to allow her to be a boarder under a certain amount of supervision, and if it is not sufficient it is our business to notify that fact—probably a relative would get the patient herself to sign an application to the Commissioners, asking their consent; and if they are satisfied that she knows what she is doing, and that it is quite voluntary on her part, she is allowed to come to us; at the same time</p>

               <p>they warn us—I do not think they examined her; in some cases they do, but I doubt if they always do—if she comes on her own application she can leave when she pleases, at twenty-four hours' notice—the Commissioners get to know who comes to the house, and under what circumstances.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the witness's promissory note for</hi> £210, <hi rend="italic">payable four weeks after date, had been presented that day and dishonoured, and requested immediate payment</hi>.)</p>

               <p>—when I read that I said, "The letter says the bill is payable here; I am very short of money, and I have signed this, but you have nothing to do with it; my wife will pay"—I think he came at two o'clock and left at 4. 30 or five o'clock—that was Saturday—on Monday I went to Scotland Yard—on the Tuesday I went to the office of Messrs. Lovell, Son, and Pitfield, and saw this document: "Four days after date I promise to pay the Rev. J. Massis, or order, £210, at my residence, 25, Duncan Terrace, Islington. E. <hi rend="smallCaps">COULET</hi>"—that is not my signature and not my name, nor did I give anybody authority to sign it—I had never seen it before—I know the writing, "J.

Coulet, Manager"—I never in my life signed a promissory note in favour of Mr. Massis.</p>

France—I have a letter from him in which he says if he recovers he will send me a cheque for it—Massis did not advance £50, nor did he give it to my mother as he promised—he did not send me to the Grand Hotel de Normandie two bank notes, one for £20 and one for £10; Ransetti paid me—I wrote this: "Thanking you a thousand times for all your kindness, my dear Mr. Massis, I beg to remain, with friendship, your devoted <hi rend="smallCaps">COLET</hi>"—I was grateful to him for the trouble he took—this is my letter of August 1st, 1891—he had not then lent me £50—he sent me a cheque for £30 and said, "Don't pay this cheque to the bank for fifteen days, and when you do, advise me"—he did not advance me £40 on August 1st—he owed me money, and he sent me a cheque—he is a poor man, and so am I—he was going to give Madame Colet £10 on the expectation of Ransetti paying me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque for £40 of August 18th, which I received—Massis has never advanced money to my wife—this cheque for £17 4s. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is drawn to Madame Colet or bearer—my mother never had an account at the Union Bank of London—Massis did not advance £25 to my mother on November 9th, or £21 to me on 14th December—those figures amount to £153—this is my signature to this receipt, but somebody has scratched something out and put this in—this £153 is forged—I think it was £15, but by my book it is £35—I said before the Magistrate that I thought it was £15 or £16—I said, "On 15th May I did not receive £153 from the prisoner, I received from him about that time £15 or £16 for the Firewood Company"—that is true—I had not received anything more than £15 or £16 up to that date—I said, "In my opinion the figure 3 has been added to the £15"—that is my opinion now—I had seen the receipt for half a minute when I gave that evidence, but I cannot remember a year ago—it is now: "Received from the Philanthropic Institution, £35 11s."—that is all that had been received up to that date—I cannot remember entering receipts for Massis for the Philanthropic Firewood Company, amounting to £62 10s.—I joined the institution as manager in 1892—I had then received letters sending me £1 or so, but I had nothing to do with the institution up to that time—this account is</p>

Gillie—the firewood institution was started by Massis for the employment of the poor in chopping wood—he bought wood, they chopped it up, and he sold it to defray some of the costs—the business never paid its expenses—Mr. Massis put £300 in once, and perhaps more than that—he purchased a cargo for £600—it was not arranged between me and him that he should pay £300, and that the other £300 should come from the receipts of the wood when sold—if I had money I should have had to pay the other half, but I had no money—the other £300 was not to be paid for by the receipts for the sale of the wood, if there were any—the receipts were not all to go into my pocket—I received the money and bought everything that was required—I cannot say where the profits, if there were any, were to go to—£200 or £300 was owing to me by the committee after paying the expenses, money which I had advanced—it was my money—I only received one month's salary from the company; £12 10s., I think—I lent the committee £45 10s. and more than £100 several times, I have put money from my own pocket to the cash to pay the expenses—I have grown poor since—I did not instruct my solicitor not to let you look at the books—he said, "You must not give the books to Mr. Massis without the order of the committee," and that was given—Massis did not advance £24 to Madame Colet on August 12th; this is her writing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but he was bound to my mother—on September 17th, 1892, £20 was advanced to me, and partly paid by cheque, £412s.; the solicitor has got the letter—I suppose Massis did pay a further sum of £164 for the purchase of the cargo, making £464; I am not prepared to dispute that—the money I received from customers is all in the Firewood Company's books—I called on Mr. Massis several times when Madame Vitu was there, but I did not mention in her presence that I owed Massis £147, nor did I say, "I will give you a bill for 'it," nor did Massis say, "Very well, that will suit me," nor did I then hand him a bill—I did not go to Massis's in January and say, "I have come to see you about the bill"—I did not say, "I have not the means to meet it"—Madame Vitu was not present, nor did she say, "Well, I may consider it arranged for two months"—on the evening of the day of my mother's arrest I went to Massis's house—Madame Vitu was there and several other people—I did not say in her presence, "It is impossible for me to meet the bill, my mother has gone away"—I did not say that I wanted money for her—I know Mr. Bardan—he is the man who drew Ransetti's bill—I did not tell her In August, 1891, that I had a bill drawn by Ransetti which had not</p>

               <p>Philanthropic—Colet told me that the principal thing was to. get the Consistory Court to their side, and to get Mr. Massis away—at the beginning of January Colet told me that there was something else he had heard about Mr. Massis, and they had some bills of exchange that Gillies and Colet had given to Massis, and if it did not succeed he would blow Massis's brains out—he said so in the presence of my wife; she is not in Court—about February 20th Colet said that there was something much more serious—I asked him what it was—he said he only wanted one document to get Massis ten years' imprisonment, and offered me some money to find some letters or any evidence, and if I found anything he would take me down to his solicitor—when I saw all these manoeuvres going on against Massis I asked him if he had signed anything (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Colet told me that he and Mr. Gillies were going to get up some evidence against Mr. Massis—I did not think it of much consequence at the moment, because I did not believe they would do it—M. Colet did not say what charge was going to be made against Massis, he said he was looking for letters—I made no note of what he said—it was the interview at the beginning of January that my wife was present at—she is not here, but I think she is coming—I do not remember telling Mr. White that my wife was present at the interview—in a moment of anger M. Colet said that he would blow out Mr. Massis's brains, as he had some papers of his—it was about February 24th that Colet said he only wanted one more document—I fix that date because it was about the time that the workshop was closed, and there was no business—I did not know on April 4th that Mr. Massis was going to be arrested—I do not know that police officer (<hi rend="italic">Sexton</hi>)—Sexton said in my presence that he was a police officer, and he blew his whistle in my presence, and came to the door and asked me several questions—I did not kick him, I took hold of him when he was going to take hold of Madame Massis, when he opened the door and pushed her, and they took hold of her, and told her they were police—when he told me he was a police officer I let go of him—I did not kick him after that: when he said he was a police officer he came inside and I went away—I did not know that the police came there to arrest Massis; they said they came there to inspect the chapel, and they were told it was not the day—I had no desire to prevent their taking Mr. Massis; I did not know they came for that purpose—I was manager of the Philanthropic before I was foreman, and when I gave in my resignation M. Colet became managing director, I do not know why; I know he offered £50 when he became my successor—nobody asked me to remember these, questions, when I heard of the thing I went to Massis—I have discussed it with him on several occasions since he was arrested—I was at the Police-court.</p>

I am employed by the Great Western Railway Company at the goods depot at Smithfield—about half-past two p. m. on 6th April my attention was called to a Great Eastern van, No. 908, which was full, and next to it was another Great Eastern van, empty—between them a Great Eastern man in uniform was stooping to look underneath the full van—I could not identify that man, because he went away rather sharp—he asked me what I was looking for, if I had lost anything, and then went on to the platform—I walked back about five yards to the person who had called my attention, and presently we heard something fall down—I went back and looked under the van, found a packet of these table jellies under the van 908, and looking further I saw some more packets behind this rope sack, which was on the ground, between the hind wheels, right underneath the van—it contained these packets—I handed the things over to the policeman on duty—I cannot say if the sack was there when I was there before; I did not look the first time—I was only away a couple of minutes.</p>

I am a van guard in the Great Eastern Railway Company's employment—on 6th April I was working with the. prisoner Smith, who drove the van—about half-past twelve we took a load of goods from Bishopsgate, and arrived at Smithfield about one—among other things we took cases of preserves—Clifton and Saville also came from Bishopsgate on that day, each with a loaded van, and our three vans arrived at Smithfield about the same time, and backed in against he bank—Saville was next to us; Clifton was not—my mate said, "Unload the van, Joe"—I unloaded half the van, and then my mate and Clifton came into the van, and Clifton told his boy Wood to take me to have some dinner—I did not go, but Wood did—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw Clifton tapping at a case in our van, and then I saw him put something like a brown-paper parcel under the bib of his apron,</p>

               <p>which is like a kind of coffee sack, and then he got out of the van and, went away, and did not come back for four or five minutes, when he helped my mate Smith to unload the rest of the load—all this time I was. talking to Saville's boy.</p>

It was about half-past one when we got to Smithfield, and then, after backing the vans in, Clifton and Smith, and Winter, another Great Eastern carman, went to a public-house—they were away some little time, and while they were away I was unloading our van—I had got half-way through the load when they came back again—I did not see the cases in which these things were in the van while I was unloading—the cases in which I think they were up in the front of the load—I think they were nailed down—I don't know if they were corded—I have read the evidence I gave at the Police-court, not several times—what Clifton put in his apron looked like a brown-paper parcel;, I don't know if it was a handerchief, or what it was—it might very likely have been his handkerchief—when I heard the tapping noise I was. talking to Saville's boy—I saw nothing in Clifton's hand when I heard' the tapping—he had a loose carman's apron—all carmen wear articles of' that kind—these packages would have to be moved from the top of the van to the tailboard; I saw Clifton lift them out—the checker and caller out were outside—the caller-out stands on the bank at the back of the van, and the checker three or four yards from him—as an article is handed out from the back of the van the caller-out calls it out to the checker, who checks it off on the sheet, so that the caller-out sees everything that comes out of the van and calls it out to the checker—all I saw when I heard the tapping was Smith putting the things at the back—I said at the Police-court, "I looked, but could not see anything; Clifton was assisting Smith to unload when I heard the tapping"—Clifton's apron was in the same loose state when he got into the van; it is always loose about him, but when he gets up and drives sometimes it is buckled—I said at the Police-court, "I did not think there was anything wrong at the time"—I did not speak to anyone about it then, or that day—it sounded like something hard that Clifton tapped the case with; I could not see what he had in his hand—I was outside Smith's van talking to Saville's boy, and could not see through the side of the van—next day I told a Great Eastern inspector about it—our head foreman took me down to our office, and he asked me questions—he asked me whether I heard anything going on in the van—I said I did not take notice of anything wrong at that time—I have seen our inspector outside here—I was not questioned downstairs at Bishopsgate—when we arrived at Smithfield on this day, and the carmen went to the public-house, only me and the men unloading were left in charge—carmen sometimes help each other to unload, so that we can get away quick—as a rule we go to dinner about half-past one or two if we have unloaded; we generally go to dinner when we get home to Bishopsgate—I have got my dinner with me now—we take half an hour for dinner to rest and amuse ourselves—the gentleman who questioned me did not mention the word suspicious—I said at the Police-court that Clifton's movements were rather suspicious in the van—I saw him moving in the van, and he was stooping down like this—he would have to do that sometimes—I could see the top part of him, but not what he was doing, through the side of the van.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Constable, Great Western Railway</hi>). On the morning of the 7th April I looked round in the roadway near the edge of the platform, in the part reserved for the Great Eastern vans, and near the van banks—there was room there for four vans—I found this parcel, which I gave to Austen—it was being swept up with rubbish and straw.</p>

I found it under where Clifton's van had stood on the day previous—I should say his van stood more than four off Smith's—the parcel was under the edge of the platform or bank—generally there is considerable accumulation of rubbish after the vans have left—one man starts at midnight to clear the rubbish up, but when I found the parcel the next morning this part had not been swept; the</p>

               <p>man had not done as far—he works all night—the parcel was covered with loose straw and rubbish; there is a certain amount of straw and rubbish on the ground—after unloading cases straw would be the principal rubbish left—it was the man's duty to sweep it up—he began at the other end, and had not swept this end at all—the bank he has to sweep is about thirty yards long—I found the parcel about half-past eight a. m.—there might be a great many vans there after half-past one and two. In the day—I do not know that there are a great number of sacks marked "condemned "lying about for things to be put into—it takes the man all night to sweep, because the vans are backed to the platform and stand there all night, and he cannot sweep behind them till seven in the morning—before this parcel was found Clifton's van had gone, and one of our vans had backed in—I could not say if that Great Western van was there when Clifton's van was there, or if it was backed in immediately after Clifton's Van had left—I did not see it backed in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman in the Great Eastern Railway Company's employment—I came with a load to Smithfield, arriving there about one o'clock on 6th April—I backed my van in next to Smith's—I might have had conversation with the prisoners while Smith's van was being unloaded—I could not say what it was about—all I saw was Clifton helping Smith to unload—I sat on the tailboard of my van—I believe Clifton's van pulled out before I was unloaded—I met the prisoners afterwards at a public-house at the top of Smithfield Hill—we four carmen went and had a drink together at twenty minutes to four, I daresay it was—when I went out of the goods yard I was spoken to by a Great Western policeman; I was alone then—I said to the three carmen in the public-house that the policeman downstairs had found three packets of jellies underneath my van, and I said to them, "I don't know anything about any jellies;" and Smith, I believe, said, "You ought to look fat on jellies, Denny"—that is what they call me—the prisoners and I went to another public-house, the fourth man left us—I brought up the same thing, and one of them I could not say which) said, "It was a fair bowl"—we called for another drink, and the conversation was chiefly then with the barmaid about two dogs; nothing more was said about the jelly business—I had not seen the sack before the policeman spoke to me about it, when the prisoners were not there—he did not show me any sack, and I did not speak to the prisoners about it—they said to me in the second public-house, "If there had not been a hole in the sack the three packets of jellies would not have been found underneath your van"—I could not say which of them said it; we were all talking together—I said, "If it was you that done the jelly in the sack you must have been b——fools"—they made no reply—that was all the conversation.</p>

The checker and caller-out were present the whole of the time the second half of Smith's van was being unloaded, and at that time Clifton was helping Smith to unload—the caller out was outside the tailboard, standing by it—after things are taken off they are called out to the checker—if a case gets broken in transit, and a portion of the contents tumbles out, it would be signed for on the sheet as damaged at Smithfield—I should give what tumbled out to the checker or caller-out, and he would make a note on the sheet—it is the duty of the</p>

               <p>these sacks are called condemned or rope sacks; they are condemned by the company, and are almost useless except for coverings—you can get them in the stables; van boys run off with them—I don't know the names of the checker or caller-out—the checker is two or three yards or within hearing of the caller-out—he can see what leaves the caller out—we went to the public-house because the checker was engaged in checking Smith's van.</p>

We were away ten minutes, I put it down at—these sacks are unfit to hold anything, or we should not have them—I should think it was not likely you could put articles in this sack, which you knew were going to fall out at the bottom—I should think no carman would put such things in a condemned sack.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Next morning I was fetched to Bishopsgate Police office to state what I knew about the matter—nearly every Great Eastern carman carries these sacks—I was not in a position to see him unloading the van; I was in a position to see the caller-out take the goods from the tail—I was in a position to see what was done in front of the van, and should not see anything passed over the side of the van.</p>

I now live at 59, Bay Street, Bromley—I am the daughter of the prisoner Thomas—I formerly lived with my father and mother in Ottis Street—I have three brothers and four sisters—when in Ottis Street there were eight of us, all children of my mother—Mr. and Mrs. McDonald lived at No. 4, next door but one, for about six months—we were there eight years—the McDonalds had five children—I did not know of Mrs. McDonald going away, not till three months after she had; gone—I knew she did go away—my father was alive at that time, and after he died mother went into McDonald's house and looked after the children and minded the house—last December we all moved to 3, St. Leonard's Avenue, but at that time I was in service at the Fairfield Road—there were eight children living at St. Leonard's Avenue, five of McDonald's and three of ours—mother lived there with McDonald—they lived together in the same room; the back room upstairs—McDonald went out to work every day—on Sunday, 19th March, I was living at home at the time, waiting for another place—McDonald was there—mother gave us our dinner about one or half-past—she put some on her plate and ate a little piece of pudding—she did not finish her dinner, nor did the children—she went upstairs and laid down; McDonald went' upstairs after mother—about half-past <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> that afternoon I heard a baby crying—I went up, Opened the door, and looked in—mother asked what I wanted, and sent me down again—she was not in bed; she was standing—I just put my head in; I did not see any baby there—mother did not come down again that day—McDonald was in the house that night, and slept there as usual, I believe in the room where mother was—next morning he went out to work—he was a commissionaire at 111, Queen Street—he said mother wanted me to go somewhere for her—I went up and saw her, and she told me she wanted me to go to Mrs. Ellis and tell her that she wanted her; she did not say what for—Mrs. Ellis lived in the house in Ottis Street eighteen months before father died—mother was in bed when she told me—I did not notice any baby there then—I did not go to Mrs. Ellis; mother told me afterwards I need not go—I went up again as soon as 1 came in—it was about a quarter to eight when McDonald went out—I saw no baby then, but I saw something moving under the clothes, and I asked mother if she thought she could hide it away from me, and I turned the clothes down and looked at it; she told me to leave it alone—little Bose McDonald was with me at the time, and she took the baby out of the bed, and we said it was ugly and we did not want it—we were arguing over the name it was to have—we told her we would sit on it, and she said she would save us the trouble; when she got up she would do so—mother said its name was to be Ernest Thomas McDonald—she said that Mr. McDonald said if he heard anything about the baby in the street he would break our b——necks—I noticed that the baby had a few little white pimples on its nose, and the face was rather yellow—mother pointed out one of its finger nails and said, "This is a sign of children having fits"—it was rather dark—I said we would take it out</p>

I am an export merchant, of Lauderdale Buildings,' Aldersgate Street—William Barmash was my office boy for twelve months up to November 12th, 1892, and had the opportunity of knowing who our customers were—he saw documents about the office, and copied letters into the letter-book, and then posted them—I occasionally sent him to the bank to pay in cheques—I did business with Adam Pearson and Co., who have from time to time paid me, for goods received, cheques, which the younger Barmash saw—some of the letters in this order for a cheque-book from Adam Pearson and Co. are in William Barmash's writing, and the endorsement on this slip and the address I should say are his—this book is mine (<hi rend="italic">Found on William Barmash</hi>)—I never gave anybody authority to take it from my place—it contains the names and addresses of manufacturers—the name of Adam Pearson and Co. is written in it, and also "Bank of Scotland," first in pencil and then in ink.</p>

I had other clerks, but it was William Barmash's duty to copy letters, not theirs, and occasionally to clear out the office—I did not send him to pay cash into the bank, only cheques—I have seen him write more than half a dozen times—he made press copies of letters, and addressed envelopes in a good commercial hand—I can positively swear to these "p's" and to the whole words "Yours truly"—this is rather a peculiar "t"—" John Jacobs "is written on the back of this—I notice that the "p's" are quite different, and that the "I" has a loop to it—I looked at different letters and picked those out which I thought were like his writing—I was away a considerable part of the time William Barmash was there—I wrote this: "William Barmash has been in our employ twelve months; we always found him steady," etc.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier at the Bank of Scotland—on November 28th this cheque for £593 was presented for payment across the counter—it is signed "Adam Pearson and Co."—they keep an account there, and it is a very good imitation of their signature—I compared it with a cheque, and with the signature in the initial book—there is some pencil writing on the back of it, and an endorsement in ink—I did not see them written—I cashed the cheque in acceptance with the memorandum at the back (<hi rend="italic">This named the amounts of the notes to be applied for</hi>.)—the man was there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes while I went away to check the signature—I afterwards went to Paris. and saw Robinowitz—I believe he is the man.</p>

I do. not know whether it was endorsed or not when it was presented—I handed him back the cheque undoubtedly, and asked him to put on the back how he would take the money—the endorsement is in ink and the money in pencil—I said at the Police-court, "I asked the person if it represented wages; he said it did—I told him to put the amount he wanted at the back—when people come for wages they bring a written statement of how they want it, and perhaps because that was not there I may have given it back to him—if copper, silver, and gold are required they have to be specified—one of the first things I do is to see whether the endorsement is correct—I think 1 looked at the signature first, and when I looked at the endorsement 1 should very probably see the endorsement, "Silver, gold, and notes"—it was handed to me afterwards with the amount there—I am well acquainted with Adam Pearson and Co.

I am manager of the Aldgate branch of the City Bank—Solomon Barmash opened an account there on Kay 20th, 1892—he was introduced by Mr. Windsor, a solicitor, and described himself as an estate agent—he signed the address book 38, Clark Street, Sidney Square—the description is written by someone else, apparently—the third column is his own writing—he represents himself as having had no previous account—it then changes to 35, Victoria Park Road—I produce a copy of his account taken from the books of the bank, which I have examined (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

In the majority of cases the cheques were filled in by some hand other than Mr. Barmash's—I do not profess to be an expert, but I have had a good deal of experience of writing, as a cashier—the signature is the principal part which my attention would be directed to—the whole of the endorsement on cheque "U" is Barmash's writing—after looking at the signature to a cheque the first thing I should do would be to look at the endorsement—if the pencil writing was not there at the time it would not alter my opinion; I should still believe it to be his writing—I have never given evidence before with regard to hand writing—I do not speak on the ground of a general resemblance; I speak to the "s," the "t," and the "r"—I am not so certain about the capital <hi rend="italic">"</hi> T" as the small "t" in "Nots"—I never saw him fill in writing—there is no "t" in "Solomon Barmash"—there is a mistake here; there are two "t's" in Notts—there is nothing in the word "Street," but there is in the word "Stepney"—the "S" is certainly plainer on the back of the cheque, but the small "S" is the same—it is very bad writing—I suggest that the resemblance between the two is greater than I should see in the writing of 100 ordinary people; it is very peculiar—I looked at the signa<lb/>ture</p>

Mullins and Bosanquet, the solicitors for the prosecution—Abrahams has pleaded guilty here to-day—I have known him about five months, but I have not seen him very often—I never saw him and Robinowitz together in London—I used to meet Robinowitz at Kemp's, in Whitechapel—Gershon Abrahams had a restaurant—I never went there with Robinowitz—before I went to the solicitors Abrahams did not say much; he said I should oblige him, and do him a favour if I went with him—he did not say that he was going to make any money out of it—I don't know what he meant by "making a good thing".</p>

I am a brother of Major Ferguson, and own four or five racehorses"—he said Major Ferguson was in the army somewhere abroad; he wanted me to look after his horses—we spoke about wages, and he asked me if I should, want any money in advance of wages to go on with—I said I had a little, and he said, "I will give you £4 in advance of wages"—he asked me how much I should want a week—I said I should have to consider, because I had made application to get twelve months' absence of leave from the country—at London Bridge, when they collected the tickets, there was a dispute about the prisoner's ticket, which was only to Woolwich Arsenal—the prisoner said he objected to paying the excess on principle, as the booking-clerk had made a mistake—he gave his name to the porter as Major Ferguson, Victoria Hotel, Westminster—at Charing Cross I proposed that we should have refreshment; we went to Gatti's—from there the prisoner and I went to the Charing Cross Underground Railway Station, where the prisoner procured a pen from one of the messenger-boys and wrote out a cheque (which he took from a cheque-book in his pocket) on the London and County Bank for £4 in the name of Ferguson; he did not endorse it—he gave it to me and I put it in my pocket—then we went back to Gatti's, and I showed the cheque to Holmwood—after we had been there some time the prisoner proposed that we should go to the Savoy Theatre, at the same time saying that I could pay for him as he had no loose cash, and my friend could pay for himself—we went to the Savoy, and I paid, by the prisoner—I had his cheque for £4—I had a pair of gloves, a silk handkerchief, and my discharge in my outside right-hand overcoat pocket; and I had 8s. or 9s., including a Jubilee sixpence, and the.

               <p>prisoner's £4 cheque, in my right-hand trousers pocket—had between £12 and £13 altogether—we went into the gallery of the theatre; the prisoner was on my right, and Holmwood, on my left—I took off my overcoat and put it behind me on the seat—during the performance I fell asleep for half an hour or twenty minutes—I was sober—when I woke up the performance was nearly over—my overcoat had been shifted from behind me to the right of the prisoner—I could not find my handkerchief—I took my overcoat and tried the pockets, and missed my gloves, and then I found my discharges were gone—I searched my trousers pockets, and found the 8s. or 9s. and the Jubilee sixpence were gone—I asked the prisoner if he had got my gloves, hand kerchief, parchment, and money—he said "No"—I asked him to try and see if he had them—he said "No, he had not seen them"—after some argument I said, "Just see if you have got them"—he pulled up his overcoat, and out fell two gloves, one belonging to me—he then pulled out another pair of gloves, and I recognised another one as mine—in the meantime my parchment dropped out of his pocket—I asked him if he had got my money—he said he had got nothing—I asked him for my handkerchief—he denied having it—he made no observation when the things fell out—I retook possession of some of my property, and walked out with the prisoner and the corporal—the prisoner proposed that the corporal should go and catch his train, or he would be late, and we went to Charing Cross Station and saw the corporal off—the prisoner, on coming out of the theatre, proposed that I should go to the Victoria Hotel with him and square up what money I had spent during the evening with him—at Charing Cross Station he said he wanted to go to the convenience, and he went in, telling me to wait outside, as he would not be long—he doubled out on the other side, and went across—I saw him, and pursued and caught him coming out of the gate of Charing Cross Station—I said, "Give me my handkerchief and money you have robbed me of"—he said, "All right, old boy, come and let us settle up"—I said, "I will five you into custody for robbing me"—I took him to get a policeman—when we got by Charing Cross he dropped my handkerchief—I then caught him by the arm and led him along, but he ran away again—eventually I gave him in charge, and accused him of robbing me of the money, and cheque that had gone, too, with the money—I don't know if he made any reply—he was taken to the station and formally charged—he said he had not done it—I saw him searched—on him was found a bank-book, a Jubilee sixpence, and, I think, 2s. or 3s.—I drank very little that evening—I knew perfectly well what I was about—I had some refreshments in the morning, and when leaving Woolwich—I was perfectly sober when I got into the train, and when I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

When you were searched and the officials looked at the cheque-book found on you I got up and looked at it and said, "The cheque you gave me is on the London and County Banking Company"—I bought no cigars at Gatti's—I recovered my certificates of character at the theatre, not my discharge—the other documents were in my pocket, and were not taken—I recovered the parchment—we had an altercation outside Charing Cross Station—I applied to a gentleman just inside the station gates for assistance; he walked away—I leaned</p>

               <p>upon the gallery railings and went asleep—I did not lose my ticket, and the railway official did not ride up with me to Charing Cross; he rode with yon—I spent 11s. or 12s. that day, as I was leaving Woolwich and the corporal—I spent 2s. or 2s. 6d. at Gatti's on drink—I did not feel you, take anything out of my pocket—the corporal saw you drop my handkerchief, and he picked it up—I have never been in trouble in the army. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The 2s. was spent at Gatti's for liquor for all of us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corporal in the Army Service Corps—on 11th April I came with O'Connor from Woolwich to Charing Cross—the prisoner was in the carriage—O'Connor showed me his discharge, and the prisoner joined in the conversation, and suggested that O'Connor should come into his employment at certain wages—I went with them to the Savoy Theatre, and we sat in the front row of the gallery; I on O'Connor's left and the prisoner on his right—there is a dark scene in the play—O'Connor was leaning over the railings, apparently asleep or fatigued—during the dark scene I was away at the refreshment bar—I had left the prisoner with O'Connor—when we were leaving the theatre O'Connor said he had lost his gloves, handkerchief, and discharges, and he asked the prisoner if he had his gloves or anything, and to feel in his pockets—he said at first he had not seen them—O'Connor asked him to put his hand in his pocket, and the prisoner did so, and pulled out two pairs of gloves, one of which O'Connor identified as his—his certificate of character came out with the gloves and fell on the floor, and I picked it up—O'Connor did I not charge the prisoner in my presence with stealing money; I heard nothing of that—they accompanied me to Charing Cross Station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Henry George Allen, export bookseller, of Henrietta Street, Covent Garden—the prisoner has been in his employment for three years past as collector—he had a fortnight's notice to leave at the beginning of March, and left about the middle of March—I receive orders from abroad, and I send the prisoner or some other <hi rend="italic">employé</hi> round to the wholesale publishers to collect the books required—it was the prisoner's regular duty to collect in that way for the three years, so that he was well known by the different publishers—he took a list of books, which I wrote as a rule, and the places to which he was to go—Mr. Allen never made out the list—it would have the indiarubber stamp of our firm on it—the prisoner would have access to that stamp if he wished to use it—he had no authority to order books unless they were contained in a list similar to this—Simpkin, Marshall and Co. was one of the firms with which we dealt, and to which the prisoner would go—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189305010073"/>
               <p>would call over from his list to the publishers' assistant the books they published, and then he would receive the books, and would sign for them in their book, and run his pen through those books on his list—some publishers do not give invoices, but expect the collector to take a memorandum; but Simpkin, Marshall and Co. supply us with invoices, and we fettle up monthly—the order lists would not be filed, but are thrown away when completed—this one produced was probably in use at the time the question was raised—sometimes I have gone through a list with him before it was thrown away, but as a rule he has not brought them to me—if he had a few lines open he might take them on to another list, and destroy the old one—there was no objection to that by our firm—we had no order for two sets of Miss Braddon's novels in March this year—I did not authorise the prisoner to purchase them for my employer—they are published by Simpkin, Marshall—I did not furnish the prisoner with any list containing them in March this year—since the prisoner left, an account from Simpkin, Marshall has been received—I have searched for the invoices of the items in the account—I have not found any invoice for an item of £11 8s. on 7th March, or for any books at all, or any invoice for £1 17s. 2d. on 9th March—if such invoices had been supplied by the prisoner I should have kept them—he was not authorised to call for Miss Braddon's novels on those days—we received no orders for them for years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Two or three years ago we had an order for Miss Braddon's novels for a library, but we should have sent that order to the publishers by post—if I was pressed I would depute Gurd to make up the list—no one else would do it at that time—in March the prisoner and Gurd were the only <hi rend="italic">employés</hi>—if I gave Gurd the list to write he should have brought it back to me—I don't think he got orders from Mr. Allen to make out lists without my knowledge—Gurd is now in prison for signing for books at Simpkin's without authority—he was convicted at the Mansion House last Monday week, and sentenced to one month hard labour—if the prisoner went on 7th March with a list to Messrs. Simpkin, I could not say in whose writing it had been made out—I heard Mr. Allen mention the name of Commins, of Exeter, in connection with books sent by Gurd—I very rarely met the prisoner after business hours—I am aware that Gurd borrowed the office keys from the prisoner, and went there after business hours once or twice, and being then alone he would have the opportunity of making out a list like this, and putting the stamp on it, and sending the prisoner with it in the morning—the prisoner should not have received the list from Gurd, or if he received it from him he should have brought it to me first—if the list was in Gurd's writing this firms would give books to the prisoner without making inquiry—when the prisoner was on holidays, and on one or two special occasions, Gurd collected books—it was Gurd's duty to post these invoices, and he had them in his possession for entry—when he left I found a mass of them on his desk; the books, had been getting behind—I found a number of items in Simpkin's statement for February for which we had no invoices, and I pointed it out to Mr. Allen, and went to Simpkin's and saw the books, and found that most of these invoices we had not received were signed for—Gurd only had access to the office alone once or twice at Christmas time; that' was when he had work to do.</p>

When Gurd wrote out the list it was by my instructions, and then it was given back to me, and if heavy it was posted, if light I gave it to the prisoner; the general rule was to send it by post—when ever the prisoner had a list to collect, written by Gurd, it came through me—he had no authority to take a list from Gurd without receiving it from me—when he had obtained the books and invoices he should have brought them to me—I saw all the books that came in—there were not two sets of Miss Braddon's novels on 11th March—I believe I found in February there was rather less than twenty items for which there were no invoices—I had no books corresponding with those items which were charged for in the statement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an export bookseller, at 28, Henrietta Street, Covent Garden—nobody but myself and Foley had any right to authorise the prisoner to collect books from publishers—I did not authorise the prisoner on 7th March to purchase from Simpkin and Marshall two sets of Miss Braddon's novels to the amount of £11 8s.; I never saw them—there would be over 100 volumes in the two sets—I did not require the books, and had no orders for them—I did not authorise the prisoner on 9th March to collect books to the value of £1 17s. 2d.; that amount is part of a much larger amount—books he collected with our authority it would be his duty to bring to the office at Henrietta Street—those books to the amounts of £11 8s. and £1 17s. 2d., and invoices, were not brought to my office—they should have been handed to Mr. Foley—after the prisoner was charged we were charged for the books by Simpkin and Marshall—we found that from January to March 20th something like £120 worth of books not ordered by us had been obtained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Gurd has collected books once or twice, but it was quite exceptional—Gurd is now in prison for the same offence as that with which the prisoner is charged—I have not found that the prisoner tried to sell any of the books he stole—after he was discharged we found he had concealed about 200 parcels of postal matter—Gurd was in our employment on 7th and 9th March—he was discharged five or six weeks ago at a month's notice.</p>

M.," in my presence—the entry is, "Sundries to the value of £11 8s."—among those goods were two sets of Miss Braddon's novels, of the value of £8 8s.—these are two volumes of a similar set, and are new and clean—he had been previously, and called over the list to another counterman—I handed the prisoner the goods—he would not have had the goods if he had not produced a list—I believed he was authorised by Mr. Allen to receive the books on his behalf.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector, City</hi>), I arrested the prisoner on a warrant on 12th April—I read the warrant to him—he simply said, in answer, that he was the person referred to in it—he gave his address as 29, Selborne Road, Wood Green—I told him I should go to his lodgings, and asked if I should find any books there—he said, "Yes, you will find two or three rows of books, and other books lying on a table in the room"—I went there the same day, and the prisoner's wife showed me into the front room, where I found in a bookcase three rows of books and other books in the well of the bookcase, amounting in all to 175 volumes of new books, and two books done up in brown paper, addressed to the "library, University, Colorado, U. S. America," stamped, and bearing Mr. Allen's label—the stamp has not been obliterated—this was a month after he had left the service—when I saw the prisoner again in the cells, with the sanction of the Court, I cautioned him, and said, "You know who I am?" and I said anything he might say to me might be used against him, and I told him I had been to his lodgings, and there found 175 volumes of new books—I said, "Where did you get them from, and have you anything to say about them?"—he said, "I bought and paid for them, and I can prove it"—I said, "I also found two books already addressed, and done up in a brown paper, parcel, to the University of Colorado, U. S. America"—he said, "They must have been given to me to post, and I must have taken them home and forgotten them"—among the books I saw were 53 volumes of Miss Braddon's novels, all new; these are two; and 34 volumes of Mrs. Henry Wood's works—I said to the prisoner that about 88 new books had been found in a locker used by him at Simpkin, Marshall and Co.

                  </hi>. I live at 48, Hillfield Road, West Hampstead, and for the last thirty-five years I have been owner of property in the City of London—I am of no occupation, and I collect my own rents—I have owned 64, 65, and 66, Drury Lane, at ail times material to this case—at 64 there is a basement—at 66 there is an archway going through 66 from Drury Lane to the back—part of what would otherwise have been shop and parlour is the archway—there is a shop and parlour on the right-hand side of the archway which goes under the rest of the house—at the back of 64, 65, and 66 is a yard, and across the yard is a line of warehouses—the prisoner had been my tenant for about two years of the warehouse at the back of 63, across the yard, at 4s. 6d. a week rent, up to 3rd December, 1891, when there was a fire at that warehouse—after the fire, the first time I was at 66, Drury Lane, was 6th December, Saturday, at twelve o'clock; that was my usual time for coming to collect rents—I had not heard of the fire till I arrived there—I then saw the prisoner in the arch or gateway—Guinn, who worked for me at whitewashing, papering, and so on, was there too—the prisoner said, "There has been a fire; can you give me other premises?"—I pointed to the shop and parlour of 66, and told him the rent was 14s. a week, but on account of his having the fire, for the time being he should have it for 10s. a week—I sent Guinn for the keys, and Mrs. Elizabeth Beach, my caretaker, who lives at 65, brought the two keys—one of them opened the front shop door of the house into Drury Lane, and the other opened the parlour door into the archway—I unlocked the parlour door in the archway and went in with Austin, who said it would suit him, and I handed him the keys there and then—the shop and parlour had been empty for some time; there was nothing but a few old fixtures in them, no goods—the prisoner then had possession, and I walked away to attend to other business—after that I was on the premises daily except Sundays—I often saw the prisoner and some of his men in the shop and parlour—he is a wholesale fruit and</p>

               <p>vegetable salesman in the orange market at Covent Garden, and has been so for some time—he had a large stand in the market—I have seen oranges and lemons in the parlour; they were mostly in baskets and boxes which I could not see inside of—I have seen him sorting them—I have seen goods taken out of the premises by men whom I have seen employed by him at his stand—he continued tenant till 20th February, 1892—the warehouse at the back, where the fire had occurred, was reconstructed in January—this is a little book I kept in my pocket to put down accounts of what I received and the date—it is a rough book I have with me when I collect my rents—on 5th December I had it with me, and at that time I made an entry respecting the tenancy—I have an entry on January 18th, 1892, when after the reconstruction he took back his own warehouse and another one at 8s. 3d. per week—the entry is, "Austin commenced 8s. 3d—that refers to the two warehouses he took, through the yard at the back—from 18th January he had, besides the shop and parlour, the two warehouses—one warehouse was 4s. 6d. and the other 3s. 9d. a week—between December 3rd and January 18th he had no warehouse, nothing but the shop and parlour—on February 1st he took the basement at 64 at 1s. 9d. per week—I made the entry in my rough book on December 5th when I was standing in the gateway, and when the prisoner took the shop and parlour—I wrote it across the page in a hurry, I was upset with the fire—on 20th February, 1892, the tenancy came to an end—I went to see the prisoner, who was in the orange market, and he laid the keys on his desk, and said he had cleared all out—Mrs. Beach was there at the time—I don't know whether she could hear what was said, as I was inside his stand, but she could see him putting the keys down and my taking them up—two of his men were also there—I know them by sight, not by name—he gave no notice to quit the shop and parlour; it was not required, because I wished him to give them up as soon as he could for another tenant—before that I had called on him once or twice to know how soon he was going to clear out—I only called on him quarterly for the rent—I made several applications for the rent of the shop and parlour—the first time was when I took the keys from him—he said he would pay me in a week—he did not say he had not occupied the shop or parlour, or anything of that kind—I collected the rent for the warehouses on the quarter day, but I asked for the rent of the shop and parlour, as the tenancy was at an end—I next applied for that rent in a week's time—I did not get it, and I got no denial of the occupation—I should think I have applied quite half a dozen times for that rent—I had no denial of the occupation—when I brought the first action I was legally advised—on 8th November Austin was still tenant for the basement and two warehouses—the plaint was for eleven weeks at 10s. a week, less 4s. 6d., £5 6s. 6d.—I made a mistake in a shilling; the 4s. 6d. should have been 3s. 6d.—on paying a cheque for £4 16s. 3d. it was 3s. 6d. in excess—on 2nd April, 1892, he paid £4 16s. 3d., and it was really 3s. 3d., but he put down 3d., and that made 3s. 6d.—the £4 16s. 3d. was for the rent of the other premises—the particulars in that action state that it is "rent for warehouses"—as the shop and parlour were used for a warehouse, I termed it "warehouses," but the action was really for the shop and parlour—the date when the rent is stated to be due is</p>

               <p>29th September—I made the particulars out myself—I put the 29th September because the rent was not paid, and that. was the time I sent the account in—he gave me the keys on the 20th February, and that was the date up to which I claimed rent—September 29th was the last time I applied for the money—I consider it was due on September 29th; that was my only reason for putting that date—I gave my evidence in that action on the 7th December—my evidence was directed to the shop and parlour, and I then gave the dates as from 5th December, 1891, to 20th February, 1892—at the County Court I only appeared myself, and did not call other witnesses—I was met by the prisoner's evidence that he had never occupied the premises—that same morning I consulted Mr. Marriott, my solicitor, and in consequence of that consultation the second action was brought on 15th February this year—I gave evidence, and called Mrs. Beach as a witness to the tenancy—I saw the oath administered to the prisoner, and heard his evidence—Mr. Barnett appeared for him then—the prisoner stated on oath that he never had the shop and parlour, and never was in the place; he simply repudiated the occupation—he repeated a second time that he never had the place, and never was in it, and said, "I know nothing about the place"—I don't remember his speaking about the keys; I don't think the keys were mentioned—he said that Mrs. Beach was living there at the time, and that I was living there with her—I never lived at the place in my life; there were only bare boards to sleep on—he said that Clifton Smith was my tenant, and that he had recommended him to me, and that it was to him I gave the keys—I don't know Clifton Smith—he gave evidence at the Police-court; I had never seen him before—Hoare, who represented himself as Smith's manager, gave evidence at the Police court—I had seen him on the prisoner's stand very often; I did not know his name—I never saw him at 66, Drury Lane.</p>

               <p>said it was a weekly tenancy; there was no agreement—in the second action Mr. Marriott, the solicitor, appeared for me—it was not exactly one of my objects in bringing the second action to found a prosecution for perjury—Mr. Marriott advised me, as I had put warehouses instead of shop and parlour, to take a second action—I was acting entirely under his advice—I did not wish the prisoner to commit perjury, but I intended if he did commit perjury again, that was, if he told the same story, I should punish him for it—I told that to Mr. Marriott—on 7th December Mrs. Beach was outside the Court, but I was not aware of it till afterwards—the 4s. 6d. in the particulars was a clerical error—in paying me a cheque on 29th April for £4 16s. 3d. the prisoner paid me 3s. 3d. too much, and he put down 3d. more to make it 3s. 6d., which I allowed him off the £5 108.—the only mistake I have made about that matter was in putting down 48. 6d. instead of 3s. 6d.—I left the information against the prisoner, sworn on 21st February, 1893, in Mr. Marriott's hands—I gave information for a warrant by my solicitor's advice—I stated to the Magistrate that he was likely to run away—I had information to that effect—that was why he was arrested on a warrant—when I was examined in February, 1893, I said, "About April, 1892, the defendant paid a cheque for £4 16s. 3d. in respect of the March quarter's rent of two warehouses and basement; it was 3s. 6d. too much; I held it and gave him credit for it in respect of the shop and parlour"—I was then cross-examined about a cheque for £2 18s. 6d. which I had had from the prisoner—three or four cheques were produced at the County Court—the one for £2 18s. 6d. was not shown to me, nor produced there—I did not then say, with regard to that cheque, that £2 15s. was applicable to the rent for other premises, and the balance, 3s. 6d., I retained in respect of the shop and parlour—the cheque for £4 16s. 3d. would be made up of rents for the warehouse and basement from 18th January, 1892—from 18th January to 25th March (quarter day) at 4s. 6d. would be £2 5s.; the ware house at 3s. 9d. between the same dates would be £1 17s. 6d.; the basement from 1st February, 1892, to 25th March would be 14s., and that amounts in all to £4 16s. 6d., but I allowed the 3s. 6d. for cleaning up the place, and when I made that allowance it was overpaid—I made an allowance of a fortnight's rent, at 1s. 9d. a week, for his man cleaning the basement up—when I called on 26th March for the rent of the whole premises the prisoner had paid the man—I allowed the 3s. 6d. out of the rent—I did not give him the 3s. 6d. because he said he had paid his man for cleaning up the place, and I said I would allow him a fortnight's rent of the place—this arrangement was made on 26th March, directly after I took his cheque—if the cheque is dated the 2nd April it was then—I did not look at the date of the cheque—I should have said it was 2nd April instead of 26th March—I called there on 26th March, and I fancy he must have postdated the cheque; I did not notice it at the time—it is quite right that he put down threepence to make up the £4 16s. 6d.—I believe this arrangement was come to on 26th March, and that although the cheque was dated 2nd April, 1892, it was a postdated cheque given to me on 26th March—I may have said on 28th February, "The tenancy came to an end on 20th February, 1892; he then went back to his old warehouse, which had been by that time reconstructed.

               <p>his premises at that date—I found this book in one of a chest of drawers in my bedroom—I put different things in it—the drawers are not kept locked—I have in them several other books, and clothes; I had not worn the clothes for a very long while; they were my regimental suit when I was in the Volunteers—the other drawers are in daily use—I don't suppose I had looked in the drawers for twelve months—I looked through the drawers I usually used for this book before I went to the County Court the second time—I did not look in this particular drawer because I considered that there was nothing but this suit of regimentals in it—I looked in every drawer of this chest except the one where the book was, and I did not look there because I did not dream of its being there—I thought the book was destroyed all the time I was looking for it, and until I found it—I am quite sure of that—I found it after I was before the Magistrate—I could not swear it was the day after—when Mr. Barnett asked me at the Police-court I said, "I made a note at the time of the tenancy, which note is filed at my home"—that is correct, but I could not find the note, it is destroyed; it was on the file—it is a different note, and was on a piece of paper; I could not find that, but I produce the book—I was thinking of the bit of paper at the time—I did mention to my solicitor before going to Court that I had not only a book but a further memorandum on a file; I did not think of it—I made the second memorandum not under the archway but when I got home, and I filed it—the whole file has gone; I suppose I burnt it—I was collecting some rents in December—I collected quite half the number on the next leaf of the book—there is no date to that because I don't usually date that book; there are dates in it—the date of the 14th does not refer to that leaf I pointed out—in this entry 10s. is crossed out and 8s. 3d. written over it; it was a mistake—it is a rather black pencil, but it was done at the time—pencils do not always mark alike—the 10s. apparently came there by mistake—the 8s. 3d. is a genuine and contemporaneous entry—10s. was put down by mistake on 18th January and crossed out—no doubt I was thinking of 10s. for the shop, and then crossed it out directly and put 8s. 3d.—the 10s. does work out at exactly the rental that afterwards occurred—the entry on 1st February, 1892, of 1s. 9d. must have been made on the date it appears in the book, when he took the other warehouse—Mrs. Beach is only called Mrs. Lynch as a joke; she has been so called.</p>

Austin"—they went into the shop and parlour by the side entrance; I don't remember the front door being opened—the prisoner has not been in there more than four or five times, to the best of my recollection—I have seen him at the beginning and end of the week at mid-day—I have seen him go in and come out—I have not seen him there more than six times between December 6th and February 20th—I have seen him there when the men were putting goods in; he has not stopped long; I have not heard him say anything—I never heard him give orders—I got Mrs. Pyebus, who helps me, to get three or five lemons at a time from him—I stood at the door and saw her—the prisoner was there eleven weeks, and after he left I cleaned the premises; Mrs. Pyebus helped me—I found this bag, marked "W. Austin, Covent Garden"—on one occasion in the market Lynch went for his rent and could not get it, and he asked the prisoner and the prisoner gave the two keys to him on a string over the desk—a young man was then on the left-hand side of the desk—I did not hear what was said—he gave the keys into Lynch's hand—I did not notice where he took them from—I afterwards saw those keys; one belonged to the shop door and the other to the parlour door, and were the keys I had given Lynch to give to the prisoner—Lynch frequently went to the prisoner for the rent after that—when the first action came on in the County Court I was there, but was not called—Lynch did not know I was there—I was just outside—I went because Lynch had a case against Sullivan, and I went to hear that case—I had nothing to do with the action against Sullivan, I went to hear it—I did not tell Lynch I was going—he told me he had a case at the County Court that day, and I thought it was Sullivan's case; he did not tell me the name of the person, and I did not ask him then—I knew he had an action against Sullivan for £10, and I did not know this case was coming off—Lynch said the action was to be tried at St. Martin's Lane—he did not mention that I might look in—he said he was going there—the conversation took place in my room at Drury Lane; he came there to collect my rent—he said he had an action against Sullivan and I thought he was going for that—he did not tell me he had an action against the</p>

Austin say any thing about Lynch in connection with the occupation of the premises"—it was not my mistake—I do not know that I said that—if I said it, I could not have heard it—I signed my deposition——in December, 1891, I was in occupation of the shop and parlour at 65, Drury Lane, and Lynch came weekly to collect my rent, 6s. a week—I paid on Saturday, or Thursday, or Monday sometimes—he kept a rent book—I cannot say what he put down in it—I don't know if he had a book where he wrote down what he received—I cannot point out in this book the entry of any payment made by me—Mr. Lynch pays me 10s. a week for looking after the place, and he makes me a reduction, of course—sometimes he would deduct the rent, and sometimes I would give it to him—sometimes I am called Mrs. Lynch—I have gone down with the keys, and they have said, "Here comes Mrs. Lynch," but my name is Mrs. Beach—after the first action Lynch spoke to me, and then I was called as a witness on the second action—the County Court Judge decided against my evidence—I and Lynch were the only two witnesses called then—I have seen more than one of the prisoner's men going into the shop And parlour, and I saw bags with the prisoner's name on, bananas, oranges, and lemons taken in—the men were strangers, some one day, some another—I saw the prisoner take the goods in—I said before I could not be sure about the men—I said before, "I know several of Austin's men by sight; I cannot swear it was Austin's men I saw take in the baskets"—I know they took Mr. Austin's goods in—I only know the men by bringing the prisoner's goods—I said to the Magistrate that I could hot swear to the men—I found this bag on a shelf in the shop when I cleaned up, and gave it to Mrs. Pybus, who helped me—she used not to wear this bag as an apron when she cleaned the premises out—this was the only one—I don't know if the prisoner kept a number of such bags in the warehouse where he stored his goods; I was never there—the prisoner occupied premises at the back before the fire, and placed fruit there; and afterwards he was there dealing in the same class of goods—he gave up the shop and parlour, and went back to the warehouse—I heard nothing</p>

I am the wife of James Pybus, and live at 64, Drury Lane, and help Mrs. Beach to clean the premises—before the fire, on December 3rd, the shop and parlour at 66 were unoccupied, and there was nothing in them—about Christmas time I saw lemons go in baskets several times—I have seen several of the prisoner's men in the shop and parlour unloading and taking the lemons in, and unpacking goods, and they used to come in the morning and get baskets and things—I noticed no names on baskets or barrows—I have asked them to give me and Mrs. Beach lemons and oranges, and sometimes the men, and sometimes the prisoner, have given me two or three—he has taken them from the little shop and parlour under the archway—I very seldom saw the prisoner there when they were unloading; but when he was there he was seeing that things were put properly into the place—he had lemons in the warehouse he occupied for some time—I have had lemons from him before the fire; but after the fire I had them from the shop and parlour—after the prisoner left the premises I helped Mrs. Beach to clean them up, and I found a lot of empty baskets, and a sack was on the shelf in the shop—I put the rubbish into the sack—Mrs. Beach found the sack, and she said I could have it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say when I was examined about it that I found it in the parlour—I did not say at the Police-court, "I have had that bag since last September twelve months"—I said there were bags left in there which they gave us to put across our aprons, with no names on them—this was not a walnut bag—it is a perfectly sound bag—I did not think the prisoner would want it, and Mrs. Beach said I could keep it to use when I helped her to scrub—I did not use it as an apron in cleaning out the shop and parlour—I considered it was cleaning when I put the rubbish in it—the prisoner had the warehouse at the back up to the fire, and he went back there a very short time after the fire; and during that time he would have boxes and baskets of oranges and lemons delivered there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 56, Frederick Street, Caledonian Road, and am a commercial traveller—on 15th February, 1893, I was at the Westminster County Court when the case of Lynch and Austin was heard—after Mr. Marriott had pressed him three times the prisoner denied on oath that he had ever had in his possession the keys of the place in Drury Lane, and he said that Clifton Smith had taken the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not interested in the case; I was waiting to see Mr. Marriott, and listened to what went on—I heard Lynch say he had received a cheque for £2 18s. 6d.—the Judge asked him how he accounted for having received the 3s. 6d. on account, and his answer was something about a cheque, but several cheques were mentioned—the 38. 6d. was said to be on account of the premises in Drury Lane—I could not swear to the amount from which it was deducted—I said before the Magistrate, "I understood the 3s. 6d. was upon the £2 18s. 6d."—I did understand so, and I say so now, but I would not take my oath upon it—to the best of my belief the 3s. 6d. was part of the £2 18s. 6d. cheque, and was in excess of what was required.</p>

I then lost my temper and used the poker"—on the 10th I saw him in the cells, a few minutes before 9 p. m.—I said, "Are you all right, Kemp?"—he said "Yes," and then made a statement—I gave him no warning—I was in charge of the station till nine, and prior to going off duty I went round to see if everything was all right—I did not ask him to make a statement—he said, "On returning home from work she commenced going on to me as she did on Sunday, and has done for a long time, that is why I hit her, and I hit the old man because he is as bad as she is; he takes her part and gives her his brass"—the old man was independent, so far as I know.</p>

I live at 16, Silva Road, Upper Norwood—on 10th April I was called to 29, Tredholm Road, between 6 and 7 p. m.—the house was nearly empty, most of the things in the room being smashed—I went to the back and got over the fence which divides the backyards of 29 and 28—I saw the deceased lying on the ground unconscious—I directed him to be removed into No. 29, where he was placed on a sofa in the front parlour—his head had been bandaged up—I removed the bandages and examined his head—I found three wounds on the right side of his head extending down to the bone through the scalp, and at the posterior wound a depression of the bone—there was a fracture of the</p>

I live at 86, Gipsy Hill—on 10th April I examined the deceased at the Cottage Hospital, when he came in at eight o'clock—he was suffering from a lacerated wound over the right eyebrow, and the right eyelids were exceedingly bruised—there was another large wound a little behind the first, and a third wound on a level with the ear running upwards; these all reached to the bone—I could feel fractures of the skull beneath my finger—there were also two slight cuts on the top of the head, and a cut at the back of the head, and some slight bruises on the left hand—the injuries were the result of separate blows—they could have been inflicted by this poker—the bruises on the left hand, I think, were caused by struggling—he died nearly at midnight—I made a post-mortem examination on Wednesday, 12th—on removing the scalp there was a depressed fracture, larger than a five-shilling piece—the bone was broken into several pieces—the fracture was more or less circular, and then starred, as it were, into three or four pieces—I found another fracture extending from the ear upwards—from this fracture, I should say, I had taken several pieces of bone on the night of the attack, before he died—I found numerous and extensive clots of blood on the brain, notably two large ones, one on the right aide under the fracture, and another on the left side—very great violence must have been used to have caused those injuries—the fracture at the base of the skull was only found on removing the brain—the cause of death was effusion of blood from the violence of blows and shock.</p>

I am a clothier, of 35, Weston Road, Forest Hill on the night of February 10th my premises were securely fastened before I went to bed, and about three o'clock next morning I was called up by a police-constable, and found two of my shutters down—I entered my shop and missed boots, children's things, braces, and other goods of the value of £15 or £20—I identify these braces, book, flannels and coat as mine, and as stolen on that night—on 11th April I saw the prisoner walking along wearing this coat, and I followed him till I saw a constable—I recognised the coat by the pattern and by a private mark—the prisoner was asked how he became possessed of it, and he said he bought it off a rag and bone man in the Brockley Road—he was taken to the station and charged—afterwards the police searched his lodgings and brought in these other things, which I identified—at the station I identified the neckerchief he was wearing—the prisoner said he had bought it of me on a Saturday a few weeks before 10th February—that was after he had been told he was charged with a burglary on 10th February—I do not remember a sale to a person who tendered 7d. and left me an odd 1/2d. as I had not got 1/2d.—I have seen the prisoner in my shop before.</p>
