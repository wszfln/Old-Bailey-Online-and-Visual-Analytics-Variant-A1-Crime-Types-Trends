               <p>When did you first become acquainted with Mr. Bennett? - A. In the early part of September last, in consequence of a recommendation, he was permitted to open an accont with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he begin his account by a large sum of money? - A.Three hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. For some considerable time there was no overdrawing by the prisoner? - A. No; there was generally a balance due to him, I might say constantly, for a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how soon he began to over-draw? - A. I cannot, without referring to the books.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you remember his coming to your house on the 13th of January last? - A. Yes; he paid in some bills on that day.</p>
               <p>Q.What bills were they? - A. There were three bills of exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect from memory, what the bill were? - A. No, not without referring to the books.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill, and see if that is one of the bills the prisoner paid in on that day? - A. Yes; this is one.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what conversation you had with the prisoner when he paid it in? - A. I do not recollect any, the bills were received and carried to his account.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon did you see Mr. Bennett again? - A. I do not recollect seeing Mr. Bennett from that time till the 16th, three days after.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us what passed then, respecting any of these bills? - A. Mr. Bennett came in to Mr. Bond's banking shop, and presented two drafts; when he gave him the drafts, which were for a considerable sum, I observed to him, that his accounts were considerably over-drawn, and desired him to walk into the accompting-house; in the interim, I turned to the accompt in the ledger, and found it was as I had supposed; when I went into the accompting house to Mr. Bennett, I told him the account was much over-drawn; he seemed rather surprised, and said, are not those bills I brought the other day discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. He had only left the three bills you had been speaking of, on the 13th? - A. Only these three bills; he seemed surprised that they were not discounted; I told him it was not agreeable to discount those bills, he seemed rather vexed, and observed the warrants were a sufficient security for the money he wanted, as well as what was over-drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. You had had other securities from him? - A. Yes; he pressed very much for the accommodation, it only being for a few days; in consequence of that, he had upwards of three hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, in consequence of some information, you went to the prisoner in the Poultry-Compter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When was this? - A. The 31st of July.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. You of course went to him in that melancholy place to obtain some discovery from him? - A. I went to enquire something respecting the bills we had in our custdoy.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in order to derive some information respecting this matter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pity his situation? - A. I told him I was very sorry to see him in that situation.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you frequently seen him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon those occasions, you were rather impressed with a good opinion of him than a bad one? - A.Always.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went to that place, I take it for granted, you believed that he would answer truly every question that you proposed to him? - A. I had no reason for forming an opinion upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not doubt but you should get the truth from him? - A. I do not recollect forming any opinion at that time, but if I had, I should rather have formed it unfavourable than otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went in, do you recollect any persuasions that you made use of at that time, to disclose the whole truth? - A. No, none at all; I merely asked the question.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260004"/>Q. Did not you encourage him to speak the whole truth? - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. No exhortation to speak the truth? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q.you did not tell him what would be the consequence of prosecution? - A. No; I made no observation of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to unbosom himself to you then? - A. It was in consequence of a conversation we had with respect to some other securities in Mr. Bond's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. You entered upon that conversation before, with respect to the other securities that Mr. Bond had? - A. The first conversation I had, was, with respect to his being in such an unpleasant situation, afterwards I spoke to him upon the state of his account, and its being considerably over-drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the conversation, respecting the other securities in Mr. Bond's hands, last, before he unbosomed himself? - A. It was a very short time that I was there altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. He craved your assistance did not he? - A. Yes; at the latter part of the conversation when I was nearly coming away.</p>
               <p>Q. You made use of no expressions of that kind to him? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Tell us, exactly as you recollect it, what conversation you had with Mr. Bennett, respecting the bill, how did you address him? - A. I told him I was extremely sorry to see him in that situation, speaking of his account having been over-drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was every thing that he said respecting the bill that is now the subject matter of enquiry, in the same conversation? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you separate it? - A. I will endeavour to do so; he said, Mr. Bond had other securities in his possession; I told him that I had discovered these securities to he forged; then says Mr. Bennett, I am a dead man, and I immediately added, I suppose the bills are of the same description.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe, at this time, the individual bill we have now been talking of had been out of your house some time, had it not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr Knapp. Q. To that did he give any answer? - A. Mr. Bennett said, yes; he was certainly much confused when I made the observation.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at this bill again, was that one of the bills upon which this conversaton took place? - A. Yes; there is the number of our bill book, and my own writing at the back of it.</p>
               <p>Q.This being one of the bills that was talked of ninety-three pounds, what became of it from that time in present? - A. It was in my possession for several days.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that bill? - A. I delivered it to Mr. Gregson on the 9th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. You only gave him one of that sum? - A. No; it has my name upon the back of it, which I wrote when the forgery was first discovered; they were all delivered over the same day, and my name is wrote upon one of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you put your name upon it the day you delivered it to Mr. Gregson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. Had this bill, which you delivered to Mr. Gregson, remained in your possession or in the possession of the house, from the time when it was brought in by Mr. Bennett? - A. Not only so, but in my own custody.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time of its first being brought to your house by Mr. Bennett, till the time you delivered it to Mr. Gregson? - A No; from the time it was left to the discovery of the forgery it was in a bill-drawer; since that, it has been in my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. It has not been in course of negociation? - A. No such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. They were left by Mr. Bennett as securities? - A.They were entered short.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not look upon any thing that is entered, as you call it, short, to be equivalent to a payment in cash? - A. No; but if a person draws upon the house we very often pay those bills that are not entered cash.</p>
               <p>Q. You entered, however, the receipt of so much paper from Mr. Bennett? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And nothing more? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass, at that moment, with you and Mr. Bennett about a negociation of them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There they lay, and in consequence of some suspicion, that happened to affect this young man, you had a conversation with him, and then you delivered this bill into the hands of Mr. Gregson? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not put it into a course of negociation? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Mr. Bennett demanded any money for it? - A. No; but he had over-drawn his account.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is the bill, together with two others, that Mr. Bennett deposited at your shop, you take them and write them in short, that your house received those papers, in your book, and afterwards you do not offer to negociate those bills? - A.Certainly not; they would have lain there till they became due.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing, in fact, was done upon them? - A. Though we refused to discount them, they would have been an inducement to lend money upon.</p>
               <p>Q. If Bennett had come to your house for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260005"/>papers which he had deposited there, and required you to deliver them, should you have persisted at all? - A. It is very likely that I should, as the account was over-drawn.</p>
               <p>Q.This not being cash, but paper, lodged there, was it not subject to his demand? - A. Not under the circumstances of his account.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, previous to your having any suspicion, should you have hesitated to return them, they not being cash? - A. If it had been cash there could not have been a doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then no act whatever had been done upon the bill, nor was it presented for payment, nor any one endeavour made, either to discount them, or put them into any course of negociation? - A. The observation of Mr. Bennett wondering that they were not discounted, implied that he wished them discounted</p>

               <p>ROBERT JONES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an Excise-officer: On the 7th of December, I was stationed at Robert's bridge, near Battle, in Sussex; between one and two o'clock on that day, I was at a public-house, called the Royal-Oak, at Warlington; I saw a cart with two horses going by, which I suspected was loaded with smuggled goods, and I took my horse out of the stable, and went towards Battle; I met Mr. Pilcher, and a serjeant in the Lanark and Dumbarton sencibles, we overtook the cart.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was with the cart? - A. One Thomas Johnson; and another man, whose name I did not know, in another cart; I told 
               <persName id="t17970426-2-person67">

             I had an information, that he had smuggled goods in his cart; he said, I was mistaken; Mr. George Pilcher came to the tail part of the cart, and he examined the goods; he cut one bag, and pulled part of the contents out, and it turned out to be unmanufactured tobacco, which I put in my great coat pocket; we seized the cart, and went on with it to a place called <placeName id="t17970426-2-crimeloc7">Vine-hall</placeName>

             called out loudly, that he would give my person ten guineas to fight us at that time; Robert Kingsmore, the prisoner, came out of the house and whispered something to Johnson, which I did not hear; in a little time after that, Johnson produced two double barrelled pistols, and presented one of them to me, and said, he would shoot me if I interfered any further; Mr.

             was in the cart at that time, then Johnson called to them to turn the cart round, which several persons did, and the prisoner was one of them, he said hold of the reins after the cart was turned round; Johnson said, he would shoot the first man that offered to follow them, I told him, I would follow him, because that was my way home to my residence; then he went into the cart, and Kingsmore gave him the reins and went up the hill, I think, about forty yards, when he returned with other; Mr. Pilcher said, Kingsmore, have you any thing to do with it? Kingsmore said, do you know me? yes, says he, I know you very well; d-n you, I wish you did not; or, I know how it would be, he said to Johnson, d-n them, do not let them have it.</p>
               <p>Q. When Johnson offered ten guineas to any persons to assist him, how many might come out of the house? - A. I suppose four or five people.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At what distance might you be from the public-house when you met with Johnson? - A. I cannot say exactly, by it was not half a mile.</p>

               <p>Q. This house was then shoeing at the farrier's? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was taking some refreshment at the public-house? - A. I caanot say.</p>
               <p>Q. It was quite a matter of chance that you went to this public house? - A. I was going to take the goods where they ought to be taken after they are seized.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be detained on the road before you got to the public-house; you and Johnson had been scuffling? - A. No, we had no scuffling, only some words.</p>
               <p>Q.Where abouts did you meet with the light-horseman? - A.Near Warlington.</p>
               <p>Q.After you arrived at the public-house, did not you stop before the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When Johnson offered ten guineas, had not he, at the same time, exclaimed, that two men had improperly stopped him, that he believed they were highwaymen, and wanted assistance? - A. He did so after, I believe, but not before.</p>
               <p>Q.When did he say so? - A. After he had produced his pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Johnson produce his pistols before you produced your's? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.This was after Johnson had cried out, that he believed they were highwaymen? - A. No; that was after all the conversation happened, that he said that.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Johnson made resistance, and you cried out to him to cut this man out of the cart? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this light-horseman, I believe, made several cuts at the man in the cart? - A. No, he did not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fieling. I am an officer in the Excise; I was in company with the last witness, we followed this cart; I went to the backside of the cart and saw some bags of tobacco, I cut one of them up; and, as soon as we saw what it was, we seized the cart and brought it back to Vine-hall before we came to Vine-hall, after we had seized it, Johnson begged for one horse, and I told him I could not do it; when we got to Vine-hall he begged for his great coat, I was then in the cart, I threw out the great coat; and then he said, I will give any body ten guineas to help me sight them; there were many people out at that time, and I believe the prisoner was out at that time; upon that the prisoner at the bar whispered something to Johnson, what I cannot tell; I said to him, Kingsmore, have you any thing to do with this business? I knew him before; says he d-n you, you know me, do not you? yes, says I; says he, I with you did not, and I Know how it would be soon; then, after that, Johnson produced his pistols, and said, some of our lives must be lost, for I would sooner lose my life than my goods; I then came out of the cart, and went to the public-house; he then presented a double barrelled pistol at me, he called out to the people to turn the cart, which they did, and Johnson stood then with his pistol in his hand, and threatened to shoot me; I thought then it was time to give it up; he went with Johnson a little way, and some others, and then he came back, and told me he had endeavoured to persuade Johnson to run away and leave us the cart; I told him he had better have had no business with it, as he might smart for it here after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I was in the month of December last that this took place? - A. Yes.</p>

            , In York-street, Covent-Garden: Early in the month of March I lost a small parcel of books, which are specified in the indictment; upon searching the premises and not being able to find them, I concluded they had been delivered to somebody by mistake; in consequence of information some time after, I went to a bookseller's in Piccadilly, Mr. Stewart's where I found two books that I had lost, he was going to sell them by auction; he gave them up readily, and told me that the person who had sent them there for sale was in the room; he came forward, and said, that he had bought them of a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q.What were those two books? - A.Warner's Albion's England, a quarto volume, and Sir David Lindsay's works, a small duodecimo; the manner in which I discovered the remaining seven was pretty similar to the manner in which I discovered the other two: a gentleman told me if I went to a bookseller's in Princes-street, I should there discover them, which I did, and they are now in Court; I found them at Mr. Stace's, in Princes-street, Leicester-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you found those at the auction? - A. I believe, about the 21st or 22d of February, but I am not exact as to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the other seven? - A.Two days afterwards; the books have been in my possession ever since. (Produces them.)</p>

               <p>Q.Was that much under their real value? - A. It is much under what they sold for; but, I suppose, there is not one in an hundred who would have given more for them, or so much; Mr. Stewart, a bookseller in Piccadilly, called upon me a few days after, and told me he had a library of books that he was going to sell, and if I would put a few lots in he would be much obliged to me, that he had not enough to make out two day's sale; I told him I had a parcel of rubbish which I should he very glad to get shot of, and I sent these two among the rest, I attended the sale, and met Mr. Leigh there; we parted and met again in the evening at the Public-office, Bow-street; Mr. Bond said, I was in a very disagreeable situation, as I could not produce the man I had bought them of; I had lived with Mr. Lackington, where I had bought books of him several times, I knew his person well; the next day, as I was passing along Cattle-street, I very fortunately met the man; I asked him if he was not the man who had sold me two books; he asked me my name, I told him, and he said he did; I then desired he would go with me to the Public-office, which he refused at first; he made some trifling resistance, I took him by the collar, and insisted upon his going, I tore his coat a little, and then he said he would be very willing to go if I would let him walk on quietly; I took him to the office, and delivered him to one of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know these books again if you were to see them? - A. Yes, perfectly; these are the two.</p>

             sworn. - I am a bookseller, in Princes-street, Leicester-square; the prisoner at the bar, on the 8th of February, brought two books to me, and told me he had a large and valueable collection, but these were the only two he should part with at present.</p>
               <p>Q.What were those two? - A.Patengenius's Zodrac of Life, and Turberville's Falconry; I asked him if they were his own, and he said I need not be afraid; that he was very well known to Mr. Stewart, down the street, who was a very good customer of his, and also was well known to Mr. White, in Fleet-street, to whom he was distantly related; that he had made this collection in his early days for his entertainment, and now, in his age, he was obliged to part with them from distress; he said he hoped he should be able to purchase them back again, and asked how long I would keep them; he expressed a with that I would keep them two months, in which time he should he able to purchase them back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say this of the two, or the seven? - A. He spoke of the seven; he asked me to keep these books two months, and he said he would allow me twenty per cent, for my trouble; I told him I wished he would not consider me as a pawnbroker, that if he came within a month he should have the books, and I would only charge him ten per cent; when I pressed him for his address, he did give it me, but very unfortunately I forgot to take it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you those books of him? - A. Yes. seven books.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy these books of him, the Vision of Pierce's Plowman, Fletcher's Purple Hland, Bulwer's Artificial Changeling. Evans's Mirror, and Scotch songs? - A. I did; I kept them by me till Mr. Leigh claimed them; I had sold one to a book-binder, and when I found they had been stolen, I gave him his money back, and returned the book to Mr. Leigh.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM STEWART sworn. - I am a bookseller, I had an auction of a gentleman's library in the month of February; Mr. Eglin sent me some books of his to put into the same auction, he sent me fifty or sixty lots, among them were the works of Sir David Lindsey, and Warner's Albion's England; the books being upon view for some days, some gentleman informed Mr. Leigh that I had them, and he came to me and claimed them, and I delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leigh. I know these are the books I lost, they are all of them books of a very rare description; in Fletcher's Purple-Island, thee is a manuscript note at the beginning, giving an account of the author, and in the Vision of Pierce;s Plowman, it says, perfect, except the title; these very books were part of the library of Mr. Dodd, the comedian, which I myself sold by auction; I had purchased them in the sale by commission, for a gentleman, they are very rare, and very uncommon books, and at the termination of the sale, I had tied these books up together.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you bought them in your name or his? - A. I had bought them neither in my own name nor his; I had bought them in the name of Higgins.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any claim upon him till you had delivered the books? - A. None in the world, and then I have a claim of ten guineas upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see me in your shop but once, and that was about nine months ago, to enquire for an edition of Borlase's Cornwali, I never was in your shop in my life, except that time, nor I never attended any public sale.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leigh. I never saw him till Mr. Eglin brought him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have carefully concealed this from every friend, I have neither money to see counsel, not any thing else; the facts are re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260010"/>duced to a very small point, I bought them of a Mr. Brav, and paid for them; I had bought books of him before in the same way, not that it is in the way of my profession, but I have a pretty good idea of these things.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you quite sober? - A. I was not in liquor but what I new what I was about; I went out to the door to make water round the corner of the lane, and Chapman laid hold of me on one side, by the collar, and the baker on the other; the baker is not taken.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Chapman before, did you? - A. Yes; he shoved me right a-head down the lane, there were three of them; the baker knocked me down with a stick, Chapman on one side, and Horne on the other; the baker took the watch out of my pocket; I did not see Horne till the baker hit me upon the forehead, and the baker said then, d-n the b-r, kill him, then they all three ran away towards Gunnersbury; I came up on the Monday following to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the name and description of the baker, at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your watch since? - A. No; they never asked me for any money, I had only one shilling and three pence about me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first give an account of this? - A. The Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you quite sober enough to know these people? - A. Yes; it was quite starlight, and I was quite clear that they were the people.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen either of these two men before that night? - A. yes; I have know Chapman, I suppose, two or three years, and I have known Horne pretty near two years, ever since he came to work at Mr. Wood's as a labourer.</p>
               <p>Q. These two prisoners are both labourers as well as yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you take them up? - A. The Monday following; I took Chapman myself upon Ealing-Common; I took him by the collar and told him he must go along with me, he was at a cricket match, he turned round and said he would cut my bloody head off; one of the runners took the other at Action.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever robbed in your life before? - A. No; people gave out that I was robbed several times, that I had got a bad pocket, and the money slipped out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give evidence before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of any reward for taking a highwayman? - A. Yes; I dare say there is forty pounds, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first told of that? - A. I have heard of that, I suppose, for many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Chapman what you had taken him for? - A. No; the runners did at the public-house, when they searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them say any thing, then you charged them with this robbery? - A. Not one thing at all, no more than what he said to me when I took him by the collar; I told him he must go with me, he said he would not, he would cut my bloody head off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen either of them that evening before? - A. Yes; I had seen them in the same public-house I was not in company with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to talk when you came out of the public house, which road you were going? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How much might you have been drinking that evening? - A. I cannot tell; I suppose I might have drank about three pints in the course of the night, but I am sure that would not make me drunk; I had been hard at work all that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.This is a pretty good job you have made this time, you have no other witness? - A. I am my own witness.</p>
               <p>Q. And then expect you will be your own witness to eighty pounds you know? - A. I am very clear that they were the people.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect to get eighty pounds? - A. No. I applied to the runners.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know you will be entitled to a share of eighty pounds? - A. If I have a right to it, I should give it to the runners.</p>

               <p>Q.Where do you work? - A. At Gunnersbury; about half past seven o'clock, I received two guineas from my mistress.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to stick to that, that for five hours on settling your pay and the work, you drank no more than three pints of beer? - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you drank before you came there? - A. None at all, only a pot of beer that we allow ourselves at dinner time.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know exactly which seized you, and knocked you down? - A. I cannot exactly say, but Smith was one of them; they wrenched the stick out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they strike you? - A. In the side; they made off; I then pursued them down Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you strike either of them? - A. Yes; I Struck Smith on the side of the head, so as to occasion a great deal of blood; I then pursued them, they ran different ways, I never lost sight of the two prisoners at all till they were taken by a watchman; when I came up, there was the blood upon his face occasioned by my striking him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.When did you first observe the prisoner Dyke, after they ran away? - A. At the corner of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Dyke, as well as Smith, at the time you were knocked down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This was a little after twelve at night? - A. Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to speak only to the unfortunate deaf and dumb prisoner? - A. I never lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. But the person you struck was Smith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.I take it as to the persons of the others you could not speak positively to them? - A. I never lost sight of these two.</p>
               <p>Q. But I dare say other persons ran; the watchmen ran, did not they? - A. Yes; I was very near them at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it you must have been a great deal agitated and confused? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you will not swear, when the life of the man is concerned, that Dyke, was one of the persons that struck you? - A. Yes; to the best of knowledge he is.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of a night was this? - A.Rather moon-light.</p>

               <p>Q. I don't mean to be offensive, but you had been in company, I suppose? - A.- Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You were returning home from dinner? - A. Yes; I had drank about a bottle of wine, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. A bottle of wine, now and then, makes a man a little merry? - A. I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that Dyke was particularly active? - A. He and the other persons talked together.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say that the prisoner Smith made any signs, or any thing of that sort, to the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Before you were knocked down you were hustled? - A. Yes; and then I was knocked down by the whole party together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. The whole four were active, and these were two of those four? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman of St. James's parish; Between twelve and one o'clock I heard the rattles go from St. George's parish, I was sitting upon a bench in my box, in Cork-street, nobody could see me; I heard a cry of stop thief, and Dyke came running up, and I met him and laid hold of him; he came up Vigo-lane from out of Bond-street, and so turned into Cork-street, and there I stopped him; Captain Askew and the St. George's watchman came up almost immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had Dyke in custody, how soon after did you see Smith? - A. In about three minutes after; as we were going to the watch-house with Dyke, Smith came up between Vigo-lane and Cork-street, just at the corner; he came up and made some signs to Dyke, he put his hand up to his head, I suppose, to tell him he had been hurt; when we were going to the watch-house, says Dyke, d-n my eyes if it was me that struck the gentleman, or took his hat off, for it was the deaf and dumb man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very correct in what you now say? - A. Yes, I am very sure of it, as we were conveying him to the watch-house; I naturally thought that we had got this deaf and dumb man in custody, and I desired him to be taken into custody immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whereabouts O'Donnell found the hat? - A. Yes, I was witness to it; it was down an area in Cork-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Must he have passed it in order to get to where you saw him? - A. Yes; the deaf and dumb man made signs to the captain, as if it was the captain that had hurt him, and he pointed to Dyke likewise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.This poor unfortunate foolish deaf and dumb man walked up to you when you were all together as if nothing was the matter? - A. Yes, he met us.</p>
               <p>Q. The poor man, as if he did not know what he was about, came up to you, and walked with, you? - A. Yes; he endeavoured to make his escape, and so did Dyke, till the patrol took out his cutlass.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HALLIDAY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. When Dyke was in custody, and going to the watch-house, do you remember his saying any thing? - A. I went up to Cork-street and secured him by the collar; in coming along, he seemed very obstinate, and wanted to make some resistance; I took out my cutlass, and told him I would lay his head open, and then he went very quietly; he said it was not him, that it was the deaf and dumb man that knocked the gentleman down.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you are correct in that? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the hat was found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Must they have passed that spot? - A. Yes, they must.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You took these two men into custody and do not know which way the other two men went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore they might have gone this way and thrown the hat there for any thing you know? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were you at the watch-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Had they each a hat on at the watch-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. (To Captain Askew.) Q. Look at that hat; is that the one you lost? - A. It is, I am perfectly sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Dyke's defence. I had been at a public-house in Green-street, and stopped there and had my supper, till half past eleven o'clock; I was going along Oxford-street and Smith overtook me, and was going the same way as me, and we past that gentleman; I believe that gentleman was drunk, he tumbled against us, and the dumb man turned round to look at him, and then he struck him with his stick; the dumb man did not offer to hit him again, but he called the watch, and I made off then.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence. (Interpreted by his brother.) I went to get between two people, and one of them struck me upon the head; the gentleman tumbled down, and I saw the hat but I do not know whose it was, I kicked it before me; the other man and I were walking along together; the gentleman struck me with a stick several times.</p>
               <p>For Dyke.</p>
               <p>HENRY THORNGATE sworn. - I keep the Pelham-Arms, in George-street, Grosvenor-square: He was a lodger of mine for three years when I kept the Roe-buck; he always paid me very honestly, and was very seldom out after eleven; he has not lodged with me since I have been in this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260016"/>house; the night that this happened he supped at my house, in the bar, along with me and my wife, and another gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other prisoner in company with him? - A. No, there was nobody with him; I perceived he was in liquor, and my wife wished him to stop all night, but he could not think of sleeping from home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What time did he go away? - A. At half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw any thing of him afterwards? - A. No; he is as worthy a fellow as ever lived, he was very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Dyke called three other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses were called for Smith, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury. it must be with very deep concern, that you find your attention now engaged upon a charge of murder; it is my duty to inform you, that every circumstance attending this unhappy deed, will demand of you a most solemn, patient, and comprehensive investigation, for, upon the bearing of very minute circumstances, establishing particular facts to your satisfaction will depend the application of the law, as you will receive it from the learned Judge; according as those facts fall within the contemplation of the law in different modes in which the law has considered the death of man, either as the facts will amount to the crime of murder, or as they may only amount to the crime of manslaughter, or the less criminal and less culpable offence of homicide. Gentlemen, upon this melancholy occasion, the person deceased, was a seaman in the King's service, and was employed in what they call a press-gang: but, upon the present occasion, from the particular circumstances of the case, you will not have to hear from the learned Judge, that clear authority, established where the execution of a power is entrusted to an officer of the navy, for the purpose of impressing seamen. Gentlemen, I will not call your attention to the case of the man, as it might arise, by possibility, under the contemplation of a murder, arising from doing an unlawful act. If, upon the present occasion, the clear authority established by law had been in the possession of the party, most undoubtedly his crime would have arisen to a murder upon a very different account than that which I shall take the liberty to state.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, on the 29th of March, the deceased was part of a press gang, under the immediate command of a midshipman, a Mr. Pritchard, not having with them the superior officer of the press-gang; if the lieutenant had been there, the case would have worn a very different complexion; however, as is very customary, the midshipman, together with a part of the gang, were dispatched upon that most disagreeable and dangerous service of endeavouring to impress seamen either upon the river or wherever they might be found: in consequence of an order given to this midshipman, he went in his boat with five of the gang with him down the river, and landed at Poplar; when they landed there, the gang were suffered to go into a public-house to refresh themselves; the midshipman took his station at the door, and had not been very long there before he saw the prisoner at the bar passing; he took him for a seaman, and concluded he would be a fit object of the impress service, although he was not armed with the especial authorities that the law requires, namely, the commission from the Admiralty, for that purpose, which is alone intrusted to the lieutenant of the navy, who was not present; they were then about doing that which would not have been strictly legal, but as is customary, to take men where they could be found, whom he supposed to be proper objects of an impress. Gentlemen, I am sure, to men of your description, I need say very little upon this necessity, and it is a necessity to be deplored, but still it is a necessity, and it is a necessity perfectly established in the very elementary principles of every state, and confirmed by the wisest and most temperate minds for a long time back in this country, to be com prisoner legal and constitutional, but I wish to give the prisoner every advantage of considering this matter not under a legal authority, but as a matter passing between indifferent men. The midshipman, as soon as he saw the prisoner pass, called his men from their place of refreshment; the signal which he gave them, was in the sea language, "all talk," which is a phrase they use on board-a-ship; the deceased came from the house, the other part of the gang came one after the other out of the house, and Mr. Pritchard, the midshipman, followed the prisoner at the bar; before they came up to him, he turned upon them, he presented a pistol towards them, told them, that if they approached he would fire; the midshipman was evidently a man of courage, the gang were likewise men of courage, they were not dismayed by this menace, they insisted upon passing him, he insisting, with his pistol presented towards them, that they should not pass, he swore he would shoot the first man that advanced: Mr. Pritchard, the midshipman, expostulated with him, and desired, that if he was determined to shoot, that he would shoot him, and not the men. Blake, the deceased, being a man of this fortitude, which I have hinted at, he swore in language but too customary with these men, d-n my eyes, but I will pass, the King's highway is as free for me as you; he therefore was attempting to pass, and in that attempt, he was shot by the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Now, Gentlemen, I take it for granted, that you yourselves will conclude immediately, that the prisoner at the bar knew these men were a press-gang, and that Mr. Pritchard,not with standing it would not have been a strictly justifiable and legal authority, when it was enquired into, was about to impress this man if he had turned out to be a proper object. Gentlemen, you are here called upon to exercise a very considerable degree of caution, under the direction of the learned Judge, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260017"/>apprehension of this man cannot amount to any justification, in point of law, for an act that leads to the death of another; that he might have apprehension that these men were about to impress him, cannot, in any possible contemplation of the nature of the human mind, admit, in a Court of Justice, of a warranty for what he has done.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I admit that the design most probably was to impress this man; but it is no more upon design than upon an apprehension in the mind, that the solid wisdom of the law establishes a resting place; a design in the mind must be manifested by acts before it can become either praise-worthy or blameable. In this particular case, for it is always best to consider the particular case, and not at all to deal in the abstract; in this particular case, the only manifestation of the design of the press-gang, which could have held out any possible excuse for any degree of violence, infinitely short of the fatal act that we have to complain of here, must have been carried into a degree of force, affecting his person, and restraining his liberty, no such thing happened here; he himself, whatever his apprehensions were upon this occasion, was the first aggressor, and the last.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the learned Judge will be very well aware of a case which happened so long ago as the year 1749, where a press-gang boarded a shop at Bristol without the proper officer, intrusted with the King's authority, being with them; there the distinction arises manifestly at once, they boarded the ship; so here, if the man had been on board a ship, and this press-gang had gone there without legal authority, then the case would have squared with that determination of which the learned Judge is apprized. In another case, if the prisoner had been in his house, and had been there assailed, or any attempt had been made to have forced into his house, there the case would have squared with that determination likewise; but here, upon the open way, where he might have gone about his business, where he might have attempted to have escaped by swiftness, to turn about, with the men advancing at some distance, threatening to shoot them if they approached, was a degree of rashness, accompanying his apprehension, most criminal indeed. Why, then, Gentlemen, as to the time taken up in this, that will remove the case from every possible consideration in the law which constitutes the crime of man slaughter; for the ingredient in manslaughter is a sudden uncontroulable gust of passion; here there is not that ingredient, for it is predetermined; he turns about, threatens them if they approach that he will shoot them, he having not right, nor pretence of right, to turn about in that situation; and afterwards, executes his purpose, fires the pistol, and kills the man.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, the crime of murder derived from malice aforethought, that malignity which seeks the life of another, I am afraid but too often must make its appearance here. Gentlemen, you find then, in this situation, that the prisoner stands not warranted in any degree, by any manifestation of their design, by any force used towards his person, by any attempt towards the restraint of his liberty; he, on the contrary, is rather the person, that restrains the liberty of those who are desiring to approach, makes use of menace, in order to manifest the intention of his mind, and, therefore, instead of having any one circumstance that can hold out a pretence of excuse for turning in that situation, for presenting his pistol, more particularly less for firing that pistol. - You find that the main ingredient of a murder here makes its appearance, that of the execution of a wicked purpose from a malice aforethought, from a predetermination that if that was done, which he himself chose to prohibit, that he would fire his pistol, which firing causes the death. Gentlemen, here the case stands for your contemplation, as between indifferent men; if it be possible, under the direction of the learned Judge, that you can find a degree of excuse for this rashness of his, I am perfectly contented that men of your description should receive and give him every possible advantage of such a contemplation. But, Gentlemen, you must in order to come at a perfect knowledge, as for as human beings are capable of coming at the knowledge of what passes in the mind of man; you must advert to some circumstances antecedent to this-that he was armed, not only with a pistol, but likewise with a sword. Gentlemen, having fired his pistol at Blake, the ball having wounded him, of which wound he afterwards died, Blake being a man of courage then struck him with a whip; upon which he instantly, with the butt end of his pistol, knocked Blake down; then it was, that another of the gang, Thomas, rushed upon him, seized the stick which Blake had before held, and knocked him down; in falling he attempted to draw the sword which he had, and as it was afterwards declared by him, if it had not been for the wresting of that sword from him by the hand of power, with that sword he was determined to have killed the midshipman.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in a case of this sort, you will naturally expect, where a scuffle takes place, where the whole of the business is not so accurately seen by all as by some, that there must be shades of difference in the testimony of the witnesses; Mr. Pritchard, I have told you, was forward upon the occasion, and when the man turned round and threatened to shoot, he exhorted him, if he was so determined, that he would shoot him, saying, at the same time, he did not mind his pistol for he had one too; he produced his pistol, and presented it at him. Now, Gentlemen, whatever was the behaviour of Mr. Pritchard after this act, whatever was the behaviour of any one of the men after the act, will not alter your contemplation of that very moment of time when he fired the pistol; and the other necessary enquiry, as to the state of his mind before the pistol was fired. These men, exasperated as they were for the death of their companion, used him in such a manner as they would not otherwise have done; he was secured, taken to a Magistrate's, and the poor man was taken to the hospital. Of course upon this occasion, there was a Coroner's Inquest summoned, to enquire upon the death; the Coroner's Inquest have made their enquiry, and upon what ground it was it is not for me to say, but they brought in a verdict, in this case, of justifiable homicide; the facts being made known to the officers of the Crown, it was expedient that they should enquire a little further into the business; the Magistrate thought it therefore his duty to apprehend the man, and he, in consequence of the previous determination of the Coro<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260018"/>ner's Jury, considered it as manslaughter only. It now comes before you, enabling you, if you think the facts call upon you, when you shall have heard the evidence, believing what they say, to establish this material fact, that he, the first aggressor, with malice aforethought, killed this man.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have taken the liberty to suggest to you the grounds upon which that establishment is likely to take place, together with the impossibility of all the circumstances or acts done by any part of this press-gang, giving him the least pretence of warrant in law for the malignant rashness which immediately followed the culpable apprehension. That the men might have intimated their purpose, and that he might so have understood it, goes not to a tittle of justification; the only ground upon which he could derive the least sanction for what he was about to do, would have been a violation of his liberty, or degree of force, and attack upon his person.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, upon an occasion of this fort, the most scrupulous examination is necessary; the men who appear on the part of the prosecution, should be attended to, and will be attended to by you, with every degree of jealousy, with every thing that is scrupulous; such an impression as they make upon your minds, such I am sure the Court will be satisfied with, and so shall I. Gentlemen, you shall hear these witnesses, you will hear the account of Mr.Pritchard, and of the other men who were there; it happens upon every melancholy occasion like this, where many witnesses are called forward, there will be different shades in their testimony, they are best submitted to a Jury of the country, twelve gentlemen, attentive to the manner in which a witness gives his evidence, and to the probable and natural circumstances attending a transaction, their determination will always be satisfactory. Upon this occasion you are not troubled with, nor will the learned Judge be troubled with any thing respecting the legality of the authority for impressing seamen; I admit that the authority with which the midshipman was armed, was not sufficient to have carried into effect, with any degree of violence or restraint, the execution of his purpose; and I therefore say, that though he was not armed with the legal authority, he did nothing but as a common man, he was warranted in doing; they did not advance to any attack, to any the least restraint of the liberty of this man, but he, on his part, was the aggressor, under a degree of sanguinary rashness of mind, which one cannot think of without very considerable horror; if therefore, upon the whole of the case, you shall be satisfied from his behaviour, with the time which he had for deliberation, that instead of deliberating upon the likelihood of making his escape, his mind was determined upon it with malice aforethought; you will do your duty, by finding him guilty of murder; if on the contrary, you find any part of this turn into a scuffle, into any attack, or any thing like an attack, and that in consequence of that, a sudden gust, and a natural gust of passion took place, and that under the influence of that, without premeditated malice, he killed the man, then assuredly it will be manslaughter; less than that it cannot by possibility be; you shall hear the witnesses, and I am sure your determination will be satisfactory.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe you are a midshipman in the impress service? - A. Yes; I had five under my command.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased one of those five? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time in the afternoon was it that you saw the prisoner at the bar? - A. about five o'clock; my men were at the sign of the King's-arms, near the river side, they call the place Mill Wall; I was at the door, and upon seeing the prisoner, I called out, "all talk," which is the signal for mustering the men together; upon that they followed me; one, I believe, staid behind to pay for the bread and cheese; we followed him, and hearing us behind him, and hearing the pass word, which he knew very well, he turned round with his face towards me, and presented a pistol at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he presented the pistol to you, had you said any thing to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you done any thing to him? - A. No; I was on the same path that he was, but he was before me; he said he would shoot the first man that came nearer to him; I then begged to speak a few words to him, which he granted; I asked him his name, he told me his name was Christie. belonging to the Young William; the whole of the time he was speaking to me, he walked backwards with his face to me, and kept himself upon his guard; I then asked him to suffer me to pass by him, which he refused, saying, the first man that came a step nearer to him, he would shoot; William Blake then made a similar request, which was denied him; Blake, in reply, said, d-m my eyes but I will go past you; Blake instantly started, with an intention to pass him, and he immediately shot him, the ball entered the right breast; Blake then endeavoured to make a blow at him, after he was shot, and his stick flew out of his hand, the prisoner instantly knocked him down with the muzzle of the pistol;

            , who was behind me, hearing the report of the pistol, rushed forwards and seized the stick that Blake had had in his hand, and knocked Chrissie down and secured him; when he was secured, he attempted to draw a weapon from under his coat, it was a sort of dagger that flies out of a stick, it is in Court, and the pistol too; he was then secured and taken to the boat; I proceeded up the river to New Crane-stairs, I landed them, and put the wounded man in a coach to go to the hospital, and what passed after that, I know not; in the boat, Christie said to me, he was sorry for what had happened, and that I owed my life to

               <p>Q. Are you of that description? - A. I am considered as such; I was then.</p>

            , for he meant to have shot Blake, and then run you through, is that upon the paper? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before the Coroner's Inquest, did you tell them of that expression? - A. I am not certain whether I did or not; at the time that I was before the Coroner's Inquest, I was interrogated so much, that I hardly knew what I was about, for there were half a dozen gentlemen asked me questions at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot recollect whether you told that or not? - A. I am positive it is a fact and a truth.</p>
               <p>Q. May I assume that you did not tell them that? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You were afterwards examined before a Magistrate, did you tell him that? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that? - A. I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear now, that you told him that expression; you were examined three different times, will you swear that any of those three times you made use of that expression? - A. I have only this to say, I have a very indifferent memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, perhaps, what you told him, you could not perfectly remember? - A. I am sure I mentioned it before Justice Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, were you sober at this time? - A. I considered myself as such.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you swear you were sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are as sure of that fact as of any other that you have spoke to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any body accusing you of being drunk? - A. I was very much agitated.</p>
               <p>Q. But you were never accused of being drunk? - A. Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon the prisoner coming by, you say, he heard you call out, "all talk," and that he knew it was to all out your men? - A. I have no doubt but he knew what it meant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say, that upon the gang coming out, you went towards him? - A. I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Should I mistake it if I said you pursued him when he tried to get away? - A. We walked after him; we intended to impress him, no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him, or were you told before you set out that he was upon his Majesty's service, and it was vain to attempt to take him, for mischief would ensue if you did? - A. Mr. Action said something like it, but I was not to mind what people say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not his words these: do not be after any of your old tricks, that man is a mate in the service of one of the transports, and it is vain to attempt to take him? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you say, that let him be a mate of a transport, or the devil himself, you would have him? - A. I did not; I said it signified nothing, I will over-hawl him, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say you are drunk, and you will repent this? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you were drunk? - A. It was impossible I should be drunk, I had drank but one glass of grog after dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who kept that house? - A. No; I was in at Mr. Acton's.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know who keeps the public-house? - A. I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a Mr. Mills? - A. Yes; he keeps the King's-head, at East-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been there? - A. I called there as I was going across the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Mills was an old acquaintance of your's? - A.No more than any other, I had a pint of porter every day from there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him for any arms? - A. I called for a pistol that I left the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing else about arms? - A. I passed a joke, and asked him to lend me a hanger.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you remember his saying, in this state I will not trust you with a cutlass, you are drunk? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He did refuse it you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember saying, at least I have a right to my own pistol? - A. I took it.</p>
               <p>Q.After this unfortunate accident you went again to Mills's? - A. Yes; after the man was gone to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing particular passing upon this subject there? - A. I only went to order a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you been drinking there in the morning? - A. I do not recollect that I had any thing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. You were there in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was three times then you were there? - A. I go every morning to look after my boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260020"/>since? - A. Yes; I have been called to an account by his wife, several time, about the accident, because Christie was a particular friend of their's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember shewing him your minute? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember telling him you would make it still better? - A. Mills pretended to be a friend of mine, and I shewed it him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember his objecting to some things in it, and altering it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only note you have wrote? - A. That is the only time I ever put pen to paper upon the subject; I delivered a copy of it to Captain

               <p>Q.

He said his name was Christie, and he belonged to the Young William.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what ship that was? - A. She was a transport, in what service she is at present I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What service was she in at the time of the accident? - A. I believe in the merchant service.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Upon your coming up to him, with the rest of the gang, did not you make use of these words, d-n you if you are good at that, I have got one too, and did not you then draw your pistol and level it at him? - A. He said he would shoot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not draw backwards for an hundred and fifty yards, you all the time trying to get round him with these men? - A. He did a good way.</p>
               <p>Q. The place itself is a causeway, with the water on one side, and a deep ditch on the other? - A. A marsh on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he must know you meant to get round him, in a place where he could not possibly escape? - A. We meant to over-hawl him, no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you try to take hold of him by the hand, and said, by God, let you be what you will I will have you? - A. I wanted to shake hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you snap your pistol at him? - A. I am perfectly sure I did not, I told him in the boat that he as much deserved to be shot as the poor man that lay in the boat, but the laws of his country should punish him.</p>
               <p>Court. I put it to you, Mr. Fielding,"I think it is impossible this can amount to murder; and I think it is as impossible but it must be manslaughter. Gentlemen of the Jury, We have interfered in this case, it appearing that the evidence is not likely to be varied, and that it can only amount to manslaughter; that being our clear opinion in point of law, perhaps you will be satisfied to find him guilty of manslaughter upon this evidence.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What time was it this matter took place? - A. About half past six o'clock in the evening, it was dark, and we had lights in the windows; I was sitting close to the left-hand door, there were two doors to the parlour, and I saw those goods taken out of the window.</p>

             sworn. - I am sister to Mrs. Cook: I was at my brother's house on the 17th of of February, I saw the prisoner, John Darley, there; he was directed to mind the windows while we were at tea.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you live with your brother? - A. Yes; I heard a noise; I cannot tell what noise, but it alarmed me; I went into the shop and found the goods were stolen out of the right-hand window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner, Darley, in the shop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did he return afterwards? - A. It was upwards of half an hour; my sister was sitting near the left-hand door, she stepped momentarily out, and saw the man; there were three bundles of silk stockings, two coloured, and one black.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The prisoner generally wears a cocked hat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was an immediate alarm made when the stockings were missed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM ALLEN sworn. - I am brother-in-law to Mr. Cook: I was at his shop on the 17th of February, in the back parlour at tea; the prisoner at the bar was porter; I was there at the time that he had orders to go and watch the window; Mrs. Cook was near the door. I heard a noise, and Mrs. Cook immediately moved and went into the shop; I did not see the prisoner afterwards for half an hour or rather more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe you attended the second examination? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not asked by the Magistrate where a person of the name of Cox was to be found or not? - A. No; he did not ask me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the name of Cox never mentioned? - A. When I pursued the thief, I should say that Cox said he had met a man running up the court, but he did not know who he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you not tell the Magistrate that you did not know where Cox was to be found? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go yourself and converse with Cox? - A. I asked Cox whether he knew the man that run up the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the porter constantly wear a cocked hat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>SARAH FARR sworn. - I live next door to Mr. Cook's house; the prisoner came to my house between six and seven o'clock in the evening for half a quartern of gin; about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, Mr. Cook came, and enquired if Darley had been to my house, I told him he had.</p>

In consequence of Mr. Layton calling upon me I searched for the ladle, and missed it; I then went to the prisoner in the watch-house where she was, she began crying, and said, how cruel it was to rob me after I had behaved so well to her; I told her I missed other articles, and I begged that she would confess for the sake of the other servants; I went the next morning to Marlborough-street, where Mr. Layton was with the ladle; he has kept it ever since.</p>

             sworn. - The prisoner at the bar offered me this ladle in pledge on the 18th of March; I asked her who it belonged to, and she said a Mr. Fisher, a master cabinet-maker, in Oxford-road; I said it was not marked with Mr. Fisher's name; she said that may be, because my master is out, and my mistress is ill in bed, and, I believe, her son went out and borrowed it to raise some money; I rather doubted the story altogether; she said there was a person lived in the next street that, if I would send to, would vouch for her character; I told her I would charge the watch with her; she said, if I would not charge the watch with her she would tell me the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you would not charge the watch with her? - A. No, I did not; she then began to say that she had been dabbling in the lottery, and she meant to have pawned this to get out some clothes that a person, where she had chaired, had had a death in their family, and had given her a suit of black; she had made free with it, and wanted to get it out to appear in at the gentleman's house the next day; I was determined to call the watch, she was taken to the watch-house, and there she named Mr. Gunter, in consequence of which, I went to him. (The ladle was deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Gunter has been a worthy master to me, I hope he will be favourable; he always behaved well to me.</p>

I told him we had not any; he asked when I should have any; I told him we did not kill any sheep at all, he might get some in Long-lane; he said it was for a child in a fever, to put on its feet; he went out, and in about ten minutes after I heard the chain of the watch rattle, it hung on a china image on the mantle-shelf, in the parlour behind the shop; I heard the parlour-door shut to, and I went toward the parlour, and saw the prisoner go out of the shop, I was backwards chopping wood for the fire; directly after he went out of the shop, I acquainted Mr. Porter of it, and he went after him, and overtook him, and he was taken to the Compter. Mr. Hart, the constable, brought the watch back soon after seven o'clock.</p>

             sworn. - I am coachman to Mr. Cooper of Southampton-buildings, my master's coach stands at Jockey's-fields: A little after nine o'clock, as I was putting my pole into the carriage, a Hackney-coach came down the mews, and was ordered to turn round, I don't know who ordered it to turn round; and I saw a box put into the coach, it came out of Mr. Lewis's stable-door; I was at my own coach-house, about five or six yards distance.</p>

               <p>Q.Was there any thing put in besides the box? - A. A little white bundle; they got into the coach and ordered the coachman to drive to Great Russel-street, the corner of some place, I don't know where. I said to John Humphreys I would follow the coach on suspicion; there being no light, I followed it on my own coach-box, I drove to the corner of Wooburn-street; when I came up to the coach, Miss Ladbrook's servant had got the box on his shoulder, they went down Wooburn-street, I followed them no further.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner at the bar? - A. I spoke to the prisoner at the bar, and asked him where he lived; he said he belonged to Mr. Lewis of Bedford-row; I told him he would recollect he had got a box out of Mr. Lewis's stable; he said he knew he had; I told him I knew he had, because I saw him lock the door, and put the key in his pocket.</p>

On the 26th of last month I was out of town, I returned on the Monday morning, and the first information of the transaction I received from Mrs. Lewis; in consequence of that information I was led to think the prisoner at the bar had been in the stable, and I called him up into my room, I had the housekeeper up at the same time, and my own coachman; I asked him if he had been in the stable on the Sunday; he said he had; I asked him who was in company with him; he said, at first, that Mr. Worrel's groom had been with him in the stable; I asked him if Mr. Worrel's groom had a laced hat on, he said, no; I then told him I understood that that person who was in the stable with him had a laced hat on; then he said, it was William, a servant who had just left my place; I asked him what business he had there with William; he said he was assisting him to take his things away out of the stable; I asked him if the things had been under his care; he said, no, but that the coachman had them, and that he was assisting to take them out of the coachman's stable; I asked him, if they were in the coachman's care what business had he to take them away from the coachman's stable; and the coachman, who was present, told me, that the thing which the prisoner had taken out of the stable were the things which he had before had in his custody; I asked him what things they were; he said he did not know particularly, he believed they were old clothes; I asked him what they were in; he said a square box, and a bundle; I then observed to him, that it was very extraordinary that he should have things belonging to this man; and then I asked him to tell me the truth.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260031"/>Court. Q. Did you make him any promises? - A. None; he said that was the truth; I asked where William lived; he said he did not know; I observed to him that it was very extraordinary; I asked whether William was to call again; he said, yes; I asked when; he said to-morrow; I said, what is he to call on you for; he said he wished to befriend him; I told him I thought it was a very extraordinary connection, and observed to him, that I thought he had done something very bad; I then desired him to give me an account of his plate, which was very correct.</p>
               <p>Q.After this conversation did he go out? - A. Yes; I told him he must quit my place that day month; and about five o'clock, after we had dined, he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out after him, and were to? - A. When I understood he was gone out, and I had got information that the person who was in the stable was Miss Ladbrooke's servant, it struck me it was probable he might be gone to Miss Ladbrooke's; I went to Miss Ladbrooke, and mentioned to her the circumstance; I begged her permission to have her servant up, which she gave, and he was called up, his name is

               <p>Court. Q. What conversation had you with the prisoner, did you make use of any promises or threats to induce him to confess? - A. No; I asked him where he had been; he said, that as he understood I meant to send him to prison to-morrow, he had gone out to see a friend; I asked who his friend was; he said it was Mr. Tubb's servant, in Bedford-square; I asked him if he had been no where else, he said, no; I asked him if he had not been at Miss Ladbrooke's house, he said, no; I asked him if it was not Miss Ladbrooke's servant that had been with him the night before in my stables.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did he say in answer to that? - A. He said, no; I told him he had told me a great many falsities in the morning, and that those were falsehoods likewise; I told him he had been at Miss Ladbrooke's, that Miss Ladbrooke's servant was with him in the stable, and that the box and bundle which he took out of the stable contained wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say whose wine it was? - A. I told him I suspected it was my wine; he denied it, then I told him I had Miss Ladbrooke's servant at the door, and the wine, also the man who kept the house where Miss Ladbrooke's servant had an apartment; he then exclaimed, Oh! sir, you watched me to Miss Ladbrooke's, and cried; I asked him how he had got the wine, he said, it was the savings out of the bottles, and entreated me to have mercy on him.</p>
               <p>Q.During the time that last conversation took place, Ward and Hinsall were present? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I see that the indictment charges forty-two bottles of wine-how many servants have you? - A. Three or four servants.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore I take it for granted it was impossible to carry out of your house, at one time, such a quantity of wine, unless it was carried out by one or two bottles at a time? - A. I take it it was not so, because the box and bundle contained the quantity; I think there were two dozen and an half in the box, and one dozen in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q.Your cellar is attached to your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not imagine it must have been taken away by one or two bottles at a time? - A. It appears to me, that it must have been carried away all at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not taken originally from your cellar one or two bottles at a time? - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had this man the care of your cellar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any wine? - A. No; I trusted the care of my cellar to my house-keeper; I did not keep any accurate account of the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever quantities of wine might have been taken from your cellar, you are certain that box was the box taken from your out-house? - A. Yes; I went into the cellar afterwards, and I dis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260032"/>covered there had been several bottles taken from pipes that were set up by themselves, that were not come into use, to a considerable amount.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Portal). Look at the twenty yards of muslin, can you swear to it? - A. Yes, I can, from its having my own hand-writing on it at each end.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value of it? - A. It has been cut since I had it, it was in one piece when she took it, the piece cost me six guineas, at 5s. 9d. a yard.</p>

               <p>Q. The three yards and three quarters of muslin, can you prove that to be your's? - A. Yes; but there is not my mark on that part, because the prisoner has made part of it into a petticoat; I value that at 24s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. All the articles, excepting the petticoat, were found in the box, which Mr. Parker brought to your house? - A. Yes; except little trifling articles.</p>
               <p>Q. The twenty yards of muslin is now in two pieces? - A. It is in two pieces, I cannot tell the length of them now.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell whether they were taken in one piece or two pieces, they might have been taken at different times for what you can tell? - A. They certainly might.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any door immediately from the one to the other? - A.No; it is about five feet across a yard; there is a wall goes round the yard. In the morning when I got up, I was informed that I had been robbed, and I immediately went over to Noah's house, he lived opposite to me; he was not at home, his wife sent him over to me when he came home; he deals in lead, and I had gone over to give him information if any should be offered for sale, to stop it; he told me he had no lead at present, but if any should come, he should know what to do with it, that was all that passed. I found one piece of lead, that I can identify, in a cart, the Saturday night following, about nine o'clock. (It is produced).</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure that is a piece that you lost the night of the 13th, or morning of the 14th? - A. Yes; I am sure of it, it was a piece that was on the block not finished; the cart was going out of Great George-street, there were Noah and Jefcourt, with the cart, and somebody else that got away. They both said they did not know any thing about the property; they were stopped just as I came up to the cart; there was three hundred weight of lead in the cart, besides this; I did not see any body else with it; the other was sheet lead, which I believe to be mine, but I cannot pretend to swear to it. The lock of the shop-door had been forced open with a chissel, or something, it was a very great strain; I suppose they came over the wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. This shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260038"/>was built after the dwelling-house was built? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to go into it, you go out of one door from the dwelling-house, and through another door into the shop? - A. Yes; there is a little bit of an angle of about five feet between the two doors.</p>
               <p>Q. It was on Tuesday night that you lost your lead? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday following you found it in a cart? - A. Yes; a small part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see either of the prisoners with the cart? - A. Yes, I did; they were stopped just as I came up to the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see either of the prisoners driving, or accompanying the cart? - A. I did not.</p>

             sworn. - On Thursday, the 16th of February last, I was going along with my cart and horse to collect some old iron.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by collecting? - A. To buy old iron; I always go all along Westminster once a week, and stop at all the old iron shops; I stopped at Mr. Noah's shop, and asked if he had any old iron; he told me he had; I laid out with him about fifteen shillings and sixpence for iron; afterwards he told me he had something, that he could put a few pounds in my pocket; I asked him what it was; and he said, it could not be done before night, on account that it belonged to a person opposite the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a very intimate friend of Noah's? - A. I used to buy old iron of him; he told me he could put a few pounds in my pocket; I asked him what it was; and he told me it was lead, and he would show my partner where the lead lay; he said, it could not be at his house because it belonged to the prosecutor; my partner went with the horse and cart to the foot of Westminster-bridge, and I went with him, and saw the lead; he asked me what I could afford to give for it, and asked me, if I would give ten shillings a hundred; I told him I would.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is it really worth? - A. We give fourteen shillings for it, and sell it, for fourteen shillings and sixpence, old lead, but this was new; I did not take it away that evening because I wanted to find out the prosecutor's name, and I told him I could not fetch it till Saturday night; I saw him on Saturday, and gave him information of it; I went to a public-house and sent for him, I would not go to him because of the prisoner living opposite the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what had passed between you and Noah? - A. Yes; I then took my horse and cart, and fetched it away; I got the lead loaded in the cart; when the cart had been loaded with four or five pieces, Mr. Noah desired me to put the cart in Cartwright-street, and he would look out to see if there were any officers about; he knew them all, and three others were to go with the cart; the cart was put into Dartmouth-row, in a bye-place; Jefcourt, and two others, went with the cart, the two others got off; Jefcourt was to have gone home with Noah to my house, because he would not trust him to receive the money alone; Mr. Noah agreed with me for ten shillings a hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was your cart removed from the place where it was loaded before it was stopped? - A. I cannot say rightly; it might be fifty or sixty yards; the cart was stopped by

               <p>Q. Did he give you any information of your lead? - A.He did, and an appointment was made in consequence of it; I directly went for two officers, he told me where they were to load the cart in Cartwright-street, he was to give us a signal when it was loaded; but before the signal was given, a young man came and told us the cart was loaded, and we went out and met the cart; Noah and Jefcourt, and two other persons, were present.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at them, are they the two men that passed you? - A. They are; I then got on my horse, and saw them before me, one of them had got off his horse, and was going gently.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, had you any suspicion they were improper people? - A.None at all; when I overtook them, there was one about ten yards before the other; I overtook Chester first, and was going to speak to him, but when I saw their faces, they were not as I expected them, and then the other, who was about ten yards before, turned his horse round and met me, with a pistol in his hand, that was Perry, and then the other, Chester,came up behind me with a pistol, then Perry demanded my pocket-book, which I gave to him.</p>
               <p>Q. That contained nothing valuable? - A. No, nothing of any value; then the other prisoner, Chester, demanded my money, which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was there? - A. Forty-two guineas and an half in gold, one dollar and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know how many guineas, or how many half-guineas? - A. No, I do not, there were a good many half-guineas; I know I begged for mercy, and hoped they would not misuse me.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not, however, ill-use you? - A. No; the prisoner, Perry, said, I was not to go off so; he gets from his horse, and cuts my girths, and likewise the bridle reins.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not make use of either bridle or saddle? - A. No; he then got on his horse, and they both rode off.</p>
               <p>Q. Having seen them on Finchley-Common, and passing you on the road, and at the time they were with you, had you an opportunity of observing both their countenances? - A. Yes; particularly at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any disguises over their faces? - A. Not that I perceived; only their faces were very dirty as if they had not washed them very lately.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no handkerchief put over them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You will recollect upon your oath, and the men's life depends on it, have you any doubt they are the men? - A. I never was so certain of any one thing in my life; Perry I looked very hard in the face, when he came round my horse's head.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you say that, did you speak to one or both? - A. Both; my horse is a very gentle horse, and I went to the Duke of York's-head, and from there I went in pursuit, but could not find them; I went to Bow-street the same day, about two o'clock in the afternoon, and gave information, and about eleven in the morning, on the next day, I saw them again, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them, when you saw them? - A.Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they, at that time, standing by themselves, or with other persons? - A.They were standing by themselves, and I recollected them directly.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any money produced when you were at Bow-street? - A. Yes; there was a guinea among it, that I recollect being among mine, from the appearance of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Although you saw the two persons that robbed you, on Finchley-Common, you did not see their faces? - A. No, not at that time, when they were behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, the only opportunity you had of observing their countenances was during the time you were robbed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260041"/>Q. You, I think, had been to town to Smithfield market? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps your business had kept you up all night? - A. No, I had been to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, when one person came up with a pistol before, and another behind you, you were under no inconsiderable degree of alarm? - A. I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. That alarm might prevent you from observing their countenances so accurately as if you had not been frightened? - A. I could perceive them perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Being frightened as you were, could you observe their countenances so perfectly as if you had not been? - A. Not quite so perfectly; but I am perfectly sure of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you more positive to the countenance of one than of the other, having more opportunity of seeing him? - A. Perry came up facing me, and I took particular notice of his face, and likewise at the time he was cutting my girths.</p>
               <p>Q. But you paid more attention to one than the other? - A. I am perfect in them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you had equal opportunity of observing both of them? - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said, that you should not know the persons of the men who robbed you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any talk of that kind? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure, that at Islington, you had no conversation of that sort? - A.Quite.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the officers of Bow-street: I went with my brother officer to Perry's lodgings, I found in his breeches-pocket a guinea and a half, four dollars, and two shillings; and I was present when the pistols were found, and also this powder-horn, with a small quantity of powder in it, (produces it); and then I took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Look at that guinea that is in a paper; is that the guinea that was produced to you at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what belief or knowledge you have whether that was part of the money you lost? - A. I believe that was one of the guineas; but I don't pretend to swear to money.</p>
               <p>Perry's defence. I deal in horses to kill, and I likewise deal in pigs, that is the way I came by the money, and I will prove it by witnesses, and the way the money came to be found where it was, is, that there is never a lock to any door in the house, and I put the money there for safety, and the officers knew the same.</p>
               <p>Chester's defence. He said first, the men were in great coats, with velvet collars; he said, he believed we were the men, and then they called him on one side and tutored him, and then he said, he was sure of it; they have done it to swear away my life.</p>

               <p>Mrs. LANE sworn. - I am the wife of the prosecutor; on Saturday evening, the 15th of April, I marked three dollars, and gave them back to the clerk, Francis Lisle, and I saw him put them in the till; I saw them there about twelve on Sunday night, and on the Monday morning was informed one of them was missing; I desired the man to shew me what money he had in his pocket, he had but one dollar, and that I knew was not one of them; about nine o'clock, when the prisoner came in, I desired to see his money, and amongst it was one dollar that I had marked; after he was taken away, we found a key that we supposed he had dropped, that opened all the three drawers.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Lane; I have frequently missed sums of money; I suspected the prisoner, and on Saturday night the 15th, Mrs. Lane marked all the money I had in the till, except the copper, which she did not mark; I deposited all the money that was marked in the till myself, and locked the till; some time after nine o'clock, and I think it was not ten, to the best of my recollection, I then, with the other young man who boards with me, went home directly, and did not return till the Monday morning, a little after seven o'clock; I then unlocked my till and pulled out a paper, in which I had an exact account of the money that was in the till, and found a dollar missing, and a half-crown substituted in its stead; I waited a short time, and Mrs. Lane came down stairs, and I communicated it to her, the prisoner was then out; immediately upon his return, I believe, Mr. Lane searched him, and I was dispatched for a constable in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had the care of the till? - A. Yes; of the library-till.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been often called to an account for deficiencies? - A. No; I always felt myself responsible for every farthing in my accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you always made up the deficiencies? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. If your accounts appeared fair and honest, there was no deficiency to make up; if they were not clear, you were compelled to make up the deficiency? - A. I compelled myself.</p>

               <p>Q. The footman was examined, and suspicions fell upon him? - A. No; I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath? - A. Upon my oath I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not as certain, as you are of the existence of a God, that he was examined? - A. I do not know that he was, because I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he was examined? - A. I was informed that the servant had been asked to shew what money he had.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying just now, you did not know, do you believe nothing but what you see? - A.Exactly so, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not believe that man took the money, because you did not see him? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the half guineas and shillings marked as well as the dollar? - A. Yes; in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no half guineas nor shillings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not your master threatened you, if you did not regularly account for the property in the till? - A. I should suppose my master never suspected me of a dishonest action.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the keeper of the till? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has that young man lived at Mr. Lane's? - A. It may be three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a married man? - A. I believe he is a single man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you would have us understand that the person, who took the dollar, left half-a-crown in the room of it? - A. That is the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me you never had any threats from your master? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say to your master there is a deficiency in the money, and he said, you must make it up? - A. That was the case the 1st of April, there were 5s. I could not account for, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260045"/>observation I made upon it was, that some light might be thrown upon it in future.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master did not make you pay that 5s.? A. I gave myself credit for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not expected to be dismissed from your service, if you did not regularly account for the property under your care? - A. That has always been my natural feelings.</p>
               <p>Q.This was the library-till? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any deficiency in the other till that night? - A. No; I am the superintendent of the library.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Lane). These two tills are perfectly distinct from each other? - A.Perfectly distinct, under separate locks and keys; the prisoner was the porter, he had nothing to do with either of the tills in any shape whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came in at nine o'clock, what did you do? - A. I had heard of the dollar being so missing from the till; I took him by the collar immediately as he came in, and I said, I am very sorry to find that I must now examine you; he was then taken into an inner accompting-house, and I immediately searched him, and on turning out his breeches pocket, I found three dollars, I laid them upon the table, one of which I have in my hand; Mrs. Lane then said, that is the dollar I marked on Saturday night, and picked it out from the other two; knowing that no access could be had to these tills without forcing the lock, and that Mr. Lisle, the librarian, having lost the key appertaining to his till, it occurred to me that the prisoner might have that key in his possession, and on searching him, he slipped a key down his leg between his stocking and his flesh, which I found, but that was not the key of this till; on the next morning, the key was found which had been delivered by me to the librarian, to lock up his till, which at the time it was delivered to the librarian would only open one lock; but since that time, the key, which I have now in my hand, will, by some alteration, open the three different tills.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You gave the key to the librarian? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The librarian, I believe, still continued in your house after the prisoner was apprehended? - A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the parlour he was searched? - A. Yes; it is a sort of back accompaing house.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Lisle and those other persons about the house might have had access to it? - A. That is my inner accompting-house belonging to myself, and no servants dare come there, unless they are sent for in.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not keep the door locked? - A.We do not keep an officer at the door to prevent it, they may come in irregularly.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed him putting a key between his leg and his stocking? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you were looking pretty sharp, and three persons were in that room, and nobody saw this key drop? - A. It was found exactly where he had stood the next morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is Mr. Lisle's character? - A. Since he has been in my service, I have no reason to doubt his fidelity, nor that of the footman.</p>

               <p>Q. Oh, it was all fixed then to lay it upon the prisoner? - A. No; he was suspected.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it you found the key? - A. Yes; in the breakfast-parlour, near where the prisoner stood, the next morning, and I gave it to the librarian.(Mr. Lane produced the key).</p>

               <p>Q. Were the candles lit? - A. Yes; I was sitting by the shop fire, and saw the prisoner open the door, and take the cloth out of the shop, it was in several remnants, I ran out directly, there was a light in the shop; when he saw me coming, I saw him throw the cloths down; I ran after him, and left the cloths lying, I was within a yard of him the whole time, I never lost sight of him; when he had run about one hundred yards, he fell, and a person took hold of him, and I came up and took hold of him too, and brought him back to the shop; he had thrown them down about half way in the door, and half way out, and the shopman picked them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No; but I came to speak to them, they are here, I took them to Bow-street myself, my master has had the care of them ever since that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon them? - A. Not particular; but they have been kept separate from the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise when he came in? - A. No; I felt the wind come, and I turned round, and saw him come in; I had been at the door just before, and it was then shut.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear the latch listed up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these cloths? - A. About 10l. I believe they are worth more.</p>

               <p>Q.What does your family consist of? - A. Six small children, a niece, a wife, and myself; we all went out together; I barred the windows and locked the doors myself; we all returned together exactly at eight o'clock the same evening; I had seen the property not a minute before I left the house, I had been to the bureau for some papers, it was all safe then, and I locked the bureau, I never do leave it open, nobody has the key but myself; about ten minutes after I returned, I went up stairs, and saw a pocket-book lying upon the bureau open in the bed-room up one pair of stairs; all my papers were tumbled and thrown about in a most terrible manner, and the property was gone; there was a five pound Bank note, and ten guineas, tied up in a bag that was missing, bag and all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon the bag? - A.None at all; there was in another bag a ten pound Bank note with my name upon the bag, the note was gone, and the bag left; in another bag were five guineas in silver, and in another bag about five or six shillings worth of halfpence, a crown-piece, a half-crown-piece, and several pieces of coin, a silver coral, and two silver tea-spoons.</p>

               <p>Q.Nothing has been traced but this five pound Bank note? - A. No; I did not recollect the number of the note at the time I missed it, but I recollected that I had taken it with another five pound note at Messrs.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do not you know, that his Majesty had done Dr. Willis the honour of giving him that horse? - A. I did not know that at the time, I considered him as the King's horse, and had him under my care as such.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Gray.) According to your judgment, is that the hair off that horse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Higginbotham.) Is it hair from a horse's tail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Gray.) Q. I dare say, you would not pledge yourself to swear positively, that that hair came from that horse? - A. No, but it is like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you learned since, that it had been before presented by his Majesty to Dr. Willis? - A. I did not know that it was horse that, I know it is now.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I keep the Swan public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the deceased and another man, coming to your house on the 25th of March? - A. Yes; the door was shut up, and Allen, and Withers came up, and said, they would break the door open, if I did not let them in, then they said, they would have but one pot of beer, and be quiet; they came in, and had a pot of beer, and the moment they had got the money, they began to fight; the first hit me, Mrs. Withers then got hold of my hair, and began pulling as hard as she could; I begged for peace, and desired that there might be no fighting.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. They did not make this attack upon you, without your having said something, or done something? - A.Nothing at all; they fixed upon a man that lodged at my house, and said, he was gone out of the house upon something that he should not have been about, and then they began fighting; we got them out of doors, and we had a scuffle out of doors, and the patrol came up, and I did him command peace.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. After you got them out of the house, what passed there? - A. They pulled their cloaths off, and tried to beat us to conquer us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body fighting when they came up? - A. Yes; Withers and I were both upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Allen doing at that time? - A. I do not know, but I heard Mr. Baker commanding peace.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the blow was struck? - A. No, I did not see that; I had got into the house first.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HUGHES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am ostler at the Swan: On Saturday night, I was sitting in the house, when Mr. Withers, and the poor man that is dead, and another man, whose name I do not know, came to the door, they swore they would come in; Mr. Colley begged of them not; they begged very hard for a pot of beer, and they were let in, and as soon as they had come in, they pitched upon a young fellow that sat behind me, I do not know his name, and Withers said, he had run away from him the Saturday night before; no, says the young man, I do not know that I ever saw you before in my life; they had some words, and he pitched a top of this young fellow, and Withers hit my master twice in the mouth, and I got up and tumbled him down in the house, and I told him that was the second time he had been there, and always tried to kick up a dust; we got them all out of doors, and then Withers, and I and my master were all down together.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Allen doing at that time? - A. I do not know; while I was down, Witchers bit my ear; I said, do not bite my ear off, and then the patrol came up, and my master applied for peace; my master got in with Creedland, and I staid out, and this Allen was bullocking very much, Baker and I were standing together.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, had Creedland gone in doors with Colley? - A. Yes; then Allen ran at Baker, and pegged at him, and told him he would beat his head off; he ran at him twice, I cannot say, whether he caught hold of him or not; he said, you had better be quiet, for I will not be handled by any body; he had his fist clenched, and he told him he would hear his head off, and his eyes out; Baker and I both desired him to be quiet, and advised him to go home, he swore he would not, and he ran at him again, with both his hands up to his face, and then Baker struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he aim to strike Baker? - A. I believe he would if he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the deceased after this happened? - A. Yes, on the Thursday following; I had part of two pots of beer with him, and he said, he was very sorry for what he had done, that he could blame nobody but himself.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Bennett? - A. Yes; he kept cash at our house, the account was opened in the early part of September last.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was recommended to your house by a friend of Messrs Bonds? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any bills being brought to your house, by Mr. Bennett, and when? - A. There were bills brought by Mr. Bennett, and deposited in Mr. Bond's hands, on the 13th of January last, they were three bills of exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell me if that is one of the bills? - A. Yes; this is one that was left at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose were they left there? - A. They were entered short to Mr. Bennett's account.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Mr. Bennett again? - A. The 16th, three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what passed between you and Mr. Bennett? - A. When he came in, he filled up two drafts for the sum of between three and four hundred pounds; I said, the account was overdrawn, and desired him to walk into the counting-house; I turned to his account in the ledger, and found it was as I supposed; I went to him in the counting-house, and told him the account was much over-drawn, he seemed surprised, and said, why, are not those bills that I left with you the other day, discounted? I told him, no it was not agreeable to discount them; he pressed very much for the money, and said, that some other securities that were at that time in Mr. Bond's hands, would cover more than the sum he wanted to draw.</p>
               <p>Q. What other securities were those? - A. They were India warrants; Mr. Bennett was very pressing for the accommodation, he said, it would only be for a day or two, I have the cheques. (Produces them.) The amount of them is 3761. 13s. 8d.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had not left those bills, and the warrants that you have described, should you have let him have had that sum of money? - A. It is a difficult question to answer what I might have done, but I rather think I should.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Mr. Bennett again? - A. On the 24th of the same month, nothing passed then respecting this bill; I saw him afterwards, at the Poultry-Compter, on the 31st of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation respecting this bill, previous to the 31st of January? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260058"/>Mr. Fielding. Q. You visited this young man, I believe, pitying his distress; how long did you continue your persuasions to him to disclose the truth of the transaction before he said any thing upon the subject? - A. I made use of no persuasions to induce him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Tell us exactly the conversation that took place between you and Mr. Bennett in the Poultry-Compter? - A. I deplored his situation that he should be in such a place as that, and told him his account was considerably over-drawn; he said, the warrants which we had in our hands sufficiently covered Mr. Bonds from any loss; I told him we had discovered that the warrants were forgeries; Mr. Bennett said, if you know that, I am a dead man; Mr. Bennett was certainly very much embarrassed at the time he said that; I immediately added, after saying that the warrants were forgeries, that I supposed the bills were of the same description; he said, they were; he pressed me very much that those things should not come forward; I told him it did not rest with me; Mr. Bennett mentioned a person that owed him some money, a Mr. Asbee, he told me the amount, which he said was six hundred pounds; that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that note in your hand again, look at the indorsement, and tell me whose hand-writing that appears to be? - A. I believe it to be Mr. Bennett's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him write? - A. Oh, frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. From the knowledge you have of his handwriting, do you believe that to be his? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the acceptance of that bill, and tell me whose hand-writing you believe that to be? - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fidding. Q. You have told me, very honourably, that you rather think you might have let him have the cash he required without regarding any security? - A. Not any but those securities.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 13th of January last he brought the three bills? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You entered them, you say, short; that is, that you did not look upon his deposit of these bills as equivalent to cash? - A. No, not at the time I made the entry, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact, you did not give him credit for having paid in so much in cash as would have been the amount of these bills? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q.These bills you had no idea of discounting? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him it would not have been agreeable to have discounted these bills at all? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you, when he wanted this three or four hundred pounds, that the India Bonds deposited with you would cover the whole of what he had over-drawn, and the advances you were about to make? - A. He said, it would cover the account.</p>
               <p>Q. Not at all adverting to these three bills of Exchange that he had deposited on the 13th? - A. I had my mind in contemplation that we had those bills, and though we did not chuse to discount them, they certainly might be considered as an additional indicement to advance money.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact, you did not discount them, nor had you any intention to discount them? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. And he left them there without asking any money at all upon them? - A. I do not recollect particularly what passed; only I remember receiving the bills, and entering them short.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, on the 16th, he said, the India warrants would cover the whole? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you advanced the money, and nothing more was done; were these bills at any time, to your knowledge, put into any channel of negociation? - A. There was nothing took place respecting these bills from that time till the forgery was discovered, they remained in our house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw this unhappy young man in his confinement, you are correct in the language he used, he said, if you had discovered them to be forged, then he was a dead man? - A. I would not say so if it was not so.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not say that he had any connection with the forgery of them? - A. No.</p>

            ; the prisoner at the bar came to our house about three weeks before this happened, by the Portsmouth coach or mail, I cannot say which; he acted the part of a gentleman all the time he was there, which was a fortnight or three weeks, he slept there every night; on the 15th of March, in the morning, he came down rather sooner than usual.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was his room to that in which Mr. Diamond slept? - A. They were two different ways; this gentleman's room went up one flooring to the left, and the prisoner's went up another flooring to the right; he came down and desired me to get his breakfast, I did not get it immediately, and he asked me two or three times for it; I got it him, and after he had had his breakfast, he desired a coach to be called; there was one of our hackney coaches in the yard going out, and he went with it, his portmanteau was brought down, and he went away; about an hour afterwards, this gentleman came down and said, he had been rob<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260060"/>bed. I was going through Great Russell-street that evening, between six and seven o'clock, and met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that earlier or later than he usually returned to his lodgings? - A.Earlier; I looked at him, and he at me, and he asked me if I had any letters at our house for him, I told him, no, there was not, but I would wish to speak to him; he said, what do you want with me? I said, I do not went any thing with you, but my master does; he said, he was going a little way, and he would come down in the space of five minutes; upon that, I said, he could come down there, and go where he wanted afterwards; he said, he must go there first; then I said, I would go there with him; as we went past the Hummums, he tried to run away; upon that, I said, if you behave like a gentleman, I will not collar you, but if you do not, I will; with that, he walked by the side of me; we went through Tavistock-court, and when we got to the bottom, there was some beer letting down into a cellar at a public-house, and we could only go over one at a time, he stepped over the rupes first, and then be took to his heels; I followed him into Maiden-lane, and there I told him he should not go another step without me; I delivered him into the hands of the patrole, and there was a seal found upon him, and some money which the patrole has got.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure it was not an accident that brought your hat over your face? - A. I am perfectly sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these two men was it you detained? - A. The tallest, Humphreys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get away at all? - A. Yes, he was stronger than me; it was all done in a minute; I cried out, stop thief, and, in about five minutes afterwards, the constable brought me one of them to the watch-house in Friday-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Which of them was it the constable brought to you? - A. The shortest, Taylor; the other came in in about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you time to observe the faces of these men when they robbed you? - A. No, I could not; because they knocked my hat over my eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe their clothes? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainty, when the constable brought that one back, whether it was one of the men or not? - A. Yes; because it was the size, and the colour of the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. When the other man came to the watch-house, how came you to know him? - A. By his clothes; he had a white great coat on.</p>
               <p>Q.Had Taylor a great coat on? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found upon either of them? - A. The watch was not found.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it been found at all? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Now, Honestly, I believe you have never had the good fortune to find your watch again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you? - A. About seventy.</p>
               <p>Q. Your eye-sight is not quite so good now as it was thirty or forty years ago? - A. If I have my spectacles on it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this about a quarter before eight in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The day was pretty near shut in; it was getting dark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not see quite so well as if it had been day-light? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had an opportunity of seeing the person's faces at all? - A. No; I saw them run.</p>
               <p>Q.Even, when you did see them afterwards, when the constable led the one in, and the other came voluntarily into the watch-house, you could only speak to them from their clothes and their size? - A. I knew their clothes and their size.</p>
               <p>Q. You have, perhaps, in the course of your life, seen just such a coat as that before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man you know by the size; you have seen a great many men about the same size? - A. Yes, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had an opportunity of seeing the faces of either of them, because they put your hat immediately over your face? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to Humphreys, half an hour after you had been in the watch-house, while all the crowd were about the watch-house, Humphreys came to the watch-house voluntarily, did he? - A. Yes.</p>

             came into the watch-house; I asked him what he wanted there; and he said, he thought he knew the prisoner; he said to Taylor, I believe I know you; but Taylor said, no, you do not know me, and then the other said, he did not know him; the Jew, as soon as he saw them, said, they were the men that robbed him; before Humphreys came in he described him to be a taller man than the other, in a light-coloured coat; and as soon as he did come in, he said, that was the man; we asked him who he was, and what he was, and he did not give any account of himself; one of the constable asked Humphreys what he was, and he struck him with a stick in his face; I asked him what that was for; and he said, for taking charge of him; and then we secured them both together; we searched them, but found no watch upon them; Humphreys came in about half an hour after Taylor; when I brought Taylor to the watch-house, the Jew was there, and he immediately said, that was the man; when we took him from the watch-house to put him in a coact, somebody said, d-n your eyes, cut away.</p>

I took them to the watch-house; they told me it belonged to a person in Rose-street, Soho, opposite St. Ann's workhouse; I went there and found it was so; the truck is in my possession in the Court yard.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutrix.) Have you looked at that truck in the Court yard? - A. Yes; it is my truck.</p>
               <p>Newman's defence. Yesterday morning I saw this young man, he told me he had found this truck near Compton-street, I was going to work; I saw him again in the afternoon, about four o'clock, and told him I had heard of a person that had lost the truck; we both directly went to the place where he had taken the turck to, and we agreed to take it home; we were getting it out of the yard to take it home when the constable stopped us.</p>
               <p>Collins's defence. On Thursday night, about half past ten, I saw this truck lying in the middle of the road, with one of the wheels off; I put the wheel on again, and brought it to Bowling-pin-alley; I asked Mr. Brooksbank, she head porter of Lincoln's-Inn, whether I might leave it there till I found the owner; and he said, I might; I saw this young man the next day, and he told me he had heard of a person that had lost the truck; and we had got one wheel on, and was going to put the other on, when the constable came up, and we told him we had heard it belonged to some person in Rose-street.</p>

             sworn. - On the 5th of this month, I was applied to for a search-warrant by Mr. Clarke; before that, I had been into the cellar and seen the soap marked; there was a cake missing; we went and got a warrant to search the prisoner's lodgings, and we found a bag and a piece of soap; I went over to Mrs. Johnson, I had a suspicion of some being sold there; I asked her what soap she had; and she said, seven pounds, she shewed me what there was; I asked her if it was all she had; and she said, yes; I looked under the counter, and pulled out a large box, that proved to be soap; it is in Court.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you hear what he said before the Magistrate? - A. Yes; it was taken down in writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any mark upon that found at the prisoner's lodgings? - A. No; only upon that found at Johnson's; the person who took the examination before the Magistrate not being in Court, the prisoners were found</p>

               <p>Q. They were not shavings? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. He told you at the time he thought they were shavings, and was mistaken? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Court (To Southey). Q. Are those things given to the workmen as perquisites? - A. No, never; they have been locked up in our warehouse ever since, and sealed. (Produces them).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury-this is a spiteful malicious piece of business; I went up to fill the bag with shavings, and Mr. Turner saw me go up; when I came to take up my bag of shavings, when I was going out to breakfast, my bag was taken away, and this bag of pieces put in the place of them, and I took it, and thought it was shavings; I spoke to the foreman directly, and said what a scandalous piece of business it was; my bag was found covered over with dust and rubbish; I knew no more that it was pieces than the child unborn.</p>
