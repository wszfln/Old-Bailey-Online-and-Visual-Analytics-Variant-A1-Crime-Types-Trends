               <p>driving a van; in it were three or four women and seven or eight children; three men were sitting in the front; the party were singing. Prisoner was going from Wembley towards London. At the Jubilee Clock Tower a tramcar was stationary; deceased and a soldier named Brown were alighting; the latter was assisting the old man on to the pavement. Prisoner's van came along at about eight or nine miles an hour; the shaft struck Wilcox; he and Brown were knocked down, and the wheels passed over both men. Prisoner had these men in view for about 30 yards, and there was nothing to prevent him pulling on to the off-side to avoid them. After the occurrence he whipped up his horses and made off; I cycled after him and overtook the van and stopped it. I then saw that prisoner was drunk. He said, "It was not me, sir, it was the horse." One of the men with him was also drunk; he was arrested and subsequently fined. Wilcox was taken to Dr. Jones's surgery, where he died the same evening. Brown was taken to the hospital, where he was detained till May 16. When I stopped the van the horse was in a very distressed condition, per<lb/>spiring freely; one of its shoes was thrown.</p>

At the post mortem it was found that the skull was badly fractured; one arm and one rib were broken. I knew the old man very well; he was very feeble and helpless on his feet. Before he died he said to me "I am sorry I was foolish enough to go out on a Bank Holiday." I examined Brown; he had an injury to the kidney and passed a lot of blood. I sent him to the hospital.</p>

I alighted first and got on to the pavement. Brown was helping Wilcox; they had got about half-way to the kerb when they were knocked down. I saw the van coming along at a very rapid pace, and I shouted "Please stop quick." There was no traffic in the road at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother (prisoner) at 122, Peabody Cottages, Heme Hill. Father is a tailor. I go out to service every day, but sleep at home. My brother Frank was 11 years old; he had a double clubbed foot; his feet were kept in plaster of paris. My sister Emily 13 years old, has a diseased spine. On April 26 father went out to work at 6 a.m.; I left about 9. I got home about 3.30 in the afternoon; at first I got no answer on knocking at the door; presently Emily opened it; she seemed to be ill. I went upstairs and saw mother lying on the bed unconscious; she was fully dressed. Frank was lying in another bed, undressed; he was then conscious. Exhibit 1, which was found on the kitchen mantelshelf, is in mother's writing. (This note read: "My dear husband and children; do forgive me for what I am doing. I cannot let my darlings live their lives in misery any longer; I love them so much; my last wish is, do all you can to help my dear daughter Vi.")</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I heard my father say in his evidence at the inquest, "My wife had been much depressed for some time, more so the last six months. She has very often cried, and she has suffered from headaches. A brother of hers was put away for a time. I have also heard that her grandmother was insane at one time."</p>

In the evening be became drowsy and finally comatose; at 11 next morning he died. Death was due to opium poisoning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When prisoner was removed to the infirmary I certified that she was insane.</p>

                  </hi>, Assistant Medical Officer at Holloway Prison. I have had prisoner under observation since May 11. When admitted she was in a very dejected, despondent condition. Her memory was a complete blank as to what occurred on April 26. She said she had been suffering dreadfully with her head. She was very emotional and constantly referred to her dear little children. Her mental condition has now improved somewhat, but I consider her now of unsound mind. I think that at the time of this occurrence she did not know the nature and quality of her act; she undoubtedly has homicidal and suicidal tendencies.</p>

On May 2 I was called to the London City and Midland Bank, Tooley Street, when the manager said "I shall give this man into custody for endeavour<lb/>ing to utter this forged cheque." Prisoner replied, "Very well; I did not know it was bad." He was taken to the station and charged, and made no reply.</p>
               <p>Prisoner handed in the following statement. On the day of arrest I went to the bank. I was acting as a messenger. I had been in the City seeking employment. On reaching Tooley Street I was asked by a man of smart appearance to go on a message, and being eager to earn something I quickly said I would. He then gave me the cheque and told me to go across the road to the bank, and he would wait where he was for my return. On my reaching the bank I gave the cheque up to one of the officials, who then asked me where I had come from. I said I was acting as a porter or messenger. They then took me to the real owner, and in the meantime the man I had received it from had taken himself off. As to the forging I know nothing about it. In the whole of my life I have never done that. That is all I can say so far as I am concerned.</p>

                  </hi>, manager, Singer Sewing Machine Company, 159, Victoria Street. In June, 1910, prisoner was employed as collector and salesman under agreement produced at a salary of 10s. a week and commission. It was his duty to collect instalments, to hand in the amounts received the following day, and every, Friday to render an accounting sheet showing the amounts received during the week and his salary and commission. On April 3 he absented himself and sent letter produced, dated April 4, "Receive one day's notice from me to leave your employment according to agreement. Will call with your property at 5 p.m. to-day." He afterwards rendered a sheet showing that he had collected £9 10s. 6d., which he had not accounted for. He forwarded the letters produced, stating that the company had broken their agreement and that he was entitled to retain the moneys collected as commission due to him. I investigated his accounts and found that on January 10 he received £1 3s. 6d. from Julia Kure, which was not entered in his sheet, but in respect of which two sums of 7s. 6d. were subsequently credited, leaving 8s. 6d. unaccounted for. On February 17 he received 10s. from Lilian Westall, which is entered as 5s. On March 3 he received £3 10s. from Alice Mabbett, on which date there is an entry of 6s. only, leaving £3 4s. unaccounted for. On March 31 he received from Kate Patience £5 4s., of which no entry was made and which is also unaccounted for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. On June 18 I took about 20 collecting cards from prisoner, which were given to other travellers; in the first instance prisoner was given 60 or 70 accounts from other collectors' business. I told him that I would give him 20 more accounts; it was not done because he absented himself.</p>
               <p>The Recorder pointed out that a dispute as to the account would not justify the prisoner in retaining moneys or making false entries.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Prisoner's average earnings were 33s. 9d. a week. It took three weeks or a month to ascertain the total of prisoner's defalca<lb/>tions, which amount to £39 4s. 6d. Prisoner has never made any objec<lb/>tion to the change in the customers from whom he collected.</p>

I am a poor man fighting one of the largest and richest companies in the world, and it is notorious that the wages that they pay their agents are not sufficient. The company have not paid me what I was entitled to under my agreement. I protested and was told that if I did not submit to their arbitrary decision I could leave, which meant that 12 months' hard work was to be sacrificed and that the commission which the company had agreed to pay me would be lost to me. Under these circumstances I did what I thought was best, and if I have erred at all I submit it is an error of judgment, as I consider that the company have deliberately broken their agreement. I gave my notice and sent them a list of all the accounts that I had received, so as to give them as little trouble as possible.</p>

                  </persName>, X Division. On April 25, at 9 p.m., with Sergeant Girdler I went to 46, Philpot Street. The door was opened by a woman; prisoner was standing behind it. I said to him, "Your name is Douglas?" He made no reply but rushed at us and struck at us. I said, "I have reason to believe you are in pos<lb/>session of counterfeit coin." He struggled and took something from his pocket. On the way to Arbour Square Police Station he said, "I know you have got me safe for the soft stuff," meaning the 10 florins wrapped up in separate paper which were picked up by Sergeant Girdler.</p>

We had to get uniformed men to help us in the struggle. At the station I showed prisoner the coins; he said, "How many have you got?" I said, "Ten." He replied, "That is about all; a pound's worth."

The counterfeit coins found on me were given to me a quarter of an hour before my arrest in the presence of Mrs. Silver by a man to mind till 10 o'clock the next morning. They were wrapped in paper. I did not know what they were till later on, when the parcel dropped out of my pocket. About five minutes after, when I was going to find the fellow to give them back, I was stopped at the door by the detectives. There was no struggle. I resisted and they attempted to strike me with some kind of weapon. I had no intention to utter those coins or make any use whatever of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The coins were given to me to take care of, not for my own use, by a man I know as Charlie Murray. I do not know his address. I was to return them the next day.</p>

               <p>Mr. Travers Humphreys stated that on April 1 Byerley was seen with another man in Commercial Road by Police-constable Mitchell to take a jemmy out of his pocket and try a door; they then went to another street close by and tried a door. The officer then went up and told him he would arrest him; Byerley said, "You will arrest me! You will arrest someone, you will "; he and the other man threw the officer to the ground; the other man kicked the officer and Byerley struck him with a jemmy, then struck him again; the officer put up his left hand to guard the blow and the left forefinger was broken. Pri<lb/>soners then ran away, but were followed by the officer and Byerley was caught. The result of the injury to the finger was not certain, but the doctor thought it might have to be amputated.</p>

He had a small file in his hand. On the table were some paper bags and on the floor some particles of plaster of paris. Another bag contained a quantity of silver sand. I asked, "What is this for?" He replied, "I am going to scrub the floor." I asked, "Where is your scrubbing brush?" He replied, "I am cleaning the knives and forks with it." I said, "I shall search you"; he then produced five counterfeit sixpences and five counterfeit shillings from his right-hand trousers pocket. The shillings are dated 1898 and the sixpences 1907. He had 3s. good money. He said, "Here you are; here is the lot; I was just getting them ready when you came in." Three are finished and three un<lb/>finished. I searched the room. In the grate were two bags containing plaster of paris, one bag containing sand, a basin containing water and particles of sand (produced). In the fire pieces of plaster of paris. A plaster of paris mould broken up, with parts of the impres<lb/>sion of a shilling on it. On the top of the stove three tins with molten metal adhering to them. Also a gas ring.</p>

On May 5 the caretaker closed the hall at 7 p.m. Next day when I went to the hall I missed the curtains, carpet, oil<lb/>cloth, and portable organ. The total value is about £5.

I followed him to a shop in Caledonian Road, where he tried to dispose of the stuff. He saw me and tried to avoid me. He ran away. I gave chase and eventually caught him. I asked him why he ran.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On this Saturday morning about 10 to 6 I turned out of my bed with the intention of going to get a barrow to go to market. I goes round to Sermon Lane, where the barrows are kept. Going through the lane I see two constables in the Mews looking at something. I did not know what it was, but I passed right on. Going up the lane, I looked to see if I could find a barrow, but being late other costers had taken them all. I come back to the Mews, thinking I might find one there. There was no barrow there. While I was there I was wondering what the policemen were looking at. I go in the direction where the policemen were looking. I thought the stuff on the barrow had been somebody's spring cleaning from the squares close by, and to get rid of it they had put it in the barrow in the mews. It was all dirty. The two constables was there in front of me when I pulled it out from the place. I pulled it out into the centre of the mews and examined it further. I did not think much of my opinion. I thought, "Shall I take it to the police station?" I went away. When I come back the constables had gone. I thought I would take it out of the place with the intention of taking it to the police station. I gets halfway when I thinks to myself, "I want to do my own day's work; to-morrow is Sunday; I can earn a couple of pounds with the money I have in my pocket; if I go to the police station they might detain me and say I stole them, and I cannot say any more than where I find it from." I thought, "I will leave them and anybody can have them." I left them from about a quarter past 6 to half past 8. Anybody could have taken them. All I wanted was a barrow, being Saturday morning. I goes to Poster's to try to get</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191105230021"/>
               <p>a barrow there and could not get one. I thought to myself, "I will have the barrow with the things in it; I don't want the things; if I can get a few ha'pence for them I may as well have the benefit and go to market and do a proper day's work." I took them away from this place to Offord Road first, where I asked a gentleman if he would like to buy a lot of old stuff. He did not want them. I took them to a man in Caledonian Road; he did not want them. While I was asking him, the constable came up. I thought there was something wrong. I did not want to get into trouble; I wanted to get off to market. 1 was taken into custody, brought back, and charged with stealing.</p>

                  </hi>, grocer, 141, Victoria Dock Road, E. On May 2 about 10 p.m. I locked up my shop. Returning next morning about 8 a.m. the first thing I noticed was that some bins we put tea in had been removed from the place where they were put overnight. I also noticed there was tea missing. I sent for a constable. On looking round I found that the warehouse gate had been forced from the top and side; the bolt was wrenched off. There were marks on the gate which correspond with the jemmy produced. About 760 lb. tea were missing, some bottles of Bovril and Oxo, and five doxen tins salmon. The value would be about £45.</p>

Before I went there I see the van drive by me in Ashton Street, where I was inquiring for a pair of ponies to do my day's work, and sent a man named Nash for a constable while prisoner and another man were unloading the tea at 52, Eastfield Street. I saw them carry in four to six bags of tea. I was standing at the corner and did not want prisoner to see me and did not see exactly the amount they took in.</p>

                  </persName>, H Division. Accompanied by last witness and Detective-sergeant Weston, I went to 52, Eastfield Street on May 3. On entering the house I found four sacks containing tea in the front room, ground floor. I left Weston in charge and went back to the police station, where prisoner was. Weston found the rest of the tea. I told prisoner the charge and on searching him I found a bottle of Oxo in his right hand jacket pocket. Two other bottles were found amongst some tea in the van. I searched the sacks of tea when brought by Weston and in one sack I found 645 1/4 lb. packets of tea. I also found this jemmy in a sack. I have compared the marks on the gate and the jemmy exactly fits. Prisoner was arrested by Police-constable Gwinnell. When I told prisoner at the station that he would be charged he said, "Yes, we got it from Victoria Docks way." When charged he said, "I do not know any<lb/>thing</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). This man used to work for a carman and contractor. I know him as an honest man. I used to drive about with him when I came home from sea. This morning he asked me where I had been. I told him I had been in Greenwich Hospital five weeks. He said, "Come and have a ride?" I said "Yes." We drove to Canning Town and he asked me if I would object to stand at the coffee shop till he came back as he would not like the people to see two men on the van. When he came back he had another man in his company. We got on the van; he allowed me to drive. I drove right through the very streets where I live and am well known. He always allowed me to drive when I went with him. He sat in the van and smoked. I used to work with him. He said he was going to leave the sacks at Eastfield Street until he had delivered the other things that were in the van. He drove to the bottom of the street and stopped in front of a coffee house (the other man stayed in the house). When he left the van he said, "Put the nosebags on"; I put one bag on and he put another. He went to the corner, saw the police, and ran. I stayed there and got arrested. I was taken to the station and charged with stealing the van and horses. When I was arrested there was no tea in the van; it had been taken into this house next door to the coffee shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Eastfield Street is about three miles from Canning Town. Why I was so far from home was I was looking for a job in Regent's Canal Basin. I worked with the man I accompanied. I do not know his name; they used to call him Jack. I knew him to be an honest man, driving for this firm for a long time. It is a natural thing for anybody to drive. If a man has a vanboy he allows him to drive. (To the Foreman of the Jury.) I do not know what the object of the man was in running away; it turned out afterwards the van was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191105230023"/>
               <p>stolen. I naturally thought the same as you did. Any of you gentle<lb/>men could make the same mistake. If a friend of yours had a motor<lb/>car and took you for a drive, you would not ask if he was starving; you would go for the drive. Supposing whoever it is in that motor-car sees a detective and runs away and you are left in charge and they arrest you for it, you have got the same chance of getting out of it as I have. It is hard to make anybody believe the story when once you are convicted. (To the Judge.) Why did I take the bottle of Oxo? That is the only thing you can punish me for, I think.</p>

                  </hi>, carman to Mr. White. Mr. White has a stable at No. 2, Salmon Lane. I was in charge of the stable on May 2. I left about 9 a.m. The governor was with me when I locked up. There was a padlock on the inside and one on the outside. When I went next morning, I found it had been broken open and the van was missing. One padlock was broken, the other was not, but was lying on the ground. They must have had a key of their own. A quantity of starch and blacklead was missing, the two horses and van, a double set of harness, a tarpaulin, and hoops. The value is about £100. I told the governor what had happened and went with him to the police station and made a statement. I left the governor there and he told me to go and see if I could get a pair of ponies to do my day's work with. While I was inquiring about a pair of ponies of a woman named Butler in Ashton Street a man named Ash, who was waiting to do the day's work while I went to the court, was beside me when prisoner drove by with a pair of ponies. The advertisement plates—Zebra Blacklead, Reckitt's Blue, Brasso Metal Polish—had been moved off the van. I should not have noticed they were the ponies only I noticed the pony on the off side was a bay pony. I said to the other witness, "Don't look round; there goes my ponies." When they got to the corner of Eastfield Street I followed them. They drove it round the corner and stopped on the right hand side, next door to the coffee shop. Prisoner put the boxes of tea on the pavement and the other man carried them in. There was only two in the van when I saw them. I sent Nash for a constable. Finding he was so long gone, and thinking they wouid be some minutes unloading, I went myself for a constable. At Ben Jonson Road I found Police-constable 298. He came back with me to Eastfield Street. The van was gone. Just as I got to the bottom of Eastfield Street I saw the van. just as I got near it the constable came round the corner. They were going to leave the van. I shouted to the constable, "They are the two." The constable claimed pri<lb/>soner; the other ran by him. I ran after him; he ran down several turnings and got into a house by the time I got into the turning. I did not see which house he ran in so he escaped.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I cannot account for none of the witnesses seeing the third man. As I told you this morning, one man went into the house and he never came out again. When I first saw the van there was a tarpaulin spread right over to the wheels. That does not make any difference to the driving of it. I did not notice the advertisements on the van; I did not see any. All I did was to get up in the van and drive it. I had known the man a good time by travelling about with him when I came home.

               <p>Mr. Metcalfe, who appeared to prosecute, said that prisoner in 1908, while a married man with a grown-up family, met a Mrs. Johnson, a widow, at Colchester, and, giving the name of Sidney George Graham, pretended to be frightfully in love with her. He obtained from her about £500 and went through a form of marriage with her at the parish church, Clapham. They lived together for about three months, when she found out that he was a married man. She never saw him again until she saw him at the police court when he was taken on another charge. Having possessed himself of her property, he met at Yokohama a Miss Barton, who was a stewardess of one of the P. and O. liners. He told her he was a widower, that his wife had died 18 years before, and they went through a form of marriage at West Ham on May 17, 1910. After the ceremony he induced her to give him £964 to invest in bonds. These were put into a box. On June 11 he went away, leaving a note on the table. The bonds dis<lb/>appeared when he did. She put the matter into the hands of the police. There were a number of other cases. One lady he relieved of £1,000. In January, 1895, for frauds similar to the present pri<lb/>soner had been sentenced to two terms of five years, to run concur<lb/>rently and five years' penal servitude.</p>

               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE CORNISH</hi>. On April 15, at 7.30 p.m., I with other officers went to 63, Ely Terrace, Mile End. On the kitchen table I found a mould containing a 2s. piece, pot containing metal, three spoons, two files, copper wire, two knives, pot of tallow, two irou frames for holding the mould. Upstairs Police-constable Nicholls found a bottle containing cyanide of potassium, plaster of paris, and silver sand. At 11.30 Walsh came in; he was told what had been found and said it had only been going on for five weeks since Ginger Brady came there; that they had dropped eight that night round New Cross and Greenwich; "he has been making them here with another man I do not know, and it looks to me he has sent you here." Two counterfeit florins were found on him; in good money 19s. 9d. silver and 1s. 7 1/4 d. bronze, and several penny articles; he said, "Brady gave me those; I have been carrying, he has been dropping. At 1 o'clock Thompson knocked at the door; he said, "I live here and sleep upstairs"; when told what had been found he said, "I don't live here; I live at Rowton House, Whitechapel; my name is Thomp<lb/>son." Prisoner Walsh was asked, "Is this Brady who lives here?" and replied "Yes." On Thompson was found 10s. 3d. silver and 4d. in coppers, good money; three 1d. packets of chocolate, two chocolate eggs, pair cheap socks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Thompson first said he lived there, but when he learnt we were police officers he said he did not live there. No bad coins were found on him.</p>

                  </hi>, blacksmith, Southsea. In January I saw in the "Portsmouth Evening News" an advertisement (Exhibit 13)." Man, married, wanted as collector and caretaker for garage and contractor's yard; permanent position for reliable man; cash security required. A. B., 47, Clovelly Road, Ealing." I wrote for particulars and re<lb/>ceived B. in reply a letter signed "A. B., for Geoffrey Jones," stating C. that the duties would be to collect all moneys and take charge of D. vans, harness, and horses, and that £75 was required for security. E. After several other letters I met Jones at Guildhall by appointment F. on January 24. He told me that the situation would be at Grove G. Lodge, Tollington Park; he said he had been at the same place 30 years H. ago and had 40 horses and vans there, but he had not got any there I. now. He said he had a big building contractor's business at Waltham<lb/>stow, J. with a number of horses and pantechnicons, and a big coal K. trade business in Ealing. He said he had spent £100 in putting the L. place at Grove Lodge in order. I told him I had not got £75 for M. security but only £50; he eventually agreed to take £60, and I handed N. over £57 10s., the deduction of £2 10s. being for my travelling ex<lb/>penses. O. Before parting with the money I had been over Grove Lodge P. with Jones and Bee (the latter being introduced to me by Jones as Q. his confidential clerk), and was much impressed with the place; it R. was a good-sized place, with accommodation for a lot of Vans and S. horses. Jones said he was spending a lot of money in putting the T. place straight, and the workmen were there; he said he was going U. to transfer there the business from Walthamstow in a week or two. I V. spoke about security for my £60; I was told that that sum was nothing W. to the stock there would be in the place. When I parted with my X. money I believed I was going into a very good job. I moved up and Y. entered Grove Lodge on January 28 and stayed there just over two Z. months. The only business I did was one removal, for 2s. 6d. There AA. were no horses when I went there; after a week or so two horses BB. came. After the workmen had left a carman came; he was paid by CC. the week. When Jones called I used to tell him that I had no busi<lb/>ness to do and I have said the same to Bee; they both put me off with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191105230030"/>
               <p>excuses, saying that they were not ready to undertake business yet. On March 1 there was £5 due to me for wages and 5s. for interest. I pressed for this but could not get it; on March 3 I got 15s., and later on 5s., 2s. 6d., and 1s. I issued a writ, and on March 11 I was paid the difference between these sums and the £5 5s. At the end of March 1 went to Jones's place in Tollington Park and saw a man there; I asked Jones who he was and he said it was his son. After-wards I asked the man if his name was Jones and he said "No," his name was Higgins. As the result of our conversation we went to a solicitor and a warrant was issued. I repeatedly asked Jones to return me my deposit, but I never got it. He gave me a month's notice. Bee brought me down a form for me to sign, agreeing to accept £50 and £5 for wages and to clear out at once; I said I would not sign anything till I got my money. These communications and the agreement that I signed first are all in Bee's writing. I had given to me three books for the business; I never made any entries in them. One reason Jones gave me for not returning my money was that he had spent £40 of it to speculate in building lands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Jones. I was wrong in saying that all the busi<lb/>ness I did amounted to 2s. 6d.; it was a removing job, two hours at 2s. 6d. = 5s. (eventually witness admitted that there were other small jobs). As I was paid on March 11 the wages and interest due on March 1 there was nothing more due until April 1. I swore the information and obtained a warrant on March 30. It is not the fact that on March 3 or 4 I was drinking with Faulkner, the carman, in public houses from 8.30 a.m. till 11. I was not repeatedly or at all drunk during February and March. The day after your arrest your wife called on me; she said that if I would leave the place and without the prosecution she would pay me my £60; she said she had the money in her purse; I told her I would withdraw anything so as to get my £60, but I did not get it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fulton. It was Jones who at the interview at Guildford gave me the particulars I have mentioned, and I thought the job was a very good one; I had not then heard of Bee. Afterwards there were general conversations between me and Jones and Bee. I handed over my money to Jones. Bee was not employed ait Grove Lodge, but he often attended there. I regard Bee as a partner of Jones. Bee used to open letters that came for Jones and destroy some. The writ I issued was against Jones alone. In the Informa<lb/>tion I described Bee as Jones's secretary. When I call Bee a "part<lb/>ner" I mean a partner in the swindle.</p>

                  </hi>, solicitor, Finsbury Park Chambers. Early in March I was consulted by Banger and wrote to Jones, who called on me on the 10th. Banger had given me a piece of paper given to him by Jones, with the name of the latter's solicitor as Taylor, at an address in South Kensington. I told Jones that there was no solicitor of that name or any other at that address. The address afterwards turned out to be that of Bee. Jones promised to call the following day and pay the amount of Banger's claim; he failed to do so, and</p>

                  </hi>, furniture salesman, Walton Road, Woking. On March 14 (living then at Oxford) I read an advertise<lb/>ment in the "Daily Telegraph," "Man, young, wanted, to manage branch furniture dealer's business; wages 30s. weekly; free apart<lb/>ments; good commission; cash security of £75 required. Address, Antique, box 273." I answered the advertisement and received a reply, signed G. Jones, from 43, Clovelly Road, Ealing. On March 17 I went to this addrest and there saw Jones. He said he had a lot to do in his coal business at Ealing and wanted a salesman at his furniture business at 176, Tollington Park; he said he had a number of vans and horses. He showed me the lease of 176, for which he said he had paid £120. We went together to 176; it was a very tall building; a shop at the front, large side doors, and stabling; eight rooms over the shop and yard. The shop was fairly well stocked with furniture; he said that this was his and that there was more coming in when he could spare his vans to fetch it from his other premises. He said he had spent over £100 in doing up the place. Eventually I paid Jones £60 as security and took the situation. The agreement I signed has Jones's signature, but the body of it is in Bee's writing. Jones introduced Bee as his confidential clerk. When I parted with my money I thought the whole thing genuine. I took possession at 176, Tollington Park on March 22. Jones gave me three small account books. Occasionally customers came and asked for estimates for removals; I would give the message to Jones or Bee, sually Bee; they would tell me to make some excuse, to say that we were so pressed with business that we could not accept the job. No business was ever done, except some very small cash sales. Bee came nearly every morning and opened the letters, most of which he would burn. Finally I saw Banger and we both consulted a solicitor.</p>
               <p>(To Jones.) I do not know that the previous tenant had had this shop for 35 years, carrying on business as the Tollington Pantechnicon Coal and Forage Company. Besides what was on the premises when I went there, other furniture was brought in afterwards. I went in on Wednesday, March 22; two or three days would be spent in fixing up my home; I swore the information on the 30th. On that date there was actually nothing due to me.</p>

On March 17 I saw Jones alone at his private house and had a long conversation; he told me the nature of the business, that he had 12 pantechnicons, etc. I then returned to Oxford, consulted my friends, and decided to take up the position. On March 21 I came to Tolling<lb/>ton Park and handed the money over in the presence of both prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>, 5, Lothian Road, Camberwell, jobmaster. At the end of January Jones hired a pair-horse pantechnicon to move furniture from Nine Elms Station to Finsbury, paying £1 for the job. On February 6 he hired a van and two horses and two sets of harness to be stabled at Grove Lodge; he had them for some weeks at 12s. a week for each horse. One of the horses was returned on March 11; the other was hired out by Jones to Lucemore, who still has it. I received the letters produced headed "Geoffrey Jones, furni<lb/>ture dealer. Furniture, household effects, and miscellaneous property of every description bought for cash. Coal merchant. Removals," etc., and signed "Geoffrey Jones, p.p. A.B."</p>

                  </hi>, 1, Stroud Green Road, auctioneer and house agent. On December 13, 1910, Jones applied to rent 176, Tollington Park; he filled up the application form (produced), stating his address as 47, Clovelly Road, Ealing, which he had occupied for six years at £45 per annum. He offered a rent for 176, Tollington Park of £60 on a seven years' lease, commencing February 9, 1911, giving a reference to his landlord, J. E. Haigh, 26, St. James's Square, Tol<lb/>lington Park, and to J. Lawrence, 154, Coningham Road, Uxbridge Road, and stating that he had been just accepted as tenant of Grove Lodge, Finsbury Park (being stabling for 40 horses), at £100 per annum. I wrote to Haigh and received the letter (produced) of Decem<lb/>ber 22, 1910, stating that he had known Jones a number of years and had no hesitation in saying that I should find him a respectable and responsible tenant, able to pay the rent. Receiving no reply from Lawrence, I telegraphed to Jones, who replied, stating that Mr. Law<lb/>rence had been away from home. On January 4 I had a satisfactory reference from Lawrence. (These letters were stated to be in Bee's handwriting.) 176, Tollington Park was then let to Jones under 21 years' lease, produced.</p>

At the end of February I saw Jones at 176, Tollington Park and arranged with him to store furniture value £200 belonging to Mrs. Arnold, my aunt, at 6s. a month. It was placed in the shop and in the room above. I afterwards went with Kieley; I identified part and Kieley the other part of the furniture on the premises, with the exception of two or three articles worth about 10s.</p>
               <p>To Jones. The furniture was removed and stored at a reasonable price. I instructed you to sell some of the furniture and it was kept in the shop for that purpose.</p>

Jones called and arranged to do it for 30s., and also bought part of the furniture for £5 17s. He sent a van with the name of Dennis and Co. on it; I paid the carman for the moving.</p>

                  </persName>, Y Division. On March 30 at 9 p.m. I went to 47, Clovelly Road, Ealing, with a warrant, and in consequence of information went to 14, Elsham Road, Kensington. After some trouble I got admittance and in an upper room found Jones in bed with his son. I told him I was a police officer and that I had a warrant for his arrest for conspiring with a man named Bee and obtaining about £55 from Higgins, and that he would be further charged with obtaining about £60 from Banger by false pretences. He said, "False pretences—you cannot make it that, neither can you make fraud of this." He dressed and went down to the basement. There I found the four letters produced addressed to "A.B., 14, Elsham Road." I afterwards went to 3, Hazlett Road, Kensington, where I found Bee. I told him I held a warrant for his arrest for con<lb/>spiring with Jones and obtaining sums of money from Higgins and Banger. We went down to the back kitchen, where Bee got hold of some papers and endeavoured to tear them up. I prevented him and took possession of them. Prisoners were taken to Kensington Police station; they made no reply to the charge.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Fulton. The papers found on Bee have nothing to do with this charge.</p>

                  </persName>, Y Division. On April 8 I went to 176, Tollington Park, and found in the safe, which I had broken open, the four account books (produced), cash book, ledger, stock book, and day book. The last entries in any of them are August and April, 1909, except that on February 10, 1911, there is a short list of tools. There were other books spoken to by Higgins and Banger. The letter signed "L. Lawrence" (produced) is, in my opinion, in the handwriting of Bee, somewhat disguised; the letters produced by Strickland, signed Lovell and Haigh, are also Bee's writing. Letter to Rushworth of February 3, 1911, signed "G. Jones p.p. A. B." is in Bee's writing; that of February 6, 1911, to Rushbrooke is Jones's writing. On April 25 I visited 176, Tollington Park, with Copping and Kieley; with the exception of two or three articles they identified the furniture as their property.</p>
               <p>To Jones. No furniture could have been removed without our knowledge between March 30 and April 27, as a special patrol was kept on the premises.</p>

I sold it to one of two men who were standing in front of me. The man gave the name of Huntley, of the "Balham Hotel." I sold Lot 90, a chestnut mare, to the same man. I was not able to identify the man who bought the lots. Prisoner was then dressed differently; he had a hat on and had a growth of beard and whiskers as well as a moustache, and no eye<lb/>glasses. I would not say it was not the prisoner, but I could not identify him. We have recovered the chestnut gelding.</p>

I asked for a deposit; he said, "That is all right; I bought two horses in the morn<lb/>ing.". To the best of my belief prisoner is the man. After I had given a description to the police I was asked if I saw a photogragh could I pick him out. I did so. Later on I saw a number of men and picked out prisoner as being the man who, to the best of my belief, gave me the information on April 5.</p>

                  </hi>, jobmaster, Albert Square Mews, Clapham Road. On Thursday, April 6, a man who represented himself to be Mr. Hayes came to my place with a long-tailed mare and phaeton. It was the prisoner. He asked me to keep the horse for the night and he would give me further instructions. Next morning I received a letter</p>

               <p>from Hayes asking me to send to Bowling Green Mews and ask George for a chestnut horse belonging to him. I was to clean and feed it and send it to Rushbrook's, Camberwell New Road, by 11 o'clock. I got the horse, paid the fee, and sent it to Rushbrook's. Rushbrook said he knew nothing about it. I took the horse back to my premises and kept it there till I had information from Hayes. I had information by telephone from Hayes to fetch the chestnut mare, phaeton, and harness to Gibson's in Holly Street. I recognised his voice. He asked me when I took it there why did not Rushbrook keep it. I saw Hayes in a public-house across the road there. That was the prisoner. He told me he had just telephoned to me to ascertain whether I was coming or not. I left the horse and phaeton there and went to Totten<lb/>ham on business. I called back and asked Hayes was he done with my man; he said yes and that he would let me know further about the chestnut gelding, and away I went. He afterwards telephoned me to send it to Ward's in Edgware Road. I recognised the voice as being prisoner's. I did not do so, as I had doubts about my expenses. He then 'phoned to know why I had not sent it to Ward's. I said I wished to have my expenses. He told me to send it to Ward's and keep the voucher till it was sold and then he would settle with me. I kept the horse until I gave it up to Aldridge's.</p>

                  </hi>, 114, Holly Street, Dalston, contractor. I have known prisoner about 15 years. He used to live at the "Dyson Arms," Dalston Road, Rosebery Avenue, and Battersea Park Road. 1 saw him early in April at my place. He drove up with a horse and trap and asked if I would buy it. I told him I did not want it. He said it belonged to a friend of his, who had come up from Reading, just left a public-house there, and he had got it to sell for him. He said he had put it in at St. Martin's Lane and put a big reserve on it and did not get it. He did not give the name of his Reading friend. I think he said the reserve was 40 guineas. I said 25 would be a lot. He then asked me if I could find a customer. I said I did not know anybody who, would buy it and he went away. He came again next afternoon without the trap and asked if I would buy it; I said no, but if it had been a cart horse I would. I said, "Why don't you put it in the sale again? "He said he did not want to do that. At the finish I rang up Mr. Nosworthy; he was not in. I afterwards spoke to his man about it and he said he would tell Nosworthy when be came in. Nosworthy came later and while he was there the horse and trap drove up. They were sold by prisoner to Nosworthy. Prisoner said the horse belonged to Mr. Hayes. I saw prisoner write Exhibit 9, "L. Hayes, c/o Kingston, 41, Seaside Road, Eastbourne," and "Dundella House, 41, Clapham Road."</p>

He told me the lot had been drove from Reading and had been put in at St. Martin's Lane, but did not fetch the reserve, and that he had</p>

I do not know why he put "George Hayes, Dundella House, 41, Clap<lb/>ham Road." He wrote his own name and address first. I took him to bo Kingston; he was introduced as Kingston.

He said, "Forgery; I have forged nothing." I went next day to the address he gave, 41, Seaside Road. I found there a cheque-book, Exhibit 1. When charged he said, "I am not guilty." I found upon him a note-book which contained "George Hayes, proprietor, 'Red Lion' Hotel, Lambourne," and a telephone No." 302 Reading."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I know nothing about the forging of the cheque. Until I was arrested I did not know that any cheque of mine had been presented at the bank with a forged signa<lb/>ture. I had had an account at that bank which was closed. When I had an account I more often than not carried loose cheques. When the account was closed as far as I know I put all my. loose forms in the cheque-book. I was not in London on April. 5. On the day of the sale at Aldridge's I went to Newmarket in the morning. I suppose I left London somewhere about 10. Sales at Aldridge's begin, I believe, about 11; I could not say. I did not know of anybody going there to buy horses or anything that day. I did not go there on the 6th, and did not know of anybody going to fetch horses from there. How</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191105230038"/>
               <p>I came to be concerned in selling these horses was this. I went to Newmarket on the 5th and came back to Cambridge the same night. It was a rough night. I sent a telegram to my wife, which I think the police have, saying that I was stopping at Cambridge next day in<lb/>stead of Newmarket. On the Thursday morning I saw a friend of a man named Dobson. He said, "Hullo, how are you getting on?" I said, "Nothing too grand"; I thought he was wanting to borrow something, perhaps. He said, "Dobson wants to see you, if you can find a buyer for a horse and trap" or "horse or trap." He said, "Do you particularly want to go to Newmarket?" I said "No." He said, "Will you meet Dobson at one o'clock at the "King Lud"? I said "Yes." He then left me for a time and wired to Dobson. I knew this man as Pat. I knew Dobson as a customer for five or six years at houses where I have been. I met Dobson as arranged; he took me to "The Horns," Kennington; we walked a little way up the road as far as "The Cock." While we were in there I saw pass by a mare in a kind of phaeton: there was another horse at the tail of the trap. Dobson said, "There they are; I want £20 for the mare and trap and £12 for the horse; they belong to a man named George Hayes, who has gone broke."Dobson does exist; when I first knew him he was a billiard-marker at"The Saracen's Head," Snow Hill; that was four or five years ago. He asked me to meet him at eight in the little pub. in Farringdon Street. About 2.30 I drove off with the horse and trap, the other horse was left in the stable opposite "The Horns." I drove to Gibson, a man I had known 15 years, and asked him if he would buy the lot; he could not do with them. I then drove to another man at Battersea, Mr. Hibbert; he said he could not do with them. I knew Hibbert 12 years ago, when I had the "Clock House," Battersea. It was getting dusk and I left it at Clapham. I met Dobson and told him what I had done. He said, "Surely you can get rid of them at that price. I will meet you at 11 o'clock at the 'King Lud' on Saturday morning." I went over and saw Gibson again, and, alter a conversation, he said he thought his friend, Mr. Nosworthy, would buy the mare and trap. Arrangements were made for him to see it that night and he bought the lot for £22 10s. We were haggling two hours. Gibson had £1 out of it, the man with Nosworthy 5s., and the man with me 5s. I met Dobson next morning, gave him £20, which he told me he wanted, and had £1 myself. I took a receipt for the £20. I believe it is with my papers. I had it in my pocket after I was arrested, I believe. The writing on the receipt is the same as the letter counsel has. I have not seen Dobson since. I had no suspicion the things had been come by dishonesty at the time I sold shem. I had no idea the cheque was forged or that the things had been come by that way. The man who used the cheque must have had it in his possession some months. I do not think I have had the cheque-book in my hands since September. A Mr. Hazel is the only man I have given a blank cheque to. He banks at the same bank. I was introduced to Nosworthy as Kingston. I told him the owner of the horse was Hayes, and I wrote down "Hayes, care of Kingston,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191105230039"/>
               <p>41, Seaside Road, Eastbourne." Dobson gave me the address of Hayes as "Red Lion Hotel," Lambourne, and as I know Lambourne a bit I was anxious to take it down. He was supposed to be going to take the "Red Lion." All I received out of the transaction was £1.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I heard Mr. Leach give evidence. He described me as being in attire I never had worn. I was not there. He was not altogether certain of it either. I heard him say he picked me out from a photograph of a crowd of people. I suggested to him myself that he had been shown a photo of me before. I was the only one in the photo wearing glasses. I heard him say he picked me out from my features. I do not think he had much time to look at people's features on sale day. I know Huntley. I was not intimate enough to know his Christian name. I did not know where he banked. I was surprised to hear he banked at the same bank. I was in the habit of carrying loose cheques. The man who forged the cheque may have got it from the billiard-room from my coat pocket on anything. Dobson gave me no address. I have known him five years. I understood he was billiard marker at the "Saracen's Head," Snow Hill. He used to come into the public-houses where I was. Before pril 5 I last saw him during last summer at the "Duke of Devon<lb/>shire." I did not ask what he was doing. I did not know he was in the habit of dealing with horses. He told me the horses and things belonged to a friend of his, Hayes. I concluded afterwards why he wanted me to sell them was because they had been obtained by my cheque, so as to throw all the guilt on me and clear himself. He said the man he had the things off had come out of his house at Reading and wanted to get rid of them; he had no use for them. I met him at the "King Lud" by appointment, which Pat had made pre<lb/>viously. He evidently found out where I was, having obtained the things by my cheque, and sent his friend after me, so that he should fix me up into the whole thing. Whitman said on the 'phone, "Is it Hayes speaking?" he did not know me as Kingston; if I had said I was Kingston he would not have understood. I was repesenting myself as Hayes. I wrote' in the name of Hayes because he did not know me as any other name. We do not go through all that explana<lb/>tion with a man who only stables a horse for a night. I do not know what "302 Reading" means—probably a telphone number. It is evidently Tomkins' number. He has a horse repository.</p>

                  </hi>, 9, Houghton Mews, Harrow Road, coetermonger. On May 12, at 8 p.m., I was returning home with my barrow, which my mate was wheeling on the road, I following on the pavement. I went into a public-house and changed coppers for 3s. silver, which I put in my pocket. I then took from my satchel 3s. 6d. worth of coppers, counting them in order to get silver for them, when I passed the three prisoners. One of them hit me on the back of the head and knocked me down in the road; the coppers fell out of my hand; the three prisoners scrambled for them and picked them up. I followed the three prisoners to Kew Bridge, where they entered the "Express" public-house; I complained to a police-constable on point duty. The officer held the door; another officer came up; the prisoners were taken to the station and charged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Moore. Beadle was six yards in front of the other two—he did not strike me—he helped to pick up the money. There was no one else about. The three men walked on quietly to the "Express" public-house—they walked fast.</p>
               <p>(To Hickman.) I did not say at the station I lost 1s. 8d. I was not drunk. There was no young woman picking the coppers up.</p>

On May 12, at 8.15 p.m., I was on point duty at Kew Bridge when prosecutor complained to me and pointed out the three prisoners in the "Express" beer-house, where they were drinking. I bolted the door; Police-constable Cleveland arrived. I told the prisoners they could consider themselves in custody for robbery with violence. I saw Bryan place some coppers on the counter; Hickman covered his movements. The barmaid asked who the coppers belonged to; no one answered. I took possession of them—15 pence. I took Beadle to the station. He said, "He dropped his satchel and I only helped him to pick it up." Bryan said, "That is right." Prisoner was wearing a satchel on his right side. At the station Bryan said, "He" (Hickman) "gave the coppers to me." Hickman said, "What are you talking about?" Bryan said, "Certainly you did." Hickman said, "You ain't half a nice fellow." Bryan said, "I ain't going to have the blame shoved on to me." Be<lb/>fore being placed in the cell Bryan said, "He gave me the money" (meaning Hickman) "to count because we thought he was cheating us." When the prisoners came up Beadle was pushing a grinding machine, the two others walking by his side.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Moore. The "Express" beerhouse is about 150 yards from the waterworks, which is where the prosecutor said he had been attacked. I found nothing on Beadle or on either of the others, the only money found being the 1s. 3d. which Bryan placed on the counter. Bryan did not say, "That is the money we have earned grinding."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a knife grinder. On Hay 12 I was wheeling my brother-in-law's barrow. Bryan had hired it from my brother-in-law and I had been working with Hickman and Bryan. At 8 p.m. I was in the road when I heard the money falling about the pavement. I had not noticed prosecutor being assaulted and had seen nothing of him before. I picked up 2 1/2 d. or 3d. and handed it to prosecutor. I heard Hickman say, "I will give it you for calling me a spiteful tinker," or words to that effect. I did not help to pick prosecutor up—as I left the barrow he was getting up. Early in the day I had received a shilling of the money earned and taken it to my wife. I met the others again at Young's corner and finished the day's work with them. After leaving the prosecutor we went to the "Express" public-house, when I asked what money I had earned. I did say that I had helped to pick prosecutor's satchel up. As he got up it was hanging loose from his neck—it had come off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had been with the other two prisoners all day—I heard no scuffle or blow. There were two or three other lads picking up money out of the road and a lady. I did not see Bryan put 15d. on the counter.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On May 12 I was with Bryan on the pavement, Beadle pushing the machine in the road, when prose<lb/>cutor came up; he appeared to me in drink and said, "Hullo, you spiteful tinker chap!" I said, "What is the matter?" He put him<lb/>self in a fighting attitude and struck me on the shoulder. I did no more than merely push him and he fell on the side of his face in the road. As he was falling money fell out of his hands and out of his bag into the road. I did not stay to pick any up. Bryan and Beadle stopped behind picking something up. Twenty or 30 other persons came up in a few minutes. We walked along and I gave Bryan the coppers which we had been earning with our grinding machine—it was about 1s. 5d. We went into the "Express" public-house, when Police-constable Johnson came in and said he would detain us and charge us with assaulting a man. He said nothing about robbing till we got to the station. He shut the door and about five minutes afterwards Police-constable Cleveland came in and said we could consider ourselves in custody for assaulting and robbing a man. I saw the coppers on the counter. I did not see Bryan put them there—I suppose he mus. have forgotten them. At the station Bryan said, "He" (meaning me) "gave me the money what we had earned grinding"; that was the 15d. which He left on the counter.</p>

                  </hi>, furniture salesman to H. J. Searle and Son, Limited, Old Kent Road. On December 20, 1910, prisoner signed the agreement (produced) for the hire-purchase of furniture and household effects to the value of £148 17s. 1d. The goods were delivered to 14, Marylebone Road; prisoner paid £17 10s. deposit and £4 a month subsequently. Clause 4 of the agreement provides that no part of the goods shall be removed from the hire's premises without the written consent of the company. On April 6 I saw defendant, told him that he had removed certain goods, drew his attention to the agreement, and gave him a copy. He admitted that he had parted with two over<lb/>mantels and a carpet, which he had sent to Rossy, 24, Balancefield Road, St. Margarets, Twickenham. I told him it was a serious offence to part with any of the goods. On April 15 I went to 24, Balancefield Road, saw prisoner, and identified the two overmantels and the carpet. Prisoner said he had disposed of several other articles—two bedsteads and two dressing chests for £4 10s. He refused to say to whom he had sold them. I pointed out it was a serious offence. He gave no reason why he had sold them. On April 19 he was arrested on a warrant for stealing these articles. I afterwards went to Farndon, pawnbroker, 573, Old Kent Road, with Sergeant Whitmore, and identified two dressing chests, washstand, fender, and toilet-set, which he had sold for £4 10s. The value of them under the agreement is £18. I have since identified at various pawnbrokers two blankets, a sheet, and other articles as our property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner is an Italian. On December 17 no copy of the agreement was given to him. Prisoner had an opportunity to dispose of the whole of the goods, amounting to £148 7s. 1d. He has</p>

               <p>received for goods sold about £10. He has paid £17 10s. deposit and instalments amounting to £14. When I told prisoner I had heard he had sold some of the property he at once acknowledged it; he offered to pay for them in cash, and a friend of his offered to become surety.</p>

                  </persName>, L Division. On April 19, at 6.30 a.m., I saw prisoner at Nile Terrace, Camberwell. 1 asked if his name was Thomas Gonory. He said, "Yes." I told him I was a police officer and held a warrant for his arrest, which I read. He said, "I am sorry to hear it, but I must admit I have sold a dressing chest and two bedsteads, and have pawned some other things." He then handed me seven pawn-tickets, and said, "I should have got them back in a few days, as I have a cousin coming from New York; he is due at Southampton in a day or two; he has got plenty of money, and he will settle all up for me." I conveyed him to Walworth Road Police Station; he was charged, and made no further reply. I have since been with Threlford to various pawnbrokers, and he has identified a number of articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have made inquiries about prisoner; he bears the character of an honest man. I received a number of references from various places where he has been employed as waiter and steward since 1905; they are quite satisfactory. The company have taken back all the furniture which had not been disposed of.</p>

                  </persName>, Scotland Yard. While serving a sentence of five years' penal servitude and a remnant of 312 days, pri<lb/>soner took an active part—in fact, was practically the ringleader—in the mutiny among the convicts in Maidstone Prison, which resulted in the Governor having to call a company of soldiers with fixed bayonets to quell the disturbance. Through his action in the matter he had to serve the whole of his sentence, and was not liberated until March of this year. On his release he was met by his brother, who supplied him with money and an outfit to enable him to go abroad, but the same day he journeyed to Brighton, and fraudulently obtained goods. On April 2 he engaged rooms at the Hotel Cecil, hired a motor-car, and, in company with a woman, went to Esher, and, after obtaining goods, stole her ring, and left her to settle with the hotel people. On April 4 he visited Chatham, and stole a bag containing clothing. He also called at the Royal Marine Barracks to see Major Noble, but was told he was ill, and so on returning to London began ordering goods in the name of the major. On April 14 he went to Eastbourne, and, visiting the best hotels, obtained through one of them the use of a first-class horse and carriage, in which he drove to various tradesmen, from whom he fraudulently obtained goods, and absconded. During the five weeks he was at liberty he called at most of the best hotels in the West End and high-class boarding-houses, engaged rooms, and used the addresses for the purpose of obtaining goods from tradesmen in all parts of the metropolis. He had used the name of Captain Noble, and also called himself a doctor. In consequence of the numerous com<lb/>plaints special watch was kept, and on May 5 Detective-sergeant Burton, of Scotland Yard, arrested him in the Edgware Road. Pri<lb/>soner made a written detailed confession, according to which he had committed over a hundred cases of fraud within five weeks, and had obtained goods and contracted debts to the extent of £800. In one case he called on a Harley Street specialist and stole his silver cigar-case. I may add that the greater part of the property has been re<lb/>covered.</p>

                  </persName>, New Scotland Yard. I saw prisoner on April 29 last. I said, "Your name is John Watson." He said, "Yes." I said, "I am a police inspector. I am going to take you into custody for feloniously intermarrying Mary Elizabeth Stanhope, your wife, Isabella Dare, whom you married at St. George's, Hanover Square, on February 22, 1895, being now alive. The marriage with Mrs. Stanhope took place on February 14, 1905, at Rhondepoort, Cape Town." He said, "All right." On the way to Poplar Police Station he said, "I admit I married Miss Dare, but she was married before to Lieutenant Gough, of the 3rd Dragoon Guards in South Africa, and I have papers to show it where I am living. When I married Mrs. Stanhope I heard she was dead." When the charge was formally read over at Poplar Police Station he made no reply. I went to 16, Neville Road, Poplar, and searched the place, but could not find the papers he referred to. I conveyed the luggage to Poplar Police Station, and gave him the opportunity of examining it. After doing that, he said, "The papers I referred to are not here. I will consult my solicitor." I have never seen any of those papers. As far as I am aware he has not sought to find the papers. His solicitor applied at the police court to have access to papers, and I told him he could have access at any time convenient to him. No papers have been produced to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. I wrote down the statement I have made at the police station within a few minutes of the conversation taking place. The substance of it is exactly word for word. I was not rather excited. You made a complaint to the Commissioner of Police about my excitement, which has been investigated and found to be without foundation. The Attorney-General of the Cape of Good Hope did not ask us to obtain evidence in the matter of a bigamy charge they were bringing against you in the Cape. We had an inquiry with reference to obtaining evidence of your former marriage. There was no bigamy charge made against you at the Cape at that time. (To the Judge). The charge was not proceeded with, as the witnesses would have had to go to the Cape of Good Hope, which it was not possible to do. I did not personally know that you had re<lb/>turned</p>

                  </hi>. In 1908 I was a widow, my husband having died in 1901. I met prisoner in 1904. On February 14, 1905, I went through a ceremony of marriage with him at the Roman Catholic Church, Rhondepoort. This is a copy of the certificate. Before the marriage he told me he had been through a form of marriage with some lady who was dead. I found out first in 1906 in the Cape that the former wife was alive. I opened a letter to prisoner from his father. I did not leave him. I spoke to him about it. He said it did not matter whether she was alive or dead, because she was not legally married to him. I said I should really like to know, because I could earn my own living, and had two situations I could go to. I am certain he thought what he said was true. He said her husband did not die till 1901. No papers were ever shown to me to prove that she had been previously married. I believed what he said implicitly. There were certain separations and reunions. The separations were on account of quarrels, not because I believed he wag married. I thought I mentioned to the police when I laid the in<lb/>formation that he told me his wife was dead before he married me. When I found out in 1906 that his wife was living I still went on living with him until I laid the information, which I did because he said I was not his wife, and I thought I would like to find out which was. It was not in consequence of the declaration made by the Pope; that decree did not come into force until 1906. I began this prose<lb/>cution because he said I was not his wife, and he had two females in the flat, so I thought it was time he was pressed, as a matter of fact, and I would find out if I were his wife or not.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I do not remember you dwelling much on the aspect of the case of your having gone through a ceremony of marriage in a Protestant church with a Protestani. (In answer to the Judge, pro-soner said he was a Roman Catholic) Tou told me you heard that the girl you had married had since been in Africa, and had married Lieu<lb/>tenant Gough. You told me that Lieu<lb/>tenant Gough was alive when Dare went through a form of marriage with you. I thought you believed it. I saw all the letters you received from your parents. We had been married some time before you told them of it. You said you wanted to make sure it was a success before telling them. In the letter your father said something about a disastrous experiment of yours</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191105230047"/>
               <p>some years before. I knew it was something about two wives. Just before Christmas you asked me to go down to Scotland to see your mother and father. I stayed there a fortnight. When I came back I found a typist in the flat; the other woman arrived with you later on. I was very much upset, especially as one of them was wearing a blouse of mine. I went to a solicitor, who advised me to get maintenance from you. You offered me £1 a week on condition that I accepted it as not being your wife. You knew I should not accept that. You agreed to pay the schooling for my child. After a lapse of two months I wrote you, saying I was going abroad, and wanted to see you. There was a sort of a truce, and we remained together three days, when you were arrested.</p>

                  </hi>, solicitor, 34, Finsbury Pavement. I acted for last witness in reference to the question of getting alimony. I saw prisoner at his own request at my office. He came in reply to a letter 1 wrote on behalf of my clients. He said, he thought Mrs. Watson was not his wife, that she had no claim upon him, and she was simply blackmailing him. He called again two or three days later and repeated that she had no claim, and that he was living with her at that moment. He said if my client would keep quiet he would allow her £1 a week and look after a certain child that was referred to.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I wrote asking you what alimony you were prepared to pay. I did not demand £5 a week and £5 5s. costs. On the second occasion I told you if you would enter into a proper agreement to allow my client £1 a month and pay the costs, which would be £2 2s., I might be able to advise her to accept.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">BALL</hi>, recalled. In August, 1900, there were proceedings in connection with a maintenance order in Marylebone Police Court, and further proceedings in 1901. There was only a lapse of three and a half years between that and the second marriage. In 1901 he en<lb/>deavoured to get the maintenance order quashed, on the grounds of want of means and infidelity of the wife. He himself made the appli<lb/>cation.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I met my first wife when I was stationed at Edinburgh. She was a chorus girl at the local panto<lb/>mime. We lived together, and some little time afterwards she came up to London and I followed her. We were down at Brighton together from Saturday to Monday, where her sister was living under the pro<lb/>tection of a very great friend of mine. I understood he was married to her. That friend said to me at Brighton, "Why don't you marry Amy?" On the Monday we probably indulged in a good deal of liquor, and a license was procured—I cannot say whether I went to Doctors' Commons, but I understood afterwards the license was pro<lb/>cured in my name, and we went to St. Georges, Hanover Square, and a ceremony of marriage was gone through. I was a Roman Catholie,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191105230048"/>
               <p>and this lady a Protestant. As the Catholic Church does not recognise marriage with a Protestant I did not regard the matter seriously. Having done that I went back to Scotland. When I got there I came to my senses. I spoke to my father and mother. He said, "Well, you have made an ass of yourself. The only thing under the circum<lb/>stances is to make the best of a bad job," and if it got abroad I had married in the way I had I should be commercially and socially ostracised. So we thought the best thing to do was to find another clergyman who would perform the ceremony validly. I came up to town and a second ceremony was performed at St. James's, Padding<lb/>tion, for which invitations were sent out. My wife was continually un<lb/>well, and had a professional nurse. We did not have a day's happi<lb/>ness together. The professional nurse was the cause of the trouble. My wife was laid up about six months. A few months after she was better her sister paid us a visit. She stayed some considerable time. When I was in the north of England I had a wire to say the two sistera were in bad company. I was appointed shortly afterwards manager in Birmingham to a firm of whisky merchants. That was not a success, and I went to London. In London I had a stable in Park Lane, and carried on a horse-dealing business. I had some rooms at the stables, and they were used in this way, that if I wanted to spend a night or two in town I would sleep there. In the meantime Miss Dare had gone to live with her sister, who had left the gentleman who was pro<lb/>tecting her. One day I found they had both come to live at the stables. The next thing I heard coming up to town was that both sisters had been arrested in the street and charged at Great Marl<lb/>borough Street with being drunk and disorderly and fined. I went to the Continent out of the way. Before I went Miss Dare had applied to the magistrate for an order. I submitted to the magistrate that I did not consider her my wife. In consequence of a certain reproach I put upon her when we had a little tiff she explained that she had been married in South. Africa some years before she met me and that marriages in Natal were not valid in England. I accepted the ex<lb/>planation. I raised the point from time to time afterwards, and she always denied having mentioned such a thing, or that she had been married. She issued a summons for maintenance. My defence was she was not my wife, and the magistrate made an order. She after<lb/>wards gave birth to a child, in regard to which a man-servant of mine made an affidavit to my solicitor admitting misconduct. A paternity order was applied for against me. I again put up the plea that she was not my wife. The magistrate said, "This is not the place to settle that. I can only go by the facts before me." The man gave evidence that he was the father, and on that the magistrate refused to make any order for the child, but he made an order of 8s. a week. I then went out to South Africa, where the war was proceeding. While I was in Vryberg I met a man named Durant, who told me he had been connected with a company, of which Miss Dare formed one, when they were touring in South Africa in 1902 or 1903, and he remembered her quite distinctly, and told me to whom she was married, Lieu<lb/>tenant Gough. I have seen letters from Lieutenant Gough. Just at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191105230049"/>
               <p>the end of the war I wrote a friend of mine, Forrestier Walker, asking him to send some luggage of mine out to me. He wrote and said I should be glad to hear that the lady you call my first wife is dead. At that time I had an opportunity of joining the Cape Mounted Police, by which one can get into the Civil Service in the same way as you can get into the British Army—the back-door way. I put this letter before the representative of the Director-General, before whom I was sworn in as a member of the Cape Police. He read the letter and said, "I am perfectly satisfied with this; you are a single man, there<lb/>fore you will be allowed to take the oath and join the police." I saw promotion was going to come very quickly and wrote to Mr. Lumley, Miss Dare's solicitor, and to Bernard Abrahams, my solicitor, for confirmation as to her death. Mr. Abrahams's letter was returned. He had retired from practice, I believe struck off the Rolls. I was perfectly satisfied with the evidence of Mr. Lumley that if his client had been alive he would certainly have asked me for arrears of main<lb/>tenance. (To the Judge.) Mr. Lumley is not here to-day. He had a very excellent reason for not replying to my letter as he was at that time serving a sentence of four years' penal servitude.</p>

He had no claim against me of any kind. I had last seen prisoner on June 12, 1910, when he came to the club, de<lb/>manded money of me, made a disturbance and asked for the latch-key of my lodgings. I had put him up the night before and lent him some money, as he was out of work and had no home. He had been turned out of his lodgings, and he brought a bed-chair and one or two things and stayed at my place. I gave him 5s.; two months after<lb/>wards he took the things away. On May 13, 1911, the letter (pro<lb/>duced), which is in prisoner's writing, was left at the club: "If you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191105230050"/>
               <p>do not send 10s. by return I shall make it my business to call and see the steward, who knows me. I shall do the same what the gentleman done to the butler who you saw last Sunday night." Some years ago I was sent to prison for theft; I came out 15 months ago, and have since been in respectable employment. I understood prisoner's letter to mean that he would tell the steward about my conviction and get me out of my place, and that if I did not pay him he would give me a good hiding. I received this letter on Sunday and took it to the police. Prisoner sent Turner the next morning; he took the officer round to the prisoner, who was arrested.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 23 years old, and am a stockman in Victoria, Australia. I left there on the Orontes on February 20; at Colombo the ship was joined by Thornycroft, and we got acquainted. He travelled overland from Marseilles; I came on to London by sea; he met me on the boat reaching Tilbury on April 1. On April 13 I met him in the Strand; he told me he was to meet at Frascati's at 11 that morning a man who was well up in the racing world; would I go</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191105230051"/>
               <p>with him. We went to Frascati's and met Barry; be handed Thorney-croft what looked like a cheque, saying: "This is your winnings for yesterday"; he said he had an even better thing on for that day, and if I liked I could have something on as well. We three again met at 1 o'clock. Barry asked me how much I would have on; he suggested £25; I said I could only spare £5, and I handed him that sum in gold. Thorneycroft handed Barry a cheque and said he wished to have that sum on, mentioning £50. The race was to be run at two o'clock; no name of a horse was mentioned; I asked, and Thorneycroft said it would be all right. We again met at half-past two. Barry said that the horse had lost, but he would do all in his power to recover my loss; he explained to me a system by which he could do so, and said that I should invest as much as I could afford. I said it depended on my receiving a draft which I expected on Thursday, and an appointment was made for Saturday. I saw prisoners several times after this, but my draft had not arrived. I became suspicious and went to the police. On the 20th I saw the two by appointment; Barry handed to Thorneycroft a cheque which he said was his winnings yesterday; he said he had an even better thing on for the 4 o'clock race that day and asked me what I would put on; I said I would have £17 on. We agreed to meet at 3 o'clock, when I was to hand over the £17. Barry left us, and just later while I was with Thorneycroft he was arrested. I kept the 3 o'clock appointment with Barry, and he was arrested.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. On the voyage from Australia I did not tell Thorneycroft that I was coming over to look for employment. When I met him on the 13th I did not ask him to let me go with him to Frascati's as I was tired of walking about by myself; it was he who suggested it. I said at the police-court, referring to the interview at Frascati's: "They wanted me to put £25; I said I would not mind having a fiver; Barry said I could stand in with him; if the horse had won at 3 to 1 I should have expected £20; I did not expect back the identical coins I gave; Barry subsequently came back and said that the horse had run third; no name was mentioned; I then handed him £5 gold." That is a mistake; I am sure that I handed him the money before the race was supposed to be run. I did not say to Barry when he told me the horse had run third, "I owe you a fiver, here it is." After the loss of the money Thorneycroft lent me 10s. and on the 13th he lent me a further 10s.; we went to several places of amusement, he paying the expenses. I never met Barry alone. Thorneycroft told me his address was Horrocks's Hotel, Strand; I never had an address of Barry's.</p>
               <p>Detective-Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM RIXON</hi> proved arresting Thorneycroft, who made no reply when charged. Upon him was found a cheque (Exhibit 1) dated April 10, "National Bank of South Africa, Limited, Cape Town; London office, London Wall; pay bearer £200 sterling; J. Barry."</p>

               <p>It was stated that three or four months ago Barry opened an account at the Cape Town branch of the National Bank of South Africa with a small amount, thereby obtaining the cheque-book; the amount was almost immediately withdrawn; he had no account at the London branch. Thorneycroft had volunteered the information that he had served six months' hard labour in Johannesburg for larceny.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. Prisoner is my son. I occupied a room with him at 19, Upper Cleveland Street, Fitzroy Square. On Saturday, May 7, we had a few words about 6 p.m. He called me a shocking name. I said, "You little bastard; I wish I had never seen you again." He kicked me in the ribs and hit me with his fist in the side. I fell on the bed. I said I would have to go to the hospital. He said he would go with me. I said I would go by myself by and by. He picked up all the things belonging to him, took them downstairs, then came up again, looked at me with such an evil look and went away. I got to the hospital about 7 p.m. and was bound up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191105230053"/>
               <p>by the doctor, who told me to go home and go to bed. I did so. Prisoner came home again about 9, did not say anything, went away and returned again about 11.20. He found me in bed. His mattress was not down. He pulled me out of bed with the mattress. I screamed because it hurt me so. He used bad language and struck me on the back of the head, so I went to the window and screamed for help. He said, "I will give you help presently," and went to a saucepan that was full of water and emptied it over my head. After that he upset a kettle of water over me. I was drenched. A police<lb/>man came to the window and asked me to come down. I could not, because prisoner had locked me in. A little while afterwards he opened the door and I went down. The policeman asked me to go up again. He followed me and took prisoner. (To the Judge.) I do not know what began the quarrel; it was about the dinner, I think. He had been sleeping in the room since November. We had never quarrelled previously. He does not generally drink. He had very likely had a glass or two. He has a funny temper sometimes. He has been in India nine years and had fever twice. I do not think he was responsible for his actions that day.</p>

                  </persName>, 474 D. I was on duty in the early morning in Cleveland Street. I heard cries and went in their direction and saw prosecutrix with her head out of the window. I saw prisoner pour water over her. She was calling "Police" and "Murder." I told her to come to the door. Prisoner could hear that I asked him to come afterwards; he said he had no clothes on. I said, "Put your clothes on." He said, "No, I am going back to bed." I then went upstairs He put his clothes on and I took him to Tottenham Court Road Police Station, where he was charged with causing grievous bodily harm In answer to the charge he said, "You notice what time she said I kicked her." She told the inspector it was half-past 6 or 7. She spoke very indistinctly. They both stuttered.</p>

I have lived with prosecu<lb/>trix about five years. She does not drink to any extent. Last year prisoner was out of work and remained at our place about six months; and this year he came again. I recollect him giving her a blow once before with his fist. I have never struck her. Prisoner had had two or three drinks. If he is leniently dealt with I will take him into the house again.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have no trade. I have been working in hotels and on the railway. I was in India in the Army 8 1/2 years. My discharge is "very good, thoroughly sober and reliable." At the time of the assault I was sober. At 11 p.m. I had not bad much drink. I deny that I did the injuries; I never touched prosecu-trix at all. When I left her at 2.45 p.m. she was hopelessly drunk. I came back at a quarter past 5. She was just the same. She said I had taken some money from her purse She will do a week's work and two months' drinking. She has always been the same. Joel is as bad as her almost. She said to me, "You dirty little thief," and "yon dirty little bastard, I don't want to see your face no more." I said, "If I am what you say, what must you be?" With that I went and cooked the dinner. She got some water and aimed it at the fire, so I could not have dinner. With that I aimed the dinner away and then I packed all my things up. She threw all my shirts and things out of the window. I went down and fetched them up and packed them away and went out. This was seven o'clock. I came back at 11. She was in the same state of drink, only lying down. I did not pull the mattress from under her. She must have fell down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have been employed by the Great Central Railway as odd man on the goods. I did not contribute any<lb/>thing at home. Before May 7 my mother had not done work for two weeks. She had money on May 7. Mr. Joel came home rather early and sent for drink, and I did as well, so she never had any money of her own then. She was nearly drunk at half-past 11 p.m.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GOLDSMITH</hi>, recalled. Prosecutrix did not seem to have been drinking; she was coherent but distressed.</p>

                  </persName>, Y Division. At 10.30 p.m. on May 9 I was on duty in Seven Sisters Road with Detective Peddle. Prisoners were with three other men. One prisoner pushed up against and the other knocked up against an elderly man; the latter got away and prisoners walked on; Peddle and I followed. Outside the "Durham Castle" public-house there was standing a governess cart and pony belonging to a bookmaker named Whiteman or White. I heard Daly say to Wallace, "Let's go in and bleed the f—r"; they went into the saloon bar; the other three men went into it by another entrance; Peddle followed the latter; I followed prisoners. Whiteman was standing up by the bar. As I entered Wallace was talking to a man named Giles; Daly had got across to Whiteman; I went behind them to try and hear what Daly said. He turned round and saw and recognised me. He said, "I will give you f—g copper"; he struck me twice with his clenched fist in the face, causing blood to flow; I closed with him; while struggling with him he kicked me under the knee-cap; then Peddle came in; we three fell to the ground; Daly continually struck me, once with the knee in the lower part of the body; Wallace kicked me on the back of the head and twice in the side. Other constable came in and prisoners were secured. I was placed on the sick list and am still unfit for duty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am now practically recovered. (Counsel put the story told by prisoners in their evidence; witness denied it in every detail.)</p>

                  </hi>, Divisional Surgeon. I examined Lock at 11 p.m. on May 9; he was very collapsed, bleeding from the nose and mouth and the left eye. There was a large contusion on the left side of the head and the back of the neck. He also complained of having been kicked in the stomach. There was a bruise on the left knee, just below the kneecap, and another in the centre of the stomach; these were consistent with his having been kicked. I placed him on the sick list; he will be fit to resume duty in about a week. I examined both prisoners; they had slight injuries; they had been drinking.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). Wallace and I were going to this house for drinks. I went into the saloon bar; Wallace had gone to the lavatory outside. I spoke to Giles and then turned round to order the drinks. I noticed a man behind me and he gave me a push. I turned round and said: "What's the matter with you, what's up." With that, he struck, me in the eye. (I did not know the man; I had never seen him before in my life; I now know that it is was Lock; he may have known me, but I did not know him.) I retaliated and struck him in the eye. He claimed me by my collar and tie, twisting it and sticking his knuckles into my throat. Peddle rushed in and put his foot in front of me and the three of us fell down. Lock had hold of me by the throat and was choking me. I heard Wallace say: "Don't choke the man; let him loose." Then the uniformed men came along and I was arrested. Wallace said: "You are taking the wrong man; it is these men (meaning the detec<lb/>tives) that has been interfering with Daly"; with that they arrested Wallace. I did not know that Lock was a police officer; he struck me and I hit him in self defence. I never kicked him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I swear that I do not know Lock. I do not remember that he had something to do with me in 1901. The story about Wallace and I being with three other men and hustling an gentleman is a made-up tale. I did not notice a pony and trap outside the public-house. I know Whiteman. I did ask Giles to lend me 10s., but I was not trying to frighten him out of his money. He may have said there was someone else in the bar. I was not going to speak to Whiteman. I cannot explain why Lock should have pushed me and struck me first. I only struck him one blow. I never attempted to kick him. I saw Peddle in the bar before any blows were struck. Wallace did not say anything about biting.</p>

On April 7 at 3.15 p.m. I was in Lea Bridge Road with Sergeant Hider and Police-con<lb/>stables Capps and Smith when I saw Ellis and French walking in the direction of Whipp's Cross, Bailey, on the other side, going in the same direction. French, who was 14 yards behind Ellis, nodded to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191105230058"/>
               <p>Bailey. Near Whipp's Cross Ellis joined Bailey, and they all three went in the direction of Wood Street. We afterwards found the three prisoners in Ferndale Avenue and followed them on bicycles into Shern Hall Street. At the corner of Oliver Street French took something from his pocket and threw it within the railing of the United Methodist Church. We caught them up in Shern Hall Street. I said, "What are you about walking round these roads?" They said, "We are having a walk round," and went on in the direction of Lea Bridge Road. Hider returned to the church and picked up inside the railing purse (produced) containing counterfeit coin. I arrested French and Ellis, French ran off, followed by Hider; and was caught; Bailey got away. Ellis said, "What have you arrested me for?" I said, "For possessing counterfeit coin." He said, "I do not know the other two, they are strangers to me. Do not put anything in my pocket." I conveyed him to Lea Bridge Road Police Station, where French was brought in by Hider. They were charged and made no reply. Both declined to give any account of themselves. Ellis gave his address, "No fixed above," and French declined to give his address. On Ellis was found 2s. 6d. and a halfpenny good money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had suspicion of the prisoners when I first followed them. We did not arrest them until the coins were found. Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE HIDER</hi>, J Division, corroborated. I picked up the purse inside the railings of the church. It contained 22 counterfeit florins. I followed French and Bailey through various roads and eventually caught French in Howard Road. He said, "What is the matter?" I said, "I ama police officer and shall arrest you." He said, "What for?" I said, "I will tell you presently." I took him to the station where he was charged and made no reply. He was asked by Arnum whether he could any account of himself or refer to any employer. Ho said, "No," I have no fixed abode, I am not going to give any information." I counted the coins out in his presence. He said, "I do not know anything at all about that" On April 15 at Old Street Police Station I picked out Bailey from amongst nine other men. I said, "I am a police officer, I shall take you to Lea Bridge Police Station, where you will be charged with being concerned with two other men with having in your possession on the 7th of this month 22 counterfeit florins." He said, "I admit I was with them but I know nothing about the coins." He Was then charged and made no reply.</p>
               <p>To French. I did not tell you why I arrested you. I was dealing with a very funny thing—counterfeit coin. I said nothing about arresting you as a suspected person loitering for the purpose of com<lb/>mitting a felony.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On April 7 I was talking to Ellis outside a coffee shop when Bailey asked Ellis if he would go with him to Shern Hall Street, Walthamstow, to see his sister, who was very ill. He agreed and I went with them, as I had nothing to do, as the fruit was very dear in the market. In Shern Hall Street the detectives passed us riding bicycles; one of them said, "Now, you are three smart looking fellows, what are you doing round here?" I replied, "We have come for a walk." Arnum said, "I know all about that; get out of it while you are safe." We went on; Bailey said, "I reckon they are detectives, and they would arrest you and get you two or three months in prison as a suspected person walking through the streets for the purpose of committing a felony." We talked to the corner of Oliver Street' and turned back because we had passed the right corner when we were again stopped by the detec<lb/>tives who said, "What are you coming back for?" We explained that we had gone to the wrong turning. Arnum got hold of Ellis and me by the arm and said, "I arrest you." I pulled my arm away, said "What is this for?" and ran away. Hider followed and caught me. I asked what I was arrested for; he said I should know later on. I thought I was arrested as a suspected person and was completely surprised when charged with being in possession of counterfeit coin. Stevens came into the police station and said he did not know who threw anything away, but it looked like a book called "Answers," a copy of which I had in my hand. I threw nothing into the rail<lb/>ings. If I had thrown these coins away and got away, should I not have jumped on to a tram and got out of it?</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was in Hoxton Street with the other two men and was with them in Lea Bridge Road at 3.45 p.m. Bailey came across to speak to us—I nodded to him, and we walked together. I went to the corner where the church was but did not stoop down by the railings or throw anything in. I have never seen the purse (produced) in my life. I struggled when I was arrested and got away because I thought I was taken as a suspected person.</p>

French told them we had come for a walk; the man replied, "I know all about that; you had better get out of it while you are safe." We had a few words and then went on, when Bailey said we had come too far; we re<lb/>traced our steps and were met by the two men again who asked us why we had come back; we explained. Detective Arnum got hold of me; I said, "What is this for?"; he said, "For being in possession of counterfeit coins"; I did not know what to say or do, but I said, "Don't put anything in my pockets." I was then taken to the station and searched and the half-crown found on me I asked to be tested. I then saw for the first time the 22 counterfeit coins which were dropped by French. I have never been in prison and can get an excellent character from where I have worked.</p>

                  </hi>, 166, High Street, Stratford, E. Prisoner is my son. I was present at West Ham Church on October 26, 1897, when he married Sarah Cross. I have seen a copy of the certificate, which is correct. They lived together about a year and a half. They sepa<lb/>rated on account of her dirty habits. My son soon afterwards joined the Army and went to India. He was in the Army four to five years. I did not know whether his wife was dead or alive. On July 6, 1907, I was present at the parish chuch, Mount Messing, Essex, when my son went through a ceremony of marriage with Annie Louise Brittain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not know he described himself as a bache<lb/>lor. He went as if he was a single man. Of course, he thought he was single. He thought has wife was dead. We heard so.</p>

I told him I was a police officer and was making inquiry with respect to a marriage con<lb/>tracted by him on October 26, 1897, with Sarah Cross at West Ham parish church. I said, "I am told you have since married another woman at Mount Messing in 1907." He Said, "I know I have done wrong; what was I to do; I did not want to be tied up to a woman like her all my life." I then arrested him and conveyed him to West Ham Police Station. When charged, he said, "I thought she was dead and I got married again." His wife is now an inmate of West Ham Union."</p>

I said "I shall take you back to Richmond and you will be charged with breaking into the caddie master's place last night." He said, "I know nothing about it." I said, "This coat has been found in your possession." He said, "I gave that to my brother, he knows nothing about this. I bought this coat this morning from a chap in Rich<lb/>mond, he said he was going to Hounslow, he wanted 6d. for it; I gave him 4d." He made no other statement. He made no reply when formally charged.</p>

                  </persName>, E Division. I arrested James Houston. He said, "All right, I will go; I won't run away." On the way to the station, he said: "I did not take the stuff. I do not know anything about it. I first met my brother at ten o'clock this morning and he said he bought it from the fat man belonging to Hounslow; I was not there at all. I was at Dawson's lodging house, Brentford, at 7.30 last night, and booked my kip. I did not leave there." I took him to the Richmond Polioe Station. On searching him I found one knife, six pawn tickets, and one coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The pawntickets have nothing to do with this stuff. I said before the magistrate, "I arrested James Houston; he said, 'Well, I do not know anything about the stuff.' "I made in<lb/>quiries at Dawson's and found James was there as stated, I do not think he could have had anything to do with stealing the things.</p>

                  </hi>, 25, Richmond Road, Richmond. I am assistant sad also golf professional player for the Mid-Surrey Golf Club. On the morning of May 13 I found the caddie master's office had been Broken open and the lockers. Entrance had been made from the caddie shelter window. I missed the golf coat that is here, the caddie master's property coat, a blue serge suit, some tools, six club screw<lb/>drivers, a towel, an auger, and the mirror that is here. Thomas Houston was employed at the meeting on May 2, 3, and 4. On May 2 I saw pri<lb/>soners. I stopped them. James walked on and I had a conversation with Thomas. I said, "Why are you not at the club now?" He said, "The caddie master told me the ladies' meeting is over and if I call up at the gentlemen's meeting hie would give me employment." I said to him, "I came from Richmond Music Hall on Thursday even<lb/>ing about 20 past 11. I saw Thomas enter the wicket gate, which is attached to the two gates entering the ground. He said, "Don't you remember anybody passing you at 20 past 11 last evening." I said, "Yes." He said "Was that you?" I said, "Yes." I wished him good night. I found the coat James Houston was wearing under<lb/>neath the coat he has got on now. How I come to see that coat was that I followed him. James took the coat he is wearing off and underneath that was my golfing coat. The brothers then parted, and I followed James to a second-hand shop in Isleworth town. When he came out of the shop, I said "Young man, where did you get that coat?" He said, "My brother gave it to me." I said "That is my golfing coat; give it to me." I pushed him and took it away from him. Another young man, named Collins, came along. I said to him, "Take charge of this chap and take him to the police station, he has got my golfing coat." He did so and I gave him in charge. When I looked round I saw Thomas 20 yards away from his brother. I went after him and tripped him up. He said, "I know nothing about it." I said, "Come to the station with me." I took him and he was formally charged.</p>

Next morning my assistant reported to me that the place had been broken into. I looked in and saw clothes scattered about and immediately telephoned to the police. The value of the property is £4. I employed Thomas two or three days a week pre<lb/>vious to that carrying clubs.</p>

Some were loose, the rest were done up in a towel. I informed the caddie master and he identified the property.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have never been convicted of any offence. I have been living at Dawson's lodging house ever since November, never missed one night. My brother gave me the coat. I wore it all day. He said hie bought it off a man and I could either wear it or sell it. My brother is no better off than I am. I put it underneath this coat, but anybody could see it all open; there is no button here. (At the request of the jury the prisoner put on the golf coat under his own.) I tried to sell it to make up enough money to make up for two night's lodging. I came out of the shop with it and this Spencer came rushing up to me, saying: "My coat, my coat!" I said, "Come down to the station and I will explain about it." I had a chance to get away. The police came up and I went to the station. I said I knew nothing about it being stolen. There was a young fellow with Spencer; I expect it is Collins. I was there when my brother was arrested. He was further up the town looking in a baker's shop. Neither of us tried to get away.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). This night Spencer says he saw me going into the club at 11.30 I left the station at five minutees to 11 with a young lady. I left her about 150 yards off the main entrance of the park and went down St. John's Road about 20 yards the side of the park and went along the Kew Road home. Next day about half-past nine, I got to the station, where a man said to me, "Can you do with a coat." I said, "I do not want no coat." He said, "I will sell you this one cheap; I want to get my fare to Hounslow, I am after a job." I said, "If that is the case I've not much money; I will have it for my brother." I gave him 4d. and away he went. I went to see if I could see my brother at Munday's second-hand shop. I saw him standing outside a public-house. I said, "I have a coat I will give you, it is better than the one you have got on; you can have it to wear or you can sell it." He tries it over the other coat, then he puts it on under the other. I said, "Keep it under the other till you get home." He said, "All right, I will." I left him then. I then went to Mortlake to meet a young</p>

               <p>lady, we came from Mortlake to Richmond. She went to the lavatory and I stood for three-quarters of an hour outside the police-station waiting for her. I wanted to show her a shop in Richmond where she could get some food for her husband. If I had done that burglary the night before would I stay three-quarters of an hour outside the station waiting for a lady. I see her on the 'bus on the corner and away she goes. I was in Richmond town all day.</p>
