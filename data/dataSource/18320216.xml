            . I am serjeant of the Scotch Fusileer Guards. On the 14th of January, a little after one o'clock. I was ordered to search the prisoner's clothes, which hung up in the barracks, in the place appropriated for them, and took this box out of his clothes -the prosecutor was not present, nor was the prisoner; he was intoxicated when I found the box, and I said nothing to him about it; any body could get at his clothes - I did not search his person; I searched his clothes, because he was suspected of a robbery - I did not myself see the prosecutor till five minutes after the search; he knew the box, and swore to it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BRALEY. I know this box by two letters on it, which I had observed several times in my comrade's possession; I was robbed on the Saturday, the 14th of January; I passed the board on Wednesday, and got my money on Thursday; I stopped two days at an acquaintance's in London -I went to the barracks as soon as I could find them out; the prisoner appeared a little in liquor when he was with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160004"/>me - he struck me with his fist; I do not know the letters on the box, as I am no scholar.</p>

            . I am a baker. On the 14th of January, about half-past twelve o'clock, I saw Braley and the prisoner in Park-lane - I did not see them go into any public-house; they were walking together by the side of each other, but not arm-in-arm - I saw the prisoner knock Braley down - they were both a little intoxicated; the prisoner struck him in the neck - he fell down across the road: the prisoner picked him up, and put his hand into his right-hand breeches pocket - I saw him take out a purse; I did not see any thing else - I was about ten yards from them; the prisoner walked on tea or twelve yards, then pulled the purse out of his own pocket, pulled the ring back, and took some silver out of the purse; he put the silver into the purse again, turned back to Braley, and asked him to go down towards Bayswater-road - Braley refused; the prisoner then ran on down Oxford-street - Braley turned quite a contrary way; I went and told him I had seen the prisoner take his purse out, and took him (Braley) to the barracks - we got there nearly half an hour after I had seen them in Park-lane; we saw the prisoner a very few minutes after getting there - I knew him again; I have not a doubt of his person - I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to Oxford-street did the prisoner knock Braley down? A. About two hundred yards; there are not houses on both sides - it was in Park-lane - there is a dead wall on one side; there was a gentleman near: I gave no alarm, as I thought at first that the prisoner was Braley's son, and I knew the prisoner belonged to the Scotch Fusileers at the Portman-street harracks - I did not know him before; Braley was a little in liquor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was paraded at half-past ten o'clock, and dismissed a little before eleven - I went up stairs at the barracks, and told my comrade to put my belt and fire-lock in the room - I then came down, walked down Oxford-street, from there to Regent-street, and up Regent-street, into Oxford-street again; I went into the Horse Grenadier, Oxford-street, and called for a pint of beer - one of the Coldstream Guards came in, and called for a pint of beer; he offered this box for sale in the room, and asked me to buy it; I gave him 2d. for it - I left him, and went home to my barracks; I put the box into my jacket pocket at the barracks, and hung my jacket up- I then went into the Canteen, to get something to drink - I was ordered into the Guard room; this man came up, and said I was the man - he was then worse for liquor.</p>

I came there last Thursday week, and afterwards went to an hotel in Covent-garden to see a gentleman who I had bought the coals for; I was to see the gentleman at ten o'clock at night, but it was eleven before I saw him - I then had to go to Paddington again, and lost my way; I enquired the way; I saw the prisoner shortly after I left Covent-garden, and asked him to direct me - he said he knew Paddington very well, he was going that way, and would show me; we had not gone far before he said,"We must have something to drink," and called in at a gin-shop - we went into five or six gin-shops in all; I took a little gin at the two first shops, but not at the others - he drank at all the shops, and I paid for it; he wished me to drink more, very much, but I declined: it was half-past five o'clock in the morning when I got to <placeName id="t18320216-4-crimeloc20">Paddington</placeName>

               <p>Q. What was you doing all the time? A. He kept calling at different gin-shops; I kept saying I wished I was there - he said, "Well, we shall soon he there now;" I got him out of the gin-shops as soon as I could, and when I got to the Paddington canal I knew where I was - I was quite sober; I had just taken two small glasses, and eat nothing; when I got to the canal I said, "I know where I am now;" he said, "Well, before you leave, look if your money be right;" I felt rather fearful, and would not look - he asked me several times to take out my money, but I would not; he said, "I should wish you to look at your money, and see if it is right, for if I leave you, and your money should not be right I should feel uneasy;" he said,"Well, what o'clock is it?" I looked at my watch, which was a silver one - I took it out, and it was half-past five o'clock; I told him so - he said he thought I had made a mistake; he wished to look himself - he asked me several times to let him look, and at last I let him lay hold of the watch, and I held fast by the ribbon; he held it up, and said, "I thought you had made a mistake, it is two minutes more;" as soon as he had said those words he gave a snatch with one hand, and hit me over the breast with the other - I stood with my back against the canal, and thought his intention was to knock me into the water; I recovered myself - I did not fall, and he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the blow stagger you at all? A. Yes - he hit me as hard as he could, but I did not fall; I should think I might be nearly a yard from the canal - I did not step back when he struck me; the blow, as I felt it, was with his first - it hurt me; he tore the ribbon of my watch - the swivel or ring broke by his pulling; I held the ribbon still in my hand, and he took the watch - he ran up the street; I ran after him, and caught him thirty or forty yards off; I cried Murder! as loud as I could, and then he cried Police! I held him but a very short time before the Policeman came up, and took him in charge; when the Policeman came up, he said, "I have not got his watch - you may search me;" the Policeman searched him, but did not find it on him - he found it on the ground, four or five yards from him; I saw it on the ground myself - the Policeman had a light; the watch flew out of the case with the fall - I picked the watch up, and the Policeman the case; I gave the watch to the Policeman, and he kept it -I have kept the ribbon ever since; the ring remains on the ribbon now.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was near the canal in Praed-street - coming along I heard the cry of Murder! two or three times, and immediately began to run; I heard a cry of Police! I ran down the street towards the wharf road, and found the prosecutor holding the prisoner about forty yards from the cut; as soon as I came up, he said, "This man has taken my watch;" the prisoner said I might search him, which I did but found nothing - I turned my light on; it was a very had light - two boatmen came up with a lantern, and I picked up the watch-case, and saw the watch laying about six feet from it; the prosecutor took it up, and gave it to me - I have had it ever since; I took him to the watch-house.</p>

I was sent for on the 12th of January to the prosecutors' counting-house; the prisoner was present - Mr. Stone said he suspected him to have a piece of silk under his coat; the prisoner said nothing to it - I searched him, but did not find the silk or any thing which could be identified; I went up to his bedroom with him, and searched a box which he pointed out as his - it was locked, and he had the key in his pocket; I asked him to point out his box - I opened it, and the first thing I found was this piece of silk, which I have had ever since, and now produce; I found other property there.</p>

            . This piece of silk is our property - I know it by this mark, which was made by Martin, in my presence; I was present on the 11th of January, when he found it in the box - it was taken the next day; there are seventy yards and three-quarters of it - the cost price is 2s. 3d. per yard, which would amount to between 7l. and 8l.; our warehouse is under the same roof as the dwelling-house, and in the parish of St. Martin in the Fields.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you not more than one house? A. One front is in Cockspur-street, and the other in Pall-mall, East - it is the same house; I reside in the Cockspur-street front - all the young men belonging to the establishment sleep in the house, but neither of my partners sleep there; we have ninety-one young men - part sleep in one front, and part in the other; I pay to the firm the same amount for rent as they are allowed for their houses elsewhere - the whole building belongs to the firm, and is charged to the firm; we pay a ground rent to the Crown - the firm charge me 225l. for rent, and my partners are allowed that amount for their dwelling-house elsewhere; the firm pay the ground rent, which is 400l. and odd: the firm built the house - the warehouse is on the basement story.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do the young men feed in the house? A. Yes, at the expence of the firm: the prisoner came to us on the 16th of September last, with a good character.</p>

            . I am constable of Uxbridge. I accompanied Murray to the public-house where the prisoner was found, and in the stable we found the mare and harness; I asked the prisoner whose harness that was - he said it was his; Murray's account of the conversation about the mare is true.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the prisoner shortly before that? A. No, not for more than a month; I was informed he was in possession of a mare and cart, and went there - Uxbridge is a hundred and sixteen miles from Litchfield.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went about the Tuesday before Christmas-day, for a holiday, to Birmingham, and on my return, about Woodstock, was overtaken by a man with this horse and cart together - I asked him to give me a ride; I got into his cart, and asked him where he was going - he said he did not know, for he was in trouble; I asked what trouble he was in - he said he had got the bailiffs on his premises, and brought the horse and cart from home intending to sell them, but did not know where - I said I wanted to buy a horse and cart; he said he would sell them - I got out, and looked at them; he asked thirty guineas for them - I offered him 20l., and then 25l.; he said he would take that - I wanted him to go into a little public-house just by, but he said he did not wish, because he was known there, and the people would want to know why he sold his horse and cart; I paid him on the road, just outside the public-house - it was on Wednesday; I came home; the man turned back, but where he went I cannot tell.</p>

            . I live in Uxbridge, and have known the prisoner two years; he was in the habit of going about the country with earthenware - I saw him shortly before Christmas; I cannot tell where he was going - I saw him take out his pocket-book; he had a great bulk of money, and put some gold on the table - he bears a good character.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ever know him keep a horse and cart? A. No, his father did; I do not know where he was on the 15th of January - he has two brothers younger than himself; the eldest is about sixteen - he goes about with a horse and cart for his master, Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the prisoner driving the horse and cart about Uxbridge? A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he the only person who came out of the cart? A. I cannot say whether two or one came, for I was nearly blind with the blood; I am sure he is the person who took my purse and money - I felt his hand in my pocket; he was taken in less than half an hour - I ran for a constable; he struck me with his fist - I was struck by somebody with a whip, but not by him - it was one of the people who came out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pull off your coat? A. I left my coat in his hand, and thought to run away from him, but could not - it was not to defend myself against him that I pulled it off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Have you told exactly the facts, as you stated them at the last Session? A. I think so; this happened in the high-road - nobody passed till it was over; the prisoner walked on before the cart to Uxbridge as quick as possible - my comrade never lost sight of him; he ran into Uxbridge, and we ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he ran after he got up to the cart? A. Yes; I am sure of it, for we were up with the cart, and he was a good bit before us - the cart kept going on; Donoghue said his oranges were 1d. each, upon which the prisoner took two - he offered to pay for one; he said he would give 1d. for the three - Donoghue said he must have 1d. for each; we did not say after he had taken them that we must have 3d. a piece for them - I did not demand 3d.; Donoghue demanded 3d. for the three.</p>
               <p>Q. After he got into the cart, was there not a few words between him and your companion? A. I cannot tell, for I was a few yards before; I saw no knife in any body's hand - I did not draw a knife, for I had none; nobody had hold of me in the ditch but the prisoner - the prisoner held me, and I could not see, but there might be one or two others near me; I cannot say whether they were within reach of me - I am sure the prisoner had one hand on my neck, and the other in my pocket; I could see his hand in my pocket - the purse could not have fallen from my pocket; I have often been at the Chequers with Donoghue, and seen

            . I deal in oranges. I had been out with Diegnan; a cart came up to us about half a mile from Uxbridge; there were four men in it - there were words between the prisoner and me about some oranges; he struck Diegnan, and knocked him into the ditch - the prisoner was down on him in the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person who came from the cart at the ditch at the time? A. There was young Beach and Clarkson in the road - neither of them touched him; I saw them getting towards him. and I walked away - when the prisoner left Diegnan, he came along the road; he walked - he got into the cart when he got into town; he did not pass the cart till he got into the town; I and Diegnan also walked all the way from the ditch into the town - we did not run till we got into the town; Diegnan complained of being robbed of 10s. 3d. when he overtook me in the road - I had only walked on a few yards; I did not stand by him - we were then more than a quarter of a mile from town; I did not see Diegnan with his coat off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see a knife drawn? A. No, nor did I see the prosecutor strike the prisoner; I demanded 3d. for all the oranges, not for one - he took two from me at first. and then one.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's service. On the 29th of January the prisoner dined with master and me - master called me up stairs after dinner, and paid my wages; when I came down the prisoner asked if master had paid me - I said Yes; he asked if he paid me every Sunday - I said sometimes before it was due: master went out, telling me to take the key with me, which I generally do - the prisoner asked what time I should be at home; I told him about nine o'clock, and master had himself asked me that question, in the prisoner's hearing; the prisoner said, "I dare say you will be back by six or seven?" I said No - I went to wash myself, and saw the side door, which is close by the sink, unbolted; I bolted it, and went up stairs to put my clean things on, and while up stairs I heard the prisoner open the door leading to the passage, where the side door is - there was nobody else in the house - I ran down stairs directly; the prisoner then drew his chair to the fire, and said it was so cold he did not know what to do; he asked again what time I should be at home - I said about nine o'clock; he said, "I dare say you will be home by six or seven;" I again said I should not; he afterwards asked if there was a fastening to the parlour window - I said Yes; he went to see, and found there was- I went for a brush to a cupboard by the side door, which I had bolted, and saw it was unbolted again; I bolted it, then came into the parlour, and told the prisoner I was going to fetch master's dog from the cellar, - I went out at the front door, down the passage, into the cellar, and brought the dog into the shop; the prisoner then stood in the back part of the shop, where there is a door opening into the passage, in which the side door is - the prisoner played with the dog, and called it by its name; he was acquainted with it - it would bark at a stranger, but not at him; I called the prisoner out, and told him I must go- he asked what I was in such a hurry about: I said the sooner I went the sooner I should be back - he came out; I locked the front door, and put the key into my pocket - we went together to a public-house over the way; he asked me to treat him - we had a glass of rum and shrub each - he said he had no money; we parted there: I returned about half-past nine o'clock; master came home in about five minutes - we both went to bed: I got up about four o'clock in the morning, and about seven master called me up stairs, and complained of losing his money - I then examined, and found the side door was unbolted; I told master nobody but the prisoner could have done it - I had not examined the door after bolting it the second time; the key of that door was also missing - it is not usually locked at night; I had seen the key about a week before: it hung on a hook at the back part of the shop.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About what time did you leave? A. About a quarter-past three o'clock; I left all safe then - I did not speak to the prisoner about the bolts being undone; he had formerly lived in the house - I lived with Mr. Hand, a respectable butcher, before I came to master; he told me to leave, because he said I was looking after another place - that was the only reason; a young man out of doors had a sister at Brixton - she brought a bundle of things for him, tied in a white apron; he was going to leave, and gave me the apron to keep till she called for it; I gave it to the whasherwoman, and she told me not to tell master she had washed it - I put it into my bundle, thinking it was the young man's; I threw it out of my bundle when I was leaving - Mr. Hand's initials were on it: Hand had promised to give me 6s. a week, and only gave me 4s.</p>

            . On the 11th of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I was in Leadenhall-street, coming towards Bread-street - I had a purse in my reticule, containing twenty-seven sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, three half-crowns, a 10l. and 5l. Bank note, and a draft on Maberly's, of Bread-street, for 185l. -I observed three men just by the India-house; they walked hastily by me - one of them turned round, and looked at me very attentively; that was the prisoner - he then talked to his companions, and he also turned round and looked at me attentively; they walked in that manner, turning round now and then, till they came to Leadenhall-market, and then they all three stopped; I walked on, and did not see any more of them till I came to the corner of Gracechurch-street - I had observed them look at me several times; I was waiting at the corner of <placeName id="t18320216-24-crimeloc129">Gracechurch-street</placeName>

I did not know who they were - I instantly went to the banking-house to stop payment of the draft, and by their advice went to the Mansion-house; I have never seen any of the property - on the 25th I was sent for to the Mansion-house, as several persons were in custody, to see if I could identify any of them; I saw the prisoner among others, and am certain of him - I told the Lord Mayor he was the person who had his hand round my waist.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Where do you live? A. At No. 5, New-road, St. George in the East -I had come from home that day, and walked all the way alone; nobody had interrupted me before - I did not come along Whitechapel, but through Prescott-street, into the Minories; I had nothing else in my reticule but my handkerchief and card-case - here is the reticule; I had called on a tenant a short distance from home, and received four sovereigns, which I put into my purse, and after that had no occasion to open the reticule - I held it with the string twisted round my hand; it is very small- I had a cloak on; it was a beaded purse - I saw a man who was taken with the prisoner; I could not positively swear to him, but if I saw the other I should recollect him; nothing attracted my attention but their rudeness in looking at me several times; I was told to attend at the Mansion-house, as several were in custody, and perhaps I might recollect some of them - I described the person who had robbed me, and a stout gentleman said,"I don't think he is here;" I then went up stairs - I did not see the prisoner till he was brought before the Lord Mayor; several others were brought up first - I said I did not know them; the prisoner was then brought with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160014"/>one rather taller - I thought that was one by his dress, but could not recollect sufficiently to swear to him, as I never saw his face, but I saw the faces of the other two; my handkerchief did not come out of my reticule - I cannot say whether the purse could have remained in it after it was cut; it was not cut before I got to Gracechurch-street, for I had it in my hand, and felt my purse in it - I had used my handkerchief coming along, but cannot recollect where; the purse was at the bottom of the reticule - it was exactly a fortnight before I saw the prisoner in custody; he had a hat on in the street, but not at the Mansion-house - I noticed him very much, because I considered him very rude; I described two of the persons at the Mansion-house the day it happened - one had a stye on his eye.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Till the person's arm was round your waist, your hand was at the bottom of your reticule? A. Yes - the purse contained 20l. in gold, and would have dropped into my hand if it had been cut then.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received orders to take all persons into custody who I saw in the street and knew to be bad characters; the prisoner was in custody - the prosecutrix came to the Mansion-house, and saw him in the Justice-room at the bar, with another, and identified him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was placed at the bar with another? A. Yes, not mixed with people in the Court; she had seen several others, and did not identify them.</p>

He said he brought it out for a poor man, and put it on his cart; I did not go with him to see the cart - Allison has been with me eight months; I had a very good opinion of him till latterly - the stable is in a private situation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You never saw the truss of clover afterwards? A. No - I could not miss one truss from my stock.</p>

            . I am six years and a half old - I know God will punish me in the next world if I tell a lie; I live with my parents in Church-street, Hackney. I was looking at the biscuits in the prosecutor's shop; I saw the prisoner behind the counter, taking some money out of the box in the till - he then came out, and took a spice nut - I saw Dunn tell Mr. Holwell of it; I saw the prisoner brought back - I am quite sure he is the person who took the money; I saw some money taken from him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Mr. Cross say to him, "I know you have been robbing me - tell me what you have done, and when you commenced, and I will forgive you?" A. Not exactly that; he said, "Now, young man, mind what I am going to say - we have been missing different sums of money from the desk, and we are aware of a great deal more than you think; we have found some marked money which was taken from a young man's pocket - did you take it?" he then said what I have stated; I do not recollect Newgate being mentioned - I think if it had I should have recollected it.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. On Thursday, the 5th of January, I was in Tothill-street, Westminster, with Evans - I saw the two prisoners and another woman, near the King's Arms; Roberts had this bundle under his arm - he was talking to Davis and the other woman, between a pawnbroker's and the public-house; I passed them a short distance and watched them- I saw them go into the King's Arms, and Evans followed them; I then went in, and Davis was abusing Evans - I asked Roberts what was in the bundle; he said some silk dresses, which were his own - I said, "You know me?" he said, "I do;" I said, "Where did you get these?" he said he bought them six months ago, of a man in Petticoat-lane; Davis was still making a great noise, and there were several women in the house - I requested Roberts to come into the street; he did so, and then he again said he bought them of a man six months ago, in Petticoat-lane, but he could not tell his name; I had left the bundle at the bar, and while I was talking to Roberts, Davis was coming out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160021"/>with something under her cloak - I suspected she had got the bundle, and asked what she had got; she said it was her own - she was loath to show it me, but I pulled it from under her cloak, and found it was the same that Roberts had had; it was then near three o'clock - the bundle contained these articles, which Mrs. Bannister afterwards claimed; on the evening that I discovered where they were lost from I went to Davis, who had been discharged the first day, but could not find her - I found her on Sunday morning, the 8th, at lodgings, which she said were her own: I found in the parlour this screw-driver, which, in my opinion, fits the marks found on the drawers at Mrs. Bannister's - Roberts said he had been in the habit of dealing in such things for two years; he lives in Ann-place, Westminster-road, and he stated so before the Magistrate, but he had first given me another direction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then Davis was twice examined? A. Yes, and twice discharged, and I was ordered to take her again - Roberts then had an olive coat and dark trousers on: the bundle was larger than it is now - Evans was not examined the first day, I believe, but he confirmed my statement on the second day; I cannot say whether Evans heard me ask the question in the house, but he did in the street - I swear that I put the question in the house, and out of the house, as a precaution to myself; I am certain Roberts did not say in the house, that he had been a dealer, attending Petticoat-lane for six months; but he said, distinctly and correctly, that he bought those things six months ago, of a man in Petticoat-lane.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I was with Grossmith, and saw Roberts and Davis in Tothill-street -Davis left Roberts, and went into a pawnbroker's shop; I followed her in, and asked what she was pawning - she turned and said, "You vagabond, I am taking something out, "Which I found she was - I then said, "Where is the man that was with you?" she said, "I had no man with me:" I went into the public-house, and saw Roberts there- Davis followed me in; I said to her, "Here is the man, what have you now to say?" she made a great noise - Grossmith, came in and said, "We will have none of this;" he took Roberts out - I then went out, and heard Roberts say he had bought the things of a man in Petticoat-lane, six months before; Davis took a small parcel out of pawn, which she said was a gown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What passed inside the public-house? A. There was such a confusion inside, that I did not hear what passed between Roberts and Grossmith - when I came out my attention was not called to any thing that passed, further than Grossmith said, "How long have you been a dealer in these things?" he said two years - that he bought things in the street, or of any body where he could get a bargain.</p>
               <p>Davis. Q. Had I any bundle? A. Yes, the bundle you took out of pawn - she afterwards took up this bundle, and was coming out; Grossmith stopped her with it.</p>

On the 12th of January I had been to Somers-town on an errand: I returned down the King's-road, and saw a carpenter fixing up some posts to a paling in front of a garden - I knew them to be Mr. Cumberland's; I cannot say when I had last seen them, as we have a great number of them - I believe it was some day in October; we lost six of them; I knew them by their matching some others which we had; I told my employer of it, and he sent me to the Police inspector, who came with me - we went, and they were still there, fixed in the ground, but they had been painted over and altered in shape at the top - I had before that told James Martin, and he had been there and seen them; they were taken up and matched with those we had in our possession - they were oak posts, for fencing round fields; they were square originally, but there were not enough to go round the field, and Mr. Cumberland had them cut in two - I examined the quality and age of the timber; they are the same.</p>

On the 12th of January I went with Martin and Boden to the prisoner's house - he was painting the posts, which the carpenter was putting up; I asked whose they were - he said they were his, he had had them given him six months before, by Mr. Waite, who used to keep the Fortune of War, next door to him; I said Mr. Waite had not kept the Fortune of War for six months past - he said No, he had left it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say you had seen these posts safe within three months? A. It might be four months; it was not so much as six - I think it was in october, or it might be in September: it could not be in August - I have been in Mr. Cumberland's service for fourteen years; I have now a discharge from him, in consequence of a letter which has been sent to him - I am to leave on Saturday week; I believe these posts came from Lord Camden's estate; his Lordship's work is not yet finished - I do not know whether the prisoner is his Lordship's tenant; the posts were not painted when I first saw them - I did not speak to the carpenter; they were next the pavement, in front of the garden - the prisoner consented to their being taken down, and then refused; he then consented again, and they were taken down - I did not say that I had a doubt whether they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160022"/>were my master's; I went before the Justice - I do not know that I knew any body was coming up for the prisoner; I did not go to his wife, and say there was nothing in the charge, and there was no occasion to bring up any body; I did not go to her with any message - I saw her on the Thursday morning, before the prisoner was taken - I told her the posts were my master's, and she said they had been in their place a long time: I did not go to the house a second time - I do not know that I saw her again.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you again, and desire you to recollect yourself - did you or did you not see the prisoner's wife again? A. No, Sir, I did not, nor speak to her any where - Hilyard was the carpenter who was putting up the posts; he told me that Lovegrove found the posts, and that he had had them for six months, and he himself was to find the rails.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM AGGS. I made inquiry about the prisoner of the persons he referred to, and they gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the prisoner's wife on any occasion? A. Yes, he desired me to go to the neighbourhood and inquire his character, and I went to his house, but not with an intention of seeing his wife; I went to see a lady named Lardner, who is now in Court - his wife said she was going down to the Police-office, and I said I did not think it was necessary - I did not think the prisoner was in danger; Mr. Cumberland desired me to say he did not wish to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to Mrs. Lardner, "Madam, you need not attend - it will save you a dirty walk? A. I did not say she need not attend; I do not recollect saying any thing about a dirty walk - I will not swear I did not: I told his wife she might expect him home by twelve or one o'clock, because the prosecutor said he did not wish to prosecute, he only wished him to be reprimanded, or to have some slight punishment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you let them know when you found the Magistrate was disposed to commit the prisoner? A. No, there were several of his friends there, who knew what the Magistrate did, and I thought they would let them know - I believe the prisoner is a painter and glazier; his house is about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was employed to put up these posts and rails; about seven months ago I repaired the back part of the kitchen for the prisoner - he said, "What shall I give you to put up some palings in front of my garden?" I said, "What am I to find?" he said, "Nails and rails - I have the posts in my garden;" I went and looked at them, and on the day stated I was putting them up; any person might have looked over the wall, and seen the posts in his garden - the prisoner said to Boden and Martin, "If you can swear to the posts swear to them here;" they said they could not, and he then consented to their being taken up - I was at the first hearing, and I was preparing to go to the second hearing, but the inspector came, said that no person would be wanted, and that Mr. Lovegrove would be at home at twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When had you seen these posts? A. About May - I do not mean to say that these are the posts I saw in his garden, but he had oak posts; I looked at them, and said they were rather short - he said, "Yes, but I have an oak bedstead up stairs, which I mean to cut up for spars;" I then said they would do very well - I noticed one was longer than the others, and so are these - he said I might do the job at any time that suited me, and I had a house to finish, which prevented my doing this before; the prisoner is a painter - I heard him say he had the posts of Mr. Waite.</p>

The prisoner has been in his employ more than six vears - he worked in a shop at the back of our house; on the 18th of January he came, and asked me for a piece of gold to make six brooch borders, (I have been in the habit of supplying the workmen with gold for many years) - I gave him a box with several pieces of gold in it; he had a pair of dividers and a gauge with him - he took up several pieces of gold with his right hand, and passed them into his left; I then perceived three fingers of his left hand closed - I watched him, and saw him lay down a piece of gold on the gauge, which he said would do for his purpose; I still noticed that the fingers of his left hand were closed - he then took up the gauge with his right hand, put it into his left hand, and I heard it chink against something, which confirmed my suspicion: just as he was going out my husband came in - I said, "Run and see what he has got in his hand;" he went after him into the shop, and I heard a great many words - the prisoner took the piece of gold in his right hand, which he said would do for his purpose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where were the dividers at the time? A. In his right hand - he was dividing the gold with them when he had laid the gauge down: there was a knock at the door while he was there - he said should he open it, and I said, "No, thank you," as I thought he would put the gold in his pocket; a lady came in - it is not the rule at the house if a person comes for the servants to go away; they often stop, and have what they want; I called my husband in to tea, after the words that passed in the work-shop; the prisoner then came in, and said he wished to have his wages settled - my husband said he could not settle them then, as he was in such a confused state, but he might call on the next day; he called the next day, and saw me - in the mean time my husband had been to his lodging; I did not see the prisoner again till he was at Hatton-garden - he was in general constantly employed, but sometimes only for four or five days in a week; he was never employed so little as three days till within about a month - he was a confidential man.</p>
               <p>THOMAS AUSENDER. On the 18th of January I went into my counting-house, between four and five o'clock; my wife told me to follow the prisoner to the shop, which I did - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160023"/>went up to him, and said, "You have a piece of gold, have you not, Rapley?" he said Yes, and he hold up a piece of gold, which he had marked with the dividers, and said it would do for what he wanted, and in fact it was more than he wanted; I said, "You have more gold;" he said he had not - I said, "You have something in your left hand," which was doubled; he said, "Yes, the gauge;" and he held it out to me - I said, "You have a piece of gold in that hand;" he said he had not - I told him I would not stand any nonsense - I insisted upon seeing what was in his left hand; he then took the gauge out of his left hand, and from between the gauge and the palm of his hand he threw this piece of gold on the work-bench - this is it; I marked it - I called him a thieving villain, and said I suspected he had been robbing me for a long time; he said he had only one thing to blame himself for, and that was for denying that he had the gold in his hand, and he did not wonder at my suspecting he had stolen it - I desired him to leave my work-shop; I went for an officer, and went with him to the prisoner's house about two hours after he left me - he lodged in the attic; I went into the room on the left, and he was melting something in some charcoal, but I did not see the metal; I said, "I suppose you expected me?" he said, "Yes, I did, rather;" we went into the back room, and I found he had got a complete shop, a flatting-mill, and more tools than I have - there was some little talk between him and the officer, but I did not hear what the prisoner said; this is the piece of gold - there is about 2 dwts. of 18 carat gold - if I had known he had a shop of this description I would not have employed him; he surrendered at the office.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went into the shop in consequence of what your wife told you? A. Yes; I did not see how his hands were when I followed him; the shop is about five yards from my house - I told him to go, and then he said he could not think of stopping; he came into my counting-house to ask for his wages - I said I was not in a state to talk to him about them then - he might call on me on the morrow, and I would settle; I saw an ingot of gold at his lodgings, in a box, about 8 ozs weight, and there were some cuttings, which I know came out of my work-shop, and there was some silver solder cut up in pannels: I said to the officer, "How the sight of the gold makes my heart ache, when I know that I have been robbed;" I did not desire the officer to take any thing else - we went away, and left him that night; I had decidedly expressed my opinion that some of the property was mine, but I have not had it taken - we sent for the prisoner the next day, but he was out; he came to the Police-office of his own accord - I have not sent his wages; I do not know what is due to him - his work is unfinished; he never had to ask me twice for his wages, though he has been with me nearly seven years.</p>

I was in the shop when he charged the prisoner with this; he asked what gold he had in his hand - he said,"This, Sir," but I did not see it as I was at work; Mr. Ausender then asked what he had in his other hand - he said the gauge; he then said, "Have you not got a bit of gold?" he said No - he said, "Open your hand," and I heard something fall on the board; I looked up, and saw a piece of gold in Mr. Ausender's hand - this is about the size of it; there was much altercation, and Mr. Ausender asked what excuse he could have for having it - he said he took it for a size; I suppose he meant to gauge the other by - the prosecutor said it looked very suspicious, having it in his hand, and denying it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know what is due to the prisoner? A. No - he might earn 2l. a week, more or less; I consider him a very good workman; he had to make the borders for six brooches - I did not look up till I heard the gold fall.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he say he took the gold in part of any wages? A. No.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutors service. I was present when he came to the shop and asked the prisoner what he had in one of his hands; he held out his right hand, and said, "I have got this;" he said, "Have you got any more gold?" he said, No; he said, "What have you got in the other hand?" he said, "The gauge;" he said, "Have you no gold in that hand;" he said, No:" he said, "Open your hand and let me see;" - he opened his hand, and threw something out of it on the board - I saw a piece of gold taken up, something like this - this gauge would be quite sufficient to conceal a piece of gold of this size; I heard Mr. Ausender call him a thieving villain, and he asked him what he wanted with that piece of gold - he said at first, it was for a size and then he said if there was not enough in the large piece, to make up with that.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Ausender to search the prisoners lodgings - the back room was like a shop - the prosecutor said, "How I have been robbed," the prisoner said - "I never robbed you before, this is the first time I took any thing."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the prosecutor point to any particular articles which he could swear to? A. No, he said there was no one thing he could swear to, - I do not remember that Mr. Ausender made any reply when the prisoner said, "I never robbed you before" - he was looking over a box - it was not a large room - I did not take him into custody when he said that - I thought I should have done so, but Mr. Ausender did not wish me to do it - I certainly heard the word; I have been an officer thirty years - the prisoner showed us every thing about his premises - there was a piece of lighted charcoal, and he was at work, on a ring - I went to his house the next morning, but he was not at home, and he came down to the office.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the gold and silver in the shop in shapeless masses? A. It seemed as if melted into masses, the prisoner was in his shirt sleeves - the piece of charcoal was all in a blaze, metal would have melted in it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had applied to the prosecutrix for gold for six brooches, but not being able to find a piece large enough for more than two, he told her so, when she replied that he had better take a piece more, and flat it - a lady then came in, and that he said to the prosecutrix,"These will do," upon which she replied, "Very well, take them;" upon the prosecutor's charging him with having two pieces of gold, he replied that he had so, but not more than sufficient to do his work, and the prosecutor being too violent to hear an explanation, he determined to leave - he positively denied having used the words attributed to him by the officer, and had voluntarily surrendered on hearing inquiries had been made for him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160024"/>MRS. AUSENDER. The prisoner did not state when he took the principal piece of gold, that it was the only piece of the right substance, but it would only do for two brooches; I am certain he only took one piece for his work - there were larger piece of gold there than he wanted.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at a bad house, in Rose-lane, Spitalfields, on the 23rd of December; I told her I wanted her on suspicion of robbing her mistress; there was a young man in her company - I said he must go also; she said he knew nothing about it - she said nothing else, except before the Magistrate.</p>

The prisoner and several more, all relations and friends - I would not draw them any liquor, and they were just on the point of going - when I opened the door to let them out, the prosecutor and his friend went to force themselves in; I pushed the three men (the prisoner, Bartlett, and Goodwin) out against them; that is all I know - they had come to my house about seven o'clock in the evening, and were in and out all the evening; I think there were eight of them - I had closed my door on purpose to sweep the doorway and shut my shutter; I heard nothing which passed outside till the rattle sprang.</p>

On Monday morning, the 2nd of January, about eight o'clock, I missed all these furs, which I had seen safe the night before - (I knew the prisoner Harris; I had lived next door to his father - he came to my house about three weeks before the robbery, and said,"Oh, you have got a good stock of furs;" I said, "Yes, I wish I could sell them;") my lodger keeps a dog in the garret, and that had barked about six or seven o'clock that morning; one person could have carried them all away - Davey, the Policeman, found part of them next day; they were marked with my name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you purchased any thing from Harris before this? A. He once brought some old muffs - I would not buy them, but I believe my wife gave him 3s. for them to cut up - that was three or four weeks before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Harris that three men had attempted to break open your house that night? A. Yes, on the Friday night they had opened my shutters and looked in at the window; that was two days before the robbery - I told him so on the Sunday night, when he called; he did not sit with me that night - I never kept him in conversation. for I knew his character; he stood at my cutting-board for about a quarter of an hour - I asked what was his pleasure: he said, "Have you sold your muffs and tippets?" I said No; and next morning I was robbed of them - he saw them all that night, and said he had a customer, and could sell them for me: I said if he did I would give him a commission - his father is in the same business as I am.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he at your house three weeks before the robbery, and again on the night before? A. Yes - the property was worth 32l., 17s.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 3rd of January, I and Busain went to No. 10, Lion and Lamb-court, Playhouse-yard, and in a room up one pair of stairs, I found eighty-three pieces of fur, part of which the Magistrate ordered me to return to the prosecutor - I have a tippet, two skins, and three collars; I found no muffs - there are but two rooms in the house: Wood and Hambridge were in the room when we were searching - I found the skins on the floor, under a bed; I saw the letters M. T. on one of the skins - the inspector found the tippet on the left-hand side of the room, under another hed on the floor: Hambridge was up, but had not all her clothes on - I took Anderson that night, at the Castle,  reville's-rents.</p>

On Tuesday, the 3rd of January, I went with Davey, about seven o'clock in the evening, to this house; Hambridge and Wood were there - I found this tippet between the bed and mattress; there were eighty-three pieces of fur in all found, but no muffs; there were two beds on the floor in the room - the skins were under the bed by the door, and only the tippet under the other bed; Wood and Hambridge were down stairs when the furs were found; the house is only one story high - I had taken Wood and Hambridge into custody in the ground floor room, before I found the furs; that was not on account of the furs - when the furs were first found, not suspecting they were stolen, we did not take them, but when we took them and counted them, the prisoners were in the room; they had been brought up - seeing some of them marked we said, "Here are some furs we don't think are honestly come by;" they made no reply.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember seeing some bundles there when you and Mrs. Hambridge went up to light the fire? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you recollect whether Sunday was a wet night? A. I believe it was dry - I did not clean their shoes that morning, but they were dry.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have the clerks books of this description? A. Yes; there are six clerks in the office - the hours for business with the public conclude at three o'clock - Mr. Robarts was a trustee in 1830, and, I believe, from the commencement of the Institution, in 1816; the prisoner had not left us quite a year when he was apprehended - I believe he was taken in the residence he occupied when in our office; he had no part of the clerk's duty to perform - all monies paid in there should be received by me; the clerks refer depositors to me, to make payments - I am responsible for the money received; the accounts are kept by the actuary - the prisoner was to arrange the depositors according to their turn; I pay the cash to the treasurer - nobody but myself is authorised to receive money; I am not aware of any express stipulation that no clerk is to receive money, but that is the course of business - I am not aware that about the time the prisoner left, it had been proposed to put him in livery.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was the prisoner's duty to present the depositors at the clerk's desk? A. Yes - the clerk enters the figures in the book, and after the money is paid to me, it is written in words, at length, by another clerk, and a manager signs his initials in the margin - that has not been done in this book.</p>

The prisoner said the first time, that I could leave my money with him, and it would be all correct - I left him the 5l. note and sovereigns; we returned in a fortnight, and gave the prisoner the papers - he looked at them, and said there was something wrong in one of them concerning my husband's business; he gave them to Lockwood to take home again, and gave him his address, that he might send them up, and not have the trouble of coming again - Lockwood is now dead; I got the paper altered - Lockwood wrapped them in paper, and sent them up; a fortnight or three weeks after that, I went to the office for my book, as the prisoner had promised to send us one - (Lockwood and us were uneasy about it, and Lockwood paid my fare up to see about it;) when I went in, the prisoner said, "Good morning, Mrs. Hubbard, I was just going to send your book up;" he had got it in a brown paper parcel, directed to my husband, at the Horse and Groom, Streatham - he said he supposed I was uneasy about it; I said, "Not particularly, I suppose it is all right now;" he said, "Yes, it is all correct;" I was then satisfied - this is the book he gave me; he came to see me on the last Sunday in last March - I brought out my book, and he said something about 3 1/2 percent. for what I had deposited, and if I had any more to deposit at any time, he would take it as a friend, and see it deposited for me - about three weeks before last Christmas, I went up to the office again, with a little money we had saved, and found Clay had left; I presented my book, and was told that was not the day to make deposits - I wanted them to make it for me; they refused - we left, and six weeks ago next Monday, I came up with five sovereigns, and found we had no money there; inquiry was made about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went at noon-day to make your deposit? A. Yes - I saw nobody but Clay; I was in the outer office - he appeared like a gentleman then, but, I believe, was called the porter; it was a kind of place I was never at before - I went on a Tuesday, the first and second time; the 8l. has never been put down to my account.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent of any criminal intention - I merely took it in my duty, as I thought it was to promote the interest of the concern, but my memory being very bad, (I have been materially injured, several times severely, and consider) I must have overlooked the thing, which certainly an upright man should not have done - it is not likely I should have committed myself in this way, when there was no occasion for it; it must have arisen in some degree from being fully occupied in another extensive concern, which I hold at the present moment.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. The prisoner came to the shop, and presenting a pattern of flannel, asked at what price we could supply that quality, saying he had been sent by a gentleman from the Tower, who would want about three hundred yards, to make Cholera Morbus belts, that the guards had been charged 2s. 9d. each, and he thought he could supply them at 1s. 9d. - I watched him; there was nothing on the counter likely to attract his attention but a handkerchief, and in two or three minutes I missed that - I sent for an officer, and charged him with it; he denied it, but on my saying we should soon ascertain what he had about him, he took off his cap, presented the handkerchief, and said, "This is all I have of yours."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was rather tipsy - I wanted four or five yards of flannel, and said I might want a large quantity afterwards - I took up this handkerchief, lifted it into my cap, and left my own by the side of a basket, thinking it was mine; he said, "You have made a mistake, you have got the wrong handkerchief;" I took off my cap, and saw it was his - I gave it to him, and took my own from the basket.</p>
               <p>JAMES RENIE. I saw no handkerchief of his; he came into the middle of the shop, and then moved to where this handkerchief laid - he could not mistake it for his own - he did not appear tipsy.</p>

On the morning of the 18th of January I went to Edgware-road, and ascertained that the two prisoners had been seen there together, at half-past ten o'clock the night before; I then went to Howard's lodgings, which is about twenty-five yards from the place; I found him in bed - I awoke him, and told him he was suspected of robbing the slaughter-house; he said he knew nothing about it - I told him to get up and dress, which he did, and I saw a large patch of suet on the right knee of his trousers; I asked how that came there: he said he knew nothing about it - he got up, and in going down stairs I asked where his handkerchief was; he said he had pawned it; I locked him up, and then went to Woodward's lodgings; I knocked at the door, and his wife answered; I asked if he lived there; she said Yes, but he was just gone down; I said he was not out of the house, and I must wait - I waited, and he came to the door; I said I believe you are

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If there were persons trying to trip you up, how can you say no one was near you? A. That was afterwards; it was about half-past six o'clock - at the pit door there might be fifty persons, but I was quite outside of them; the crowd was before me when I was robbed, and there was no one behind me but the prisoner - there was no person so close as to rob me; I turned, and would have taken him by the collar, if his companion, who was before me, had not pressed me back, and when I turned the prisoner was facing me in a side direction: just at the moment I first saw the prisoner, another man came between us - I put my arm out to grasp the prisoner, and the other pressed against me; I told the prisoner I thought he had been a clerk of ours, and when he was at the watch-house I called him Davis, but I had not seen that man for ten years - when asked at the watch-house how much I had lost, I said I was not certain, it was four sovereigns or four sovereigns and a half - they then said,"Here are four sovereigns and a half found on the prisoner," and I said, on reflection, "It was four sovereigns and a half;" I knew I had taken four sovereigns and two half-sovereigns from the cash, and did not at first recollect whether I had changed one half-sovereign or two - my purse has not been found; I only lost sight of the prisoner as he turned the corner, and the officer was then pursuing him, so that he was not out of the sight of the officer or me - the pressure was a pressure forwards, to get into the pit, but the prisoner was the only man behind me at the time; my wife had hold of my arm, and my daughters were before me - I did not notice to my wife that my pocket had been opened, but I felt it, buttoned it up, and then buttoned my coat: I was at the door about three minutes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If I understand you rightly, there was no one behind you but the prisoner? A. Not immediately behind me, and there was a sharp pressure upon me, which there was no occasion for, and in a quarter of a minute I found I had been robbed - the prisoner was not going forward when I turned, but he had something looking at in his hand, and was endeavouring to get out of the house - it was impossible for any one but the prisoner to take my purse; I have not the least doubt of that, nor had I from the first.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty at the theatre - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner leave the pit entrance; I reached my hand out to take him, but he ran out of my reach, and I followed him to Eagle-court, where he was met by two persons, who stopped his progress - I then took hold of both his hands; I did not see any one following him till I had him in my custody, as the company going to the theatre was so thick - I might have seen the prosecutor before, but there were so many people I did not notice him; I found 15s. 6d. and a bunch of keys in one of the prisoner's pockets, and in his other pocket four sovereigns and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Which of the pit doors was this? A. On the south side; I saw a concourse of people, enough to fill the avenue out of the street; the place was very full as it generally is - when I first saw him, he was coming down the steps from the crowd - I did not lose sight of him; he certainly turned some corners, but I turned and kept him in view - he might have got rid of a purse without my seeing him, or he might have thrown it down before he got out of the crowd - I did not see where his hand went while I was pursuing him - I took him in about two minutes - I looked along the line he run in, and in the lobby, but found nothing -I had taken him to the station-house before that; the prosecutor said he believed he had lost about 4l. 10s.; that was before I told him what I had taken from the prisoner - I do not recollect whether he said pounds or sovereigns; he recognized the prisoner as having stood on his right hand at the theatre, and just as the doors were being opened he felt himself hustled; he said several pressed up against him, and somebody called out "Don't press gentleman, there is time enough and room enough," and when he tried to get after the prisoner, he was attempted to he tripped up; I heard him call the prisoner Davis, and he said he thought he was a young man who had been a clerk of theirs, but afterwards he told me it was not him.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the evening of the 20th of January I met the prisoners in Whitechapel-road; I saw Townsend pull off his hat, and give Warner a handkerchief, who took something from under his arm, and covered it with the handkerchief; they passed me; I followed, stopped Warner, and asked what he had got; he said a picture, which he bought of a Jew in a public house in Baker's-row; I took him to the office, and the next day I found the prosecutor had lost the picture; Warner said he made the frame, and the glass was given him with the picture; I took Townsend on the Sunday morning - I said I wanted him about young Warner's concern; he said he had heard that Warner was taken about a picture, but he knew nothing of it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. About halfpast nine o'clock, on the 7th of February, I was going up Portpool-lane, and heard a conversation in a public-house - I heard a voice say, "Fred carried off these books in one of the milk-pails, and one was a history of the Church of Christ;" the door then opened, and I heard singing -I then heard a voice say "He has sold them to Mother Davie for half a crown;" I made inquiry, and found where the books came from - I inquired who brought milk there; I then went, and took the prisoner - I told him I knew very well the books were at Mother Davie's, and asked what she gave him for them; he said 6s. - I did not then know any thing of these other six books, only the History of the the Church of Christ.</p>

            . I live in Baldwin's-gardens. On the 7th of February the prisoner came, and asked if I would buy some books - I said, "Where are they?" he said outside the door - I got up, and saw him take the books from a very decent young man; he brought them to me, and said they were that young man's books, but there being one volume wanting he could not pawn them; I paid him 4s. for them, and gave him 3d. for himself - these are the four books; on the Friday he brought these other six books, and I bought them for 4s. - I have known him from a child, and his father and mother; I knew he was in the milk trade, but I never had any transaction with him before.</p>

            . I am a master carman. I was going down Swan-street; I met the cart, with the boy in it, and about the middle of the street I saw the bale; the prisoner and two others were there - the prisoner had his hand on it - I did not see how they got it out of the cart; it was in the road when I first saw it - they pitched it up against the side of a house; one said, "Where is Joe?" the prisoner said, "D-n Joe! give me a tip up with it;" he did not get it up, because a boy came up and said "That it is not all right;" the prisoner then had his hand on the bale - he was near enough to hear what the boy said; the boy said they had taken it out of the cart - when they heard this, the prisoner and the two others ran away; I ran, but they were too light-heeled for me - I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody; he is one of the persons who had his hand on the bale - in the run I lost sight of his face, but not of his back.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever see him before? A. Not to my knowledge; I first saw them throwing it out of the road into the foot-path - the cart was then about ten yards from the bale; it was going on at a full trot - the boy who was in the cart is not here; the prisoner ran about two-thirds of Swan-street - I never lost sight of him; it was about ten minutes past six o'clock, and nearly dark.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where did you take the prisoner? A. Nearly opposite Charterhouse-lane; I never lost sight of him - my father's watch was not found; the prisoner's own watch was found on him; the party was in Northampton-street; we had after that called at a public-house, and taken a glass of cold gin-and-water -I believe it was the Red Lion; we did not go to any other - I was quite sober; he had the watch when I took him by the collar, but the other man coming up I lost all sight of the prisoner - he was one that rushed out of the crowd; he had been with five or six others in Smithfield; he had the watch in his right hand - the Policeman had a watch in his hand when he took the prisoner; I cannot say whether that was the watch I had seen in his hand - my father was not quite sober; he wound up his watch in the Red Lion, and put it into his pocket - he went to the Red Lion on the Wednesday, and I went with him, and I went on the Tuesday after we returned from Hatton-garden - we had been at Mr. Carey's, and left about halfpast twelve o'clock.</p>

            . I am father to the witness. I think I was the worse for liquor: I never saw my watch after I left the Red Lion, in St. John-street - my son told me that my watch was gone - I felt my fob, and the watch was gone; my son left me, and pursued the prisoner - I attempted to follow him; I received a blow on my nose, and did not recollect any thing more for some minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were in the public house where you last saw your watch? A. My son and three men; I took out my watch before two of the men; the third, I believe, had left the house - I put it into my fob, and never saw it again; I perfectly recollect what I was about till I received the blow - I went to the public-house to ascertain if they knew the young man, who had stood at the bar and drank some gin-and-water; I wanted to know whether he had gone forward to tell any person that I had a watch - I had been to the same house on Tuesday, and then ascertained that he had staid at the house half an hour after me - I called again on the Wednesday, but I merely went in to have a pint of ale, as I was ill; I was sober when I went there on the night of the robbery,</p>

I had before that seen several persons on the opposite side of the way, as I was crying half-past one; I went down Smithfield-bars on the right hand side, and came up on the left; I there heard the cry, and saw several persons; I saw the prisoner running; I sprang my rattle, and pursued him; he ran as far as the reuts, and a private watchman, of John-street, came and stopped him; he resisted a great deal, and went down on his back - I was surrounded by ten or a dozen, who pushed me down, made an opening and rescued him. I got up, and pursued him, and when I came up, he was in custody of two Policeman - I am certain he is the person - as he ran his arm was swinging out; and I heard something chink on the stones; he had nothing when he was taken.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Broad-street, Golden-square. On the 7th of February I was called in to attend the deceased, whom I had known for some years; I saw her at her husband's house, which is a public-house, in Half Moon-street, Piccadilly - I found her in a state of insensibility, which appeared to proceed from an injury of the brain; I used the usual remedies, and attended her till the Saturday following, when she died - she always remained in a state of insensibility; I opened the head, and found the scull fractured across in one direction, and a second fracture extending from the right angle to the other - it was a very extensive fracture, but without any displacement of the bones; I found a quantity of blood effused, covering the whole of one side of the brain, and towards the anterior part of the brain I found it more effused, and in that part the brain had been lacerated to some extent; these injuries were fully sufficient to occasion death - I should have suspected, if I had not been informed of the circumstance, that it had been caused by falling from some height on some hard substance, which would produce such an injury.</p>

            . I live with Mr. John Richardson, at the Griffin. The prisoner came into the house about half-past seven o'clock; I had never seen her-before - she did not appear in liquor then - she had a quartern of gin, which a woman and her drank; they then had a pint of porter - the other woman left; the prisoner then began to make a noise, and sing; Mrs. Richardson wished her to be quiet - she then began to use bad language; my master came down, and said if she was not quiet he would send for a Policeman; she was quiet for a few minutes, and I left her standing at the bar - in a short time I heard a fall, and on coming up stairs saw mistress in master's arms; she appeared to be dead - her Christian name was Isabella.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the house with another person to drink; I said it was all right, and we would go- the bar-maid said I owed 4d. for an old score, which I had paid; the landlord came and took my parcel out of my hand for the 4d., which I said I could not pay - he pulled me to the kitchen stairs, and some female behind said, "Away with her - burke her," which very much frightened me; he gave me my parcel - as I went out, somebody took hold of me very violently, and I fell down the steps with somebody after me; my parcel fell out of my hand - my husband went the next morning, and got it; I know nothing of the accident, nor who it was that fell.</p>

I said Yes; he asked if I knew them - I said I thought I did; the officer came up - I went with him, but did not find them then; I was taken ill, and obliged to go to the London hospital, and it was eight weeks after before I saw the prisoner - he was then at the Thames Police; I thought he was the man who went before the prosecutor - I took it to be Murray, by his appearance and dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? A. I took it to be the person who I had known before - I had known the one I took it to be four years by selling pies in the street; I cannot positively swear he is the same man - the prosecutor was on one side of the way, and I on the other; the street is twelve or fourteen yards wide - it was a dark night; there was a gas-lamp a little way from him - I only had a momemary view of him; they no sooner struck him than they were off, one way, and the other the other.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You closed the door after your brother? A. Yes; I continued in the back parlour with my father from then till I was going away - my father has one servant; she is not here - the nearest coach-stand to the house is at the Angel, which is about five minutes' walk; I saw the hat drop from the prisoner - he mustv have carried it before him, as I did not see it in his hand - when I left off following him, I told other persons to follow him, and am certain of him.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL JONES. I live in Upper Chadwell-street. -When my son left the parlour I heard a rush - I immediately went to the front door, which I saw open, and heard my son cry Stop thief! a great many people were running - I went down the steps, and not two yards from there I took up this hat; my son returned in about a minute or a minute and a half - I gave him his hat, and he went back in pursuit; a crowd very shortly after brought the prisoner into the passage - the Policeman found on him a picklock-key, with wards at each end, and a latch-key; my great coat, which I had missed out of the passage, was brought in - it had hung on the same rail as the hat; a man brought it back at the same moment as the prisoner was brought in, and said he found it in Myddleton-square, which is about thirty-five yards from my house; I had heard my son Henry shut the door after my other son, about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you remain in the parlour from that time till the alarm? A. Yes; I ran out directly I heard the alarm - the people were not near my house; they were running after the man, about fifty yards off - I saw my coat safe about six or half-past six o'clock; my maid servant was not at home.</p>

I followed the prisoner, who was running, and Mr. Henry Jones after him - I saw nobody else running at first; there was only us three in the street at that time - I know the prisoner by his person, his coat, and boots; he had very large buttons on his coat - the street was very light; there was a lamp at the corner - I could see his dress plainly; he had nothing about him at that time - I followed him about a hundred and fifty yards, and kept him in view all the while; a Policeman then came up in front, and took him - he was running as fast as he possibly could when the Policeman came up; he said, "You are mistaken in the person;" I followed him to the house, and saw two keys found in his inside breast pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a pot-boy? A. No, a plumber- I have worked for Mr. Bateman, Arlington-street, off and on, for four or five years; I was standing at the corner of the Fountain, for a necessary purpose, four or five doors from Jones' house; I lodge at the Fountain - I was quite sober; I had not been there above a minute when I heard the alarm, but my back was towards Jones' house; Mr. Jones was two or three doors from the house when I first saw him, and the prisoner almost close to him - he had not got the great coat then.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Playhouse-yard, St. Luke's. I received information that some boots and shoes were to be sold at No. 10, Lion and Lamb-court, Playhouse-yard - in consequence of which, I went there on Tuesday night, the 3rd of January, about six o'clock; there are two rooms in the house - I went to the upper room, and found the four prisoners and another man, who was not taken; it is a bed-room - Hambridge was in bed; the others were up, dressed, and having tea<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160045"/>- I saw twelve pairs of boots, eight pairs of shoes, and three odd ones on the floor; I told them I had come to look at them for a person they had sent to - I paired them but, and told them they were unsaleable goods, because I had suspicion about them; I said I was placed in an awkward situation, as I was buying for another person - they asked me to bid money for them; I said I would give an answer in five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you speak to, and who spoke to you? A. I cannot name one in particular - they all spoke, the women as well as the men; I cannot say which spoke to me first - Anderson said, "You shall have them at your own price;" the one who is not here said."Not quite at your own price, but you shall have them for very little;" both the women spoke, but what they said I cannot say; I came away, and immediately went to the Police-station, Bunhill-row - they knew nothing of the robbery there, and I went to the Rosamond-street station; I then went to the prosecutor, and received information from him - I immediately went to the house with Busain, the inspector, another Policeman, and the prosecutor's man; the Policeman laid back, and the prosecutor's man knocked at the door - Hambridge came to the door, and asked who was there; I said I had come concerning the boots - she opened the door, and said she believed they were sold; she called Wood down - he said they were not sold; I said I had brought a customer for them - we went into the lower room, and he pulled the boots from under the stairs- the prosecutor's man looked at them; I said, "There were twelve pairs;" Wood said there were but ten pairs, for he had pawned two pairs - I looked them over, and asked the young man if they would do; he hesitated, and then said Yes, they would; I offered Wood 25s. for them(he asked 2l.); he said that was too little, I should have them for 30s. - I immediately went and opened the door; he then said, "Don't keep the door open, you shall have them" - I gave a whistle, and the inspector and officer came in and took Wood, and the boots and shoes; Hambridge was also taken; Anderson and Eaton were not in the house at the time - I had been gone about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Anderson is not the person with whom you attempted to make the bargain finally? A. No, he was not in the room; I should know the other person if I saw him - he goes by the name of Holley; he has been searched for, and not found - I do not know whether he lived in the house.</p>
               <p>Wood. Q. Was no other man in the house besides what you have named? A. Yes, there was a Jew in the room, looking at the boots and shoes, at the same time when I went up - he lived close by; I knew him well - he was sent for to buy the property, the same as I was; he told me so, in their presence and hearing - nobody fetched me; I received information from my wife that the boots and shoes were to be sold - I offered 1l. for them; Wood said I should have them for 25s. - I had not the money in my possession to offer.</p>

            . I lived servant at this house, which was kept by Humbridge; Anderson lodged there, but nobody else - he had not lodged there a week; I had seen Wood come backwards and forwards, but he did not lodge there - I saw him there almost every day; I do not know whether he slept there - my mistress slept in the lower room; Anderson slept on the first floor - Mrs. Hambridge moved her things up there while her own room was whitewashed, and she slept there at that time; Anderson slept in the same room - I had seen Wood there on Sunday morning and Tuesday; I saw the boots and shoes on the Monday morning, about eight o'clock, in Anderson's room - Wood was in the room at that time, and Anderson and a young man named Holley; he was a friend of Anderson's and Wood's - I only saw him there two or three times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe Hambridge had only come to the house about a week before? A. That was all - I was present when Anderson agreed to pay her 2s. a week for his room; there were two beds in the room - I remember about eight o'clock on Monday morning, going up with Hambridge to light the fire; there were some bundles in the room, which she took notice of; the strange man was in the room at that time - I remember Mrs. Hambridge making a remark about the bundles, but cannot say what it was; to the best of my recollection, she asked what the bundles were.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the man said they were his, and he was a dealer in Petticoat-lane? A. He might, but I cannot say - Hambridge said she thought they were not honestly come by, and desired they might be moved off her promises instantly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. She said that to Holley? A. Yes; I never saw any thing in the room till Holley came.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you sleep in the house? A. No - I found Holley, Anderson, and Wood there at eight o'clock on Monday morning, when I went.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . Q. Have you made inquiry for Holley? A. Yes, and understand he is in the House of Correction - I do not know that myself.</p>
               <p>Anderson's Defence. I am innocent - I certainly knew they were in the house, but at that time I could not call the room mine - it was the only room that was occupied, on account of the other going under repair; I do not know that I ever saw Holley before in my life: I solemnly declare I never made any remark about the property - I was sitting at tea, and after tea left the house; I went to the Castle public-house - the officer came and apprehended me, as I stood there talking to two gentlemen, who I had business with; I was not drinking - I told him I was very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160046"/>willing to go, for I had done nothing to be afraid of - as In the girl, I do not know what makes me think so, but I certainly think she would say any thing to convict me; I never did her an injury.</p>
               <p>Wood's Defence. I was in the house on Sunday evening, late, and stopped all night, and when the girl came up in the morning, I was in the room; I had not long been out of bed - I had my breakfast between nine and ten o'clock, and left; I returned in the afternoon, between three and four, had tea, and a man came in, who appeared the owner of the boots and shoes - he said he would sell me a pair very cheap; I singled out this pair of boots, and paid him 8s. for them, in their presence - I had my tea, and went out on Monday night, and did not return till Tuesday afternoon; when I came up there were three men in the room, which were Anderson, a man not in custody, and a man who Hardwick calls a Jew; I sat down, had tea, and heard the bargain made with Hardwick; he said he could not deal with him then, but would go out, and give an answer in five minutes, and I believe he sent an answer that he could not deal with them - the man, after some hesitation, got up, went out, and said to me, "If that man should come again, you show him the boots, but do not sell them till I come back;" in about an hour and a half Hardwick returned, and said he thought he had a customer, if I would produce the boots - I produced them- he wanted me to take money for them, and said he would give 1l., but never offered the money, nor do I think he had it in his possession at the time; I told him I would not sell them as they did not belong to me, I would much rather wait till the owner came in - after urging me for five minutes to let him have them for the money, I said I would not, I would rather wait for the owner, who I expected in five or ten minutes; he opened the door, called in a Policeman, and I was taken; while they were searching the house a knock came at the door - I was on the first floor; Busain said to Davey, "Go down, open the door - whoever it is, let them in, and detain them;" he went and opened the door, and the man, seeing an officer, instantly made off, followed by the officer; they could not catch him - he came back, and told Busain a man had been to the door with a green coat and plated buttons, but he could not entice him in; I said the man, most likely, would prove to be the owner of the property - the little girl and Hambridge can prove I paid 8s. for the boots; my own shoes were found in the room, and they were a very old pair - I changed a sovereign to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Hambridge's Defence. I am innocent of knowing they were stolen; Eaton had only come to drink tea at my house.</p>

            . I was nearly two years in the Police - I was not discharged; Busain, my inspector, can speak to my character.</p>
               <p>Wood. Q. Did you not retain money belonging to a witness in the Court? A. Never; nor did I retain a watch belonging to a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Anderson. Hardwick said before the Magistrate that I said, "There they are," not that I might have them at his own price; Heardson said on Saturday, that I said I would not take so much for my bargain, meaning my furs; if you will look at the depositions, that applied to the boots, and not the furs.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I first saw the prosecutor near Temple-bar; the two prisoners were then following close to him - they followed him to King-street, and kept close to his pockets, and once Lofthouse had hold of his coat, to feel if he had any thing in it; in King-street I saw Lofthouse put his right hand into the prosecutor's left-hand coat pocket, and draw his handkerchief out- Sartin was alongside of him at the time; I asked the prosecutor if he had lost any thing - he felt, and missed his handkerchief: I instantly returned, and secured the two prisoners - I searched them, and found the handkerchief in Sartin's hat, which he had on his head; it was a little before nine o'clock - I searched them not half a minute after I saw it taken: I had not seen Lofthouse give it to Sartin; I was about two yards from them, and had my eyes on them all the time - I did not see Sartin take his hat off - that must have been done afterwards; I am sure they were in company all the way from Temple-bar, I saw them talking together.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160047"/>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            , an attorney, in Finsbury-place. I was concerned for Earle; he had referred Price to me for a character; he was convicted last Session.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give Earle a most respectable character? A. I am not aware that I did - I stated to Price what Earle had represented himself to me, and what I knew of him: I stated that we had been concerned for Mr. Earle, in settling a lease of some premises, near Battle-bridge, for which he was to pay a rent of 2000l. a year, we being concerned for one of the ground-landlords, and that he represented to us that he had a fishery in Ireland, the lease of which was just out, and he had premises at St. Mary-at-hill: it was in contemplation to form a tontine; that he was to reveal a secret for the cure of fish; that he was to receive a large annuity; and that Earle stated to me, that the agent of the Duke of Devonshire was to be a party concerned; several other persons whom he named were to be parties, and that there had been a meeting at the London-tavern, to make the arrangements; but Earle had stated to me afterwards that the arrangements were broken off, and it was to be conducted according to the terms of the engagement; I left it to Price to judge for himself, and that he must see the danger of this security being negociated - I said that Earle was only a very recent acquaintance, and I relied on his representation to me, having no previous acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to him that Mr. Earle was a man of 5000l. a year? A. Certainly not, nor that he was in possession of a fishery in Ireland, nor what he had given for the fishery; nor that whether the pickled fish concern was successful or not, he would be sure to recover his money, for Earle was a man of property - nor that the company was sure to be successful, and that I was glad he had got into the company's service: I am positive nothing of the sort passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner any party to that agreement? A. Only by inference; he was not present at the execution.</p>
               <p>COURT Q. Did you see him on the subject of the agreement? A. I did - I think it was on the 6th of September; I went down to St. Mary-at-hill to read a draft of the agreement; I saw Brown in the counting-house; there were a number of circulars on the table: Brown entered into the subject of the agreement, and I understood from him that he was a partner in the concern, and that I might read the draft to him, which I did; some pencil alterations were made at the suggestion of Brown and Earle; some were made before Earle came in.</p>

This agreement was executed at Mr. Minithorpe's office, on the 15th of September, and I there paid over into Earle's hands, a 50l. bill, dated on that day - there was nothing in the warehouse at St. Mary-at-hill but two chairs and a small counting-house desk; there were no barrels of pickled fish; I was there day after day, and was repeatedly ordered to prepare for a journey by Brown; I never saw any barrels of fish in the warehouse; I first went there on the 30th of August, and a month or five weeks after it was closed; I saw, perhaps, 30s. or 2l. worth of pickled fish; it was brought into the warehouse one morning - that was the only fish I ever saw; there were probably 6lbs. of eels; they filled four small pots; I never saw Brown after October - the warehouse has been shut up ever since - the bill was paid when it became due, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160048"/>I have it here; the prisoner's endorsement is on the back of it - there were probably two or three-thousand printed bills on the counting-house table; here is one of them.(this bill being read, was addressed to Merchants, Innkeepers, &amp;c., recommending the pickled fish.) I never saw a greater stock of fish than I have mentioned, and part of that was thrown away - I had no notice that my bill was circulated - I never saw Brown after the warehouse was closed, which was in October, till he was apprehended; Eurle was in custody in October and discharged, as the bill being in negociation, could not be produced - I did not see him afterwards, till he was taken again - I know of no business having been transacted by the company; the bill was presented and paid when due, (bill read;) when I applied to know when I was to go my journey, Brown said the pots were not come in, and sent me to Palmer and Bernall's, to inquire after them - I went several times, and at last one hundred dozen pots came in; eight days after I signed the agreement, I said they had put me to some expence in preparing for my journey, and I must have assistance, but I did not require the 6l. per week; Brown asked what I wanted - I said 2l., and he gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you told all you recollect of the business? A. There may be other things which I do not recollect; I am not aware of any thing else - I took a reference from Earle, and he had one from me; he referred me to Wilks and Minithorpe, on behalf of himself and Brown - they were both in the counting-house together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to Mr. Minithorpe for a single tittle of the character of Brown? A. I consider I requested the reference from them both; I went to Mr. Minithorpe with a note, which they wrote - the reference was quite satisfactory; Mr. Minithorpe told me Earle was in possession of a salmon fishery in Ireland - he did not say he was in possession of 5000l. a year, nor tell me the value of the fishery, nor any thing of the kind; he said he had a right of a salmon fishery - he did not say the Pickled Fish Company was sure to succeed; he gave me his opinion that, according to the outline, it might be productive - he did not say he was glad I had got into the Company's service; he said Earle was a man of property, but not that whether the Company succeeded or not, I was sure of my salary from him.</p>
               <p>Q. If Mr. Minithorpe has sworn he never told you that Earle had a salmon fishery in Ireland, that is not true? A. It is assertion against assertion; his assertion to me was, that he was a proprietor, or had a right of fishery on the coast of Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not understand from Mr. Minithorpe, from beginning to end, that Earle was a highly respectable man? A. I considered so, from his representing him as having a right of fishery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever tell you he believed Earle to be a very bad character? A. He told me he required from him 2000l. as a bonus for the secret of pickling fish, and likewise a capital to carry it on - this was a week or two after signing the agreement; he may have told me then that he began to suspect all was not right - the pots were fetched off the premises; he said he had given Mr. Bernal his opinion of Earle - I tasted some salmon in the warehouse; I may have told Earle it was a successful speculation - I have no doubt if there had been any thing real in it, I could have made it a very good thing in the quarter I was going; I searched for Brown repeatedly, after the bill was due - I did not include him in the indictment with Earle; I employed an attorney - I always intended to charge him with this offence; I was not told to do so in this Court - I have no recollection of it, and think I can swear I was not; Brown was not present when I gave the bill to Earle - Mr. Minithorpe might tell me I was giving a negociable security, and the face of it showed it to be so; he did not caution me against giving a negociable security - if he has sworn he did, it is assertion against assertion.</p>

            . I live in Allen-street, Lambeth. I received this bill at the warehouse, in St. Mary's-hill -Mr. Forty, the clerk to Earle and Brown, gave it to me, to inquire into the respectability of the party; I think Brown was on the premises at the time, but do not think he was present - I made inquiry, and found it was a very good one; I then appointed with Brown to meet me to endorse it, and he endorsed it at the Ship public-house, Charing-cross; I got it discounted in Vinegar-yard, Drury-lane, the same day - it was paid over to me for building an oven for the cure of pickled fish; my demand was 52l. 13s. - Earle gave me the order to build the oven- 2l. 13s. 6d. was left unpaid when Brown endorsed the bill; I was to give him 20l. out, if he gave me security which I should approve of for the 20l. and my balance - as I did not approve of the security he tendered, I kept the 20l. towards my account; the oven was to be 45l., but extra work came to 7l. 13s.; all Brown ordered was an extra boiler - I have not received the 2l. 13s.; I called at the warehouse twice afterwards, and saw three or four dozen pots - I saw Earle there, and saw Brown repeatedly, because he used to come after me, for this 20l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are the only person receiving benefit from the bill? A. I received it in a payment; Mr. Moses, of Vinegar-yard, discounted it for me - I have done work for him - when I get a hill I am obliged to discount it where I can; Moses gave me 48l. for it, which was 2l. for three months' interest, and I was glad to get it at that rate - Brown was repeatedly backwards and forwards; I was informed he was a partner; I had nothing to do with him till I had incurred a debt of 45l. with Earle; I saw him on the premises daily, but he gave me no directions; I do not think he was in the office when I received the bill from Forty - he wanted me to get the bill back again three or four days after I got it, and to arrest Earle; he said he found Earle had got no money, and if he could get him arrested he should he able to pay Mr. Noble his portion of the rent, and should be able to come in and carry on the business on his own account, and that he suspected Earle was deceiving the concern; that he had deceived him, and misrepresented the whole thing - that he was desirous to pay me - he never said he believed Earle to be a scoundrel and a swindler - what he said about Earle was when he applied to me for the 20l.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The person who represented to you that he had 15,000l. worth of salmon fishery, was tried last Session? A. I never stated that he said so - I did not tell Price it would be a thriving concern; I did not express an opinion about it - I told him Earle told me he was proprietor of a salmon fishery, not that he was so; I never expressed an opinion whether it would be a successful company or not - I was not paid for drawing the agreement; I saw the inutility of applying to any body for it - I do not know where Brown or Earle lived; Earle lived in Chapel-street during part of the transaction - I had done business for him about a month before this transaction; that was all I knew of him.</p>

             - he referred me to Mr. Pilling, of Red Lion-square; I was waited upon next day by Brown and Earle, and let them the premises, as yearly tenants, subject to six months' notice - they entered without making a deposit; the premises were open till I distrained some goods of Mr. Burnell's, the morning they were brought in; Brown had promised to pay me the rent, but did not, and he recommended me to distrain - he was present when the goods were distrained; Mr. Burnell satisfied me, and I got Brown to give me possession of the premises by a written order -Brown had represented to me that they were carrying on a very extensive business, and that he had employed Price as a traveller, at 6l. a week, and in the event of the business turning out profitable, he was to have 7 1/2 percent., and that Price had lodged a bill with him as a collateral security for certain trusts - that he had paid that bill away to Mr. Walker for an oven, in consequence of Walker dunning him, to keep him quiet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are a commission-agent, I presume? A. Acting by power of attorney; Mr. Burnell paid me the rent, and took the goods - Brown did not recommend me to distrain till after I could not get the rent- he had promised to pay me on the 29th; he then said there was a difference between him and his partner, and he feared I should not get it without distraining - I never saw him afterwards; the goods were going - a person on the premises told me of it, and I distrained; Brown told me long before the 29th, that he found Earle had deceived him - it was half a quarter's rent, and became due on the 29th; Brown told me he should not sign the articles of partnership till he was satisfied respecting Earle, and he thought he was a very bad character; he said,"I will pay your rent at any rate" - he afterwards came, and said he feared I must take my course; he said the proposals of Earle, and what had taken place latterly, was certainly very different to what he understood.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q, Are you married? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you offer? A. They were to have 20l. in goods, and 30l. in cash - I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160050"/>have expected 2 1/2 per cent. commission; I asked for 5 per cent., nothing more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I declare most solemnly I was introduced to Earle in a speculation for a monument to his present Majesty - he was introduced to me as a man of property; he afterwards proposed to me to manage some premises, in Gray's Inn-lane, which Mr. Minithorpe has mentioned - that not going forward he said, "You are an active man, I should like to have you a partner in the fish concern;" that he had a fishery in Ireland, which cost him 15,000l. - I embarked in it with him, and from that the whole of this calumniation has come on me; I was innocently brought into it - I did not do a single act with a dishonourable motive, and if the prosecutors speak like men, they will say my conduct throughout was honest and upright - having been deceived by a scoundrel, I am attainted as a felon, without having committed (with humble submission) an act of felony: it is scarcely necessary to call witnesses to rebut the evidence, as most of the conversation between Price and me was before my own family, who might he supposed to be partial - the fish company was exploded in consequence of my finding out Earle - he took 150l. out of my pocket to pay for the fittings up; the instant I found my name was not in the agreement I said it was most ungentlemanly, for if I was a partner why was not my name in it - I never made any fraudulent representation to the prosecutor, nor any other person - my conduct was perfectly honourable.</p>

No, I have as far as the questions were asked me - I went at eight o'clock that morning, according to appointment, to Mr. Hall's; Hall and Cooper were there - I was searched, and they found nothing on me; they gave me five good sixpences, and directed me to go to the prisoner's residence, where I had appointed to meet him - he was in bed: I knocked at the window, and he let me in; I stopped till he dressed - we went on to the Black Dog, and he told me to go in and wait till he came to me; he came and brought the ten bad shillings; he had before asked me what I wanted, and I said half a score, as usual - I should have told this had I been asked; he had appointed me to go to his house, and if he was in bed his hat was to be in the chair; I could look over the curtain into his room - I had made that appointment at the Feathers, in Castle-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160053"/>street; I was in the Police, but was discharged about three months ago - this is the first transaction of the kind I have been engaged in, but I had made purchases of the prisoner three times before; I was introduced to him by a person whom I only know by the name of Jack - I was turned out of the Police because my serjeant did not please me, and I used language to him, which I ought not to have done; I have since been employed by different persons, and was at work at a wine-vaults till half-past eight o'clock last night - I was sixteen months in the Police, and before that I drove an omnibus from Turnham-green.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer of Hatton-garden. In consequence of information I received, I applied to Daniel to assist me in taking the prisoner; the first transaction was on the 10th of January; when I receive information I inform the Mint - on the 18th Daniel came to my house at eight o'clock in the morning; I satisfied myself he had no money - I then gave him five marked sixpences, and 6d. in copper - he walked before us to Church-street, he went into Turville-street, and up a court; I then saw him and the prisoner coming back - they went as far as the Black Dog; Daniel went in there, and the prisoner went on - I went into a shop opposite, and in ten minutes I saw the prisoner come back, go into the Black Dog, and almost immediately come out with Daniel - I saw him give something to Daniel; I then crossed, and took the prisoner - Cooper was in another house; I saw the prisoner put his hand to his mouth - I pushed him into the house, and asked what he had in his mounth; I put my hand to the back of his head, and said I would have it out- he put up his hand, and I put up mine; the five sixpences which I had marked and given to Daniel, came out of his mouth: Cooper took this paper parcel from Daniel's hand - it contains ten bad shillings; we then all went to the office - the prisoner said, "I suppose this is a plant upon me, and I must make up my mind to be lagged, but I ought to have been down to that cove."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it by accident you went to the Black Dog? A. No, Daniel told me he was to go there: I saw a parcel given to Daniel; I should think I was about ten yards off; it was given quite openly; the prisoner took the money in his hand, and looked at it; then gave the parcel to Daniel; I was in a sale shop opposite; I had not introduced him to the prisoner, but I caused him to be introduced by a person I have known a long time, who is a very respectable man, and works for some of the first houses in the City of London.</p>

I went to Hall's house on the morning in question; I saw Daniel come there; he was searched, and Hall gave him five good sixpences (which he had marked in my presence,) and 6d. worth of copper; we then went to Turville-street; Daniel went before us, and turned into a court; Hall and I went to a public-house and waited; we saw Daniel and the prisoner go by - Hall and I then went and stationed ourselves in two houses, nearly opposite the Black Dog -I saw Daniel go into the Black Dog and sit in the window; soon afterwards the prisoner went in; they then both came out together; I saw something change hands from the prisoner to Daniel, and from Daniel to the prisoner; Daniel then gave a signal agreed on - Hall and I went over and took them; Hall took the prisoner, and asked what he had in his mounth, and he dropped out the five sixpences - I then took these ten shillings from Daniel's hand; the prisoner said he ought to have been down to that cove.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate girl. I was walking with Smith, between eleven and twelve o'clock- Bruce came up to me, and said she had been almost taken up for stealing a watch, chain and seals; we did not ask what man, nor did she tell us; there was no one with her then - she asked us to have some gin, and we did.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the night of the robbery I received this information; by the description I knew the prisoners, and went to where they lived, about two o'clock in the morning; I knocked, and Mrs. Miller answered - I told her I must come in; she told me to wait, as she was in bed - I then heard a rush up stairs; I asked Miller if Bruce lived there - she said No, she had left, but I went up stairs and found the prisoners in had together, with their clothes on.</p>
               <p>Bruce's Defence. This officer owes me a spite; I was taken up one night for a row, and he came and asked if I had any money; I gave him a sovereign, and he brought me 1s. worth of gin - he kept 10s. 6d. of it and never gave it to me.</p>

               <p>Richardson's Defence. I met this young woman, who asked me to take her home, which I did, as she had no room of her own; it was very cold, and we went to bed with our clothes on.</p>

On the 19th of January I saw the prisoner in the shop - she took some beef-steaks out of the dish; she put them into her basket - she then came out, and said, "My dear boy, pray don't go in and tell;" she then went to a doctor's, and I went and told.</p>
               <p>SCIPIO ROBINSON. I went in pursuit of the prisoner - she ran into a doctor's-shop, then out again, and into a doctor's shop, then out again, and into a public-house; I took her, and found in her basket the steaks, and two pieces of salt beef.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope you will have mercy - I was in distress.</p>

On the 23rd of January, in the afternoon, he came into the shop, and asked to look at some prints in the window, which he did - he then looked at some quills; he said they were very good, and their governor used a great many, but they did not want any then - he then asked to look at some account-books; he said they were very good, and if I would allow him he would choese out three to go to Mr. Baker, the lawyer, No. 7, Finsbury-circus - he asked if I could send them; I said Yes - he went out of the shop, then returned, and said he would send a light-porter for them; Webb afterwards came, and said he had called for the three books, which their young man had chosen out for Mr. Baker, the lawyer, No. 7, Finsbury-circus - I was going to pack them up, but he said I need not be particular, as Mr. Baker was waiting in the office, and the other young man would call and tell me if they would do; he then went out with them - Evans followed him, and I was sent for in about ten minutes - these are the books.</p>

               <p>COURT to ANN WREAKS. Q. When you parted with these books did you intend that the prisoner should have the property, or was it merely to take it to Mr. Baker? A. He was to take it to Mr. Baker, to see if it would suit him; it was to be a ready money transaction, and I was to allow him so much for each book - they were not sold on credit, or sold to either of the prisoners; Baker said he would give me a good order, and recommend the shop.</p>

I went with the prosecutor, on the 9th of January, to No. 2, Pheasant-court; this money was found on the prisoner, as Mr. Williams has stated; she then said she had robbed him, and was sorry for what she had done - if he would only overlook her fanlt, she would let him have 2l. 10s. the day following - I asked what she had done with the purse; she said I should have that another time; I insisted upon having it then, and she called Mary Austin, and told her to get it, which she did.</p>

On the evening of the 17th of February, about half-past nine o'clock, I had a piece of lawn in the window - I was standing in the shop, a few yards from the window - I heard a noise, and found my window was broken; I am sure it was whole just before - they were large squares of plate glass, worth two guineas each - I immediately went to the door, and saw the prisoner running away; I pursued her, and took the piece of lawn away from her - it has my private mark on it; the greater part of the square was forced in, and this might have fallen out - the window must have been broken from without; I did not miss the lawn till I took hold of her, and it fell from her.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 18th of January, about ten o'clock at night, my attention was directed to a horse and cart, which stood at the door of the Lamb public-house, Kingsland-road - several persons were round it, who I knew had nothing to do with it; I did not see the prisoner - Matthews' name was on it; nobody owned it, and I took it to Matthews' - the mare and harness were to it.</p>

On Sunday the 22nd of January, 1831, during the night, the adjoining house, which belongs to us, but is not inhabited, was broken open, and these things stolen - the prisoner and several others were taken on suspicion next day, but as no property was found he was discharged - he had been at our house that day - I saw the clock at Hatton-garden last Saturday week; nothing else has been found.</p>

On Thursday, the 9th of February, I was at the Feathers public-house, next door to master's; the prisoner followed me out of that house, and asked if I had a watch to dispose of; I said No, that I had got a new one, which there had been a conversation about in the house - I exchanged my new watch with him for a gold one; I saw him in custody about a week afterwards - I had given the watch to the officer; Sweetland claimed it - no money passed between us.</p>

I apprehended both the prisoners in the theatre; I told them I had information that they were both thieves, and had no business there; I found on Webb a purse, containing four half-crowns, six shillings, and four sixpences; I called Mr. Thurston out, and he swore to the purse - nothing was found on Shaw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Toole, I believe, gave you the information? A. He did.</p>
               <p>GEORGE THURSTON. This is my purse, and contains the same money as I lost in it; I am certain of the purse, from the particular wear of it.</p>

On the 10th of February, in consequence of some suspicion, I made arrangements to watch on the premises at night; my premises are entered at a gateway - on the left side of the ride is my house door, and on the opposite side are stables, numbered 1 to 5; they then turn a corner, and there are Nos. 6 and 7 - a large coach-house, and then No. 8, which is close to the dung-hill - the granary is over stable No. 3, on the right-hand, and the door is nearly opposite my house door; a room is built over the ride, from the side of my house, and joins stables Nos. 2 and 3 - there is a window at each end of that room, one looking towards the gate, and the other to the back part of the ride; I stationed Unwin, one of my post-boys, in that room - the prisoner Sparks was in the employ of a person who took away my dung; Garrad had also been in that person's employ - the usual time to come for the dung was six o'clock in the morning; on the morning in question, about twenty minutes to four, Unwin made a communication to me, and I went on the roof, near a sky-light, where I could see the granary - Unwin went out of the bed-room window on to No. 5 stable; he could see the back part of the yard - the first thing which attracted my notice was a small glare of light from the sky-light, which I presume was a candle being lighted by a gas-light which was near, but not in view; I then observed a man pass under the sky-light from the direction of the lamp to No. 3 stable - I did not perceive any thing in his hand: from the external appearance I believe it to be Iseaby - he had no light; the next thing attracting my attention was lights appearing through the granary - this was in a very few minutes: we have a number of pantile lights, made of iron and a pane of glass - I observed a number of these burning; they are used to light the granary - about half-past four o'clock the bell rang very loud, and was not answered; it was rang again, and then the lights were extinguished, and the person was let in -I found it was Montague; he went up the yard, towards his place of business, and I observed somebody come back again down the yard, obtain a light, and go up to the stable again, in the same direction - at three quarters past five o'clock the horse and cart were brought down the yard, and the cart placed towards No. 3 - I had seen that cart when I was first alarmed, just under the room where Unwin was watching; it was backed a little towards No. 3 - I observed a full sack cast into the cart; Sparks took it up, and placed it towards the body of the cart - I called Unwin; a person in a red night-cap immediately pitched up some dung or litter into the cart, which Sparks threw over the sack - four sacks were passed into the cart: I could not see who the person was that put them in - Sparks was in the cart; Unwin and I immediately passed through the house - I sent him for an officer; I opened the gate and let him and the officers in- they went up the ride to where the cart stood; I found Sparks on the cart, Garrad behind it, and Iseaby came out of the door of No. 3 stable, which has a loft over it - that is on the same floor as the granary; the granary is separated from the other parts of the loft by an inclosure - the stable No. 3 does not go directly into the granary; the prisoners were then taken into custody - it was Iseaby's duty to lock up the granary every night, and deposit the keys in a desk in my office, then to lock the office, and to bring to my house the key of the office; I went up into the granary, and found the door open, and the key in the lock - I know it was the regular key; there was a small quantity of oats in the granary - I am satisfied the oats had been moved from the granary to the cart; I have samples of both the bulk and that in the cart - I have no doubt of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. It was the duty of the dung contractor to come at six o'clock? A. Yes - it appears they have been in the habit of coming at all hours in the night, but not with my knowledge; I knew it by information, but did not approve of it - I had Unwin in my sight all the time he was on the roof; I told the Magistrate I believed from the outward appearance that it was Iseaby who came from the gas-light - I do not recollect telling the Magistrate I did not know who it was; he was dressed - he appeared to have drab coloured clothes on, but I do not swear that; he had no hat on, but something in the shape of a cap - he had no smock-frock; I thought it was a cloth coat, but at that distance I cannot positively swear what description of coat, but swear he had a coat; I could not tell what the materials were - I have not sworn he had no coat on; if I have said I could not tell whether he had or not, I did not mean to say so - Iseaby knew Montague perfectly well; he was coming in to go to his business - he had come in late the night before, and had orders which required him to come early that morning; if Iseaby did not know that, he ought to - I should think he must have known Montague was on the premises; I saw French up the yard; Sparks got off the cart when the bell rang, and French passed the cart - Sparks then got into it again; the granary was over No. 3, and the bean granary over No. 1 - whether Iseaby has invariably brought the granary keys to the office at night, I cannot state, but it was his bounden duty to do so; my strict orders were that it should be done - it was never omitted, to my knowledge; the key of the office was brought that night - he had the care of the office, and it was his duty to put the key of the granary there; there was no specific hour to lock the office - it might be done at six or seven o'clock; the keys were generally put there about my tea time - it was his duty to take care of both granaries alike; we call him head ostler - it is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160066"/>place of confidence; I left him in charge during my absence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the slightest reason to find fault with him? A. I had; a bridle was lost out of the stable three or four years ago, or it might be longer - I have no memorandum of it; I have frequently complained of his getting drunk within the last twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not discharge him? A. The truth is, he was my customer's servant, and not mine, for he had a good hold of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Who is the person that takes your dung? A. Mercer - I believe Garrad has been many years in his employ; Montague and French were at their regular employ while the cart was being loaded; I was certainly surprised to see this done after Montague came in - Isenby knew the dung was not to be fetched before six o'clock - I never told Garrad so.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What duty would devolve on Montague and French? A. To feed their horses, and clean their harness to go out about eight o'clock - they generally clean their horses inside the stable No. 8, which is the further stable round the corner out of the ride - they would have no view of the granary; Montague was more likely to have come at eight o'clock than at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any proper purpose for which the cart could have been opposite stable No. 3? A. It would have been their business to have been there to take the dung from the door, but not to turn the tail of the cart to the door.</p>

             I am in Mr. Gray's service, and have been so for seven years. On the 10th of February, by his desire, I sat up to watch in the room over the gateway - about twenty minutes past four o'clock my attention was attracted by the dung-cart stopping at the gate, and in a moment I heard a very gentle ring indeed at the gate; I was so much awake that I heard the cart stop before the bell rang - I saw Iseaby go and open the gate; the cart came in - Sparks and Garrad were in it; Iseaby had the charge of the gate that night - the cart was backed up the yard, towards the counting-house, and round the corner, by No. 6, towards the dung-hill; I went and met master coming down stairs - I went through the house, and got on the roof to a side window, which commanded a view of the dung-heap; I saw Sparks and Garrad place a ladder, which we use to light the gas with; they placed it against the loft over No. 6 - master at that time was standing near a sky-light, against No. 3 loft; (I could see him, but it was rather dark) - I saw Sparks and Garrad ascend the ladder into the loft, with a candle, and the moment they entered, Mr. Gray called to me that there was a light in the loft; I said, "I know it, Sir - hold your tongue;" the ladder was then removed, and in a moment after I saw Garrad walking up the yard, towards the dung-hill; he had come down the ladder, and taken it away - he was on the ground, against No. 6; I had not seen how he came down - I then saw Garrad back the cart up to the dung-hill, and could see him throwing dung up into the cart; about half-past four o'clock the bell rang twice, the second time was rather violent - I could not see who answered it, nor see the gate, where I was; Montague came in, and went up to the top stable, No. 8 - the cart being in the way I could not see him go into the stable, but that was his place; after that I saw Garrad bring the cart down from No. 6 to opposite No. 3, before the loft window - master then called me to him; I saw sacks put into the cart - I could not see by whom; I was then sent for an officer - I went through the house, and fetched one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Is Garrad a married man? A. I have heard so; Montague must have gone by the cart to get to his stable - Garrad was Spark's assistant.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Gray's service. I came on Saturday morning as the watchman was calling half-past four o'clock; Iseaby opened the gate - I asked him for a light; he said the dung-men had got it, up the yard - I went to the dung-men, and they had no light; the gas gave a very fair light on the dung-hill, sufficient to take the dung away - I went into No. 8 stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Iseaby had no notice at what time you would come? A. Not at all; I rang twice; he slept in No. 2; the bell does not go into that stable, but hangs a very little way off; the dung men had no light at the heap; whether they had it else - where I do not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Have you been there so early on other mornings? A. I do not recollect that I have; they did not seem surprised at my coming.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were unusually early? A. Yes, my time of coming was very uncertain; six men took it by turns to sit up; when any of us are out, they have to answer the bell; when I am ordered out early in the morning I am obliged to get there early; the man who sits up usually gives me a candle to get a light from the lantern, which hangs in No. 2; when the dung-men said they had no light I went back to get one; the bell did not ring so loud as usual the first time, though I pulled it as usual - I have found the dung-men there early before - I do not recollect having been sent to them before for a light.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Gray's service. I came at a quarter to five o'clock; Sparks opened the gate to me; it was Iseaby's duty to open it - I went to No. 8, where my business was; I asked for a light; Garrad said"There is one up there;" he stood by the side of the cart which was opposite the granary - I saw nobody else by the cart - I did not see anybody else by the cart - I saw no light till I got to No. 8, and Montague had one there; I afterwards went to unload the dung-cart; there were four sacks of corn and two bushels of chaff; two in the front of the cart, with two nose-bags, and two behind, with the chaff and straw over them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When Sparks opened the gate, you asked for a light? A. No, I went up the yard and asked him for a light - Garrad said there was one up the yard - I did not go into No. 2<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160067"/>stable; there was a light there; Iseaby slept there, and should keep a light; I might have gone there if I chose; I saw Iseaby up the yard about half-past-five o'clock - he was dressed - he usually got up at six o'clock - he came round the corner, as if from No. 2, or he might come from No. 3.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. How far was the cart from the dung-hill? A. Twenty or thirty yards; the dung-hill is round the corner; Garrad did not attempt to conceal himself from me.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you ask what the light was in No. 2? A. No, I saw it through the window; there is usually a lamp there.</p>
               <p>MR. GRAY. The corn was put into the cart at three-quarters past four o'clock; Iseaby was the only person who ought to have been on the premises at that time - I did not expect the glass-coachmen so early, but they afterwards satisfied me it was necessary for them to be there so early, or they could not have got ready, having to clean their coaches; Iseaby had the entire charge of the premises that night.</p>
               <p>Iseaby's Defence. I let Montague in, and when the bell rang I came as far as the door of No. 2, and saw Sparks; he let French in - I then retired to my bed, and went to sleep, till I heard master sing out "Wells" - I then rose, and ran into No. 3. thinking the noise came from there - I then proceeded round the corner; Dowdney came in; it was customary for the men to feed their horses as they pleased; Mr. Gray took no account of the corn, and sometimes the horses would have none if I locked the granary, when I was gone home, if the men come early, as six, o'clock, was my time; the corn was often taken down above an hour after I got home.</p>

On the 8th of November I wrote a letter to Mr. Eddrup, near Euston-square - the purport of it was to borrow 35l. of him; I gave the note to the prisoner, and told him to take it the next morning, and deliver it to Mr. Eddrup, to whom it was directed on the outside - it was wafered; he was to bring back what answer he received - I said,"Be back as near twelve o'clock as you can, and we will dine together;" he did not return - I went to his lodging on the night of the 10th of November; I did not find him there, and did not find him again till the 31st of January - I received this letter from him, which I know is his writing - I had read the note to him, and told him to bring the answer directly back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been an attorney? A. I was admitted last Michaelmas term - I did not instruct my counsel to open that the prisoner was an attorney; I employed the prisoner in a confidential way, to call on my friends, and to see if he could make any arrangements, as I had lost a great deal of money in a Chancery suit - we dined together almost daily at my house; I should think he has pawned goods for me to the amount of 70l. or 80l., but I think nothing later than October - none since I became an attorney; he removed some furniture for me - I cannot tell to what amount; it might be about 50l. - I did not desire him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160069"/>remove it; I desired him to pawn, because I wanted money - he pawned four watches; I had five, one was my wife's - he pawned some gold chains and gold keys; he desired to remove my furniture, and I consented to it - he said I was not in the house, and he did it for security; he took just what pleased himself, and left the remainder - I did not owe any thing to my landlord; I owed several accommodation-bill debts - I know he removed a four-post bedstead and some furniture, which he said he was afraid thieves would take; he did not leave me a bed to lay on in that house - I was not obliged to ask him for a bed for me and my wife; I ordered him to bring them - this note is my writing, (read.)</p>
               <p>DEAR LEWIS, - I have been much inconvenienced, as well as Mrs. Myles, by your not letting me have the bed and things, as you promised - the fact is we must sit up all this night, as we have no bed to lay on; the moment you receive this come with as many of the things I want, as you can bring in a coach, if you can get no better conveyance; but above all the two small mattresses, the bed, pillows, and bedding - I also want the portmanteau and boxes, as I have no change of linen.</p>
               <p>Witness. The linen I alluded to was to be washed - he did not take all my linen, but it was locked up in his house; I sent it to his house, because I thought fit - I am not bound to tell the Jury or you my motives.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Cannot you give a reason for this, which appears very extraordinary conduct? A. The fact is I locked up my linen, packed up my dirty linen, and took none with me; he at first stated he removed the furniture on account of thieves, and then he stated that the water came in - I sent for the bed and the mattresses to come to Waterloo-road, where I had taken apartments; I was within a short time of completing my articles, and there was an accommodation-bill, on which judgment had gone by default, and execution had issued - I would not have let them get into my house for that, if I could have helped it by keeping my door shut; I was not aware, when I removed, that the execution was out against me, but I removed as a matter of precaution - I had no other house at that time; I had chambers in Great St. Helen's - I do not know that I was afraid of any property being taken from there; I gave orders for my furniture to be removed, that it might be altogether at Battle-bridge, where he had a house - I took a room of him at 3s. a week as a warehouse.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many watches did he pawn for you? A. I cannot tell - he did not pawn at his own discretion; I had four gold watches and one gilt - I had had one of them about four years; I gave forty-two guineas for it - another I gave 30l. for; another I took for a debt of 17l. odd, the fourth cost eighteen guineas, and the other was a gilt watch which I gave about 9l. for - they were all regularly paid for; I have three of them now - the other two are sold; I pawned one of them myself; he had no commission for pledging - I gave him a dinner every day, and bed and bedding; I did not tell him my reason for removing my property was that I wanted to have it down to Chelmsford - this note is my writing: Chelmsford.</p>

            . I keep the house. The prisoner and the prosecutor came there about nine o'clock at night - he was very much intoxicated; they went up stairs, and were there a little while - she then came down, went over to the White Hart, and fetched a young woman to see if he had lost his watch - she then brought this watch down and told me if he asked for it, I was to give it him, and if he asked who came in with him, to say nothing, as she would not stop with him, because he had no money to pay her - he put a handkerchief round her neck when he first came in; the door was left open - two or three women lodge in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He was in liquor - I took him into the landlady's room; he tied the handkerchief round my neck - we then went up stairs; he had no money, and as there was no lock to the door, I took his watch to give to Mrs. Cummins.</p>

I took a letter from my master, on the 13th of January, to Mr. Jones' factory; I delivered it to Mr. Henshaw, and waited outside the counting-house for an answer - I saw a coachman speaking to Mr. Henshaw, and a man came in behind the coachman - he took a coat off a nail against the wall, and went out - I told Mr. Henshaw, who went out with me; we found the prisoner with the coat in a green bag - he was taken back, and I went for an officer.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. On the morning of the 27th of August I was at Brentford - I met the prisoner and two other men; I stopped them - the prisoner and I got into a scuffle, and he slipped his jacket off, which I have here - he appeared thickly clothed, and I found in his jacket a dead goose, a crow-bar, a turn-screw, a tinder-box, flint, and steel - I found another goose ten or twelve yards from where I stopped them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How can you swear it was me? A. I am positive you are the man; the other two ran away, and since that you have made a confession.</p>

In August last I had two geese in my father's yard - I lost them, one Saturday night: I attended before the Magistrate, and saw them dead - they were tame geese, and were the same as I had lost; I knew them by their having four holes in each of their feet, which I had made - they had been in a shed, which had no door to it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner here requested leave to try the jacket on, which he did; it appeared rather tight.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANNAH. He had not so many clothes under his jacket then as he has now - I am positive he is the man I caught hold of, and this is the jacket.</p>

Yes; he said he was out of employ; master would not prosecute, but he could not help it; Dunt formerly lodged there; some of the sheets were nearly new; I know Dunt was in great distress.</p>

Tingey was taken into custody that night, and Walton a few days after; I saw them in custody at the Angel, and was positive of them - some shoes were produced at the examination, which Manning claimed - I gave the officer information of what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What time of night was it? A.

On Thursday, the 15th of December, I sent him to Mrs. Constable's with some table-cloths, and as soon as he returned I asked him if they would suit - he said the lady could not give a deoided answer till the following morning; he afterwards told me the cloths were returned, that the lady objected to the price, and would not keep them; the cloths produced are the two which I sent him with to Mrs. Constable's - they came to 27s.; he should have accounted to Mr. Challacomb if he was paid for them.</p>

            . I am a constable of Chelsea. The stones that fall from the barges are taken up by the men -I am employed to prevent it. On Friday evening, the 10th of February, I saw Taylor draw a load of stones from the wharf, and next morning I traced the wheel of a cart out of Jubilee-place, where it should be shot down, to Godfrey-street, and some stones remained there, which I would swear were the same as were being unloaded - the cart had no business in Godfrey-street - I traced the wheel out of Godfrey-street into the road again to the stable - I compared the stones in Godfrey-street with those in Alexander-square; they are peculiar from all other stones; I went to Oakham's lodgings, and told him I wanted him for stealing stones, which belonged to the trust; he said he had picked up two loads of shoreings, and sold them to Harrison, and shot two loads in Godfrey-street - I took him to Newman; he then said,"I hope you will look over it this time" - I took Taylor, and told him it was for the two loads of stone in Godfrey-street; he said, "D-n it, I meant to have taken them up again;" I said he had no business to shoot them there - he said he wanted to go home for his corn.</p>

On the 11th of February, about ten o'clock, Blackford came and bought a rasher of bacon, which came to 4d. - I was close by the parlour door; he put a shilling on the counter - the prisoner gave him two penny-pieces, and at the same time put his hand in the till, took out some silver, and put into Blackford's hand - Blackford went off with it, without stopping to see if it was right; my son stopped him, and we found two shillings, two sixpences, and two pence in his hand; I took it from him, and both were taken into custody - I am sure I saw the prisoner deliver that money into his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. Where were you standing? A. Inside the parlour door; there is a glass partition - there are six or seven gas-lights in the shop; Blackford had lived with a cheesemonger in the neighbourhood - he only put a shilling on the counter, and the prisoner rang it; I was watching, having had information that Blackford had received money twice before - he and the prisoner both live near Spitalfields.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I saw Blackford come in the afternoon, and buy a piece of cheese, which came to 1s. 6d. - he put down half a crown; I thought the change given was wrong, as I heard silver sound in his hand - he came again about ten o'clock, and bought some bacon; I watched, and he had the right change that time - he came again in a quarter of an hour; I was then in the parlour, and told my father my suspicion - he had a rasher of bacon; I saw him put down a shilling - the prisoner put down some copper: his hand was then in the till for some time - I saw him take something out, and put into Blackford's hand; I went out, caught hold of Blackford's hand, and my father opened it; there were two shillings, two sixpences, and two pence - he said he had given the prisoner half a crown; but at the watch-house he said he had two shillings in his hand when he came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him come in the third time? A. No; I am sure it was a shilling he gave the prisoner, and he could not have other money in his hand, for I saw it open - I am certain the money came out of my father's till.</p>

No, the first time was on Christmas-eve - I do not know that he was there after that - he never slept with me - I never knew him to sleep in the house - I did not know that he was in the robbery till I found some of my things; Mr. Duncot used to come backwards and forwards, from knowing Mr. Gill; Duncot was there for a week once, but I did not know him at the time these things were taken; he slept in the same room that I did - I have seen the prisoner since the robbery; he lived at a public-house near where I lived - it is hard for me to tell how often I have been in that public-house with him - Duncot has absconded; I did not know that Gill was in the robbery till Duncot told me so; he never was in my place till Christmas-eve.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear he never, to your knowledge, slept in your house? A. I never saw him about; he might come to Duncot one night, but I knew nothing about it; he never slept with Duncot to my knowledge; I slept in my own bed - I do not know that Gill and Duncot slept in the same bed.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did Gill pass the night in the same room with you and Duncot? A. No; I do not recollect Gill being there on any night.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Upon your oath, did not Gill sleep one night in the same bed with you and Duncot? A I never slept with Gill; I do not recollect his sleeping in the same bed with me and Duncot - I have three beds, one on the other; I have slept on them for nine years - Duncot and I lived together, as man and wife, while he was there; I do not recollect whether I was in the same bed with Gill and Duncot - it is a good bit ago; to my knowledge I never was.</p>

            . On the 26th of December, the prisoner, Duncot, and three other young men brought a tea-board, a poker, a shovel, and a pair of tongs to my house between eight and nine o'clock in the evening - I could identify the other three, but I do not know their names - Duncot told me that he and his wife were in great distress, and asked if I would buy two or three things of him; he asked 3s. for them, which I gave him; the prisoner did not speak at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Duncot in gone off? A. Yes, Sir; I did not know that he was living with the prosecutrix; I know Gill by his working nearly opposite where I did; he bore an honest character - I suppose they came to me to buy them, because I was lately married.</p>

             fastened my barn on the night of the 6th of February, and next morning he told me it was broken open - I examined, and found part of the roof had been untiled, sufficient for two to have got in; I missed some wheat from the bulk - I thought about two quarters; I found a hat in the barn, which I believe is here - I gave notice to Camp, the officer, and went with him to Taylor's, at a place called Journeyman's-green, on the following day - I think Wheeler went with me; Catling lives next door to Taylor - I found at Taylor's a bed-tick filled with wheat in the chaff, and the bed clothes on it - the bed appeared made; I think there were about six bushels in the tick, and I found about five pecks in a sack in the house -I have compared the wheat I found there with that in my barn, and I believe it to be part of the same wheat; I found at Catling's about five pecks of wheat, from which the chaff had been blown, and some chaff was buried by the side of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Do you pretend to distinguish your wheat from other wheat? A. As far as possible, I think I can - there is much difference in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160090"/>quality, weight, and colour of it; it was in the chaff, in which state it is not sold - it was very good, and cleaner than it is in general; that I found at Catling's was not in the chaff, but it was not then in a marketable state - it was in such a state as a poor person might have it for his own use; Catling was in my service about three years ago - I do not know that we had any difference; I do not recollect having a fowl injured or killed, or talking of instituting a prosecution against any body, and applying to Catling to give evidence - he made a false charge against me, but I am ready to meet it in any way.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not said before that you could not say that it was the same wheat? A. No, Sir, I never said so to any one - I said I could not positively swear to it, but I believe it was the wheat.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Mr. Boards to Taylor and Catling's - I have been a farmer, and in my judgment the wheat found corresponds with the bulk - I know that Lambert got the shoes from Berry; when I took the Berrys, they said they were at home by nine o'clock, and then they said it was nothing to me - there is a communication from Catling's house to Taylor's, by a trap-door; here is the hat which was found in the barn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are they not both under the same roof? A. Yes, it is not common for houses of that description to have a communication - I never saw it before; the partition-wall is usually carried up to the top; the door is in the partition and pulls up - it is in the up stairs room; you go under the roof which hangs over, in a sloping way - the wheat found at Catling's, has some chaff in it now - Catling and Taylor were not at home when I went; Catling gave himself up the next morning.</p>

            . I am Catling's sister. His wife, my brother, and I, gleaned some wheat, and Catling had it about a week before from my house in Silver-street.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you glean it? A. In August last, about Edmonton - we gleaned sometimes in three or four fields in a day; this was mixed wheat - we gleaned some of Mr. Boards' and some of Mr. Knight's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you permit the small wheat to remain with it? A. We cleaned it ourselves in a little sieve on a sheet - I put the chaff on a little piece of ground before my garden; I know my sister had two chaff pillows given to her.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. BOARDS. Q. Did the chaff you found buried appear to be fresh buried? A. It was not matted as chaff usually is, which has been in a pillow or a bed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LEE. Q. Are the children here who delivered these articles to you? A. No; I was discharged from Mr. Maltwood's house, but I work at home; I never knew of journeymen taking materials to make a trunk, if I have asked for any thing it was given to me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You found that he is a sweep? A. Yes, and I believe he keeps a donkey or two - he said he bought the cart of two men on Saturday morning; I am sure he did not say Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say who they were? A. No; he said he knew two men, and he was on bail a week to find them.</p>

On Saturday, the 4th, I found this cart in my yard, which I had never seen before- I inquired about, but could not hear any thing of it - the prisoner afterwards came to me about it, and asked if I was not surprised at seeing that strange cart there; I said Yes - he said, "It belongs to me - I bought it this morning for 13s.;" I knew him, and was then satisfied.</p>

I was in Belton-street, and heard Blyth abusing the prosecutor, and using very bad language - I was going up to remove them for being disorderly, and when I got near, the prosecutor called Police - I went up, and seized Barry; she threw from her hand a purse, enclosed in this handkerchief, which she afterwards denied being hers - I said, "This is the woman that had the purse," and the prosecutor, whom I did not consider at all tipsy said, "This one (meaning Blyth) took it from me" - I took both the prisoners to the station, and found on them 4s. 6d. in silver, and 3d. in copper.</p>
               <p>Blyth. I threw it down myself. Witness. No, Barry threw it down - Blyth was tipsy, and said she took it; she used the grossest language that ever I heard come from a woman - the prisoners are old acquaintances, and lived in the same street, in St. Giles'.</p>
               <p>Blyth. He gave me the money to go home with him, and then he called the Policeman - Barry came up by accident, hearing the piece of work, and asked what was the matter - he said he was robbed, and I threw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160093"/>money down - I never saw Barry before that night - the prosecutor was very much in liquor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I told him I had them of a Mr. King - he locked me in the station, and was not gone more than three quarters of an hour, and then he said he could not find him. Witness. I went to a Mr. King - he looked at the boards, and said they were not his; on the Friday I found Mr. Kewer, and he owned them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. How can you swear to plain deal boards? A. They have been planed for a length of time, turned upside down, and used for scaffolding - I lost twelve of them from the same stack, and five on the Wednesday evening; they are the same length as mine, and have some cement on them - I have not a doubt of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them of a young man named King for 8s. - I went up the Back-road, Islington, and we had some gin; I parted with him, and then, in mistake, I went straight on, instead of turning - when I got to St. John-square the officer stopped me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. Where had you dined? A. With a friend, near Clerkenwell - I recollect seeing a band of musicians in Red Lion-passage; I stood listening to them - I am fond of music, and very likely asked them to play particular tunes; I did not ask them to follow me into Holborn - I did not dance to the tunes; I will not swear I did not beat time with my foot - I am generally merry; I did not caper nor dance - I saw the prisoner there, and she remained in our company all the way to Drury-lane; there were two other women with the music, who, I believe, were in our company before I saw the prisoner - we met them in Red Lion-passage; we all five went into a public-house in Drury-lane - I do not know what I drank there; I do not think the prisoner was affected with liquor - certainly not so as not to know what she said or did - I told the officer there were six or seven sovereigns in my purse; I made a mistake, there were but four - I recollected having paid away two and changed one.</p>

Mr. Arundel and I dined together, between two and three o'clock, and left the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160097"/>house about six or seven; we went to Clerkenwell after dinner - we had dined at the York Arms, Shirelane, which I kept two years ago; it is not frequented by bad women, particularly - Mr. Arundel then went to call on a friend of his in Clerkenwell; I waited while he went in - we returned through Red Lion-square, met two or three women there round the music, and took two or three of them into Holborn, to a house kept by Mr. Thomas, stopped there about a quarter of an hour and drank- it is a wine-vaults; we then went to a wine-vaults in Drury-lane with the three women; the prisoner was one of them - they had followed us; Mr. Arundel missed his purse - I held the prisoner's hands, and he went for an officer; the prisoner then told me if I would let her go she would give me the purse, and gave it me from her bosom- it contained four sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You dined at the York Arms? A. Yes - we had wine for dinner; we got to Red Lion-square between eight and nine o'clock - we had stopped at a public-house on the way; I recollect the music in Red Lion-passage - I did not dance, nor did he; Mr. Arundel might move round with a lady - there were several women about, and two ladies were talking to us; the prisoner was there - we all five went into Holborn; I had some sherry and bitters - we treated the girls with what they chose; the prisoner was not intoxicated - I do not think I drank there; I swear the prisoner was not intoxicated; I was perfectly sober - how the purse got into her bosom - I cannot tell.</p>
