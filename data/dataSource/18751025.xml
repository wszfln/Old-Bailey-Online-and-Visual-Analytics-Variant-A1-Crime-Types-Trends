(<hi rend="italic">This letter was without date or address, it contained expressions of regret for the wrong he had done, the prosecutor, and expressed a hope that he might be allowed to return to London, when he would take measures to pay back the money by cash and bit s, and asked the prosecutor to insert an advertisement in the</hi> Times <hi rend="italic">in reply</hi>). In consequence of receiving that letter I, by my solicitors advice, put this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, on 8th April, "To E.

I am barmaid at the Cafe Regence, Tichborne Street—on 11th October, about 11 o'clock, the prisoner came in for a glass of stout and handed me a florin, I tested it and found it was found; I bent it and showed it to the manager, who told me to keep it—I said nothing to the prisoner; he went away—I had seen him there on the 10th at 10 o'clock, with another person, one of them asked for some stout and a florin was tendered to me; they had got to the door when I found that it was bad.</p>

               <p>Bishop's Road which is a receiving office—in consequence of some complaints to me I made up a test letter on 5th October; I enclosed 180 penny postage stamps in a blue envelope which I securely fastened and sealed and addressed it to Miss A. Walwyn, 3, Wood's Cottages, Buckland Road, Dover—I had marked each stamp with invisible ink—I posted the letter at Bishop's Róad office at about 5.15—the box closes at 5.30 and the prisoner would then make up the collection' for the letter-carrier, who would take it to the Spring Street office, reaching there shortly before 6 o'clock—a communication was made to me and I went to the Bishop's Road office again shortly after 6 o'clock—I saw Mr. Hutchins outside—I did not go in then, but I went past the office several times between then and 7.50—I also sent several persons into the office to purchase stamps and I went in myself, but the prisoner did not know what I went in for—Miss Crossley was there and the prisoner—Miss Crossley left at 7.50, leaving the prisoner in charge—the box closed again at 8 o'clock, and the carrier called for the letters at 8.15—it was the prisoner's duty and no one else's to take out the 8 o'clock collection—I went to and fro several times, I intended going in at 8.10, but saw the prisoner engaged very busily at the post-office counter—I went on and returned again and about five minutes afterwards I went into the office with a policeman—the prisoner was then at the extreme end of the batter's counter putting on his hat and coat to go home—I said "I belong to the Post Office, where is the 8 o'clock collection?"—he said "There it is"—I went inside; the bag was tied and sealed, I cut it open and found that the letter was not there—I tied it up again and said "Did you make up the 5.30 collections"—he said "Yes"—I said "I posted a letter here by that collection addressed to Miss A. Walwyn, search has been made for it and it was not there, do you know anything about it?"—he said "No"—I said "Did you make up the 8 o'clock collection?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Did you" dispatch the whole of the letters to Spring Street office?"—he said "Yes"—I stooped down and pulled out the drawers of the box—which the letters fall into, one under the other, so that there is no possibility of their going on to the floor; I looked down and saw an unobliterated postage stamp which had been torn from an envelope; I looked at it and found that it was the marked stamp which I had put on the envelope addressed to Miss Walwyn—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw these pieces of paper on the floor, the half-sheet had been torn into sixty two pieces—I said "Why, here is the stamp and a portion of the enve<lb/>lope I have been speaking to you about"—he said "I know nothing about them"—I said "Where are the keys of the till?"—he said "There they are"—I said "No"—he said "They were there before you opened the bag"—I said "I am certain they were not"—Miss Crossley then came in and said that she had left them on the counter—the constable spoke to him and they walked to the other end of the shop, and Butler returned with the keys with which I opened the post-office till and found there one piece of twenty-four penny stamps, ten pieces of twelve, ten of nine, and others, amounting altogether to 241 stamps, 108 of which I identified by my test as coming out of Miss Walwyn's letter—I told the prisoner that and he said "I know nothing about them"—I gave him in custody—next day at Bow Street Mr. Angle handed me these seventy-four stamps—I have applied my test to them and seventy-one of them came out of Miss Wahwyn's letter—only one is missing.</p>

Angle borrowing money out of my till—I do not remember saying to you one morning when you came "Mr. F. Angle has borrowed a half-crown out of your till; he will pay you to-night"—I do not recollect his paying me a half-crown one Friday night—I cannot recollect being thirty-seven short—I was short occasionally, and I always made it up, not out of my own pocket but by buying stamps of the public, there is a commission of so much in the pound—I do not remember saying to you "If it is done again I shall acquaint his father, I am not going to have money taken out of my till, if you do out of yours"—I had generally gone before the 8 o'clock letters were tied up.</p>

I live at No. 1, Laurel Villas, Edmonton, I am 15 years of age—on the night of 19th September, I and my sister Jessie were at home alone; my father and the rest of the family were out of town there was nobody in the house, but ourselves—I went to bed that night at 7 o'clock, as soon as it was dark; that was my practice; I slept in the back bedroom, second floor; my sister slept in the same room—before going to bed I made the house secure; it was dark at that time—I locked the area door which leads into the breakfast room, and the breakfast room door was fastened, but not locked; I got into bed quickly—my sister was after me—about ten minutes after I had been in bed she called my attention to some<lb/>thing, upon which I got out of bed and went to the window—I could see into the garden at the back of the house from the window; the garden is twice as long as this Court—I saw two men looking over the garden wall—I saw them leave the wall and go round to the front of the house; it is a semi-detached house—a minute or so after I heard a noise, as if the area door was being broken open—I then heard the breakfast room door open—I heard somebody coming up the stairs—I looked out at the door and saw a man coming up the stairs—I shut the door, opened the window, and called out for help and I threw a brush at the door of the next house No. 2, where Mr. Hurd lives—I heard somebody try to open the staircase window, and I heard a pane of glass broken, and somebody running down the stairs—I then unlocked my door and went down and opened the front door—there was a crowd round the gate, and Mr. Hurd came up; I saw nothing more of the man—afterwards when the detective came I examined the area door, it had been forced open, and I saw marks of a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on it, and the lock was gone—a bag of school books and a coat which had been in the break<lb/>fast room the night before had been removed to the staircase window, a work-box had been forced open, and a needle-case, and purse taken, which were left in the hall, a writing-desk had been tried to be forced, and that was on the cheffonier in the breakfast room, and the cheffonier drawers were all open.</p>

Whitwell and a friend came up—the other man, hearing a cry of "Police!" left me and turned round to attack my friend on the other side of the prisoner, and he then ran off into the fields—we kept the prisoner and handed him over to the policeman—I got a deep gash in my arm; I have no use in my hand at present—I am afraid it will be Christmas before I can use it again.</p>

I cannot say that it was myself that did it, and therefore I shall have to say that it was you"—I said "Harry, I feel as if I am dying, will you sit me down on a chair?"—he tore about the room as if he was mad—I don't know whether he fetched my mother or not, but she came and asked me what he had done; she lives next door—we were in the dark all this time—she fetched the landlady—a policeman came and asked me who had done it—I said "My husband"—he took me to the hospital—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife, I saw it in his hand, it is the only one I had, except one without a handle.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—on 29th September I had bought a bottle of stuff for my ancle labelled "Poison," this is it—I took the paper off it and put it on the table about 6.50, so that anybody could see the label—when the prisoner came in I pointed the bottle out—he picked up, looked at it and said "Poison!" and then he said "I could have given you a better prescription than that myself"—he then wrote a prescription, but I did not see what he wrote, I thought he was in fun, I did not think he meant it and I took no notice—he wrote something about oil and liniment—I have not got it, I have lost it—he had offered us some wine before—he sent for some glasses and brought them back—I had then gone into my bedroom to rest my ancle—I heard him pouring out the wine—he then tapped at the door and said "Here are two glasses of wine for you and Mr. Brand"—when I followed my husband into the room I found that the prisoner had gone—he usually stopped two hours when he came and on other occasions he has partaken of the wine—he</p>

I am lecturer on chemistry at Guy's Hospital, and public analyst of St. Pancras—I received these two bottles from Inspector Gee; the larger one contained only a wine glass of liquid con<lb/>taining alcohol, opium, essential oil of camphor, ammonia, and a very small quantity of red colouring matter which might have been derived from red wine—this name and address was on the small bottle when I received it—the larger bottle contained a weaker solution; the proportion was about one to one and a half, the smaller bottle being the stronger—the explana<lb/>tion of that would be that the two glasses had wine or something in them, and that a larger quantity of the colour had been added to one than to the other; the two were similar, but of different strengths; there was double the quantity of opium in the smaller bottle to what was in—the larger—something must have been added to the larger bottle to dilute it—I simply reproduced those articles by adding certain things to port wine, which gave a similar taste and similar chemical tests—a person taking a wine glass of what was in the smaller bottle would take a dose of opium greater. than the minimum fatal dose—if he had drunk the whole glass there was enough to kill him—most probably it would not kill, but a similar quantity has been known to kill—in the other bottle there was about a fluid drachm "of laudanum, or four grains of opium—a wine glass of it would contain more than has been known to kill.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am a member of the College of Physicians of London—I was connected with the Hoxton Private Asylum about ten years—I had the prisoner first under my charge there in 1845; I speak from notes—it was an ordinary case of acute mania—I remember that he con<lb/>ceived that his brother George had some intention to injure or murder him,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187510250030"/>
               <p>and the consequence was he had a loaded gun, and was going all over the neighbourhood, but not where his brother was likely to be—he was suffer<lb/>ing from delusion—he was admitted on 9th July, 1845, and was discharged on February 6th, 1846—he was violent from time to time, but not as a general rule—he came in again on 23rd February, 1850, and was discharged on September 6th, 1850; he was under my charge for those seven months—I cannot recall the particular form his mania assumed then, but I know it was always that some one was about to destroy, or injure, or poison, or get rid of him, and that some of his relatives had poisoned some other people; it was always that some individuals were about to do him mischief, and he con<lb/>ceived that his sister was about to hurt some other member of his family he was not under my control at that place afterwards—he was in the asylum from October, 1855, till June 3rd, 1856, but at that time I had ceased to be the physician to the asylum, though I was constantly there, as my brother was superintendent of the asylum—the prisoner was there again on 23rd April, 1861, and was discharged on March 3rd, 1862—I should say that he was not there after that—this is a document from the asylum—I believe he was confined a fifth time at Bethnal Green—I have been present in Court during the hearing of this case, and have heard that as far as Mr. Brand was concerned they were on friendly terms—the act charged against the prisoner is consistent with any form of mania—the Lunatic Asylum was subject to the visitation of the Commissioners in Lunacy, and no person could be admitted without the certificate of two medical men that he was insane, and stating the data upon which that opinion is formed—I saw the prisoner after the charge was preferred at the police-court, and again at the Old Bailey, and in my opinion he is decidedly not a person of sound mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He has never been of sound mind since I first saw him in 1845—the symptoms of acute mania are many, but it applies generally to the disease coming on suddenly, as if from some physical change—if he is now fifty-six, his age was twenty-six when he was first confined—my impres<lb/>sion was that he was not a man of drunken habits, but that it is insanity depending on congenital deficiency of the brain, a constitutional case of in<lb/>sanity—it was such insanity that he would not be responsible for his acts other people looking on and not noticing it, is perfectly consistent with the act—it would not probably be the first visible symptom of the delusion, and in other respects he would behave as an ordinary man—I had not seen him latterly, but the appearance of his face and eyes when 1 saw him at the Old Bailey showed me at once that he was a man who had indulged in drinking for a long while to a great extent—taking spirituous liquors would render a man doubly insane—anything which caused the heart to send the blood to the brain would in a weakened brain destroy its power for action—it is an ordinary thing that he should appear like anybody else.</p>

The treatment of insane patients was a speciality with me at that time—I call it irresistible impulse—when a man has passed five or six years in an asylum and has been detained there by the medical attend-mt, without any desire to make a profit, no sane man could be detained—had the prisoner gone out and purchased this medicine and brought it into the louse he might have intenteded to poison, his finding it on the table makes considerable difference; in a man whose mind is weakened you cannot tell what passes, but I think this was a sort of temptation; he had been out to get the wine and there was the linament; I tell you deliberately that I do lot think he knew that he was doing wrong, or if he did, this was an irresisti<lb/>ble</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I have known the prisoner ten or twelve years at Colney Hatch—he lived a quarter of a mile from the asylum with his sister, who took care of him for years—my father attended him there, and also at Winchmore Hill—I have always considered the prisoner to be of unsound mind—he used to wander about the fields with a loaded gun and said that his brother wanted to shoot him; everybody was afraid of him—I conversed with him about it, and in 1867 I took him up to Bethnal Green Asylum; that is a private asylum—he was there for a month, and was much better in consequence of being restrained from drink—he is of unsound mind apart from drink, but when he drinks that accelerates it—looking at him as he stands now without any drink in him, I believe he is of unsound mind and not responsible for his actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The form of his mania when he was confined was violence, acute mania,—when I saw him he was smashing everything in the kitchen and threatening to kill everybody—I have not studied madness very much—the longest period of confinement when I knew him was a month; that was after giving him self to drink.</p>

I have attended him and my father before me—my father would have been here but he is ill—I attended the prisoner as a family doctor; I had nothing to do with his mind, except in 1867, but I have met him and walked with him; he was then quite rational—he knew perfectly well on all other subjects what he was about, but he sometimes said that his sister was going to poison him when she brought up his tea every morn<lb/>ing, and that his brother was going to shoot him—I have not known him for the last eight years, he has left Colney Hatch and gone to Winchmore Hill—as long as I have known him his mania was doing injury—he was capable of knowing right from wrong, with the exception of that one idea—I have no doubt that he has been decidedly insane ever since I have known him—he has been let out as cured five times and then he breaks out again.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a surgeon, of Winchmore Hill—I have known the prisoner for the last seven or eight years, living with his sister—he has always been greatly addicted to drink, and then he was violent and decidedly insane, but when he was sober it was difficult to get him to admit any of his insane ideas—he has been under my care and attention—many of his ways were not those of a gentleman, he used to play foolish tricks and prac<lb/>tical jokes, and when he gets a little drop of drink on board he is totally reckless—in my judgment he is decidedly of unsound mind, even when sober—he was very fond of his garden, and I have known him sow a bed of peas broadcast—I do not think he is responsible for his actions at this moment—I never knew him do anything malicious, it was more doing things foolishly—his sister has done all she could, and has had a keeper for him, but after<lb/>wards she Bent the prisoner away as he got so uncontrollable and made the house so miserable—they are all independent—the father was in some way connected with the City or the Lord Mayor.</p>

I am a brother of the prisoner—he will be fifty-six next Sunday—he was first placed under restraint in 1845, and afterwards on four other occasions—my sister Betsy is very much attached to him, and he has lived with her for the latter part of his life—he is of a kind and generous disposition, but he would have impulses—I should say that even when perfectly sober he never was right, but of course when he was drunk he was very much worse—when he had not been drinking he told me that my sister was the murderer of the family, and that Dr. Bury was un<lb/>willing to give a certificate of his death, and he was not sure that he was not poisoned; that all the servants were bad characters, and put sneezing powders in the water to make us all sneeze—sometimes his conversation was almost learned, and the next moment he would fall off into something very stupid—on one or two occasions he said that his real father was con<lb/>fined in a cellar below—ever since 1845 he has been very eccentric at times, and my opinion is that he has never been really sane—on the oc<lb/>casion of his going to Hoxton House, he had gone to the station-house to complain to the police against me, but he had got a loaded gun and his mania was that I had got all the windows open, and was going to shoot him—the magistrate discharged him on the condition that I should take care of him, and actually lent me a policeman to take him to Hoxton House, Dr. Miles'.</p>

I am the prisoner's sister, and live at Winchmore Hill—he lived with me rather more than seven years—I was very much attached to him and anxious to take care of him—he left me nearly two years ago, and took a lodging in Camden Road on his own account—I hoped that a gentleman would be able to control him better than I could, and that if he did not like it he would return to me—I then went; into the country but he spent more than half his time with me—through the dread<lb/>ful delusions he had I was frightened of him., and thought I ought to have some one to control him—I consider him of decidedly unsound mind, from the accusations he brought against me and my nephew, and the singular way in which he passed his time—he said that my man servant and I broke open his boxes and stole his things, and he constantly made charges against the servants, and said nothing about it the next day—he has mixed things for the servants, strawberries and mustard, but at my house it was whiskey and other things; it was mere boyish fun—the servants said that he would say "Just taste this, is not it nice?" but not to give it as medicine—when we went to Hoxton House he had cards printed "Sir John Cameron," but I have never heard him speak of that again—the chief ac<lb/>cusation he brought against me was that I murdered my elder brother and my nephew.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a woollen merchant, in Sise Lane, City—I knew the prisoner previous to October, 1874, and had business dealings with him—on October 3rd a bill of "his fell due for 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for goods sold and delivered—on the 2nd he called at my office and saw some linen goods called "ducks" lying there, which I agreed to sell to him provided the bill due on the 3rd would be paid—he said "I am prepared to meet the bill, I have funds ready for it in the City and County Bank" and I sup<lb/>plied him with the ducks on that assurance, their value being 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the 3rd I had prepared some goods for him, but would not deliver them unless I was assured that the bill would be met—he then wished to buy some woollen cloths and I declined to sell them unless the bill would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187510250034"/>
               <p>he met—on his distinct assurance that he had the money in the bank I gave him a delivery order for twelve pieces of woollen cloth of the value of about 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Pewtress, the packers, of Cannon Street, were to deliver them to him—the bill for the 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was dishonoured and I never received the money—the prisoner's offices were 8, Queen Victoria Street, City—I called there but did not find him—the last I saw of him was on Saturday, the 3rd October, until he was in the custody of the police—I applied for a warrant for his arrest and he was arrested about a year afterwards—I believed his statement as to having the money in the bank because I tested him in several ways—I put the question many times.</p>

September himself, it was for goods sold and delivered—I never had any acceptance, I am quite sure I did not accept the bill for 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and ho had to take it up because I did not meet it—I delivered no more goods to Pewtress after I knew Skalski had not the money to meet the bill on the 3rd October—I sent invoices of goods purporting to be delivered, and if he had paid me the money he would have had them—I thought he should see the goods were ready, but I would not deliver them to him—that was the 7th or 8th—I knew by that time the bill had been returned—he mentioned something about going about and getting some money of his friends—I knew he was in partner<lb/>ship with a man named Rock, and that he lost money with him; and I told him if he did not part with Rock I would not do business with him, and he parted with Rock—I believe he left bis clerk at his office in Queen Victoria Street and that his wife was there when he went abroad—I took out the warrant on the 15th October and I next saw him in England when he was apprehended—I did not know that he was then carrying on business in London—he had another bill for about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming due on the 8th—he would have gone on step by step as a matter of course if he had met them.</p>

I keep the post-office at 42, Curzon Street, Mayfair—on 30th April or 1st May, 1874, a man named Wilding came to my shop and asked my clerk in ray hearing for change for a cheque—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the clerk declined to cash it and I stepped forward and said I had not got sufficient to cash it for him—Wilding said "You will very much oblige Mr. Warren if you will let him have the change"—Mr. Warren is a publican round the corner—I have cashed cheques for him before—I said "I have not got sufficient"—the prisoner came in at that time and said "I want a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. order and then you can oblige your friend"—the clerk gave two orders of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each and I gave the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to Wilding and let him go—I afterwards saw Wilding at Mr. Lewis's office in Marlborough Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in partnership with Mr. Buckland, at 5, Salters Hall Court, as estate agents—I first saw the prisoner somewhere about the middle of May, in reference to finding a large loan upon property that he then possessed—he gave me to understand that he was possessed of large property, that he was a member of the families of the Dukes of Abercorn and Hamilton, which we subsequently found to be correct, and that he was possessed of 250,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in India Four per Cents, and Egyptian Bonds—about the 15th June, he instructed to us sell out 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I never saw any bonds; we simply made arrangements with our broker to do so, and a day was fixed for us to hand the bonds over to the broker; but he did not bring them, he brought a person named Pryme, who he re<lb/>presented to be one of his trustees—the Austin property was mentioned about a week later; we introduced the property to him about 5th June, we asked him if he was open to buy any other property; he said he was, and after considerable negociation in which he shewed very great skill, we submitted the Austin property to him at 350,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he ultimately, agreed to give 336,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he signed a preliminary contract—he intro<lb/>duced Mr. Hemsley to me as his solicitor—about the 16th June, he asked me if I could oblige him by changing a cheque—he wrote out two cheques in our office, these produced are them—we gave him the exact sum 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I parted, with that money believing his statement that he was possessed of these bonds and this property, and that he had money at the bank—he said that Messrs. Barron &amp; Smith, on whom the cheques were drawn, were his army agents, and did his banking—the next day he wrote to us asking us not to use the cheque, that he would call on us—on 25th June, I saw him at his, then residence, 30, Blenheim Crescent, Notting Hill, and I went with him to Lancaster Gate, and met Mr. Austin, at the resi<lb/>dence of the late Lord West Dury—the prisoner gave me this letter; it was not brought to me by a cabman. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed an order for</hi> 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on the Paddington Branch of the City Bank, and requested the witness to send by the bearer a cabman</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in small notes, to retain</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on his</hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoners</hi>) <hi rend="italic">account, to repay himself the</hi> 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">borrowed, and to keep the repairing</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">as a bonus for the time and advice given to him: desiring him to hold the order over until the next Friday, by which time he would have settled the purcliase of the Austin and Tippdt properties</hi>).

               <p>Mr. Tippett's property, which was in Paddington, it was necessary for him to have a local banking account, and he had opened an account at the City Bank, Paddington Branch—I gave him the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me this cheque—I believed his statement when I parted with that money—I have never had a <hi rend="italic">rap</hi> or a fraction back—this cheque for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and this letter are the prisoner's writing. <hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "10th September, 1874.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I was introduced to you by a Mr. Cousins; I met you at Mr. Gibbons'—you told me that he paid the ground rent for the house, and I was led to believe it belonged to the estate—to a certain extent I was acting as your agent when you gave me the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque: you engaged me that very day to be your future agent and receiver, at a salary of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—after that date I introduced Mr. Haywood and Mr. Austin to you—at that time I was acting as agent for Mr. Austin, and I sold you the property that morning—this letter is my writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 23rd June</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">to the prisoner, and contained advice to postpone the purchase of the Tippett property for a week until the money market became more settled.</hi>) That refers to the selling out of stock—when I sold you Mr. Austin's property I was acting as your agent in that respect—if I sold the property I was to receive 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as commission from Mr. Austin, of which you were perfectly aware—after the 31st August, and after your cheque had been dishonoured, you still entertained an idea of being able to get the money; you led us to believe it was possible for you to do so, and we accompanied you to Messrs. Barker, Peek &amp; Bird—you went to Mr. Devon<lb/>shire, a solicitor, who wrote on his and your behalf to Messrs. Barker &amp; Co. about the property—after that letter was received Mr. Bird, as solicitor for Mr. Austin, drew out an agreement for the purchase of the property, adding 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the price; that was upon your representation that you were still possessed of this 250,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you never denied owing me this money; you were daily meeting me for the purpose of paying me, but I could never get it—you afterwards said you would have nothing more to do with me, for you found I had been opening your private letters—that was when I told you you were a thief and a scoundrel—I did not say I would go to Mr. Passingham's office, and let him know what had taken place—I did not go there direct; I may have called upon him on that day.</p>

               <p>afterwards saw him again, and he asked me to hold it over for a short time, as he did not wish so small cheque to be presented at the bank—I held it up to 18th July—on 18th July he owed me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, and he then gave me this cheque for 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I returned the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque to him—I believed there were funds at the bank when he gave me that—he asked me to hold that over for a few days—he continued using the brougham daily—about the latter part of August he showed me a paper, and said he had bought a large estate, Mr. Austin's property at Lancaster Gate, for which he was to pay or had paid 230,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 28th August he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I still held the cheque for 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at his request, and was holding it on 10th September—he frequently asked me when he came to the yard why I did not take some stables which were on the right hand side of the yard, and have a private yard—he said it would be a great advantage to me—I said I had not sufficient money to do so, and he-said he would advance me 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the usual interest; I think it was 7 per cent.—I did not ask him for that; it was a free offer on his part—I took him to Mr. Gray, my solicitor on that business—I believe that was on the 10th September—I heard him make a statement to Mr. Gray, and I was present when Mr. Gray gave him a cheque—at that time I believed he was a man of property, because I had seen the advertisements of certain por<lb/>tions of Mr. Austin's property having been sold, and the prisoner said he had bought that estate; I believed that statement most implicitly—on 28th September the prisoner gave me this cheque for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had incurred a further debt at that time, but I had stopped the carriage on 15th September—I told him I could not go on any further, as the amount was too heavy, and I refused to serve him for some time, and on the last Saturday in Sep<lb/>tember he met me and asked me to remove him to 50, Cambridge Gardens, and I continued to serve him until the 1st October, because he said the money would be forthcoming about 26th September from his rents, &amp; c.—he owed me 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two guineas afterwards made it 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I have had nothing but the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 28th August.</p>

I am a widow, and live at Amersham Road, Deptford—on the evening of 11th September I was going from Greenwich towards home, about 11 o'clock or 11.30—the heel, of my boot caught in my dress and I fell down—at that time I was wearing a gold watch and an albert chain—a woman came up and brushed the dust from my dress—whilst she was doing that the prisoner was passing by, and the woman said "This appears to be a respectable young man, I should let him go with you, or you might lose your watch and chain"—I said "I am not afraid of that, I am not hurt, and do not require anyone to walk with me"—I was going down the road, and he walked by my side—when we got to the Amersham Road I said to the prisoner "I am at home now"—I was about two doors from my house—he took hold of my chain, which was fastened to my button-hole, and my watch pocket gave way, and he took my watch and chain and went down the Amersham Road to Amersham Villas, where I lost sight sight of him—I went to the police-station the next morning and gave information and a description of the man—the prisoner was afterwards brought by the police to my house, and I recognised him in a moment as the person who had robbed me—I was afterwards shown my watch and chain by the police—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

I keep the Cape of Good Hope, Deptford—on the afternoon of the 4th October the prisoner was at my bar—in twenty minutes or more the prosecutor came in—the other pensioner was in previously—he belonged to Deptford and was not in his company at all—the three dropped into some conversation in front of the bar and the topic was advising the young man to enlist to better his condition—he was in a deplorable state then—he was very shabby and he suggested going into the taproom—the prisoner took the beer in—about twenty minutes afterwards the other prisoner came out, and the other two were left in the room together—I should think about twenty minutes after that I was in the bar, and I saw the prisoner rush through in a violent manner, and I said "Some<lb/>thing is wrong," and ran to the street door to see if I could see him, and it appeared he turned into a turning where there was no thoroughfare—I went into the taproom and found the prosecutor in a state of insensibility, and I asked him what was the matter—I looked at his pockets and saw one was cut out entirely, and a portion of the other taken off—I sent for the police and soon after the police came we saw the prisoner some distance off and we both pursued him and followed him into a coal shed where we took him—he said to the constable that he only had a sovereign and that belonged to him, his own hard earnings and he threw this knife away, and I went and picked it up, we took him to the station-house, and the money was found 011 him.</p>

I live at 184, Blackfriars Road, and am a registered medical practitioner—about 10 o'clock on Saturday evening, the 16th of October, I was sent for to 30, Queen's Street, Blackfriars Road—I went to the first floor room and saw the prisoner there, and found a woman lying on the floor whom I since knew to be Naomi Youell—she was quite dead—I used every means to restore her, but life was quite extinct—I could not at that time see the cause of death—I could only see a very slight abrasion over the right eye, and on the wrist, which would not in the least account for death—I asked the prisoner if she had been ill and taken medicine—he said no—he said she had been well up to that evening—the expression of the face looked so quiet that I thought death had happened from prussic acid—we made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, I found two small abrasions on the forehead, one over each eye, on the outer part of each wrist, and two small abrasions on the left knee about the size of a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, but no blood had issued from it—the vessels of the brain were very much congested—we bund a large clot of blood in the right ventricle; that had produced apoplexy—my firm opinion is that the cause of death was apoplexy—the lot of blood did not correspond with any mark of violence in the slightest degree—the vessels of the brain were generally in an unhealthy state, I might say diseased, which would render her more liable to an attack of apoplexy—the apoplexy might have been produced by the excitement of a quarrel without any blows—her stomach was very nearly empty, and the liver was very unhealthy—a fall against a table or a box, or a trunk would be very likely to produce those abrasions which I saw over the eye—there</p>

               <p>was a large quantity of blood diffused over the brain, more especially in the right ventricle—I don't think it would take long to cause that—I should think a quarter of an hour in a case like that—it was merely a slight abrasion of the outer cuticle, not at all deep, there was not any bleeding—I should think it impossible that it could have been produced by a blew that would be heard by a person who did not see it, but who was in a neighbouring room.</p>

I am single and live with my father and mother on the ground floor No. 30, Queen's Street, Blckfriars Road, and the prisoner lived with his wife Naomi Youell, in the first floor front room—we had lived in that house two years, and they came the week after we did—on Saturday night, the 16th of October, about 8 or 9 o'clock, I was in the kitchen in the basement—I went up to the ground floor and listened. because I heard quarrelling upstairs—the prisoner's door was shut—I stood about a dozen steps down—it is a very narrow staircase—I heard the prisoner say "Where have you got the drink from"—then I heard Mr. Youell say "I have no more drink in me than you"—then I heard blows, and then a noise as if it was a fall, and I heard her say "You spiteful wretch, oh, my God, you are a spiteful wretch;" after that all was quite—I heard him walk<lb/>ing about the room—this took about a quarter of an hour—after that I heard the prisoner say "I will give you more before I get you between the sheets—then I heard blows again and three groans and a kiss—after that the prisoner opened the door, came down, and asked for Mr. Baker, and I told him Mr. Baker was not in, but father was—he said "Mr. Baker, will you come up, there is something the matter with my wife"—my father and I went up and found a candle in the room and Mr. Youell leaning against the wall with her head resting sideway against the table—my father said she is dead—the prisoner said "Good God, is she?"—my father went for the doctor, Mr. Smith—the prisoner remained alone with his wife till the doctor came—I went into the room again—at that time the body was taken from the chair and laid down on the floor—the prisoner was pouring brandy into her mouth—the doctor said it was no use—the prisoner said she had fallen over a box on to the chair—he also said "I did not do anything to her."</p>

I examined the body with the other surgeon on the 16th of October—I could see nothing externally to account for death—I saw two abrasions over the right eye about the size of a shilling—if any blow had been given I think I should have found the impress, there was nothing of the sort—I found the whole of the brain highly congested, and a large clot in the right lateral ventricle of the brain—she died from natural causes, from apoplexy, that I am firmly convinced of—any excitement would bring it on, it might take a minute, it would be the last drop that would cause it—I saw no sign of injury to correspond with that clot—I examined her liver; it was a gin drinker's liver, what we call a hob-nail liver.</p>
