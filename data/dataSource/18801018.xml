                  </hi>. I carry on business with my brothers as millers at 10, Mark Lane—on May 6,1878, the prisoner entered our service as traveller, and this agreement was entered into between us (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I sub<lb/>seqnently received from him this letter of May 18, 1878, agreeing to all the terms and conditions—his duty was to take orders and send them up to us, and we should send the goods and invoices—it was also his duty to collect accounts, and either to hand them to us when he came to the office, or else pay them in to our credit at the head office of the London and County Bank, or to any branch of the same, promptly, either the same day or not later than the day following—cheques made payable to bearer he was to deal with in the same way as cash—cheques to order he would either hand to us at the office or post them to us for our endorsement—he had no authority to endorse cheques for us by procuration or in any way—from 1878 up to July this year he pursued that practice so far as we were aware—the endorsements on these two cheques of 17th July for 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Packer's, and this of August 7th for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Rayner's, are in the prisoner's writing—he had no authority to endorse them—we were not aware until he was dismissed that he had received those moneys—we have never received the money—in consequence of other matters he was given into custody—these lists are in his writing; they were left at our office by some one representing the prisoner, after his dismissal.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 30, Queen's Road, Upton Park, Essex—on 22nd September last I changed a cheque at the Union Bank, Princes Street, and received for it three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—I paid one of them away on the following Saturday to a wine merchant in Aldgate—on 29th September, soon after 10 a.m., I went to the post-office receiving house at Upton Park, which is kept by Dr. Budgett—the prisoner was not there at first, he came in soon after—I said to him "I wish to send 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Deal, I think I shall require two post-office orders, one for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner left the shop for a few minutes and then returned and said "You are right, Mrs. Hankin, will you have the kindness to sit down a few minutes? Mr. Ansell will be in"—Mr. Ansell is the station-master—he did not come, and after waiting a short time the prisoner took a small box from a shelf and said "We often send small boxes of this kind in different directions, and they always arrive safely; you have only to pay 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for registration"—at first I rather objected, but he reassured me, he said there would not be the slightest difficulty, that boxes were often sent, and always arrived safely so long as they were registered—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for registration—I then put the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes on the counter, with a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the notes were two of those I had received. from the Union Bank—I wrote down on a piece of paper my address and that of Mr. Lush, Alfred College, Deal, to whom they were to be sent—the prisoner then said "I will take the numbers of the notes"—I replied "If you will give me a pen I will do it"—however, he looked at the notes and wrote something down, which I concluded was the numbers of the notes—he then took up the notes and folded them both into this small box, he then put the sovereign and half-sovereign in, and was pro<lb/>ceeding to add the small change, when two persons came in in a great hurry and wanted something immediately—the prisoner went to the bottles and seemed to be in a great hurry to mix something for them—it is a chemist's shop—he said "Mrs. Hankin, will you oblige me by calling in this evening for the receipt?"—I said I would, and left—I called again in the evening; I found the prisoner was very busy in the shop—he looked up and said "It is all right, Mrs. Hankin, will you oblige by stepping in in the morning?"—he did not ask me for any money for postage—I sent a letter of advice to Mr. Lush the same day, but did not post it at that office—next morning, Thursday, I was not</p>

               <p>able to go to the post-office—I went in the evening, the prisoner was then very busy counting out money, and there were several people in the shop when he saw me he looked up anxiously and said "Oh, Mrs. Hankin, I am very sorry, will you oblige by coming in the morning for the receipt—I did not like the delay, but I had no objection, and left, rather un willingly—I called again next morning, 1st October, saw the prisoner, and asked for the receipt—he said "I am very sorry, but to tell yon the truth, I forgot to register the box"—I said "You forgot I that is not business please to give me a receipt, you know I paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a registration"—he said "I will give you back the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I refused to accept it, and demanded a receipt—he laid he could not give me a regular receipt, but he would give me a receipt, so he accordingly gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was not in the state it is now when he gave it me, there was no signature to it, nor was the amount of the money written on it—I wrote the amount, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and then demanded his signature—there was no stamp on it, it was affixed afterwards—the signature now is "E.H. Billing, pro G. Williams," but Mr. Williams was not there, he had left; he was in the same position as the prisoner, an assistant to Dr. Budgett—before I left the shop I asked the prisoner to give me the numbers of the notes he had written down—he said he had lost the paper—I noticed on the counter the sheet of paper on which my address and that of Mr. Lush was written, and I lifted it, thinking he had perhaps put the numbers on the other side, but he put his hand On it and said u The numbers are not there"—I said "It is of no importance, I can get the numbers at my bankers"—I then left, and never saw him afterwards—I went straight to the telegraph-office at Plaistow and telegraphed to Mr. Lush, and received a reply—I then went to Dr. Budgett the same day and repre<lb/>sented the case to him, and next day I went to the Bank and stopped the notes, and then went to St. Martin's-le-Grand and represented the case to the secretary—the prisoner did not say to me "As you have not the numbers of the notes, for safety I will change them," nor did I say to him "You can do as you wish"—I did not desire him to change the notes, for the evident reason, had he changed them the box would not have contained the money, it was too small; besides, it would have made the box heavier.</p>

                  </hi>. I am travelling clerk attached to the miss<lb/>ing letter branch of the General Poet Office—on 11th October I was in the Waterloo Road shortly before 10, and saw the prisoner there—I was on the look-out for him—I stopped him and said, "Mr. Billing, I believe "—he said "Yes"—I was accompanied by Police-constable Lord—I said, "We belong to the Post-office; I wish you to accompany us there with reference to a registered letter irregularity which occurred at the Upton Park receiving-house on the 29th of last month"—he was put into a cab and taken to the General Post Office, and saw him in a private room there—I said, "Mrs. Hankin, of Queen's Road, Upton Park, has stated that she came to your office on the 29th and wished to take out two money orders for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and you advised her to send the money in a registered letter"—he said, "Yes, I did; I enclosed the money in a small box, packed it up with brown paper, and addressed it to J. Lush, Sty, Alfred College, Deal, but I omitted to register it"—I said, "Did you enclose the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in the box which Mrs. Hankin gave you?"—he said, "No; I said to Mrs. Hankin, 'As you have not the numbers of the notes, for safety I had better change them;' Mrs. Hankin replied, 'Yon can do as you please,' or something to that effect. However, it was by her desire I changed them. I afterwards went out and changed one at Kemp's, the oilman, and the other at Folkard's, the draper's, and came back and made up the box, put the money in the box, and sent it my with the 12.30 collection"—I said, "Do you wish me to believe Rich an incredible statement, for you had the numbers of the notes before you, and could have taken them at the time?"—he replied, "Well, I must confess it don't appear feasible, but what I have stated about dunging the notes is quite correct"—I said, "I shall have to make one further inquiry, and shall charge you with stealing the money, the property of Mrs. Hankin"—he said, "Don't do that; I know what the law is as well as you do; I know I am liable, for I took the money, and what I shall have to do will be to make it good, of course"—I had this note with me, and I put it down before him and said, "This is one of the notes which Mrs. Hankin gave you"—he said, "Yes, I think it is by the number, but it wan not like that when I changed it," pointing to the cancelling—I said, "I shall charge you with stealing the money, consisting of two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and the rest in cash, the property of Mrs. Hankin—he said, "Very well"—he said he had sent it away without being registered, and he had endeavoured to trace it.</p>

In consequence of in<lb/>formation I watched the premises of Leach and Co., Newcastle Street, Farringdon Street on 16th September, about 11.30 a.m., and saw Goddard take a cartload of type to the prosecutor's other shop in Lincoln's Inn Fields—he then took the empty cart to the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi> office, from where he took a number of electrotype plates—this is one of the largest, and this one of the smallest (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he then drove to Shore<lb/>ditch Church, where he left the boy who was with him, and went to 6, Margaret Place, Bethnal Green, a private house; there is nothing on the door to indicate a business—he got there about 1 o'clock—he drove direct to the door, went in for a few minutes, and came out and carried in the plates a few at a time—I left Inspector Wells at the top of the turning, and as I was entering the door I met Goddard, and pushed him back into the house, and said in Faden's hearing "I am a police<lb/>officer, where is that type?" he made no reply, but Faden said "It is the first I have bought"—I said "Where is it?"—she pointed across the room, the door of which was open, and said "There it is by the window; I have just taken it off the scale"—I Said "Is that all he has brought that I see lying there?" she said "Yes"—I said "Are you the proprietress of the place?" she said "Yes"—I said "Have you a husband?" she said "Yes, but he is out"—I said "When do you expect him in?" she said "I cannot tell how long he will be, but I expect him in soon"—I asked Goddard "Have you any instructions to bring the type here?" he laid "No"—I asked to whom it belonged; he said "To Leach and Co."—Faden then said "I have not paid for it yet, I was going to borrow the money of a neighbour to pay for it: I was going to give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a cwt"—I said "How much does it weigh?" she said "2cwt. 3qrs. less a few pounds"—they were both taken to the station with the plates—I then went back and searched the house, and found three half pecks of dross in the yard, which was strewn with tin: a melting pot was on the other side of the yard—the parlour had tin shavings all over the floor, and there were tin shavings in other rooms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I only took away the stereotype plates—I do not think I asked Faden how much they weighed; I will not swear I did not—I waited till her husband came home; his wife was then in the house—he told me later on that he was in the habit of clearing out tin factories and selling tin scraps—she appeared rather stout, as if near her confinement—I did not lock her husband up; he was there when the charge was read over—I found about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Goddard, but nothing relating to the charge.</p>

On Sunday, 29th August, at 3.30 p.m., I was on duty in Chenies Street, Tottenham Court Road, and saw the prisoner sitting on a doorstep with a female child in her lap; it had its arm up—it looked half starved—I asked her where she lived—she said "Not far from here"—I said "Where?"—she said "Draper's place"—I said "What number?"—she said "10"—I told her to get up and take the child home—she got up, walked a few yards, and fell in the gutter—she was drunk—I took her and the child to the station and charged her with being drunk and incapable of taking care of the child—the surgeon was sent for, and the child was removed to the workhouse at once—the prisoner was charged at Bow Street next morning, remanded for a week, and discharged on promising not to drink again—the child's clothes were very dirty and wet—I was present at the inquest on the child and heard the prisoner give her evidence, which was read over to her and she signed it—this is her deposition (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

I am mother of deceased and wife to John Thomas Alexander, a birdcage maker. The deceased child was three months and two weeks old. I suckled the child for three weeks. When it was three weeks old it was taken into the University College Hospital as it was ill, and remained there three weeks. When the child came out of the hospital I had no breast milk, and then fed it with cow's milk. The child did not improve, and I took her to Middlesex Hospital. After I left the hospital with the child I sat down on a doorstep to feed the child, and a policeman told me to take it home. I got up, and the policeman then took me to the station, where I was charged with being drunk. The child was taken away from me and I was locked up. On the following day, Monday, I was taken before a Magistrate, and remanded for a week to the House of Detention, and was then brought up again before the Magistrate and was discharged. When I was let out I went to St. Giles's Workhouse three or four times to see the child. I had fed the deceased on milk and water, bread and milk, and arrowroot. The doctor at both hospitals told me to feed deceased with milk and water, as bread was too heavy for the child. I only fed it with bread and milk once after the doctor said I was to give it milk and water. I have had ten living children; seven have died. The body seen by the Jurors is that of my child, Rebecca Catherine Alexander."</p>

On 10th September, about 11.10, I heard cries of "Fire"—I went to 21, Great Cambridge Street, and saw the prisoner's wife at the door of the house—there is another door leading to the street, a large gateway; that was closed, and locked up with two locks—I went into the house by the front door, and down a long passage to another door, which was locked—I broke off the lock, entered the prisoner's warehouse, and saw a pile of crates filled with paper and straw, and saturated with paraffin oil; that was all alight, and the ceiling was burnt—I put out the fire with water—Spanton was with me—there were two fires, one on the left side of the warehouse and one on the right under the stairs, where this basket was placed with this candle in it alight, and about eight other baskets of straw and paper on the top of it—the paper was wet with paraffin oil, but the smell has gone off now—Spanton extinguished the lights—I sent for the inspector, but before he came the prisoner came in—he told the inspector that he was not insured, or he did not think he was, and he had no policy—I took him to the station—he was searched, and this policy was found in his outside jacket pocket, and this key of the door at the foot of the steps—before I unfolded it he said, "That is my policy"—I have not tried the key, but both doors were locked—he was charged with setting fire to the house, but made no answer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When asked if he was insured he did not say, "I don't think I am; I have no policy yet"—he said afterwards, "I don't think I am; I have paid my premiums, but I have received no policy."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Victoria Place, St. Pancras—the prisoner occupied two parlours in my house for a week—he had lodged with me before, and I took him in out of kindness on account of his wife and children—his wife was in the hospital ill—on 15th September I went home to dinner about 12.30—my wife made a communication to me and I went up and knocked at the prisoner's door—he opened it and said "You old b—, I mean to do for you before I go"—he stabbed me several times, and said that every time—he gave me one stab behind my left ear and cut my chin—my wife came up and tried to take away the knife, but could not, and she was stabbed three times on her left breast over my shoulder—I fainted from loss of blood, and afterwards found myself in the hospital—I am still very weak and bad—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner—he is a shoemaker—he attacked me suddenly the moment I entered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—on 15th September, about 8.30 a.m., I saw the prisoner at the foot of the stairs; he called my child an ugly animal—that was the first time I had seen him that morning—I asked him if it was my child he spoke to—he said "Yes, you d—old villain"—I asked him if he could make a pair of shoes before breakfast, and said "If you don't mind, standing there insulting me, I shall give you twelve months"—he said "I will give you two years looking through the bars"—his daughter told him to go and wash his mouth out—he went out with his children and I saw no more of him—my husband returned at 12 o'clock, and when he had eaten part of his dinner I told him the same as I have told you—he went and knocked at the door of the prisoner's room—I was on the first floor—I did not hear the words, but I heard a struggle, went down, and the prisoner had got my husband in front of him—I took my husband by the shoulders, took him away, and gave the prisoner notice to go on Saturday—I then found blood on my hands and laid hold of the prisoner, and he put the point of the knife through my fingers—finding I did not let go he <hi rend="italic">made at</hi> my left breast two or three times—my husband was very faint; two men led him out, and at the top of the gate he dropped, and was taken in a cab to University Hospital—a woman told the prisoner to put the knife down, and after some minutes he put it down on his board—we had no quarrel before.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at University College Hospital when Winter was brought in; he was in a state of collapse and had lost a little blood externally—he had three wounds, a stab perforating his chest below the nipple and near his heart—one cut had gone under the skin and glanced off, not perforating the wall of the chest—the stab was dangerous—he was unconscious—I attended him a month and he has quite recovered—this knife would inflict the wounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were three wounds between 1 and 2 inches apart—I think they were deliberate wounds, and not done by the struggle; some amount of force was necessary.</p>

Perry and Maitland 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>,—I became acquainted with the prisoner about four months ago as a handy man who could write, as I am not much of a scholar—he helped me occasionally to fill up cheques and other things—he had no authority to sign my name—on 4th Sep<lb/>tember I was in a public-house with Foskett and Mr. Breeze, talking about the debt to Perry and Co., who had sued me—Foskett said the money must be paid at once; he wanted 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was ample; he said "It is no good my taking that, I must have 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I drew a cheque for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was destroyed, and he filled up another cheque for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by my directions; he promised to pay the money—I signed the cheque; it was payable to the order of Messrs. Peckham, Maitland, and Peckham, the solicitors—this is it—I never gave the prisoner instructions to endorse or cash it—the next thing was the brokers being put in my house—I had received no receipt, as the correspondence was carried on between Messrs. Peckham and the prisoner—if I said I had a receipt at the police-court it is a mistake—I believe the endorsement on the cheque is the prisoner's—I saw him on the following Saturday, after I had re<lb/>turned from the City about this affair—I said "What have you been doing? you ought to be ashamed of yourself for forging the name of Peckham and Co. on my cheque;" he said "It is all nonsense, every<lb/>thing is settled"—I gave him no authority to deduct 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was impertinent, and I went to the police-station with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not in difficulties—the prisoner did not arrange anything—I employed him to settle matters, but he did not do it—he attended to other business, and did as badly by it as in this—I had out-standing bills, and had to get them renewed—he paid 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Peckham—he arranged for the renewal of a bill for 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know that it was at the same time—interest would be charged if the bill was renewed—the prisoner would not have to pay it, but the interest would be added on to the renewed bill—the debt to Peckham and Co. was 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, the rest was for costs—the prisoner has signed my name to letters, but not with my authority—people might have answered him, but it was kept from me—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay a debt with, and he kept it—I know Ratcliffe—I never went to him in my life—the prisoner did not arrange matters with Ratcliffe for me—I know Massiter—I have had to pay 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through this affair—the prisoner has not arranged matters for me with Massiter, nor Nash, nor Odell—I never did business with Odell in my life—the prisoner did not tell me that he should be obliged to take cash to the solicitors, as they would not receive a cheque, it not being a legal tender—he never said to me that he could get no money from me, nor that he had lost four months over my business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> These two cheques for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are payable to Foskett, and they have been paid by my bankers.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 63, Warlock Road, St. Peter's Park, and am a traveller—on 4th September I was in the Skiddaw public-house with the prisoner and Mr. Stephens—Stephens asked Foskett to fill up a cheque for Perry and Co.'s debt—a cheque was filled up, which was not for the right amount, and another was drawn for about 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which Mr. Stephens signed; I could not swear positively to the amount—another cheque was written by Foskett for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and signed by Stephens—this, I believe, was payable to Foskett.</p>

I retained the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but gave him a receipt for 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he would bring the balance in a day or two—he did not bring it—on 22nd I wrote to Mr. Stephens—the amount was not paid, and I put in an execution for the balance—I did not communicate with Mr. Stephens personally—the cheque produced is not signed by any person authorised by Messrs. Maitland—Mr. Maitland signs and endorses all cheques—the elder Mr. Peckham is dead, and his son is never at the office—I have never seen Foskett write.</p>

About 12.40 a.m. on 6th October I heard cries of "Police!" in Tottenham Court Road—I ran across the road and went to the place, and saw Richardson struggling with Conway—he gave him into my custody for attempting to rob him and assaulting him—Moore was standing by—I went towards the station and Moore followed—Richardson told me that Conway's accomplice was walking on behind, and I took him in custody at the station—Richardson was under the influence of drink—he could walk, but staggered, and spoke father muddled—I said at the police-court he was drunk—he was not incapable—possibly a great deal of excitement attached to it—they were charged at the station—Richardson said he should charge them with assaulting him and attempting to rob him, and that Conway placed his hand in his left-hand trousers pocket—nothing was said by the inspector about locking the prosecutor up; he was not so drunk as to require it—they</p>

               <p>asked the inspector if the prosecutor was sober, and the inspector made no answer—the prisoners made no answer to the charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Conway.</hi> I did not hear the inspector caution the prosecutor—about half a dozen people were standing there, but no one ran to the prosecutor's assistance when I got up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Moore's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "I was walking behind the prisoner down Tottenham Court Road to the station. When I got to the station they charged me. I did not interfere in any way."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Moore's Defence.</hi> I walked to the police-station without knowing what it was; to see what was the matter. When I got there they took me. The policeman knows he did not see me do anything. The prosecutor. was drunk. He made two or three different statements. This is the first time in my life I have ever been locked up. I am a hard-working chap, and am quite innocent; God above knows that. I do not get my living by robbing people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Conway's Defence.</hi> I was walking along Tottenham Court Road when the prosecutor came out of a mews and bobbed up against me as I was crossing. I asked him to mind where he was bobbing to and to mind he did not fall down, and he turned round and took me by the collar and bawled out "Police," and two or three persons stopped and the police came up and said, "What is the matter?" He said, "I want to charge this fellow." He said, "What for?" The prosecutor said, "He tried to put his hand in my pocket," which I never did. The policeman said, "Have you lost anything? I see he is drunk," and he took me to the station, and Moore followed and they took him, what for I don't know. The prosecutor said, "I want to charge that man there." The inspector said, "Which man? there are two," and he turned round and saw two, thinking there was only one. The inspector said, "Mind what you are about, or we shall have to put you inside." He could not sign the charge sheet, and they locked us up. Why did not the prosecutor charge Moore at the time he charged me? He was drunk, and he wanted to charge somebody. Nobody interfered with him, I assure you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head cashier of the Southwark branch of the London Joint Stock Bank—I know the prisoner by the name of John Watson—on 31st January, 1878, he opened an account in that name at our branch—he was a stranger; he gave a respectable reference—he described himself as a diamond dealer, of 71, Clapham Road—I produce the signature book which he signed on opening the account—he opened it by a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 1st February he paid in 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 4th 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. twice, and on 8th 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the debit side there is 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a stamped cheque-book containing 50 cheques, on the 4th February, Critchley 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on the 6th, circular notes, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 12th, Murray 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 19th, Hugal 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the last debit; that was paid in the ordinary way—the account was closed by a debit to some solicitors—there was a cheque for 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 23rd February in favour of Charles Cherwood, and endorsed Charles Cherwood—that would, if paid, have overdrawn the account 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the amount of the stamped cheque-book, but I returned it—it came from Mr. Kino through our head office—I paw the prisoner from time to time—on 4th February he applied to me for 10 circular notes of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, as he was going on the Continent—I applied to the head office for them, as we did not issue them—I got them, and also a letter of indication—I have no means of identifying these produced; they are 10 circular notes in favour of John Watson for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, No. 16615, dated 6th February, 1878—the prisoner's endorsement "John Watson" is on each of them—the letter of indication I gave him corresponded with the circular notes; it would be in the same form as Mr. Young's, and would have on it the number that was on the notes, 16615—I afterwards received this letter</p>

               <p>from the prisoner, dated 6th February, 71, Clapham Road, acknowledg<lb/>ing the receipt of the notes—I afterwards heard of the letter of indication haying been improperly used, and I wrote a letter to the prisoner, asking him to call at the bank—I received this answer. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Paris, Monday 13th, 1878. Dear Sir,—Your communication left with my wife reached me to-day. Business of moment calls me to Marseilles, and I leave here this p.m. I wish to certify you at the same time that I have had the misfortune to lose my pocket-book containing your letter of indication. I believe it to have been stolen from me; therefore I shall call on you immediately on my return to London. Yours truly, John Watson.") The envelope to that letter had the Paris post-mark on it—he was after<lb/>wards written to again, but we got no answer—on 20th February he returned, through the post, the 40 unused cheques—I believe they came from Paris—as we did not pay the 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque the balance was left at our bank until Cherwood's trial—Watson has never had it, or ever applied for it—we never saw or heard anything more of him until July last, when I saw him in custody at the Mansion House.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">A Prisoner</hi>). I am now undergoing a sentence of 10 years' penal servitude—I was tried in this Court in May 1878, for alter<lb/>ing a banker's cheque, and also for forging one of these 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. circular notes—I was convicted upon both indictments—I first became acquainted with the prisoner about the middle of January 1878—I knew him by the name of Hugh Murray—I was introduced to him in Regent Street in the Cafe Royal—some time after he spoke to me about some circular notes—I was not doing anything for a living at that time, it was somewhere about from the 20th to the 25th January; he said "Can you use some circular notes? if so, they will help to pay our expenses"—he said he got them as the passengers were leaving the steamer at Boulogne—I said I could do so it I had a letter of indication—he said he would obtain one for me—he said "You must allow me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for the 10 notes of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., each"—I agreed to that—I think he showed me the notes either that day or within a day or so; these produced are notes of the same amount—the name of Edward Austin was written on the face of them when he first showed them to me—in a day or so I had some further conversation with him about the notes—he said "I am unable to obtain the letter of indica<lb/>tion where I expected to, and therefore I shall be obliged to open an ac<lb/>count myself at the bank, and get some circular notes, and the same letter of indication will do for both; but in that case I must be allowed 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in<lb/>stead of 30 for the notes, on account of the extra trouble and risk, and so on, for money employed to open an account"—I agreed to that also—he afterwards told me "I have made a large deposit at the London Joint Stock Bank, and I will obtain the circular notes and letter of indication as soon as I can safely do so"—about 5th or 6th February I learnt from him that he had done so—I went with him one day to the bank in South-wark—I</p>

               <p>remained outside, I did not go in—I don't think he told me what he was going in for—ho afterwards told me that ho had got the 10 circu<lb/>lar notes and the letter of indication; I did not see them in London—we arranged to go to the Continent together, and he was to change the notes at the first place where there was a correspondent of the bank, and let me have the letter of indication for the purpose of altering the name, so that I could use it for the other 10 notes—we arranged to go to the Grand Hotel in Paris, and I was to be Edward Austin—I directed an envelope to the Grand Hotel, and it was understood between us that he was to send a telegram to the manager stating that his brother Edward Austin would arrive at the Grand Hotel on the day following from Nice, and requesting him to show him any favour that laid in his power—he told me that he had sent the telegram, and when I arrived there I found that it had been sent—I went to Cannon Street Station and I and the prisoner left London together; I think that was on the Wednesday, 6th February, 1878—the prisoner had the ten notes and the letter of indication in his possession, I had nothing at all in my possession—we went over to Boulogne by the morning mail—I suppose the prisoner cashed the 10 circular notes there—he left me for that purpose, and when he returned he told me that he had done so—I don't know that he said anything about the letter of indication at that particular time—we went on by the train to Paris and went to the Grand Hotel, he gave me the letter of indication on the way there; it then had on it the name of John Watson, and at the hotel I took out the name of John Watson and inserted that of Edward Austin instead—I did that with chemicals—the prisoner was not present when I did it, I saw him shortly afterwards—he asked if it was ready, I said that it was not dry—he afterwards gave mo two of the cir<lb/>cular notes in the name of Edward Austin and he showed me where the cashier's office was at the Grand Hotel, and told me I could get them cashed there—I noticed that there was some discrepancy between the number on the notes and the number on the letter of indication, but what it was I cannot remember, it is so long ago—I took the two notes down to the cashier and obtained the money for them—I showed the letter of indication—I could not tell which of the notes I changed, they were like these—I gave the money to the prisoner—after cashing those I cashed two more, the prisoner gave them to me—I cashed those at the Louvre, and gave the money to the prisoner—I then cashed six more at the Grand, I got those from the prisoner and gave him the money; these eight are all endorsed by me in the name of Edward Austin—I endorsed them before I cashed them—I said something to the prisoner about the discrepancy in the numbers, I don't remember now what I said—I don't think airy of the notes bore the sumo number as the letter of indcation, I noticed that in Paris—all I did was to alter the name in the letter of indication from John Watson to Edward Austin; the notes I cashed were in the same state as when I received them from the prisoner—I cannot say how much money was given to me in Paris, it was a small amount—I paid my bill and left the hotel; I cashed the last note at 10 o'clock at night, and left the hotel next morning; at least I slept at the Louvre that night—the prisoner and I came away from Paris together and went to Brussels—I left him on the Continent, either at Antwerp or Brussels, I am not certain which; about 11th or 12th February; we were together part of the time abroad, not all the time—I came back to London about 13th or 14th February—I saw</p>

               <p>the prisoner again on the Saturday following, the 16th, at a cafe at the West End, by appointment—he said "I have received a letter from the bank authorities which shows they have some suspicion of me," or something to that effect—there were other people there, mutual friends of ours; and one of them advised him to send a letter to the bank authorities purporting to come from Paris, to send it to Paris and have it mailed, saying that he had lost his letter of indication—I advised him to go to the bank and see them, and have a talk with them, the same as any business man would do—he did not seem inclined to do so, he agreed to follow the other advice; I did not see the letter he wrote—I saw him again on the follow<lb/>ing Wednesday, when I wanted him to pay me the money that was due to me—he did not pay me—I don't know what he said—I saw him again on Saturday, 23rd February; he then gave me some money, I don't remem<lb/>ber how much—it was a small sum, and he then also gave me this cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw him write it; he said that he had still a large amount of money in this bank, I think he said?270, and that I ought to assist him in getting it out—I objected to receiving any cheque; I told him that I did not give him any cheque, and that I did not like to take one from him, I wanted the money—after some time he persuaded me to take the cheque, and I finally did so; it was an open cheque on his bank in my favour—I gave it to Kino, a tailor in the Borough Road, where I bought some clothes—I did not get the change for it; I left it with him to cash, and I was to get the change at some future time—I afterwards sent for it, and the cheque was brought back to me marked N. S.; payment had been refused—I had endorsed it when I gave it to Kino—I kept it in my pocket, and when I was arrested on 2nd March I gave it to the officer who arrested me—I never saw the prisoner afterwards; I don't know what became of him—I had not seen him at all between 23rd February and 2nd March—I saw him on 24th February; I said nothing to him that I know of having any bearing on this case—I destroyed the letter of indica<lb/>tion that I had altered after the last note was cashed—I have been to the prisoner's house, 71, Clapham Road; it was a private house—I don't know that he has a wife; a woman was there living with him.</p>

I want to see you"—he said "All right, I have got some cash for you; wait here, I will take a cab and come back to you"—he went away in a cab and returned in about a quarter of an hour and paid me, and I got into the train to go to Paris—he gave me 2,000 franc notes, that would be 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English money—I asked him how lone he was going to stay—he said he was looking for a school for his children, and was going to Brussels—I know he had some family—I have seen his wife—Cherwood was not with me at this time at Boulogne, I never saw him till I saw him here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cashier of the Magazin du Louvre only receives notes which we get—he does not take credit notes from the persons because he does not know them and we do—I cashed this note for a man coming to the hotel for the first time because I thought the manager knew him—the Magazin do Louvre would not do the same because it is a rule not to do so—I was then clerk on night duty—I cashed notes for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but cannot say whether it was two notes of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; it may have been—as he had taken a room at the hotel I cashed them without his showing me the letter of indication, but when I gave him his room I asked him to show it to me, and he did so—these two notes bear the stamp of my office and the name of the cashier, Testie, but I cannot say that they are the two which I cashed—I never saw him again after he went up to bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 7, Monmouth Road, and am now the proprietor of a licensed billiard-room there—up to the end of March this year it was carried on as a limited company, duly registered in pursuance of the Joint Stock Companies Acts—the club was formed in March, 1877—they were large premises—it was closed when I took it; it had never been opened; I believe it was built for a public-house—I was the manager of the institution during the time it continued a limited</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188010180059"/>
               <p>company—I was the holder of 35 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shares, 30 in the first place and five afterwards, fully paid up—I furnished the money and laid it out for fitting up the club, for and on behalf of the company; the capital was not sufficient—I expended in the first instance 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., altogether over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as the thing went on and the requirements became more—my attention was called to an article in the <hi rend="italic">Bayswater Chronicle</hi> of 15th March, 1879, commencing, "But there are one or two so-called clubs in Bayswater of the very worst kind;" it refers to my club—my attention was also called to further numbers of 5th April, 17th May, 24th May, and 31st May, 1879; also to 24th January and 3rd April, 1880—in my opinion those articles refer to me and to the management of the club. (<hi rend="italic">These articles in general terms described the club as a gambling hell, where play was carried on to a late hour and also on Sundays, and that it was an institu<lb/>tion most pernicious to the neighbourhood.</hi>) The club was closed on 31st March; the effect of these articles was such that members ceased to come—in the previous two years, up to 15th March, the club was going on favourably, and I believe it would ultimately have been a paying concern, but from March, 1879, new members became fewer and old members fell off—I attribute that to these articles, damaging myself and the place generally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Mr. Rice some years, perhaps 10 or 12—he is clerk to Mr. Johnson the solicitor—he witnessed the signatures when the club was started—before going into this speculation I did not inquire whether a licence had been refused; I did not consult Mr. Johnson then, I did Mr. Rice; I had heard that a licence had been refused, but I did not know anything of the facts—I have sometimes been in the habit of attending races and betting; that was not my occupation up to the formation of this company—I never made a book at that time—I had money; I had previously been in business, but I had no occupation at that time; I lived private—the persons forming the company were myself; my brother Albert Copping, who had 10 shares; Richard Cutler, of Barnes, a gentleman, one share; Henry Batten, a gentleman living privately, two shares; William Ellison, gentleman, 42, Park Road, one share; George Henry Bacchus, one share; and Charles Barnett, 41, High Street, one share—that was all the com<lb/>pany; seven, holding 51 shares—there were never any more—there was no banking account, not collectively; I had one—I kept a receipt and counterfoil book—there were subscribers as distinguished from share<lb/>holders—this is one of the books; this is only this year's; there was another which was filled up—I don't know what has become of that; the place was closed, and it was mislaid—this is the only one I have—I did not take any dividend on my 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not pay any dividend—the original subscription was intended to be a guinea—I afterwards reduced it to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 7th March, 1878—it was not brought down to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the purpose of getting Whitley's shop boys in—the article of 15th March is not distinctly personal to myself, nor that of 5th April—ecarte was played at the club; bets were made on the players—I have seen gold on the table—I could not say that I have seen notes—play has been carried on all night, a few times—there was a fine for late hours—I have not gone round with a plate called "Kitty" at 2 o'clock in the morning requesting contributions, more from winners than losers—I have said "Gentlemen, the time is getting late, you will have to pay the fine for late hours," with a view of inducing them to go—they went on playing after paying the</p>

               <p>fine—drinks were sold—I don't know that the plate was called "Kitty"—I did not call it so—I have heard them say "Here comes Kitty"—after that contribution I served drinks, and charged for them; very little champagne, beer and claret; not much grog, principally beer—the profits from the drinks were applied to the purposes of the club generally, rent and other purposes—my salary as secretary and manager was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I took that out of the takings; I had to live, with my wife and six children—my wife assisted me in the business—I make no complaint of the article on 10th May; it is untrue in a great measure; I don't mean totally untrue—there was billiard playing on Sundays for a few weeks; I could not say up to what hour—when they came in on Saturday night they did not stop the game as they would do now the place is licensed; they would beg to go on playing—I don't think they would play up to 11 o'clock on Sundays; we did not open till between 11 and 3 o'clock—ecarte and Nap was not played on Sunday nights—I strictly forbade it; I believe it was done on one or two occasions upstairs, not with my sanction—I don't know whether they played for money—I believe Nap was played for money—there were two billiard matches, and I believe the stakes were 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was between a gentleman belonging to the club and a member of another club; that was the only time I knew; it was a set match, quite a sensational affair—we had a rule that no game of chance was to be allowed—the directors were the committee of management—there was no screen put up to prevent people looking in—the windows were high, and the shutters shut on Sundays; I believe the entire article of the 17th May is copied from <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi>, and also that of the 24th—I had no money to proceed against <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi>, or else I very likely should have done the same as I have in this case; I took counsel with my friends, and they said "Let it be, it will only be a nine days' wonder; it won't injure you in any way," and that was how we allowed it to go on; no doubt Mr. Labouchere could pay any damages; ho is a very rich man, they tell me—the paragraph headed "Dissipated Bayswater" on 31st May is a very unfair thing; they have cut out all the favourable parts and put in the worst—I never gave any champagne to any sergeant of police—the police were never supplied with drinks gratis, either by me or to my knowledge—the account of the fracas is false; a dispute did occur, but nothing was said about cheating—it is true that on 21st May, 1879, at 4.20 a.m., Herman Qpponheim and Frederick Milray were charged with stealing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from the person of Richard Hutchinson at the club; but the man was not turned upside down, it was merely a dispute at the curd table; they were all three members of the club—I did not give Hutchinson 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to settle it, nor any money, or know of it being given him; the man was drunk, they were all more or less the worse for drink, they had been in town, and I begged the people not to play with him; he was a quarrelsome man—I took no stops to prevent the charge being heard before the Magistrate—I did not stop one of Mr. White ley's young man as he was going to the Court to give evidence, and tell him that I had given Hutchinson 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to stop the row, it is untrue—I never said that it was worth my while to give the money, as it would probably avoid having the club shut up—I don't know that Oppenheim did or did not give bills for card losses in the club, I have made one or two bets and sometimes played at ecarte and billiards with the members if no one else was there to play with them—I did not allow friends of members to order drink, prior to the first of these articles, we were very</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188010180061"/>
               <p>particular in that matter, there is a rule referring to it; there was a notice up from the commencement that members only were to pay—no appren<lb/>tices of Mr. Whiteley's came to the club that I know of; salesmen, about 30 I should think—5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not taken from them for membership, I gave them a receipt when they paid their subscription—I did not know any one coming to the club who had the name of <hi rend="italic">Barnacle</hi>, there was a man named Shelstone who was a member only for a few days, who committed suicide, he never lost 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is one of the libels we hare omitted to charge, there are several that we have omitted—I have had several disputes with a man named Barker; he is not a betting man, he kept a mantle warehouse—I did not employ Mr. Rice to settle with him—there was an account between us, a balance was struck, and I paid him 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in full of all demands—I said at the police-court, "My complaint is that the articles reflect on the committee of management, not on myself personally," that was to some of the articles, but I think that was qualified—I never spoke to Mr. Walker but once, on a matter of business, with reference to an advertisement about the opening of the club—since this case has been sent for trial, and since the plea of justification, I may have said, "Bother the case, I wish I had never taken it on," on account of the worry and bother and anxiety—I said, "It is out of my hands, I am not finding the money for it"—since the committal the club has been fined 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the Magistrate, and there was nothing to pay the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with; I do not think it has been paid to this day—I was fined 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. last Satur<lb/>day, as manager and director; I have not paid it—I have no money, through these articles ruining me; I had a good balance since 1877, but now I am out of means—I do not sue Mr. Labouchere, I wish I had money to have a go at him.</p>
               <p>

               <p>on the job, I suppose—I don't know what part of the work he was doing—I don't know whether all the workmen from the job went to this public-house—I have generally gone in there and had my pint; it was the nearest—I was working for Mr. Cole at park-paling fence—I don't know what work the prisoner was doing: I saw him with a shovel in his hand—we were talking together this evening for about 10 minutes—I really can't tell what I said to him or he to me; it was something about the work—I don't know that there were any other men there who were on the same job; I did not go before the Magistrate, I was away—I heard of the prisoner being taken—I had a bed at Mrs. Aplin's; I heard them talking about this affair; I told Mrs. Aplin that I was with the prisoner at the time, and told her to be very careful what she said, as she might be putting away the young man—I said I thought he could not be the man, because I had been with him so long; I said that the same night—I understood that she thought he was the man—I did not go before the Magistrate as a witness because I went away from there on the Monday, and went to work at Bromley for Mr. Cole; I did not think there was anything very important about it—I did not know what he was charged with—I don't suppose I had half a dozen words with Mrs. Aplin all the time I was stopping there—I did not know the case was so serious as it has turned out to be; if I had been sent for I should have gone, but I had a letter from my employer to go to Bromley to work—I had reason to think the woman might be doing him an injustice by fixing him with a serious charge, but my business called me away—I could only give evidence that the man was with me at the bar at the time; of course, that made me doubt if the woman's evidence was correct—for two or three days after this fire I was employed at Chertsey, about five minutes' walk from the Holly Tree; I don't know how far it was from where the Magistrate was sitting.</p>

               <p>known Mr. Chatterson for some time—on 13th September, 1879, the prisoner came to my office to me and arranged to pay another Mr. Chatterton, an advertising agent, the final dividend—I thought he came from the office and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay to Mr. Chatterton—on 27th September he came again and asked me for a small sum to pay other outstanding dividends—I do not remember any reference being made to the previous occasion—the amount was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay Mr. Kish—he said he had met Mr. Kish at one of the police-courts, and that he had told Mr. Kish he had some money for him, which Mr. Kish was glad of, and I gave him the money for that purpose, believing his statement—on 30th September I gave him a cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the balance which was at the bank to settle up with the outstanding creditors—on 27th, 28th, and 29th November he came again—he asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the last occasion—I do not recollect the dates, but these two receipts were written in my office—when he asked for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he told me his wages were not due at Mr. Chatterton's office till the following Monday, he was paid monthly, and he was pressed for cash—I was under the im<lb/>pression that he was in Mr. Chatterton's employment or I should not have lent him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I eventually heard that he had left Mr. Chatterton's employment; then inquiries were made; in the result I received this letter dated 21st December, 1879. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had received Mr. Prince's letter of the</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th, which had been forwarded to him at</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">Draycott Terrace, Shane Street; that he had been unwell or would have seen Mr. Ind before, but would see him on Tuesday and produce Mr. Kish's receipt, so that Mr. Prince should not be a loser, and would write with appointment.</hi>) I had written to his office believing he was there—on 29th December, Mr. Ind, one of Mr. Chatterton's clerks, and I saw the prisoner at the Monster public-house—I there told him I had discovered the amounts had not been paid—he admitted he had not paid the smaller amounts, but stated he had paid Mr. Kish, and the receipt would be found in the bank book in his desk at Mr. Chatterton's office—I have not seen the prisoner again till recently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> The money was not Mr. Chatterton's, except as my solicitor—I was anxious to get the outstanding matters cleared up, and I might have said I would give you something—you have come to me in the evening after office hours—Mr. Chatterton has paid no dividends—I have always paid the creditors—I gave you a cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not remember telling you to keep 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it; I would not say I did not—I did not consider you were working for me independently of the office, but as Mr. Chatterton's clerk—I have said I had nothing for my trouble as trustee, nor did I—I did not complain that I should be out of pocket by the transactions, except in loss of time, not in money—I said I had not been paid even for postage stamps—you suggested you should should hold Pyman's account till applied for—he had gone away—I never suggested that you should give a receipt for it as no one would claim it—I did not tell Mr. Ind so at the Monster that I remember—I might have mentioned other bankruptcy matters to you in conversation—I do not know that you mentioned Mr. Chatterton's name when you came—you did not tell me you had met with an accident at football, but that your salary was not due till Wednesday, and I lent you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you said at the Monster you were sorry for behaving so badly to me—very likely you promised to refund the</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of Mr. Chatterton's clerks; Holt was under Pearce and me; I was cashier in November, 1879—I supplied the clerks with money and required them to keep an account in a small book in which they entered moneys their received, and the payments opposite—Pearce first had charge of Lamb's bankruptcy, and then it was transferred to me and was in my hands in November, 1879, for the purpose of making up the accounts—a first dividend had been paid to nearly the whole of the creditors—there was a second dividend to pay; Mr. Prince paid them—Holt came in January, 1879—we prepared a draft account and I asked Holt to see Mr. Prince for the purpose of proving it—he had no authority to receive any money from Mr. Prince—if Mr. Prince paid him any it was his duty to enter it in his cash book, and then it would have been entered into the journal to show the payments—no account was rendered to me of the receipts of moneys from Mr. Prince—I have looked through the journal and there are no entries—the prisoner never told me he had received those moneys—there is no such entry in his cash book—Mr. Chatterton did not personally attend to the matter, he scarcely knew of the transactions—I remember the interview at the Monster between Prince, Holt, and myself—Mr. Prince there asked Holt why he bad not paid the dividends, and he admitted having received them with the exception of Mr. Kish's, which he stated had been paid, and the receipt was in the pass-book in his desk at the office, and he asked me if I would meet him at 9 o'clock at the office and he would give it me—he did not come—the pass-book was not found at the office; this is the pass<lb/>book—Mr. Kish's receipt is not in it—the prisoner was paid a weekly salary, not monthly—no salary was due to him on Wednesday, 29th November—by the books it appears he was paid up to 22nd November—on the following Tuesday he was discharged for being absent on the Monday; he came at 11.55 on the Tuesday—he had been cautioned—no meeting was afterwards effected between me and the prisoner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Defence.</hi> This money was due from Prince, and is a matter of account between him and me. It has nothing to do with Chatterton, to whom I was clerk. Prince promised to remunerate me for what I did, as it was done for him and not for Chatterton; the understanding between Prince and me about Pyman's dividend, was that I was to put in the receipts and pass them through, and we were to divide the money between us, as Pyman had gone abroad. When I borrowed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Prince I was out of Chatterton's employ, and I did not tell Prince that I was in it. I advised Prince as a friend, with reference to several estates, but I never mentioned Chatterton's name, and none of the moneys were received from him, and I never signed the receipts <hi rend="italic">per, pro</hi>, or otherwise, for Chatterton. Prince complained to me, and I said I was sorry for the way I had used him, but would pay him back. These proceedings have been taken against me because I said some<lb/>thing about Chatterton's private affairs, and my report of it was sent to his office. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Ind here stated he had teen a report at Mr. Chatterton's office in the prisoner's writing about a week ago, but he did not know when it came. Mr. Pearce stated it was received about two days before the prisoner's arrest.</hi>) When I was brought before the Magistrate no evidence was offered, and I was discharged on my own recognisances to appear on the following Tuesday. (<hi rend="italic">James Sanctuary here stated that this was the case, and that the prisoner appeared on hit recognisances.</hi>) When I appeared on the Tuesday I was charged with embezzling these and other moneys. The charges are all brought against me through spite. I dealt with Prince irrespective of Chatterton altogether.</p>
