I am a painter, of 12, Holland Street, Westminster—on the evening of 3rd June I went with a friend named Day into the George and Bull public-house, Orchard Street, Westminster, where I saw the four prisoners—soon after we got in our pot of beer was taken off the barrel on which it stood in the bar and I saw it in one of the prisoners' hands—I said,</p>

               <p>"That is my beer," and the answer was made, "It was quite a mistake"—the one who took the beer said that; I cannot say which—soon after that the prisoners got close round the entrance to the door, and we got up to leave—the soldier was first, and I was second, and Campbell pushed him back on my toes—I said, "That is my toe," in a joking sort of way—Campbell said, "You can get by as well as anybody else," and said something about throwing me out—Day turned round and said, "If you were outside you might not be so fast talking about throwing people out"—instantly there was a rush made by the four prisoners, and I received a blow from Campbell—I defended myself as well as I could—I found myself seized round the legs by a man who was on his knees, and I was thrown to the ground over the man's back and shoulders who was on the ground—I instantly felt hands feeling my pockets, and I said, "You won't find much there"—I scrambled to my feet in the best manner I could—when I got about 20 yards off I received a blow in the back of the neck, which felled me to the ground—I received a kick or two on the head and face, and became insensible; I also received kicks on the ribs, especially the right side—when I came to my senses I found myself at the hospital, where I remained from the Tuesday night till Saturday at dinner-time—I suffered much pain for the first three or four days—I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. taken from me—I can only swear to Campbell, but I swear they were all in the public-house and rushed out.</p>

Inwood and Co.m, the prosecutors—on 16th June prisoner came into the shop and told me he wanted goods for an advance note, which he showed me—I said, "You had better go to the City and see Mr. Campbell, my brother"—he said, "I will," and went away—he came back and asked if Mr. Inwood was in—I said, "No, he has gone away, but will be back in a little time if you will wait," but he said he could not, so I agreed to show him the goods, and he chose goods value 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—that is the note he gave me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave it to the cashier, and the goods were sent to the prisoner next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant—I have audited the books of Clark and Co. since 1872, also of Bunnett and Co. since 1874—I have known the prisoner since 1870; I was always on friendly terms with him—he left the employment on 28th February, 1878—after that I went into the accounts to make up a statement as to how he stood; he had a copy of it—after that there was a meeting on 28th March—the whole of the books were produced that were necessary, and we went very fully into them—the interview lasted, I think, four hours, and a balance was agreed and struck—I sent him a fair copy of the account, with a letter making an appointment to exchange cheques on the 30th—he did not in any way refer to these accounts that he is now charged with having embezzled—on 28th Mr. Taylor went to the bank to make inquiries—on the 30th I received this letter from the prisoner, and this on 3rd March. (<hi rend="italic">This called attention to certain errors in the account.</hi>) This letter of 2nd April is addressed to Mr. Clark (This stated that the balance due from him to the two firms was 698<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) At that time no reference was made to these three sums in question—I find a paying-in slip of 21st August, 1875, for 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Smith and Sons, dated July 28, 1875—I should say that cheque is in the handwriting of the prisoner—on 19th August, 1875, I find this entry, "F. Grafton, 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," in Bunnett's rough cash book; that indicates that F. Grafton's</p>

               <p>account was to be credited with that amount—there is no other entry on that page in his writing—he has had the benefit of that 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At that time I was accountant for both the businesses of Bunnett and Co. and Clark and Co.—I think the first balance-sheet I drew out of Bunnett and Co. was in 1874, Clark and Co. in 1872—Mr. Turner had been at Clark and Co.'s before me; I believe he had done one balance<lb/>sheet at Bunnett's; he received a larger salary than I did; he had about 80Z. per annum; I had 502. from Clark and Co.—I was examined at the police-court before Mr. Newton; there were nine or ten examinations—I presume Mr. Clark is here; I don't know—the 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the rough cash-book repre<lb/>sents a sum of money paid in to the company's credit at their bankers, and in the company's books it is credited to the prisoner in his own handwriting—that book is open in the company's office, and as the moneys come in they are entered to the names of the persons paying them in—this represents that sum as paid in by him to his own credit, and he had credit for it in the ledger; the ledger is here, it is entered to the account of F. Grafton, Esq.; the book-keeper, Mr. Johnson, gives him credit for it; it is his writing; it is entered from the rough cash-book, which is the foundation of all the entries that are made in the ledger—the sums of the firm and Mr. Grafton's money are not mixed together in this account—this is the journal which contains the whole of the entries belonging to the business of Bunnett and Co.; this represents that the 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid in the company's counting-house in money, and paid in afterwards to the company's banker; it is part of the total of the 406<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is nothing wrong in that particular item—it is the proceeds of amounts drawn by Clark and Co. to pay Smith's account—the notes have been traced—this 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not alluded to at the interview of 28th March—I did not allude, to it; I did not know of it at that time; I don't recollect that I ever knew of that item; there were so many things that we were finding out about that time, but to the best of my knowledge I was not aware of that item—I had not called Mr. Clark's attention to it, or my own—Mr. Johnson had spoken to me about that 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a long time before; but I had no reason to recollect it as a matter connected with Mr. Grafton—Johnson did not tell me that he had omitted to debit Mr. Grafton with that amount; he mentioned it during the auditing while I was checking the books, about the time the entry was originally made, or a few months afterwards; it would be some time during the year; some question turned up about an amount of 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. charged through. Peck's account—Johnson said there was something about an item of Smith's in Peck's account; I am speaking of some years ago—Johnson was then book<lb/>keeper to Clark and Co.—he was sent down to Bunnett by Grafton; after the regular book-keeper of Bunnett had left the books were in arrear, and that is the reason some of the entries appear in his writing, this Amongst others—he never mentioned that he had omitted to debit Grafton's account with 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not say that Grafton had taken the money for his own use and that he had told him to debit him with it; he never hinted at such a thing—he said there was something about the second item of 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through Peck's account, and I said "If it is in Peck's account of course it will come through it, because if it has been a cheque it must show through the books of the firm;" that ended the matter—there was a private account of Grafton's in both firms; you have it there—Bunnett and Co. stood in the relation of bankers to Grafton in that account—the joint moneys of master</p>

               <p>and servant were not paid in to Bunnett and Co.'s account—the joint moneys of Grafton and Bunnett and Co. were paid into Bunnett and Co.'s bankers, the Deptford branch of the London and County—Clark and Co.'s moneys were never paid in to Bunnett's bank—Grafton had an account with Clark and Co., and also with Bunnett and Co., a drawing account, or a private banking account—he could draw moneys for himself from either account; he signed "Clark and Co." under a power of attorney, and he signed "Bunnett and Co." under a director's minute—as to the 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Johnson did not ex<lb/>plain to me the circumstances under which he was ordered to debit Grafton's account with it, and that he had forgotten to do it; if he had it would have been my duty to see Grafton then charged with it—I was at the police-court, and heard Johnson give his evidence—Grafton never posted anything in the ledger; it is very seldom that a manager does; it is the book-keeper's duty to do it—I believe a warrant was issued for Grafton's apprehension—I was not consulted about it—I did not know that it was issued at the time—he has been in the employment of this firm 25 years—Mr. Clark is his brother-in-law; he married his sister—I do not know whether Mr. Clark is to be called as a witness; I have not the conduct of the case; he is here—he has regularly sent to him every six months a private account—he takes the same part in the business now that he has done for some years past—Mr. Taylor is the manager now—I am secretary to Bunnett and Co., just as Grafton used to be—he was manager to Clark and Co. as well—I believe Mr. Newton, the Magistrate, wished this case to be referred, and it was referred; at least, it was intended to be—this order of reference (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Clark's writing. (This was dated 22nd May, 1878.) I know nothing of the contents of it; I have a general knowledge that it was arrived at—I am not aware that an action for wrongful dismissal has been brought against Mr. Clark—Mr. Turner was one of Mr. Grafton's sureties; he was bail for his appearance; I am not aware that he was surety for anything else—I can't say whether the Magistrate liberated Mr. Grafton on his own recognisances; the matter was arranged in a private room; I was not present—I understand that a second reference was suggested, that there was a dispute about the terms, and then a summons was issued; I only know it by hearsay—I know nothing about the power of attorney; my duties were confined simply to the figures and the books—I should say the signature to this power of attorney is Mr. Clark's—I believe Mr. Clark was taken ill in 1869; that was before my introduction, which was in 1872—Mr. Clark was examined before the Magistrate, I think, on one occasion—I understood that Mr. Grafton had unfettered discretion in the business (the power of attorney so stated), but I don't know anything of the nature of it; I never read it—in 1875 there was a balance to the prisoner's credit of 221<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with Clark and Co.; in 1876,161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and in 1877,108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid money in and drew money out as a matter of convenience—this was not an account for the business—he had the control of the business; Mr. Clark had unlimited confidence in him—he drew all the cheques in the name of Clark and Co., and he signed for Bunnett and Co. as secretary, and accepted all the bills—he could have drawn a cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Bunnett and Co., and had it debited to his account—the cheque for 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was drawn for the purpose of tendering to Smith and Son by Clark and Co.; Mr. Taylor tendered it—I know now that that cheque was cashed across the counter, and the money tendered; I should not know it at the time—I know now that Smith</p>

               <p>and Son refused the tender, and I heard that the bank-notes remained in Mr. Grafton's cash box; they were afterwards paid in to his account with Bunnett and Co.—if he had kept them they ought to have been debited to his account with Clark and Co.—I did not keep the books of Clark and Co. at that time; I only audited them; Mr. Johnson kept them—if he made a mistake in not debiting him it was his fault—the business of Clark and Co. is a very large and profitable one, amounting to some thousands, and Bunnett's also; they both make revolving shutters; they both belong virtually to Mr. Clark—the prisoner had not the entire management of both businesses; he was secretary to Bunnett and Co.; Mr. Taylor had the practical management, he was the sub-manager; the prisoner was nominally the manager, but Bunnett's took up so much of his time that he virtually did little at Clark's—I know of Grafton's dismissal by Clark on 28th February or 1st March—he had been to Paris—the business of Clark and Co. was to be made over to him and Mr. Taylor, and they began to manage it from 1st January in that sense—Grafton received the debts due to Clark and Co.—he only received the moneys accruing and belonging to the business credited after 1st January, 1878, as a matter of convenience, the business being virtually his—they were to pay by instalments—I do not know that Grafton actually paid 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Clark or at the bankers' for wages; I should say it was not so; he paid 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Garland, manager at the bank where the money would be paid in, is here—Grafton was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of pocket on making the final total balance of payments and receipts during the two months—he was credited with 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—ho drew 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. partly from Clark and Co., 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from one and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the other business, and he claimed that as his own money—the date of the agreement for sale of the business to Grafton and Taylor was 28th February, and not having been executed it expired—I heard of Mr. Barron visiting Grafton before the warrant was issued against him, but do not know—Barron was not sent by Mr. Clark, and did not say so—I have been to Grafton's house—he lived at the same house at the time of the inquiry and when the warrant was issued—I do not know whether Barron gave him notice of the warrant—the book-keeping in both businesses was in arrear—Mr. Stevens was book-keeper at Bunnett's, and went to New Zealand—I checked the books, but did not make them up—I made no inquiry about the 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or asked for any voucher; its going into the bank is a receipt for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I audited the accounts—I audit other people's accounts also—Bunnett and Co. had an account with the Dept<lb/>ford branch of the London and County Bank, and all accounts paid in by Grafton were paid into that account—he was credited with all the amounts he paid in his own name—as far as the bank was concerned ail moneys were paid in by Bunnett and Co. to their own credit—I am speaking of the ledger acconnt—all moneys received for the company were paid in to their credit at the London and County Bank, Deptford, and any accounts paid in. by Grafton to his own credit would so appear in this account—all sums paid in by him would be put down to his credit—if the books had been properly kept he ought to have been charged with all money he had received which belonged to Bunnett and Co., and the 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he received, and which, as appears by the paying-in slip, was paid into Bunnett and Co. on 19th August, 1875, would have been so charged—the grand total was 334<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., partly composed of 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and is credited in the books to Bunnett and Co.—the whole of the accounts are collected in this journal</p>

I should not at the next audit inquire for the receipts corresponding with the counterfoils in the cheque-book—the books and cheques are usually taken in audit as evidence—the cheques were drawn as to the debit of the drawing account of Alexander Clark—Mr. Clark had a copy of his account half-yearly—I did not ask for vouchers of each of the payments in the year at the last audit; the cheques are vouchers—the counterfoils were very irregular, many of them blank—they were not altered or interfered with or destroyed—I should say it was Grafton's duty to debit the 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. himself as soon as paid by Mr. Taylor—it was drawn payable to Smith and Son, and debited to them in their ledger account, they being creditors for the same amount.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Clark and Co.—Messrs. W. H. Smith and Co. did business for them in 1875, and in July, 1876, an account for 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent in to Clark and Co.—I had some conversation with Mr. Grafton, who drew a cheque for 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and directed me to cash it and tender the notes to Messrs. Rogerson and Ford, the solicitors to Messrs. Smith—I cashed the cheque at the Holborn branch of the London and County Bank, and received a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note (50827), dated March, 1875; two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes (41981 and 41982); one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note (25231), May 29, 1875, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I tendered those notes to Rogerson and Ford; they stamped some of them, but did not accept them, and I returned with the money to Mr. Grafton, handed it to him, and told him the result—he put them, in his cash-box and said that he would speak to Mr. Peck, the solicitor, about the matter, by whom I afterwards found the matter was settled, and this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., payable to Mr. Peck, was drawn by Mr. Grafton, on 10th August, 1875—my attention was afterwards drawn to the state of Smith's account in the books, and I said to Mr. Grafton, "Peck's account seems to show that he has paid this matter of Smith; what has become of the notes that I tendered to his solicitors?"—he said, I suppose Peck had them"—a communication was afterwards made to Mr. Peck and he came to the office—I spoke to him, and he rather warmly</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My position then was sub-manager—Mr. Grafton did pretty well what he liked—I have not succeeded him as secretary; I am in the same position as before, only instead of calling myself sub-manager I call myself manager—I am a director of Bunnett's now; I was not before—I presume I have been qualified; I hold one share—Mr. Clark did not give it to me, nor did I buy it—I hardly know whether it belongs to me—I dare say if you ask the solicitor to the company he will be able to give you an answer—if anybody attempted to take the share from me I should not resist; they could have it—it is not valueless—here is Grafton's account with Clark and Co.—it is a very large business—I do not collect the money, I take it from the collectors and hand it to Mr. Grafton, who pays it into the bank to the credit of Clark and Co.—perhaps on the whole there is an average turn-over of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year to Clark of business done—he had no banking account at Deptford; that was Bunnett and Co.'s account—the 1875 account is not one which was opened with Grafton; they are credited with their salaries here—there was a balance in his favour in 1875 of 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this balance, brought down, January 1, 1875, 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., was in favour of Mr. Grafton, I believe—this, "By cash 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," "By cash 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," is money paid by him—there is an entry to Grafton's credit with Clark and Co.—I believe one other clerk has an account like Mr. Grafton's; here is my own account, opened on 31st June, 1874—I had not the power to draw on this account; Mr. Grafton was the only person who had power to do so, under a power of attorney—here is another account of George Wilson, in 1873—my account is for my salary only—Mr. Johnson was the book-keeper; he left in 1877—there is a private account of Clark and Co.—Mr. Grafton drew every cheque that was required—he may have drawn for Mr. Clark's private account for Mr. Clark's private debts—I paid in 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Grafton's account in 1878 in reference to a proposed purchase of the business—those were the moneys which had been collected since January, 1878, of Clark and Co.—no formal agreement was drawn up, otherwise I should be in the possession of the business now with Mr. Grafton—Grafton was dismissed on 1st March, since when he has established himself in London and in Paris in the same business, a patent shutter manufactory—Mr. Clark is paralysed; the doctor said that he should not attend to business, and he generally referred every<lb/>thing to Mr. Grafton—the agreement between me and Mr. Grafton was given up at Marlborough Street Police-court, and I have destroyed it since—I do not know whether it was part of the terms of reference—I have not filed a bill in Equity—Mr. Clark did not ask me to destroy it; I had nothing to do with Mr. Clark—I destroyed it because there was no further use for it—Grafton's being prosecuted had nothing to do with it—I tore it up</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I produce Clark and Co's ledger of 1875—I find no entry on the counterfoils or a cheque of this date, but here is a blank counterfoil—Mr. Luckhurst's name is not here—the cheque appears in the ledger in an amount of 15,411<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the debit of Alex<lb/>ander Clark, it also appears in the cash-book and journal—the entry in the cash-book is, "1875, Sept 23rd, A. Clark, Esq., Luckhurst 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that is a debit to the prosecutor—from the cash-book it is entered into the journal, and forms part of the 15,411<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I should say that this "Luckhurst" on the cheque is in the writing of Mr. Ernest Grafton, the son—there is a debit to Mr. Grafton of 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if you add the balance that would give him a debit of 157<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of the year; in other words, there is a deficiency of 378<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he took the benefit of within the dates mentioned.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). Clark and Co. were in the habit of dealing with Mr. Eadon, of Holborn, an agent for the sale of springs for revolving shutters—the springs made by Eadon were supplied to Clark and Co., and invoices rendered to them; a three months' acceptance was then given for the amount—when springs were supplied it was necessary that they should be tempered or prepared in some way before they could be used,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300026"/>
               <p>and they were sent to the New Cross Manufactory; they were there tempered by Bunnett and Co., and afterwards delivered to Clark—this (produced) is an invoice signed by Eadon on 23rd September, 1874, for 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the price of a quantity of springs, for which this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the acceptance at five months due on 18th January, 1875—the signature to the acceptance is Eadon's writing, but the acceptance itself in the name of Clark is Grafton's writing; that has been duly honoured—Eadon had nothing to do with Bunnett and Co. as far as I know; that 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was a transaction of Clark and Co. pure and simple, and not of Bunnett and Co.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). I produce the books of Clark and Co.—there is in them an acceptance of Eadon's invoice of September 23rd, 1874, for 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; if it had appeared at that time with "Clark and Co." struck out and "Bunnett and Co." put in, it would not have appeared in Clark and Co.'s books at all—if it had originally been "Bunnett and Co." it would never have got into Clark and Co.'s books—I have an entry of a bill on 21st June, 1875, by Clark and Co.—that would not have been accepted by Clark and Co. if it was an invoice to Bunnett and Co.—Bunnett and Co. are debited with it—G. A. Eadon is credited with springs sold, 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in Bunnett and Co.'s books; the entry is in Mr. Johnson the bookkeeper's writing, who would make it from the invoice, assuming that "Clark and Co." had been struck out and "Bunnett and Co." put in—there is a very faint pencil entry in the ledger under the heading, "G. A. Eadon, December 24th, by goods 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." and that is deducted from the 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Bunnett and Co.'s book, leaving 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that is the amount of cash that has been paid—that pencil entry, I should pay, is in Grafton's writing—I should think it got rubbed out when the ledger was cleared up—there is no other account of Eadon's in Bunnett's books; the account was opened</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300027"/>
               <p>for that transaction alone—I say that the pencil marks are in Grafton's writing, but if you take a cheque and compare it you can judge for yourself—the entry ought not to have had any existence in Bunnett's books, but Bunnett is debited with it thus: "1875, London and County Bank, January, 251.; May 14th, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; August 12th, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 1876, August 22nd, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," making a total of 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the counterfoil of Bunnett and Co.'s cheque-book I find, "January 5th, 1875, Eadon, steel, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" that corresponds with the entry in the ledger of the same date—we cannot find that counterfoil or the two next, but we have the cheques; one is May 14th, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I find a counterfoil of the fourth cheque, which is "Eadon, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." which I say is in Mr. Grafton's writing—that is for blind tick or ticking, but it is blotted—the "Eadon" is, I say, in Mr. Grafton's writing—Eadon lived in Sheffield, but he had an office in Thavies Inn—the two cheques payable to bearer do not bear Eadon's endorsement—the first cheque, January, 1875, is payable to order, and bears Eadon's endorsement—the acceptance is dated January 18th—I know Eadon's signature—he is in Australia, but I heard from him a few days ago—this is the original cheque; it is drawn by G. A. Eadon for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the London and South-Western Bank, January, 1875, payable to Frederick Grafton, Esq., or order, and the private account of Frederick Grafton is credited with the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. goes into the bank, and afterwards Grafton takes credit for it for his private account—Bunnett is there debited with the whole amount of 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as well as Clark and Co.; the amount is paid twice over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot say in whoso writing the crossing of the cheque is, as it is only two straight lines—Grafton was not my master—an auditor takes a professional fee, but a servant receives a salary and attends at regular hours—I receive my fee half-yearly—you do not offend me by calling me a servant—Mr. Grafton drew the cheques with which I was paid—I do not know that Mr. Grafton sometimes drew cheques for a trades<lb/>man, and actually cashed them for him, or that he drew cheques for Mr. Clark and cashed them for him—I did not know that the 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was one of the sums referred to arbitration—the accounts referred to arbitration were made out by me; I will correct myself; it is difficult to deal with a mass of figures—I do not know that Mr. Eadon supplies steel to Bunnett and Co.—all the cheques I produce, and the invoices and all the entries I myself found out there, are here in Court; they were, I presume, left by Mr. Grafton; it is entered in the invoice-book copied from the altered invoice—the books are kept at Queen Street, but the steel was received at New Cross—the steel was entered from Clark and Co.'s statement, and not from the invoice—both firms have paid for the same goods—in Bunnett's invoice-book or journal there is an entry of Eadon's supply of goods to them, and in Clark and Co.'s books also—I have heard of such a thing as a duplicate order for goods—I never heard that Grafton had lent 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to to Eadon—this 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque is first charged as a payment to Eadon, and after as a payment by Grafton to his own credit—anybody as acute as me would not see it in a moment; I could not see it in the books—I audited the books in 1875 for both firms—I did not see the invoices or look at the counterfoils, or ask for the receipts; I accepted the books as evidence—I call that an and it; if I had wanted an explanation I should have asked the bookkeeper, and if he had not explained I should have gone to Grafton for it—in auditing accounts I do not ask for receipts or vouchers; cheques are</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300028"/>
               <p>vouchers—I have not always asked for vouchers since this, but I have sometimes, and I sometimes did then; in this instance I did not—had I asked for receipts and they were not produced I should not have passed the audit, as probably these things would have been disclosed or explained—I cannot give an opinion as to whether Grafton's mouth would not have been closed if I had inquired further into the matter—he would have been called upon for an explanation by Clark—"blind tick" is known in the trade that would be an intelligible expression—I cannot produce the counterfoils of the other two 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheques.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Eadon was paid by means of those four cheques, and that closed the account—I find in Clark and Co.'s books a similar account, a credit to Eadon of 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for goods, on December 23, 1876, so that unless goods to that amount were delivered to Clark and Co., and another lot of goods to that amount to Bunnett's, that account must be entered twice over, and paid twice over—the entry is, "1875, bill due 21st Jan., 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—there is, I believe, no entry of the weight of the goods—on the invoice altered from Clark and Co. to Bunnett and Co., in Grafton's writing, the words over the stamp, "Received by cash on account 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," are in Eadon's writing—from this it appears that before the acceptance was given Eadon received in cash 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance, and here is a cheque in Jan. for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Grafton, Esq.—if that was a repayment of the cash advanced on the 25th the account would be squared—the acceptance of the 15th was given for the full amount, and if money had been paid in advance that would make it straight—this cheque being payable to Grafton, if he had advanced the money himself it would be quite proper to carry it to his private account—Bunnett and Co. are credited with the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Eadon is debited—these three cheques to Eadon, payable on account of Bunnett and Co., limited, would lead me to believe that the amount was discharged, and when I audited the books I assumed that it was all correct—the books show a credit to Eadon of 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., discharged by Bunnett and Co. in that way—on this statement for the goods made out against Clark and Co., dated Jan. 18, 1875, the words at the foot, "By acceptance at five months, G. A. Eadon," are Mr. Eadon's writing—I should call the acceptance a receipt—I find no separate receipt—when an account is discharged by cheque it is usual to get a receipt in full when the last cheque is given—in a case like this loose receipts might be given—it is a very general custom in business to send in statements of accounts. (<hi rend="italic">A paper was fare handed to the Jury in which the word "cheque" had been altered to "cheques"</hi>) There is no cheque of the same date preceding that—on the face of it there appear to have been two descriptions of the same amount on the same day with the two firms—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Bunnett and Co.'s; it purports to be "Goods received from and on account of Clark and Co."—it is in the store-keeper's writing at the works.</p>

I have had great experience in testing handwriting—I have seen this bundle of cheques—to the best of my belief the endorsement on the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque is not in the same handwriting as the one for 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the formation of the letter "A" on the cheque seems to be completely misunder<lb/>stood by the person who wrote it—Mr. Clark invariably forms his capital letter "A" by a single operation of the pen; that is he crosses it with, the same opera<lb/>tion, forming a loop in the middle—in this signature the crossing of the "A." is a ring made by itself independently by a separate operation of the pen—the "a" of "Clark" in the signature of the cheque for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is formed by a combination of the letter "e" and the letter "i"—the common mode of forming the letter "a" is to join it to the next letter preceding it; but in this instance the "e" portion is very plainly formed, very deliberately formed, and stands by itself disconnected from the "i" portion, and very unlike any instances of the genuine signatures—then the "r" of "Clark" is connected with the "k" by an upstroke taken from the bottom of the "r"—the formation of the "r" is on a different principle to that in use by Mr. Clark—then the "k" is unlike—those are the principal reasons except this, the signature inclines rather more upwards than Mr. Clark's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was perfectly ready to go on with the arbitration at that time if Mr. Lewis would have done so—I know that in October, when they refused to go on with the arbitration, Mr. Lewis issued an action against Mr. Clark for malicious prosecution—on the renewed proceedings there was a summons, and then we went into a great number of cases, and the Magis<lb/>trate finally dismissed the summons without giving any reason whatever—he pulled up very abruptly and said, "Is that all?" and then he said, "I dismiss the summons"—Mr. Lewis made a very long and able speech—we called Mr. Chabot, but the Magistrate said "Why do you call him? You had better call him on the trial"—and he said that Mr. Clark's denial was quite sufficient.</p>

               <p>Magistrate—I have heard the documents read—the counsel for the prosecu<lb/>tion had opened their case before the documents were executed—Mr. Wontner had suggested to the Magistrate that the prosecution consisted not only of Smith's case, but of other cases, amounting to about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and thereupon the case proceeded, and after some witnesses were called simply to prove formal evidence, and Mr. Taylor was partly cross-examined by me, and the circumstances were stated as to the cross accounts in this matter, it was suggested that this was not a case for a Criminal Court at all—with reference to Mr. Grafton's irregularities after 30 years' service it was suggested that if we could not account for any balance that might be due by him we should be prepared to pay them, but he declined to be made responsible, as the errors had arisen from bad book-keeping, and he was the victim of it—after one or two meetings it was finally arranged, and terms were agreed to, and an order of reference; and in addition Mr. Grafton was called upon to sign an apology for the errors in book-keeping—he absolutely refused, and said he would sooner the case should go on and be investigated by a Magistrate—this was stated in Court, and that the errors in book<lb/>keeping would not have occurred if the books had been properly audited, and that the clerk had brought him into this position—thereupon the matter was left to the Magistrate upon Mr. Wontner giving the Magistrate the reason why he refused to sign the apology—the deed of reference expired on 30th June—I was perfectly ready and offered Mr. Renshaw to enter into a fresh agreement of reference—Mr. Grafton was perfectly prepared to deposit any sum of money for which he might be found liable—a dispute arose between Mr. Renshaw and myself—then I complained to Mr. Renshaw's clerk that Mr. Clark had said he would ruin Grafton if it cost him 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; so Grafton informed me, and I said, "Mr. Grafton declines to enter into any renewed agreement except it bears the date of the original agreement"—an attempt was made to get a new agreement but it failed, and then they threatened me again with the Marlborough Street Police-court—the Magis<lb/>trate suggested that I and Mr. Wontner should attend before him, and then he suggested that the matter should go to reference—I consented to do so—it did not go to reference—they stood out to make Grafton liable for the lost reference, which arose from their own fault, and those terms were not agreed to, those were the main reasons why the second reference went off, and then in fifteen months they summoned Grafton up again to Marl<lb/>borough Street Police-court—the Magistrate, I think, for ten days went into the case and dismissed the summons, and stated he did not believe any Jury would convict Mr. Grafton of fraud in such a case, and that it was stated in Mr. Grantham's presence—I swear every case was gone into except Landrier'a.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of 57, Gracechurch Street, and was for many years employed to audit the accounts of Clark and Co., which I did twice a year, June and December, and was assisted by the various clerks, if required—every month it was our duty, first, to check the cash with the cheques and rough cash book, and with the banker's book, to see that all the cash received had been paid in—half-yearly we checked the cheques with the receipts and vouchers appertaining thereto—there was a</p>

               <p>file of papers, receipts, and invoices, and if they were not found we had a list made of the deficient receipts, or the deficient vouchers, and they were investigated; I sometimes applied to Mr. Grafton for that purpose—to take the vouchers and books as correct, without verifying them, would be a very imperfect audit indeed—I have been in Court during the conduct of this trial—I communicated either with Mr. Clark or with Mr. Grafton during the time I acted as auditor—I received every assistance from Mr. Grafton in relation to any cheques which were considered doubtful as business cheques—Mr. Grafton had a private account, as also had Mr. Clark, and I was in the habit of speaking to both of them in relation to their private accounts.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Clark and Co., and also of Bunnett and Co.—in reality they were one firm—I was in Clark's service eight and a half years—I saw there was no prospect of my salary increasing, and as chance put a better situation in my way I took it, and left Clark's at the end of March, 1877—I went into the service of Brown and Co., 90, Cannon Street, and am there now—I remember an item of 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in respect of which I discovered an error—to the best of my recollection it was in March, 1877, just before I left—I discovered it through an act of Mr. Peck's, the solicitor at that time—I mentioned it to Mr. Godwin and to Mr. Taylor, who tendered the notes—he told me he had returned the notes to Mr. Grafton—I did not see Mr. Grafton for some time—before I saw him I saw Mr. Peck, the solicitor, and I challenged him about it, and he disclaimed having had the money twice—while we were speaking Mr. Clark came into the room and said, "What is all this about?"—"Oh," I said in a bantering sort of way, "it is only Mr. Peck, who has had the money twice to settle Smith's account"—it was only a joke; I did not intend or mean it—after<lb/>wards, when I found Mr. Grafton had really had the money, I pointed it out to him—he said, "Oh, you know what to do"—he did not seem very pleased—he meant I was to debit his account with the amount—it was never debited; I intended to debit it, but the books were not closed—it would be one of the last entries I should make—I was pressed very hard with work at the time—I kept all the books except the order book—each firm had a separate set of books—in Clark and Co.'s firm I was engaged as book-keeper—they had a rough cash book, a fair cash book, a debtors ledger, a creditors' ledger, a journal, sales book, and order book—I several times complained of my hard work—I was not the only one who complained—Grafton's and Clark's private accounts passed through the business books of the firm—the cheque for 136<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., paid to Hards, Vaughan, and Co., is debited to Mr. Clark's private account, so that he would see that cheque and be able at once to detect if it were wrong—the cheque for 196<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. debited also to Mr. Clark's private account—I do not remember whether the name was Luckhurst—Grafton knew that there was an auditor employed, and that the accounts were regularly audited—a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to Mr. Fase is entered in the books as "Mr. Fate," and it is entered to Mr. Clark's account erroneously—those are the only three entries in Mr. Clark's account that are complained of in this indictment—I don't recollect Grafton saying anything to me about drawing out Fase's cheque—I remember calling Mr. Clark's attention to one or two items which I said I did not know whether they were for him or not, and he said he would take the book home and look—in debiting those cheques to Mr. Clark's account I never received any order of any kind from Grafton to do so—it was simply an error which could easily have been detected if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300045"/>
               <p>the books had been properly audited—no charges were made against Mr. Grafton up to that time—they were errors which were found out and corrected—Mr. Clark was in the habit of passing all his private transactions through the business books—I knew that both firms made the same kind of shutter, and that they required the same springs—in 1876 I was authorised by Mr. Clark to go and assist in the evening at Bunnett and Co.'s in writing up their books—I remember a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Eadon's case, which is marked in pencil in the ledger—this writing may be mine; I write very like that when I write with a pencil—I cannot read what it is—I should take it to mean that they have evidently found in this credit account the amount of the claim, and I have put in the claim provisionally—the ink is my writing—in 1869 Mr. Clark had an attack of paralysis—I recollect him almost entirely himself again at the end of August of the same year—I know it by his purchasing an estate at Guildford, and another estate at Taplow, which he possesses now—he entered into several speculations—independent of my ter to Godwin Mr. Peck knew of this mistake about the 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—at letter had nothing to do with it—during the eight and a half years that I was in Mr. Clark's employ I knew Grafton, and I always considered him to be a man of honour, honesty, and integrity—I thought he was rather erratic in his business transactions, that is, in keeping his cash book—no one dared to insinuate anything.</p>

This cheque bears his" (i.e., Mr. Peck's, the solicitor's) "endorsement, but I cannot tell you what it is for"—it was not necessary for me to make any inquiry of Grafton—when Peck's account was rendered I in the natural course went into it—this is Peck's account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he has not put the date when he rendered it—the last item is in 1875—he would never render his account—I will prove to you by this letter that this identical account was not rendered at that date, September, 1876—G. Eadon's account in Bunnett's books is partly entered up by me—on one gave me instructions to enter it that I know of—all these entries in Clark's books, December, 1874, amounting to 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., are in my writing—there was a separate invoice for this—the two last entries on the Dr. side are in my writing from the cash-bock, "Dr. to cash, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; July 22, 1876, Dr. to cash, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I assume that those payments had been made in discharge of the account—these other amounts, Hard's and Vaughan's cheque, and cheque for deposit on land, and so on, I saw in the books, and entered them to Clark's private account—I don't think I entered Luckhurst's cheque for 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 23rd September, 1875.</p>

On Friday, 9th May, about 11 a.m., I was called to 4, Euston Square, and found a body lying in the cellar; by the side of it appeared to be some pieces of a black silk dress, and there was a cloth cloak with a Lood; the hood appeared to have a silk lining, and there was what appeared to be a part of a black silk petticoat, and some brown coloured lace as if it had been a scarf or a shawl; the body was partly decomposed, there were two turns of rope round the neck, very tight, embedded in the flesh; I put the point of the knife in to raise it, it was rotten and broke; it was a light clothes line the sides of the neck were partly decomposed, but not the front, and there appeared to be the flesh with the clothes line in it—I left all the things that I saw on the body there—I examined the cellar with Inspector Hagan on the same day, and helped to find some small bones of a foot, close to the spot where the body had been lying—I saw the remains put into a shell—the foot was also put in, and the small bones which were taken up afterwards, and the remains of the clothing—they were then taken to the mortuary—I saw this brooch (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>), but not before Mr. Hagan showed it to me there.</p>

I am an Inspector of the Criminal Investigation De<lb/>partment—on Friday, 9th May, I went to 4, Euston Square, and found the body in the left-hand corner of the cellar—I saw embedded under the right jaw two pieces of clothes rope or clothes line, that was level with the outside of the flesh—I saw no knot, but the body had been removed before I saw it—there were also some pieces of rope lying about; I only saw two strands of rope under the right jaw; I did not see what was round the other side of the neck; I took it away—I broke one piece in two with my finger, and kept one piece of it; it came away like tinder; it was quite rotten; the piece I took was from 3 to 4 inches long; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has shrunken away,</p>

               <p>and is now about 2 inches long, being dry—it was more like 3 inches than 4 inches—several pieces of rope were lying about, 3, 4, or 5 inches long amongst the rags, that was just the same description as the rope that was round the neck—this piece is not in the condition in which I found it; it has become untwisted since, because of the dryness—that which was round the neck was much more rotten than the other rope I found—the clothing was put into the shell—I saw no boots found at that time; when the body was removed I found this brooch at the mortuary—this buckle was found in the cellar—it fell from the rags of the silk dress—I found a great quantity of lace—I found the other clothing described; all that was found was put into the shell and taken to the mortuary, where I made further examination of the clothing—there was a portion, as it appeared to me, of a black silk body, very strong and very good; it did not appear enough for a dress; there were parts of the sleeves, showing that it had been a body; here is a piece of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were also the remains of a black quilted satin petticoat, a good long piece of it—there was a piece of red flannel, or flannel which had been red with the colour somewhat blanched, which apparently had been an uuder-garment, and outside the two pieces of black lace I found this brooch, and here is the pin of it; there was also the remains of a large circular waterproof cloak with a hood to it, which was lined with silk, and silk ribbons were hanging from the body—those things were left at the mortuary—Dr. Davis, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Pepper examined the body after<lb/>wards—I had given orders to sift the contents of the cellar, and I afterwards saw a foot with part of a boot on it; only one foot was found to my know<lb/>ledge; the inspectors were Sergeant Gatland and Sergeant Beeson—I saw two pieces of oilcloth in the cellar, one large and one small, in a decomposed condition.</p>

I live at 1, Euston Square—on Friday, 9th May, the police fetched me to 4, Euston Square, and I was shown a body in one of the front cellars—on going in from the light I could see nothing but a black mass, a black mound, but on more closely examining I found at the end of the mound the head of a female—the remains had coal-dust on them, from which they were quite black—the head was exposed, there was a very small portion of hair on the scalp at the back of the head, but I could not notice the colour then—the body was flexed and the back was uppermost—the arms were flexed across the breast and the body resting on them—the arms were attached to the body, but there were no hands—the legs were severed from the knees; the portion above the</p>

               <p>knees was attached, but the bones above the tibia were parted and quite denuded—the bones down to the ankle were bare—it is quite possible that the separation of the limbs from the body would be the result of decomposi<lb/>tion—there was nothing to show me that it was not—I gave directions that all the things should be "brought to the mortuary, where I made a careful examination on the 10th with my son—I found that the flesh was entirely absent from the whole of the face and from the front of the neck, I mean over the windpipe, as well as the principal part of the scalp, all. except the back, and at the back of the neck I found a very deep impression or indentation, in which I discovered the remains of a cord—the flesh was still remaining as far, as the ears—I could not remove it as a cord, because it broke at the touch—it was round the back of the neck nearly from ear to ear—I cannot say whether it had been fastened—it was such an indentation as would be made by a cord drawn very tightly round the neck either before or after death, it is impossible to say which—there was flesh at the back and tides of the neck, but it was highly decomposed; it was quite a substance and in a fatty condition, but all was gone in front from decomposition, at least that might have been the case—if any wound was inflicted in front of the neck it possibly would more easily decompose, it might or it might not—when I saw the hair at the mortuary I considered it a light brown; it was short, and it had half a turn round, as though it was disposed to a ringlet; it would probably have been short ringlets during the life of the wearer—there was no fracture of the skull or of any of the bones as far as I saw—the internal organs were as you would suppose some long time after death, they were passing away—there was nothing to lead me to a conclusion as to the cause of death—I carefully examined the spine; I presume there was a little tendency to curvature of convexity to the right side, a lateral curvature giving a tendency to stoop to the right side—that would cause an appearance of deformity; there would be a little prominence of the right shoulder and a bending of the head to the other side, as you see in old people—there would be a very slight stoop—Mr. Bond was with me—I can only come to the conclusion that the woman's ago would be from 50 to 70, the only indi<lb/>cation was from the lower jaw, and it might take place after 50—when the teeth go, the alvera sockets go also, and that gives an appearance of age which seldom is before 50 or 56—the height was about 5 feet 4 inches—Mr. Bond and I put the bones together with a view of ascertaining the height—we did it as carefully as we possibly could—the body had been clothed—I saw only one foot which was found, but there were some small bones be<lb/>longing to the wrist and hand—it strikes me that there was a boot on the foot and covered with coal-dust—I observed no unpleasant smell, but the coal-dust would be a deodorant, being carbon—if the woman had been strangled, most likely there would be a flow of blood from the nose, ears, or mouth; there would not be time for much, and there might be none—it probably would not be profuse, but I cannot say that I have had any ex<lb/>perience—if an artery in the neck was severed that would occasion a con<lb/>siderable discharge of blood; the quantity would depend upon whether the jugular vein was severed; if it was, the body would be emptied of blood directly.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I am a pathologist of St. Mary's Hospital—I made two examinations of the body at the mortuary, one on May 15 and the other on May 19, in company with Dr. Davis—I have heard his examination, and agree generally with what he has said—there was only presumptive evidence as to the cause of death; the deep mark in the neck showed what the cause of death might have been, but not what it was—the cord in the neck was at an angle of 45 degrees, which is consistent with death by hanging, and it is not the angle you would expect to get by death from strangulation—if the body had been tied round the neck by a cord after death and dragged, that would be consistent with what I saw—the groove was at both sides of the neck as well as at the back, and the higher part of the groove was at the back—it sloped from the front to the back backwards and upwards—all the flesh at the front of the neck was gone—there was no trace of the windpipe, but I may say that that is the first part of the body to decompose—there was a double lateral curvature of the spine, one curvature first to the right, and a second or compensatory curvature to the left—that must have existed during life; I examined the vertebrae, and found one side much deeper than the other—the main bone of the right leg, the tibia, was thickened; that would be caused by inflam<lb/>mation of the bone—that would almost certainly cause pain, which would be alleviated by rest, internal remedies, and warmth—a person suffering, from that disease might without medical advice resort to fomentation, and it might somewhat relieve the pain—the right fore arm was detached from the upper arm, but it must have been flexed on the chest before death—Inspector Hagan afterwards brought me a piece of carpet with several colours on it, and the stains were not very manifest on the upper surface, but on the under surface it was stained for rather more than a foot and a half very plainly, and nearly circular; it was caused by blood—I examined it by all the well<lb/>known tests—I can only say that it was the blood of a mammal, but I cannot say that it was human; we cannot distinguish between the two—I put some of the viscera in a sealed vessel and gave them to Mr. Luff, the analytical chemist—my opinion is that the body had been dead from one to two years—I do not think more than two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was not entire; the left hand was attached, but all the bones were there except some of the small bones—they were broken off, and the foot was quite dry by a process called mummification—only the two large bones of the right foot were present; all the rest were missing—no bones were missing from the other foot—I found among some of the lesser bones of the head two bones which were not human; one was a leg of mutton bone, and the other was the foot of an ox, the femur, no small bone; I only saw one—strangulation would make a very considerable indentation in the neck, and that was consistent with hanging, and not strangulation, unless the person strangling was very much taller.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It might be caused by dragging the body—the comunni<lb/>cation of the foot was due to exposure on account of the small amount of flesh—I found the long bones of both legs perfect, and the long bones of the arms, all of which probably belonged to the same body—the bones missing were of the feet and hands—the mutton bone and ox bone were</p>

               <p>quite clean and bare—they were the only bones I saw which were not human—the mutton bone appeared fresher than the ox bone; it is very difficult to form an opinion how long they had been there, as there was no soft material on them at all—I examined all the bones at the mortuary very carefully indeed.</p>

I am assistant-surgeon at Westminster Hospital—I was directed by the officers of the Criminal Investigation Department to go to St. Pancras Mortuary, and went on 12th May with Dr. Davis—I heard his evidence at the police-court, but not to-day—we found the body in a state of decomposition by a process called saponification—most of the viscera were decomposed or missing; some parts were very much de<lb/>composed—the front of the neck had perfectly disappeared, but at the back and sides I noticed an oblique depression—I formed no opinion whether that had been done by hanging or strangling, but I formed the opinion that it had been done by a cord—I estimated that the deceased was from 60 to 70 years of age—I measured the height very exactly, and found it to be 5 feet 4 inches—all the bones were there excepting a few small bones of one foot—if a person were strangled there might be a flow of blood some days after death, not likely a very large flow; there might be an oozing of blood from the mouth and nostrils, but not so much as would be required to make the stain on the carpet—I should expect to find a flow of blood at some variable period after death from 24 hours to a week—the mark on the neck was higher behind than in front—if a dead body was dragged by the neck by a small cord it would leave an indentation similar to what I found, and the cord would get totally embedded in, the neck—I noticed a curvature of the spine, which in life would cause, a perceptible stoop—Inspector Hagan brought me a piece of oilcloth; I examined it carefully, and by the general odour it appeared to have been in contact, or to have been subject to the same process of decay—I cut some hair from the scalp, took it home, washed it most carefully, and examined it with a microscope, but found no signs of any dye; it was slightly brown, and there was an indication of grey at the roots—it was short and very much tangled, probably as if it had been curled—a piece of drugget was brought to me—it was coloured on one side, printed, and whitey-brown on the other—there was a stiff stain on it, which was much more apparent on the whitey-brown side—I tested the stain by the usual processes, and found it was undoubtedly the blood of a mammal; that is as far as I can tell you—I sent it to Mr. Pepper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Judging, from the size of the bones, and the appearance of the flesh, I think the deceased must have been a heavy woman—from the stiffness of the blood on the carpet I believe it was undiluted—I have seen a person who died from hanging, but never saw one who was strangled and then fell on the floor—I do not think strangling a person in a recumbent position would would be more likely than hanging to induce a flow of blood—the flow of blood is caused by decomposition taking place—I see no evidence of this carpet having been washed; it is just in the condition it would be if it had been worn with the stain on it—it may have been washed on the surface, but not thoroughly—I am certain it has not been taken up and washed.</p>

I live at 9, Rochester Row, Kentish Town, and am an artist—I had a sister of the name of Matilda Hacker—in the autumn of 1877 she was 66 years of age—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are photographs of her; one of them is in an evening dress and the other in a morning dress—my sister was in the habit of dressing somewhat gaily, too young for her age—I should think these photographs were taken some 10 or 15 years since—up to about five years ago she was a resident at Canterbury; she had lived there all her life—her means were derived from rentals of houses at Canterbury—her income was about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Mr. Cozens collected her rents—she left Canterbury about two years ago; she left of her own choice—her sister having died, she chose to leave, and took a house at Brighton—after leaving Brighton she was living under assumed names—she lived at Brighton about two years or two and a half—I have learnt that she lived under assumed names in consequence of some dispute with the landlord; a claim which he made which she thought unjust, about some water rate—her height was 5 feet 4 inches, I should say—she got stouter after these photographs were taken; in fact, there is so much clothing here you can hardly see the stout<lb/>ness; but she appeared stouter latterly, and stooped and was round-shouldered—she called on me, perhaps, once in three or four months, other<lb/>wise I never saw her—I have never heard of her being alive since October, 1877—I always expected to see her once in four months, at Christmas time—the last Christmas she did not call—I thought it rather strange, and knowing there was some claim upon her which she seemed determined not to pay, I thought it possible that she might be in some trouble, and therefore I made it my business to go to Canterbury some two or three months after that, and I found she had not called for her rent—there was not the slightest quarrel or difference with me to make her keep away, except that I did not approve of her taking a large house, which I thought she had not the means for—she took a house at Brighton at something like 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent and taxes, and I did not approve of it—in May this year I went to the mortuary with Inspector Hagan, and there saw a portion of human remains—some hair was attached to portions of the skull—that hair was of a similar cha<lb/>racter to that of my sister's; it was rather light brown, and being in ringlets I identified it the more as being her hair—I have no doubt that this watch was hers, and that is confirmed by the fact of its having been made by Warren, of Canterbury, where I know her watch was bought—we were natives of Canterbury—the two watches were bought at the same time, and given by my father to each of his daughters—that was about 40 years ago—I have not looked inside the watch (opening it)—yes, I see it has the name of Warren, of Canterbury—it is precisely identical with the watch which my other sister had—this chain is similar to one I have seen my sister wear, but I have never taken particular notice of it—it was of a more recent date, which she purchased probably herself, but I believe it is the chain I have seen her wearing; it is similar to it—I know nothing about the locket—</p>

               <p>this letter, dated 5th Sept, 1877, addressed to Mr. Tuxford, is my sister's writing.

Mr. Ward has not the money at his command, and is sorry he cannot get it for me. Friday evening, Sept 5, 1877.") This other letter, dated 10th Oct, 1877, is also her writing, and the envelope also.

I have written to him to go on the roof to see if there has been a new gutter, and that has been done. It appears you then are not to be depended on, if they cannot stop the water out on such a small roof. Did you see it done? There is a window-frame wants repairing at 7. Yours truly, M. Hacker. Trusting you will attend to their complaints—I can't pay if there is nothing done.") I did not know my sister's address in Oct, 1877—I did not know that she was suffering from a varicose vein—I never heard her complain of her leg.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder at Canterbury, and live at Dover House, Dover Road—at one time I had the management of Miss Hacker's property at Canterbury, and received her rents—I received her rents in 1877—I gave it up on 30th March, 1878—neither I nor my father received her rents after that—this letter of 10th Oct is Miss Hacker's writing; it was written to my father—we did the repairs to her property—that letter of the 11th Oct, enclosing a cheque, was written by me to Miss Hacker—the cheque was for the rent of a yard which we occupied.

                  </hi>. I live at 68, Cromer Street, St. Pancras—I am a laundress—in the autumn of 1877 I washed for Mrs. Bastendorff and a lady that lived there at that time—I only received the lady's washing two weeks, and the prisoner told me on a Monday, at about 11 o'clock, that the lady had left in a hurry, and there were no clothes that week—I cannot tell what month that was in, not taking any notice—I do not think it was Mid<lb/>summer—the articles were underclothing—I generally went about 11 a.m.—I afterwards continued to wash for Mrs. Bastendorff, and after a time for some other lodgers there named Willoughby and Bowie—I began to wash for them I think about a week or a fortnight after I had the lady's things for the last time, or very soon after—I got these clothes from the prisoner, and saw her wearing a gold chain, which attracted my attention—I did not see a watch attached—that was after she told me that the lady had left, but I cannot say how long after—I said "It does not look very well for a servant to wear that in her work, and if you go to the door you perhaps may lose it, or have it snatched from you"—she made no answer—I understood from her that her uncle had left it to her—I said "I never saw Mrs. Bas<lb/>tendorff wear such a thing in the house"—I remember the prisoner giving me 8, 9, or 10 beautiful handkerchiefs to wash; I said that she might wear them longer and have them washed after, for they did not appear dirty as if they had been used; however I washed them—that was some time after she said that the lady had left, and I think it was after I began washing for Willoughby and Bowie—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but they were better than this, and not so large some of them—I did not observe it, but here is something worked in the corner—I do not know whether it is "H"—the prisoner paid me herself for washing that lot of handkerchiefs—I remember her going away for a holiday with little Peter, and I think she gave me these handker<lb/>chiefs before that—she did not speak to me about going, but I noticed a person there after she went to the country, and that was my reason for supposing she had gone.</p>

'I heard the reference yesterday to a varicose vein—the effect of a varicose vein suddenly bursting would depend upon the size of the vein; if it was a large one it might possibly cause death in a short time—I have seen one death from it, not a death immediately, but in a few days, from the effects of the loss of blood—there would be a very profuse flow of blood if a large vein was opened, sufficient to account for a much larger stain than I saw on the carpet—the vein would not cause inflammation, it would be diseased first—that might give rise to ulceration of the soft parts of the leg; that might account for the appearance of the bone that I saw; it is one of the causes of thickening of the bone—the immediate cause of thickening of the bone is inflammation—the condi<lb/>tion of the bone I saw was not consistent with the results from a varicose vein; it may burst, and there may never be an ulcer at all—you must not confound a varicose vein with a varicose ulcer; you must have a varicose vein before you have the ulcer, the ulcer must result from the vein—if there were such an ulcer it would be consistent.</p>

Suppuration from the ulcer is more likely in that part of the leg than any other—inflammation, if set up there, would produce thickening of the bone—inflammation may arise from any other cause than varicose vein, any local cause, for instance a kick would do it, or any constitutionul cause—there was nothing to show that this lady was suffering from varicose vein—the bone was quite bare—if she had been suffering from a varicose vein it might burst and cause a profuse spilling of blood—varicose veins give rise to a sense of weight and fulness in the leg, that is where they are not inflamed, very likely they become inflamed, then they are exceedingly painful—I don't think that persons suffering from varicose veins would be likely to complain to those about them of pain or</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sloane Street, and have a daughter named Elizabeth, who is just 17—in February and March she was assisting me in my shop in Sloane Square—I saw the prisoner come in with a woman—they brought an umbrella to be repaired and bought a dog collar—the woman said to my daughter "Oh, miss, would you like to have an order to see Professor Pepper's Ghost?" she said "Yes," and the woman said "I will send you one"—they left, an order was sent, and my daughter went out that evening—I went out at 10 o'clock—my daughter came home about 12.30—I let her in; she was accompanied by the prisoner and the same woman—I said "You have no right to keep my child out till this hour of the night," and slammed the door in his face—after that my daughter went out on several other evenings, and returned very late; there was quite an alteration in her—on Wednesday, 30th April, I let her go out about 9.30 p. m.—she returned about 12.30 or 12.45 in a perfect state of drunken<lb/>ness, with the prisoner—I went into her bedroom next morning and insisted on knowing where she went to—I reprimanded her for going out, and took a cane and hit her over her arm because she would not give me any infor<lb/>mation—she went out of the house about 10.30 or 11 o'clock, and did not come back that evening—in consequence of something the errand boy said I went next day to the prisoner's house in Oakley Crescent about 9 o'clock with Mr. Pearce—the prisoner was out; we waited in the hall; he came in with two other men and my daughter—I got hold of her hand and said "Lizzie, what business have you to be in this man's house?"—the prisoner deliberately put the chain on the door and said "I will see you b——before you go out or take her away, because she is over age and you have no jurisdiction over her"—he pushed her into a side room—I said "I will go out and get a policeman"—Pearce went towards the door; the prisoner knocked him down and said "You shall not open my b——door"—Pearce got up and opened the door, and the prisoner took his coat off, turned round to me, and said "Now I will settle you"—he ducked his head into my stomach, took me by the legs, and threw me down like a baby, kicked me on the back of my ear, and the blood shot out like a fountain—I was stunned for a moment—I no sooner got on my legs again than he was forcing his fingers into my throat—he tore my collar off, and tore my cravat to pieces, and a constable came and separated us—I said in the prisoner's hearing "I have not come here to make a disturbance, I want my child out of this house"—he said he would not let me take her away; the policeman said "How old is she?"—I said "Seventeen"—he said "Then I cannot interfere, as she is over age"—she then came out of the ante-room with the woman the prisoner lives with, who took her up into the drawing-room—I told the policeman I would not leave without my child if he killed me—the woman said to her "Come on upstairs," and dragged her upstairs—I went up into the drawing—room with the sergeant—I afterwards left the house, and a summons was taken out against the prisoner.</p>

I live at 49, Redburn Street, Hood Street, Chelsea-previous to 28th March I had a bill in the window "A room to let"—Howe came to my place and gave the name of Farrar on a piece of paper—it was a first-floor unfurnished room at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he asked if there was a place to keep coals in; I said there would be a place prepared in the back yard—Pike was with him, and said he was carpenter enough to build one for himself—I asked for a reference—Farrar said he had come up from the country by the Great Eastern line—he said he and Pike were friends, and were going to be employed in the neighbourhood together—he paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a deposit—this is the reference "Mr. Pike, 6, Station Road, Camberwell"—he came again on Thursday, and said he had ordered some coals to come in the evening—that would be 20th March—I told him the place was not ready for the coals, and he said they would be shot in the yard—no coals or furniture came on Thursday, but the coals came on Friday—he was in once or twice that day—on the Thursday I gave him a chair to sit on and left him there—he said he should be round the corner if the coals came—both were there when the coals came—no coals were delivered—Farrar came on Saturday morning—he stopped a little time in the room and went out again—Mr. Smith came twice that day—there was still no furniture there—they went away together—I saw no more of Howe [<hi rend="italic">Farrar</hi>] till I saw him in this Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Ulmore and Smith, coal merchants, Piccadilly, and have a depot at Cremorne—an order was received on 20th March to deliver half a ton of coal at 49, Redburn Street, Flood Street, Chelsea, for a person named Farrar—they were sent next day—Thorne was the weigher—I was not present—about 6 p.m., from in<lb/>formation received, I went towards Chelsea Police Station, and saw my van standing outside the World's End public-house—I looked in and saw my carman and both the defendants—Howe came out and said "Your man has been with the coals and the machine is broken and will not weigh them"—I said "I am surprised to hear it, as the machine is a new one"—I had the frame of the machine drawn out, and found that the back bar of the" frame was broken—it would be impossible to tell whether it was recently broken or not—before sending them from the depot the coals were weighed on our private standard machine—I had them afterwards re-weighed at the depot in the presence of myself and Thorne and both prisoners—the first sack was considerably overweight, excluding the sack, an empty sack being put on the weight scale to equalise the weight—the second was correct, the third several pounds short, and the fourth and fifth a little short, or about 201b. or 301b. short on the five sacks, value about 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—coals might have been spilled—I said "I hope you will take no further notice of it," and some conversation passed—Howe talked a great deal, and they went away saying that I shour hear of it—the next morning, Saturday, about 10 o'clock, I went to 49, Redburn Street, but did not go in; Howe did not appear to</p>

               <p>wish me to go in, as he came out immediately into the street and shut the door—he spoke a great deal of the serious position in which I was placed, and quoted a fearful number of Acts of Parliament under which I was to be brought into trouble, and suggested that the best thing was to settle it—he said he would take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and no less—I think he said he was entitled to half the amount—when we went on to the embankment close by, Pike joined us and heard a greater part of the conversation, and was present when Howe said he would not take a penny less than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "It is so preposterous I cannot listen to it," and I left on the understanding that I would see him again at 3 o'clock—he said he was going to annihilate me with proceedings—I went at 3 p.m., and he pulled the door to again and came out into the street—I tried to induce him to take less, but he would not, and at last I paid him the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in coin—he said "It is the wisest thing to do; you must not grumble, there are four of us, and that's only 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-piece; you are well out of it; I shall get," or "have got, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of Whiteley"—I had lost a relative and had a very serious pecuniary trouble—I should not have parted with the money but for the statements made by Howe about proceedings in the police-court, or if I had known what was going on at the time—I knew nothing of Mr. Whiteley's affair.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, Neither of the defendants told me they belonged to the Coal Consumers' Protection Association—Howe told me he was going to annihilate the whole of the coal trade—I will not swear he did not tell me he had formed or belonged to an association made for the purpose of enforcing the Coal Acts; if he did I should not have paid any attention to it—my carman had proper scales—I was not aware of the amount, but knew there was a penalty to which carmen are liable for not having proper scales, and I know that coal dealers are liable to a penalty if coals are delivered less weight than is put on the ticket—I did not know the penalty was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or that if the deficiency exceeded 2241b. the penalty was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the defendant terrified me by referring to a number of provisions in the Coal Acts—he made no objection to the coals going back to our depot to be re<lb/>weighed—three out of the five sacks were underweight—I believe the penalty is for sacks underweight, and that it is not material that they should be overweight—the machine was new and not imperfect, but the frame had been in use for months—I said before the Magistrate "It was not for a defective machine; it was not defective; the frame it fitted into was broken at the back and it could not act properly"—I offered to give him less than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he declined to take a penny less—when I went again in the after<lb/>noon I carried the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket, and finding he would not take less I gave it him.</p>

On Saturday, 9th March, at 6 p.m., I was on duty about 200 yards from 16, Hayes Place, when Howe came to me and said, "I am having some coals delivered at my place, I want you to come and witness the coals being weighed, as I believe the company are serving out 18 cwt. to the ton; they have been summoned once before and got clear off, as there was not a policeman to witness the case"—I went up and saw the van with 30 or 40 sacks in it, and saw three sacks weighed, two sacks were empty when I got there—the first one (No. 3) was about a pound short—I touched the scale and it easily turned one way or the other—the carman was going to put a piece of coal in to make it weight, but Howe said, "Don't put that in, it might rob some other person"—No. 4 was 4 or 5 lb. overweight—Howe said, "That's overweight"—the last I saw weighed was just right—I said, "Are you satisfied with it?"—Howe said, "I am perfectly satisfied with it"—Mr. Cole made a statement to me a few days after—I did not see one of them give 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the carman—Pike stood at the tail of the van.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They said they were satisfied two or three times. Robert Capon Cole. I live at Argyle House, Castle Hill, Ealing—I have been in the coal trade 15 years, and carry on business at Imperial Wharf, Warwick Road, Kensington, and at 75, Edgware Road, trading as the London Coal Delivery Company, and as Cole and Leigh—Pike was about 18 months in my employ eight or ten years ago as agent on commission—after he left he went into business in the Beresford Road, and then at 6, Station Road, Camberwell, and had coals from me—we weighed them till he instructed us not to weigh them—they were fetched by some one he employed, till I would not allow it and stopped it, and the coal was then delivered in my own carts—I have sold to Pike coals at 18 cwt. to the ton by his special order when he was carrying for himself, but I ceased to do so four or five years ago—I have since sent out coals for him to his order in my vans, and charged him as one merchant would another—I have not sent out any coals of improper weight that I am aware of during the last four years—I remember an order for one ton of coals, which were delivered on 8th January, at 8, Wyndham Road—I did not know George Howe before that order was sent—Johnson delivered them and brought back the delivery note produced, endorsed "Received, 18 cwt, less weight of one sack, George Howe"—I went next morning and saw Howe at 18, Wyndham Road, and said "I call to ask about the coals we delivered yesterday"—he said "What have you to say about it?"—I said "I am certain they were proper weight," and he replied "I have weighed them and found them short weight;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300102"/>
               <p>I shall take out a summons against you at Lambeth Police-court"—I said, "Before you do that you had better make a few inquiries, and come down to our wharf and see the mode in which we execute our orders; we have never had a complaint of delivery of coals"—he said "I will do so"—this letter was at the office before I saw him, but I think I had not seen it then. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "8, Wyndham Road, Camberwell, S.E. To Mr. R. C. Cole. 8ir,—Your carman called here to-day with what you consider a ton of coals. On weighing them I found there were not 18 cwt. We called it that much, not reckoning the weight of the first sack; but it really was not, as your man would insist upon weighing his hands. As I am informed you make a regular practice of sending short weight, I intend to-morrow to apply at the police-court for a summons against you, as I consider coals are quite dear enough without your swindling poor people out of 2 cwt. or more per ton. I thought perhaps you would consider me uncourteons if I did this without giving you due notice, so that you might attend and resist the application, as you may consider your defence on the day of hearing quite sufficient.—Yours, &amp;c, George Howe.") At the end of the interview he said he should make inquiries whether there had been anything against us before—I received next morning this letter: "January 11, 1879. 8, Wyndham Road, Camber<lb/>well. Sir,—In accordance with your request I have been making inquiries. The result is not much in your favour. In the first place I cannot find that your company is registered according to Act of Parliament; that will subject you to a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. fine at least I next find that you trade under the name of Cole and Leigh, but that the latter has no existence. Furthermore you said that you had never been summoned before. I find that you have not only been summoned, but fined 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. As you seem to desire to see me again, I shall be at home Monday from 11 till 2. Tuesday morning I attend at Lambeth Police-court at 10.30, as per instructions received to-day. Yours, &amp;c., George Howe."—I was fined 10 or 11 years ago for not having weights and scales—in consequence of that letter I got a friend, Mr. Mead, to see him—he saw him twice—on the second time he paid him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and brought me this. (<hi rend="italic">A receipt dated January</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1879, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">in consideration of which sum Howe agreed to forego the threatened proceedings against Cole.</hi>)—I suspected Pike was mixed up in it because my name was written in full, "Robert Capon Cole," in the last letter—I gave Mr. Mead the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know if Pike knew of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. fine—about 19th February I got an order from C. Jones, 12, Elm Grove, Hammersmith, for half a ton of coals, and sent them by my carman, Murrell—he made a statement to me when he returned, and I went there myself on 20th February, and saw Jones; I have never seen him since—I had a conversation with him, and parted with 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him in exchange for this. (<hi rend="italic">This was an undertaking off February 20th, in considera<lb/>tion of</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., "<hi rend="italic">to take no proceedings for the short weight sent in the half ton of coals." Signed</hi>, "<hi rend="smallCaps">W. JONES</hi>.") I believe the coals delivered in January and February were full weight—I parted with the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because he said they were weighed, and he had a policeman as a witness, and would summons me unless I thought it worth my while to compromise the matter—I suspected it was a clique with Pike and Howe, and I told Jones so and taxed him with it—he said, "Oh, I wrote to you by your advertisement in the paper, and I took it up quite by chance"—I gave him the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and threw it down with indignation, when I found I could not get away—I believed it to be a</p>

               <p>confederacy, and that I was at their mercy—on 27th March I received this letter: "16, Hayes Place, Lisson Grove. Please send Mr. Ferris half ton of coals. We have had them recommended to us, so suppose we had better have the best"—I sent the half ton on 29th March by Justice, who brought back this delivery note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), endorsed "41b. and 141b. short"—I went to the station and saw the inspector and Constable D 126—the coals were delivered on Saturday, and on Monday, March 31st, I received this letter: "Coal Consumers' Protection Association, 8, Wyndham Road, Camberwell, March 28th, 1879. To Robert Capon Cole, Esq. Sir,—One of our friends, a Mr. Ferris, ordered some coals of you this week, and desired me to attend and see them weighed and delivered. I did so, with the following result The first sack was about 21b. short weight, the second correct, the third 21b. over weight, the fourth 141b. short, and the fifth 41b. short, and on looking at the coals delivered I find them very far from the quality described upon the delivery note. I have therefore arranged to call at Hayes Place, Lisson Grove, to-morrow morning, to arrange course of proceedings to be taken. Our agent at Kensington sent me word during the week that the previous Saturday's proceedings had frightened Cole's people, and they were sending them out better but not quite right, as they were working in a light sack whenever it looked safe to do so. I knew you had nothing better than Silkstones, and should have advised that description to be ordered, but as you have discontinued the advertisement, did not know your address. I am afraid your sending them as best Wallsend, and charging extra for them on account of the name you bestowed upon them, will be likely to cause you trouble. I am determined to put an end to the robbery to the public in the matter of coals; am thereform forming an association for the purpose. We purpose issuing 5,000 circulars, and intend, if possible, to have at least one conviction each week to publish. I intentionally tell you this, as I am told one of your neighbours say that you must all combine to put an end to this weighing job. Perhaps you will be good enough to inform him from me that I consider there is but one way of fighting us with success, <hi rend="smallCaps">THAT IS, TO BE HONEST</hi>. Yours, &amp;c., <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE HOWE</hi>, Secretary.") I then communicated with my solicitor—I did not see Howe after that—I knew of Mr. Whiteley's case at the police-court on the preceding Saturday—I parted with my money because of the threat that was held out—I did not see Pike.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I trade as Cole and Lee at Warwick Road, Kensington—I also trade as the London Coal Delivery Company at Warwick Road and Edgware Road, after discontinuing to trade as The Guinea Coal Company when coals went up in prices—there is no Company and no Leigh, they are trade names—I adopted the name of Leigh because there was no one else in the trade of that name—I have not been charged or accused with false weight before—I said before the Magistrate "I had been accused of false weight before—this is by no means the first case"—I have been fined 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the Marlborough Street Police-court for not carrying scales and weights—in so large a trade there is no merchant who has not been accused—I have disproved the accusations, but have never settled them—I do not think I had seen Howe's letter when I went to see him—I cannot remember whether I said at the police-court "Before I went I had this letter marked G," and that I then said "I am not certain"—I told Mr. Mead to go after I had received the letter marked H—my company is mot registered, there is no one in it—I do not have a price list, and have not systematically sent</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300104"/>
               <p>coals short weight—I remember writing a letter to Pike: "Dear Sir,—On and after to-day prices to you as follows" &amp;c. "You will understand these prices are as we load, no discount. If I a trifle more"—the "X" means full weight, and coals not marked I were light weight—but they were Pike's coals, not mine—I supplied coals to his customers light weight or full weight, and he was responsible—it was a regular practice for Pike to send out light weight in his own trade—he was not my agent four years ago—his coals were delivered in one of my vans without our name being displayed, only the Government name as we call it, because he would not like his coals to go out with another merchant's name displayed in front—they were sometimes delivered in his vans till I stopped it—I paid two sums of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one in January and the other in February—I had not heard of Whiteley's case then—when I first saw Howe I offered to give him the deficiency in the coals to make up the weight—he said "No, I expect a ton, and shall summon you"—he did not on that occasion demand money, nor did I promise any—I never saw him again—Mr. Mead saw him—no one else was there but Pike, to whom I sent regular deliveries of coals not properly weighed—that has ceased for four years, and Pike owes me money—Mr. Mead was too ill to attend the police-court, and has only recently recovered—I said at the police-court "I instructed him to pay the money as I did not wish to be summoned—I could not fight that case—the coal was not weight on being sent out—the bag was merely filled from pressure of business, and there being no one at the weighing machine."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That refers to the loading of the coals for Howe—I found the men loading the coals like that, and they had formed a gang—I warned them and said "Be very careful you have the correct weight in the sacks"—I have no sacks holding less than 2241b.—they are all the same size—I saw them, and believe they were full weight.</p>

                  </hi>. I and my three brothers carry on the trade of coal merchants at 47, Euston Road, and the Elephant and Castle Station—we received an order on 10th April for one ton best coals for Mr. Farrer, 8, Wyndham Road, Camberwell—this is a copy of the bill sent with the coals—the original was at the police-court—there were three summonses against us, one for short weight and defective machine; another misquoting the Act of Parliament, 104 instead of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and another to correct that error—I was fined 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and have appealed to a higher Court on the ground that the Magistrate found as a fact that there was no fraud in the matter, and the other two summonses were dismissed—I received from our manager at the Elephant and Castle on 15th April, when the carman returned from delivering the coals to 8, Wyndham Road, this card: "George Howe, Secretary, Coal Consumers' Protection Association"—I went on the follow<lb/>ing Friday and again in the evening to Wyndham Road, but could not see Farrer—I had seen Whiteley's case in the newspapers the week before, and observed he was prosecuting two men—I went to Hammersmith Police-court the week after while that charge was being preferred—I instructed my solicitors, Messrs. Roach and Sons, to appear for me at the Lambeth Police-court—the scales were perfect when they went out, and the coals full weight—I did not see them weighed, but have no doubt my men did their work properly—I have never permitted short weight—the coals from Euston Road are drawn from the King's Cross sidings, Great Northern Railway, and all coals weighed on the weighing machine of the King's Cross Company—on</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. fine was for not setting out the Act properly, that was a printer's error—I said at the police-court "The chapter of the Coal Act was misprinted on the ticket The printer was sworn and said he and my manager consulted and agreed upon this form as more convenient than those we had in use before. The ticket left out the number of sacks and the number of pounds in them"—the other two summonses were dis<lb/>missed four or five weeks ago—I had given evidence at Hammersmith—I said at Hammersmith "There are now two summonses hanging over my head for imperfect scales"—in that case a constable and a scavenger swore to short weight in the last of the defendant's sacks—I am manager to the Tyne Main Coal Company; it is not a limited Company—there are other persons in it besides myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The three summonses were taken out after I had seen Howe at the police-court on Whiteley's case—I was keeping the scales for inspection—I attended at Lambeth—the other scales were cheesemonger's scales on which the charge of short weight was made—I did not believe they would weigh 124 lb., and I examined them and sent a practical manu<lb/>facturer to look at them.</p>

I am servant at 208, St. George's Street East—I know the prisoner, he was staying at 208—it is a house where sailors stop when ashore—a sailor named Marius Caclard was stopping there—about half-past 2 o'clock on 30th May the prisoner was having dinner—a row commenced with Caclard in French, I don't know what they said—I asked Caclard what he was rowing about—he said they had had a row on board ship—the prisoner said if he could not fight him he would take a knife to him—Caclard struck the prisoner first with his fist in the head—the prisoner then got up from the dinner-table and they had a fight in the kitchen—they were fighting and jangling about, and the prisoner ran from the kitchen to the shop and came back with a sheath knife in his hand and stabbed Caclard in the shoulder—he was standing with his back to the prisoner and did not see the knife—the prisoner did not say anything when he stabbed him—Caclard ran out into the street and the prisoner after him, and he threw the knife away—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is not the knife he was eating his dinner with—I never noticed him carrying a knife in his belt—he was a little the worse for drink, Caclard was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 2, Spital Square—on 30th May I was called to the Leman Street station, and saw Caclard there and examined him—he had a clean-cut penetrating wound, which went through the armpit in front of the left shoulder to the collar-bone—it was a dangerous wound—it did not penetrate the cavity of the chest, but it must have been within an eighth of an inch of it; the large vessels and artery were in the immediate neighbourhood of the wound; in fact, I would not put an instrument there for anything—such a knife as this might have caused the wound, if used with considerable force; the point is very blunt—it went through the clothes—he was under my observation for a week; he was then obliged to leave because he could not pay his lodging, and I did not see him afterwards—from the serious nature of the wound his arm would be weakened, and he would be liable to <hi rend="italic">traumatic aneurism</hi> at any time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Messrs. Tamvaco and Co., and have the privilege of purchasing wheat sweepings, which are generally sold privately, but sometimes by auction—I have a right of preemption—on or about March 13th I purchased, amongst other things, some wheat sweepings ex Mabel from Calcutta, and received in due course from Tamvaco and Co. a delivery order—I keep a delivery order book in the office, and all delivery orders have counterfoils like cheques—I took them about a week afterwards to O'Dwyer at the general office, for the purpose of obtaining the exact weights of the goods I had purchased, and to see if they stood in the name of Tamvaco—O'Dwyer is in the employ of the Docks Company—some two or three days afterwards I received back this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with a piece of paper attached, giving details of exact weights—I retained it, and put the original or prime order in an envelope addressed to O'Dwyer, and posted it—I have never received it back; if returned by the Post-office it would have come to the firm—it was to this effect: "London, 13th March, Victoria Dock. Weigh and deliver to the order of A. Masson 49 cwt wheat sweepings, ex Mabel, Captain—, from Calcutta, warehoused by selves,' 1879;" marks and numbers, "7 M. L."—it was signed by Tamvaco and Co.—I sold Mr. Dannett the 49 cwt of wheat sweepings about 25th March, but kept no books or record of the transaction—I handed a sub-order signed by myself to Dannett—the delivery order is part of the prime order—those are all the goods I ever sold to him—I met him about a fortnight after on my return, after absence from town.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed as clerk, at the B and K Jetty, Victoria Docks—Bodley was delivery foreman and Laurie was quay foreman there—on Friday, 28th March, Bodley was absent and Laurie was acting as fore<lb/>man in his absence—Seymour, the carman, presented to me this order (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) with two others—I took them to the general office and saw O'Dwyer there—I showed him the orders and asked for the landing books; but he said, "You will not require them"—I went back to the B and K department and saw Laurie there and laid the order on his desk in the delivery foreman's office—no one else was there, he was in charge of the premises—I saw the wheat sweepings loaded; Laurie was present, and told me which was the pile to deliver from, and got the man to deliver them, and I took down the weights as they were weighed and loaded; 21 sacks weighing 49 cwt into Green-wood's van—the loading was under Laurie's superintendence—I told him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300108"/>
               <p>the total weight and left the piece of paper containing the weights on his desk after I got the sweepings, and told him at the same time that it was the total weight—I ought to have had the landing-book to enter the weights in it—I did not do so—the total weights should have been endorsed on the back of the order by Laurie, and he would then give it to the carman—Laurie made no entry then of the 49 cwt.—I did not see the carman sign the warehouse receipt book, it was Laurie's duty to see that he did so—it contained a receipt for the goods, and should be signed by the carman—I saw another of Greenwood's vans there later on that afternoon, and it took 14 bags of linseed and 3 other bags—next day, Saturday, 29th March, I saw the same van and the same carman there again that had taken the 49 cwt., and in the same shed (No. 5), and Bodley superintending it; and I saw Laurie and Bodley talking together between 9 and 10 am., but did not hear what they said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Thompson, the warehouse cooper, is here—Bodley's is the delivery foreman's office, about halfway down the dock, and Laurie is em<lb/>ployed as quay foreman in another small office by himself at the bottom of the quay, some distance from Bodley's office—in the after part of the day Laurie was acting for Bodley and also attending to his own duties—I left the particulars of the total weights on a piece of paper on the desk with Laurie—I was going backwards and forwards from the general office to the delivery office that morning—the van arrived between 2 and 3, Bodley went between 12 and 1, up to which time he had been acting for himself—I do not know why he went away—he did not return that day that I know of—I did not hear that he had asked leave to go to a funeral—he came next morning as usual—there was no one else with Laurie in the delivery office, but others were about the place and could see inside, as it has a glass front—there were many people looking in—Mr. Gregg would not be at the Vic<lb/>toria Docks—I have been two and a half years in the company's service—I am acting clerk and go backwards and forwards to the delivery office.</p>

I am one of Mr. Greenwood's carmen; I knew Mr. Dannett, and used to carry a good deal of grain and linseed for him—I went to his premises by my master's orders on 28th March, and received a letter addressed to O'Dwyer at the docks, and was instructed to get a load of wheat sweepings—the dock gatekeeper directed me the general office, where I saw O'Dwyer, and gave him the letter, and he opened it, and read it—he then looked among some books, and handed me these three orders (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which by his directions I took to the B and K jetty—I had been there three or four times before for Dannett for sweepings, and other carriers had been there for my master—I generally saw Bodley there, but Laurie was there on 28th March; I had not seen him there before—I took Laurie the order, and said I had come for a load of sweepings for Mr. Dannett—he said "All right, back in at the jetty"—I gave the orders to some one inside the delivery foreman's box—Laurie and Halliday and one or two others were there—that is the proper place to deliver the orders—I was on the van, and other men were loading—I did not see whether Laurie superintended the delivery of the goods—I usually get the order back with a weight note after getting the goods, which I take to O'Dwyer to get my pass—on this occasion I got my pass from the general office—Laurie did not return me the order, or give me a weight note, but told me to go to the general office—I was not asked to sign a receipt for the 49 cwt; I never signed one at the docks, except on the Saturday—O'Dwyer gave me a pass at the office, and I left it with Hoper the gatekeeper; I could not pass out without it—on Saturday morning, 29th March, I went again to Dannett's place by my master's orders—Dannett's foreman sent me to the Victoria Docks for another load of wheat sweepings, but no papers were given me—when I got inside the gate I saw Gilbert standing outside the general office, and by his. directions I went to the B and K department, No. 5, where I had been the day before—I saw Bodley there, and got the same quantity of wheat sweepings, 49 cwt, in 21 full sacks, without any order—the receipt book was then shown to me, and I signed "D. Seymour," under "ex Mabel, delivered to Greenwood's van, 49 cwt sweeping"—Bodley gave me the pass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not go to the general office at all—the pass was taken front me at the gate, and I was stopped—I delivered the previous load on 28th March at Dannett's, Oscar Wharf.</p>

               <p>months ago—I have known Laurie ever since I have been in the docks, but only about six months to speak to—I first learned about nine or twelve months ago that deliveries of sweepings were being made from the B and K jetty for which no orders were received—O'Dwyer used to speak to me and give me the orders, and was very friendly—it was something unusual—Dannett has given me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on one occasion 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the previous day's passes used to be brought from the examiner's desk by O'Dwyer's orders, and it struck me as irregular when I saw him dealing with them, as they ought not to be out of the examiner's office strictly, and I spoke to O'Dwyer about it—the books from the general office were not sent to the examiners, but the day-book from the jetty used to go there to be checked with the passes—I had a conversation with Laurie afterwards—it is about six months since I first saw him on this matter—if we had an order O'Dwyer used to send me over to ask Laurie to endorse the order for the delivery—I was under his directions—if a carman was there I was to see whether Laurie would load the van without endorsing the order, the object being to get the load out without any note being taken—Laurie did do this on that day—I have not seen him personally more than three times—I have not noticed O'Dwyer and Laurie together—when I went to Laurie with these orders I used to say, "Will you back the orders up?"—he would say if it could be done or not, but could not give an answer till the van was loaded, and would then say "I will let you know"—he never expressed any surprise, it used to be understood—he would let me know when the van was loaded, and would apply for the pass, and might once bring over the order himself, but it would be unusual for him to come to the office, being quay foreman—I ascertained for a fact that goods had been delivered and that the orders had not been endorsed—I believe nothing was said as to whether he should come himself or not—O'Dwyer and I used to work it so that I should go—I saw Laurie again after the goods were loaded, and he gave me two orders; one was endorsed and the other partly endorsed—I got the orders back unendorsed on one occasion, and passes were then made out, and no entries were made in our books in the office of the delivery of the goods—we seldom talked about these deliveries, and I always used as few words as possible to Laurie—I had seen him on 28th March, when Greenwood's van was there, and I went to see whether he was going to endorse the delivery orders which he then had—I took him this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 14 bags, but had not seen this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with reference to the sweepings—I saw this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for the linseed—I did not take it over—from something O'Dwyer told me I went over to see Bodley; he was not there, but I saw Laurie there, and I said to him, "Are you going to load the van?" and I understood that he would do it—he knew what I came about, as the van was there—I do not remember his answer—I went back to the general office and saw O'Dwyer, and in consequence of a conversation with him I went back again to Laurie, and the van was still there—I asked him the number of sacks of linseed which the van would have in—he gave me these two linseed orders, but did not say anything, as two or three clerks were in the office at the time—he was just endorsing the orders, and stopped when he saw me and gave the orders to me—they ought to be given to the carman to bring to the office for his pass—he only gave me those two orders—he gave me the number of sacks that were in the van, and I went to the general office and saw O'Dwyer, and then made out a pass for them—one order was endorsed "Weight cut</p>

               <p>started and delivered 3 bags linseed, 28th March, 1879, C. Laurie," and the other "Weight cut started and delivered"—the pass was for sacks, but whether for seed or wheat I could not say—I put on the pass "Sundry ships"—I had not received the order for 49 cwt. wheat sweepings, and Laurie did not hand it to me on the Friday—I simply made out the pass from memory on the information Laurie had given me—Bodley was delivery foreman at B and K—I had had similar communications with Bodley, and I always saw Bodley when he was there, but on one or two occasions in his absence Laurie took his place, and that is how I met him—I have more than once gone back to the office, and made out passes simply from the information he gave me, without the orders, as I did for Laurie—they worked at the same jetty on the same quay—on Saturday morning, the 29th, the bundle of passes from the examiner's office were had at the desk in the general office, and I looked over them and tore out two passes, one of which I had written the previous afternoon—I gave them to O'Dwyer in the office—they related to seed or wheat delivered on the Friday without the orders being properly backed—I got three blank passes from the books and met O'Dwyer and Dannett at the Custom House Hotel, outside the docks—I gave them to O'Dwyer, and he signed them—I was standing outside the gate when Greenwood's carman came, I was not there purposely, but had just come from B jetty—I had been to see Bodley and Laurie after O'Dwyer had signed the passes—I gave them to Bodley with a letter from O'Dwyer, and I spoke to him about loading the van—he said "Have you seen the van?"—I said "No"—I went back to the general office and saw the carman coming in with the van and I directed him to go to B K—I then went into the office to my regular duties—I went again to Bodley, made out the pass, Bodley told me how many sacks were in the van, and then I filled in the number in his office and gave the pass to Bodley—I cannot say that I had seen O'Dwyer and Bodley in conversation before the 28th March—I have seen them together inside the docks, but nowhere else—I have had money from Dannett and O'Dwyer—I am not well up in the duties Laurie had to do—I believe I was down in A jetty when the van was stopped, I did not see it, but heard; Mr. Wood told me of it after—I saw the order of 25th March signed "Alfred Masson" on 29th, Bodley had it in his delivery foreman's box, and I saw him endorse it "On delivery to Greenwood's van, 49 cwt. sweepings. E. C. Bodley, 29th March, 1879," and I took it back to the general office—O'Dwyer was not there—I did not bring it away, I left it in Bodley's box—if the suborder on the 28th came to the docks it would have been O'Dwyer's duty to compare it with the entry ex Mabel in Ledger 24 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to see if it was in order, and whether the prime order had been lodged, and then enter it and endorse the order for delivery and hand it back to the carman who brought it, to take to the quay, and having received the goods, the carman should come back to the general office with the order and apply for a pass—the order would then be put on a file by the clerk who made out the pass—the date and quantity would next morning be entered from the order into the ledger—we would then know by reference to the ledger whether any goods were standing to the order of that account—those entries were not made in the case of the delivery on the 28th March of the 49 cwt, or of the linseed—I have been with O'Dwyer to Dennett's house; I did not go in, but waited in the street till he came back to me—I and O'Dwyer have pleaded</p>

               <p>guilty to stealing the 49 cwt.—Bodley and Laurie were the only people so far as I know who superintended the delivery at that quay—I believe they had the linseed sweepings under their control, but I do not know much about the warehouse—I made a statement at the office to Mr. Walker the day after the van was stopped—Mr. Stewart was present—O'Dwyer also made a statement—I was called as a witness and gave evidence at the police-court after I was arrested—I have not seen Dannett or Bodley since 29th March, nor Laurie until his arrest about two months afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Mr. Stewart on the Monday morning and was suspended on Tuesday, April 1st—I have seen Laurie on two or three occasions at the delivery office, and I know that on two occasions while he was acting as delivery foreman I saw him about the orders—I made a statement at the gaol before giving evidence at the police-court, to the solicitor for the prosecution, and it was taken down in shorthand—I did not say anything at the police-court about having spoken to Laurie on two or three occasions with respect to this matter; I was not questioned—it was about fifteen months ago that O'Dwyer first told me how this was done—he has given me money at different times, and I have had as much as 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time from him, and have had sometimes as much as 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to hold for him—I have not received more than 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Dannett—I could not say how many times I have seen Bodley for the purpose of having these orders not backed, but I think more than six times within less than fifteen months—about fifteen months ago O'Dwyer told me to assist, and I began soon after, and Bodley was the delivery foreman—sometimes we got goods out in this way two or three times a month, but sometimes we did none for two or three months—I have no idea as to when I first saw Laurie acting for Bodley—I should think Bodley was not there, but I have seen him when Bodley was there—I went to see either of them; Bodley under<lb/>stood the business, and if he was there I did not speak to Laurie—nobody was present but the shorthand writer when my statement was taken down—I saw Laurie on the Saturday between 1 and 2 o'clock before the second delivery.</p>

               <p>sent to the general office to go into the ledger—I find an entry at folio 299, ledger 24, of 49 cwt. of sweepings due to Messrs. Tamvaco ex Mabel—it is entered by a clerk—the ledger was under O'Dwyer's control, and there should be a stowage book—when an order is presented the ledger is referred to by the ledger clerk O'Dwyer or one of his assistants, who would compare it with the ledger to see that the order was in every respect correct—he would then enter it in the register order book, and from there post it in the ledger, then write instructions for delivery, and sign the order and instructions and hand back the order to the carman presenting it to take to the delivery foreman (Bodley), who would search out the goods and give instructions for delivery—immediately after delivery the foreman would take the carman's receipt in the warehouse receipt-book, enter the orders and particulars of delivery in the day-book, and refer the carman to the general office for his pass—the pass would be prepared under the direction of the senior of the division, O'Dwyer, who before issuing the pass would see that the order had been properly endorsed by the foreman; the order would then be retained in the office, the record of the delivery to be posted in the ledger afterwards—the original entry would be in a separate column, the order column; there is another column for particulars of delivery, headed "actual delivery"—they would be posted in the ledger to one entry, but to different columns and at different times—the record is then complete—with reference to the 49 cwt sweepings, ex Mabel, delivered 28th March, there is no entry in the order column or the actual delivery column—as far as the ledger was concerned, on 1st April there were still 49 cwt. of sweepings standing to the order of Tamvaco and Co.—upon an order being presented on 29th March it would appear that no delivery had been made of that 49 cwt.—I have examined the register order book—there is an entry on 27th March of an order No. 1076 under the heading "Ship's name" Mabel, ledger reference 24, fol 299, "description of goods" wheat sweepings—I think it is O'Dwyer's writing—it shows that at the chief office a delivery order was received by O'Dwyer in respect of goods ex Mabel—there is no entry of the delivery order in the ledger—the delivery order itself is always posted in the ledger—there is no record whatever in the day-book of any delivery on 28th March—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the foreman's day-book, in which the foreman should post up his work as it is completed, but there is no record in it of the 49 cwt. sweepings ex Mabel on 28th March, but there are other entries of that date, I cannot say whose handwriting, and there ought to be a record of that delivery—there should also be an entry in the warehouse book, but there is not—I think Laurie has been in the docks seven or eight years—he was a permanent foreman, which is a rank above a permanent labourer—he was in a position of trust—he came first as a messenger—I have searched amongst all the papers, and find no delivery order for delivery of the goods ex Mabel—I find no pass for the 17 bags linseed or the 49 bags wheat sweepings on 28th March—O'Dwyer and Gilbert made statements in my presence on 1st April—I did not seek for Laurie, and do not know the last time he came to the docks.</p>

               <p>record of delivery of 28 sacks linseed to Tripp's cart on or about 21st March, 1879—this order has been lodged at the chief office—it is an order by Starkey, March 14th, 1879, for delivering 28 bags linseed to order of 6. and A. R. Barnett, ex Royal Alice, endorsed as delivered 15th March, 1879; also 25th March, 1879; further delivery signed "G. Gair" of 44 bags linseed to Wynn's van in two stacks—the endorsement by Starkey, "Weigh over and hold to my order, Royal Alice," is not the way it should be endorsed if he desired to use it to get the goods out of dock; there should, in addition to the prime order, have been a sub-order directing delivery to a certain conveyance—you cannot use the prime order to get delivery unless the instructions are clear to deliver; it gives authority merely for the goods to be weighed over and restowed—the endorsement of Gair indicates a delivery on March 25th, 1879, of those sacks—I examined the ledger subsequently on 1st April, after certain inquiries had been made, and found no entries of delivery of these goods—there is no entry of that delivery in Bodley's day-book—there is an entry on the 25th in the day-book—I have found no pass with reference to the 21st or 25th, and no sub-orders—I find these two prime orders (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were lodged at the docks on or about 22nd March for goods ex Mabel and ex Gilbert Thompson.

The goods contained in the two sub-orders, ex Mabel and Gilbert Thompson, have not been marked off in the ledger—I find ex Royal Alice that Starkey had only one lot of 44 sacks standing to his order, and had no other goods except the Gilbert Thompson and Mabel—I find no record of the delivery on the 27th except the pass—there is no endorsement on the back of the two sub-orders—up to the time I gathered information about this matter there were no means of tracing the delivery on the 27th in any books or documents of the company—I have gone through the delivery of all goods to Starkey</p>

               <p>from 25th February to the end of March, and have taken the tonnage, &amp;c.—I find by the ledger the whole tonnage is about 16 1/2 tons—that includes a delivery to Starkey of 132 bags ex Mabel, which has nothing to do with the delivery ex Mabel we are now dealing with—after certain matters had been gone into on or about 1st April, I received these two sub-orders; they were presented on the 7th April.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. The weighing of the Dock Company is conclusive as between buyer and seller—the seller would invoice the goods from our weights—a cart note should be sent with each delivery, and it is generally done—it is a duty connected with the outdoor department—I am not aware of 7 cwt. of rape seed having been delivered from the ship Marian on 28th May, 1879, without any description whatever—I have no personal knowledge of goods being delivered without a cart note—132 bags of linseed would be about 194 cwt. or 9 3/4 tons—I think it would be three loads—a prime order might be a good delivery order if endorsed for delivery to the conveyance—it would then be treated as a sub-order and cover the full extent of the order—it would be returned to the carman—in reference to the delivery of the 28 sacks (44 bags), 28th March, I find no record in any of the books—if there had been in that case a prime order endorsed as a sub-order I should expect to find an entry in the warehouse book by the foreman Gair—it would be his duty to enter it—the proprietor of goods may send his conveyances-as he pleases—I did not see the 32 bags or the 132 bags leaving the Dock Company's premises—the books show that the bags left between the 18th and 20th March; but I have no actual knowledge of the delivery—it would be the ledger clerk's duty, one of O'Dwyer's assistants, at the office to enter the 132 bags—the evidence of the delivery I find in the ledger, the day books, and orders endorsed by the foreman and the warehouse receipt book—I have gone over those books and satisfied myself that the entry is made in them and the order is endorsed.</p>

I am carman to Mr. Wynn, greengrocer—I have known Starkey four or five months by working for Mr. Wynn and taking his orders to the docks and have frequently fetched linseed for Starkey from the Vic<lb/>toria Docks, and sometimes from the South West India Docks—there is a private toll at the Victoria Docks and carriers have to take a ticket there and pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not have to show the tickets to my master—Starkey gave me the money before I started; I put them in my pocket and should give them up if asked for them—I found these toll tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in my pocket; I believe I have lost some—these show that I went for Starkey on 19th March twice to the docks; once on March 20th and between 18th and 27th ten times, all for Starkey, nobody else paid me for the toll—I took no orders or papers—I have been to the south side twice—mine is a two horse van—the horses will draw 3 1/2 tons, but I do not put on so much; I put on a fair load—the first time I had about 2 tons of linseed—I signed a book only once, and that was on the south side—we are supposed to sign always—I got my pass on the other side from the foreman—I had an order from the south side—I got the pass from there, I didn't go to the general office; I went across the ferry to the general office and asked for an order for Mr. Starkey, if they had got one on the south side, and I took it back and got the goods—I did not take the order I had previously got to the general office—I got my pass on the spot and went out of the docks with it—I ought to have taken it to the chief office, but I did not know at the time—I gave up my pass at the gate, they would not let me out without—I took the goods to Starkey's place, Victor Yard—there is room for a pair horse van to go through, it is not a large place—it is a little larger than this Court—on getting there I sometimes carried the goods out of the van and some<lb/>times Starkey's men have carried them—the linseed was shot in a heap and weighed on the scales, and they wrote down the weight as it was weighed, that was always done—a cart note is a sub-order—I was sent again to the south side and saw Gair, the same foreman as before—I had no papers with me at all—I got the goods again about the same quantity as before, and took them to Starkey's, where they were weighed and shot—I got a pass for them from the foreman and did not go to the general office at all on that day—I went out of the docks and left my pass at the gate—I remember signing a book once (<hi rend="italic">warehouse book produced</hi>), this is my signature, "Received into Wynn's van, 28 sacks linseed and 44 empty bags, 25th March, 1879, J. Tripp"—that is all I did—on the 27th I re<lb/>ceived further instructions from Wynn to go to Starkey—I received no papers from Starkey—I went with the two horse van to B jetty, without going to the chief office, and saw the foreman at No. 5 shed—I got 30 sacks (about 2 1/4 tons) of linseed, and a quantity of empty bags—I got</p>

               <p>this pass from Bodley, the delivery foreman, and-left it at the dock gates without going to the chief office—I signed no receipt book—I ought to have taken an order, but never did so, I only applied for the goods and they were delivered to me—I have never been with a licensed carman—I had been as a carman on jobs to the docks before I went to Wynn's, but was not a regular carman and did not know much about the practice—I got the goods and did not think anything improper was going on—I took them to Starkey's place and they were unloaded, weighed, and shot.</p>

I don't know how many journeys I went to the docks for, Mr. Wynn—he works for other people besides Starkey, but I have only been once to the docks for another man, Mr. Watts, and that was some time before—I always came back with a load except once—I had no written orders to go to the docks—each journey took about four or five hours—I have made two journeys in one day—I got two toll tickets on the 18th and two on the 19th—I was always at work at 6 a.m.—the average load was 2 or 2 1/2 tons, I brought more sometimes—I could put 3 1/2 tons in the van, but the road is very heavy and I only took a fair load—I have had 4 tons on; they are only two ponies—if I had six tons to bring I should make 3 loads and a one-horse load to follow, if I could—if asked I should sign the warehouse receipt book—I believe it was my duty to sign it—I have been asked but not generally, and when asked I signed—I never had any papers but the pass, and have never taken papers from one office to another and back again except once, on the south side—the pass was all I wanted to get out of the dock, and I should not trouble about anything more unless asked—I did not think anything was wrong—if I had been accustomed to sign receipts and get other papers I should have asked for it, and might then have suspected there was something wrong—I had no memorandum of the weight of the goods and no account of charges against the goods—I have been stopped with timber because the charges were not paid before I came to Mr. Wynn—if any charges remained due they would stop the goods until they were paid—I do not know if part of the goods could be taken before paying the charges—I was never stopped for charges on goods in this case—I had instructions what part of the docks to go to—on one occasion I was sent to the north side, and Bodley told me at the docks to go and see O'Dwyer on the south side, and I did not knew where to go, and he did not tell me—I went home empty and told Mr. Starkey—that was the only lost journey—my first journey for Starkey was on a Shrove Tuesday, I do not know the month—I do not know the date of the last journey, I have it down in a book—it was linseed—I do not know what sweepings are—I have had rapeseed and linseed.</p>

I carry on business with my father, and I manage the business—this is my book—we have a good many other customers, but we do not provide any of them with books—I gave this book to Starkey—it was an exceptional thing to give him the book, but I did so because I could not get the correct weights from the carman—I trusted to Starkey to keep the account, as the carman would not know the weights—I have carried to the docks, but not from there for anybody else—the carman should bring me the weight; I do not know if the Dock Com<lb/>pany ought to give him the weights—he should get them from the man who hired him—all the carriage for Starkey was not from the Victoria Docks; a good deal has been to or from other places, the General Steam Navigation Company, the East and West India Dock Company, the West India Dock Company, Atkins's Wharf, and Rooks and Spencer—I gave the book to Henry Starkey in a perfect condition, and he returned it as it is about the end of April—it is a book I had by "me—I will not swear it was perfect—I could not rely on the weights given by the carman for any of the wharves; I could not check the weights.</p>

I have studied surveying, and understand the making of plans—this photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) represents Nos. 1 and 2, Vine Cottages, or Mayfield, Richmond—they are detached cottages, and alike—Mrs. Thomas lived in No. 2, and Miss Ives in No. 1—this plan (<hi rend="italic">marked "A"</hi>) shows the basement of Nos. 1 and 2 side by side—this other plan (No. 2) shows the ground-floor, with the gardens front and back, and the side door—an iron fence divides the gardens in front, and a park paling at the back—the side door leads along a passage to steps which go down into the scullery by a back door, and if you do not go down the steps, into the dining-room—I have also made this plan ("C") showing the position of the two houses with reference to the neighbourhood and Richmond Bridge—this plan ("D") is a plan of the neighbourhood where the witnesses Church and Porter lived at Rose Gardens, Hammersmith—the distance from Rose Gardens to the beginning of Hammersmith Bridge is 1,825 yards, rather more than a mile—the Oxford and Cambridge public-house is 157 yards from Hammersmith Bridge—the toll-gate is on the Middlesex side—the length of the bridge is 277 yards—the other side of the bridge is in Barnes parish.</p>

               <p>visit my mistress, and I knew that she was in the habit of attending the Presbyterian services at the Lecture Hall; I saw her there on the morning of the 2nd March; she took the sacrament in the morning—I saw her again in the evening at the same place, about 6.45—she used to generally occupy a particular seat—I spoke to her in the lobby, and I noticed that she ap<lb/>peared very excited—the service had commenced when she came in, and she sat down in a seat behind the door; that was not the seat usually occupied by her—when the service was over I noticed that Mrs. Thomas was not there, and I never saw her again alive—Vine Cottages are about a quarter of an hour's walk from the Lecture Hall—the bonnet now produced I have no doubt is the one that was worn by Mrs. Thomas; I had seen her wearing it on previous occasions.</p>

I live at Richmond, and am apprenticed to Miss Ives, at 1, May field—I am not related to the last witness—I generally went to Miss Ives's at 8 in the morning and left between 8 and 9 at night; I did not sleep there—I knew Mrs. Thomas, who lived next door—I saw her the last time alive at Miss Ives's house on 27th February, and she gave me a message to deliver to Miss Ives—on Monday, 4th March, I went to Mrs. Thomas's house, and the prisoner answered from the window over the door—I told her that Miss Ives intended to send some men to see to the roof as soon as possible—she said "I was coming round to Miss Ives to tell her there is no need to send the men round, as the water has disappeared from the roof"—she also said she knew it was only the snow which had penetrated the roof, and then she said "We are just cleaning up, as we are expecting people in to-night"—she had her sleeves tucked up—on the previous day I had noticed a card in the window with "Apartments to let" on it—I did not see that on Tuesday—I returned to Miss Ives and told her what the prisoner had said, and the same evening about 8 o'clock I heard a noise in the adjoin<lb/>ing house, No. 2, of people coming into the house, and I heard the fire being poked, and some one trying the piano like thumping on it, not like ordinary playing—Mrs. Thomas used to play pretty well—I did not hear any voices—on Thursday night about 8.30 I noticed a light in Mrs. Thomas's drawing-room; the blinds were drawn down—I saw nothing of the prisoner that week after the Tuesday, but' in the next week, on the Thursday or Friday night about 8.30, I saw her arm-in-arm with a man at the top of the road walking towards the house—I did not see his face; he was wearing an Ulster coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Mayfield, and am the leaseholder of the next house, No. 2, which I let to Mrs. Thomas from Michaelmas last—a little girl, named Edith Menhennick, lived with Mrs. Thomas from September till nearly the end of January, and the prisoner came quite at the end of January or the beginning of February—Mrs. Thomas came to me on the last Thursday in February, I think it was the 27th; I did not speak to her but received a message from her—on Saturday, 1st March, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I saw her planting a flower in the garden, and I never saw her again—on Monday, 3rd March, I heard a noise in No. 2, as though washing was going on, and some clothes were hung out in the garden before 8 o'clock; all that morning there was a very strange smell, and I mentioned it to one of my apprentices—I saw in the garden a white flannel vest, two pairs of flannel drawers, one or two sheets, and a white cotton or calico petticoat—they were not there on the Sunday; they remained till Wednesday—on the Monday and Tuesday night I heard noises in the house, a deal of moving, but no voices, and we heard them light the fire and a sound of chopping wood on the hearth and poking the fire up to about 9 o'clock—about 1.30 on the afternoon of 3rd March I noticed the breakfast things on the table in the dining room, and they were there the next day at the same time—I cannot say whether they had been removed and replaced in the interval—I noticed at dusk on the Tuesday evening that they had been removed—I sent Mary Roberts to the house with a message on the Tuesday morning, and she came back with a message to me—Mrs. Thomas's bedroom was what was called the long room over the hall and over the side entrance, it goes right through—I do not mean the drawing-room—on the Tuesday evening we heard the noise of people coming into the house—we heard their footsteps, and male and female voices, but could not hear the words—we also heard some one touching the keys of the piano to make a sound—I have heard Mrs. Thomas play well—I saw Mrs. Keighley on the Wednesday afternoon; I think it was about 4 o'clock, and in the evening I heard sounds like the filing of iron</p>

               <p>in Mrs. Thomas's front kitchen—I recognised a man and a child in the house—I saw a cabdriver go to the house on 11th or 12th, and on Saturday 15th I saw the prisoner in the dining-room with the window open—I suppose there was some one with her, for she said, "Lizzie, I think you want a pin or two"—about the end of that week I was in the garden; the fence is low, and I saw a man in the back dining-room writing in a small note book; his hair was like Church's, but the window sash came across his head so that I could not see him—on Tuesday, the 18th, about 11.40, I saw the prisoner in the front garden going into the next house; she looked at me and went on, and I went in—about the 7th two furniture vans came, a large one and a small one—I saw Weston there; he was a stranger to me, but I had some conversation with him outside—the prisoner was coming down the stairs of Mrs. Thomas's house, and the door was wide open—shortly afterwards the prisoner came to me and said, "Is it Miss Ives who wishes to know where the furniture is going to?"—I said "Well, I should like to know"—she said "Mrs. Thomas has sold her furniture; a man here can show the receipts; Mr. Weston is going to take it to Ham<lb/>mersmith"—I said "Where is Mrs. Thomas?"—she said "Don't know," and turned herself away—she was very much agitated, her face was quite convulsed, and she could hardly speak to me—I said "Can't you give me her address?"—she said "No"—I said "You must excuse me, I will attend to it," and shut the door—she came forward to come up the steps to speak to me, which made me say that, because she looked so frightful—I then went to my agent, and was away nearly half an hour—when I got back one of the vans was just moving; that was about a quarter or 20 minutes to eight, and it was quite dark; but I saw the prisoner and six or seven men standing outside the gate; it was hardly light enough to recognise who they were, except Weston—as I went up the path one of them, I think it was Weston, looked over the gate—next day, two men, strangers to me, came to my house and asked me some questions, and I gave them some answers—I thought the first was Mr. Porter—in the evening Church and Porter came to inquire after Mrs. Thomas—on 22nd March, Mr. Hughes, Mrs. Thomas's solicitor, came, and Porter and a police inspector.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was nothing unusual in washing taking place in Mrs. Thomas's house, and then they would use the copper to the best of my knowledge, but the clothes were out unusually early, 8 o'clock; it was never so early before, but I will not undertake to say that they were not washed the night before—on the Sunday night, about 8 o'clock, before my apprentice left, I am sure I heard the voices of men and women—I said at the police-court that I heard several voices, and that they appeared to be the voices of men and women—that was while my apprentice was there—I was in the workroom with her before she went—she could hear them too if she was listening—they were such as to attract my attention, and she was sitting at the same table with me—I was the nearest to the next house—I heard the sound up to nearly 10 o'clock, but did not hear any one go out of the house—Mrs. Thomas's side-door is away from my house, and I should not hear anybody go in that way—I heard no one go up on the Tuesday night from the draw<lb/>ing-room to the bedroom; we could not hear that usually—the gas was alight; I cannot tell if the gas was put out that night, but Mrs. Thomas's hack bedroom window was left open for a day or two; it was open early on</p>

               <p>Wednesday morning, and it was in the same position the day before—on the Wednesday, about 6 p.m., I heard sounds of a man and a child; the man was singing in the kitchen, but only at intervals, and this filing was going on, but he was not singing so as to deaden the noise of the filing; he only gang a note or two; it was discordant, and then he stopped—the filing went on all the evening, but it ceased now and again—I said nothing at the police-court about singing and filing, but I said that I heard a man's voice—I said it first at the Treasury—it was on the 11th or 12th that I saw a cab drive up about 11 o'clock at night, and two women, and two or three men, and a little child got into it—one of the women was shorter than the prisoner, and one about the same height—the prisoner was one of them; I am sure of that—I said at the police-court "One woman resembled the prisoner," but I am sure it was her, because she had on the large waterproof cloak and the black hat which she usually wore—during 10 days or a fortnight people were con<lb/>tinually coming to the house at all sorts of odd hours, and taking away things in cabs, and we thought it strange—when they came that night the woman had a large white parcel—I only saw cabs come there on two nights; one came on Saturday—I only saw a parcel taken away on one night—the prisoner did not ask me before I shut the door whether I wanted my rent; she did not say a word—I did not see her when I came out again to go to the agent; as far as I know she had gone into the house—I was away half an hour, and when I came back I saw her in the road—I have not the slightest doubt about that; she was the nearest to the gate—the men went away with the last van; they all moved together, but the prisoner was first—she did not look to be separate from them as if she had left them—I said at the police-court that I thought it was Henry Porter who came in the middle of the day; I thought he came twice, in the evening and in the middle of the day—what I said was that Church came in the day, and came with another man in the evening; he was a much younger man than Church.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I only saw things taken away once—I saw a cab twice—I did not recognise anybody with the van but Weston—I only waited at the door while they were letting me in—the first van was just passing the gate and the second had not moved.</p>

               <p>years—I knew her as Kate, but not by another name—she had a black cloth bag, glazed, under the table; about so long and so deep, with handles which were loose, there was no string to attach them—the bag was open, and I saw a brown paper parcel in it—my father returned after 6—it was half an hour since I first saw her—my father's name is Henry—she said "Halloa, Harry I how are you?"—he said "Quite well, thank you"—we then had our tea, during which she said that she had a nice house at Richmond—after tea my father and Kate went out, and she said she wanted me to go with her to carry the bag as far as Hammersmith Bridge, as she was going to meet a friend; I said "All right," and my father said he would go a little way with us—we three left the house at 7; my mother went to bed before we started, as she was not well—I carried the bag as far as the Angel, and then my father carried it, it was heavy—I saw my brother at the Angel—we started from Rose Gardens, through Boston Terrace, through Baynham Street and Cambridge Street, through the town towards Bridge Road, and then we turned to the right to the Oxford and Cambridge—we only went through part of Glenthorne Road—before we started Thurlow came to our house—we went past the Angel to the Broadway, and then to the bridge—my brother is employed at Chipmell's, the baker's; my father and Kate spoke to him; I did not hear what they said, but he carried the bag from the Angel to the Oxford and Cambridge, which is close to the bridge—my father, Kate, and I, went in there and had something to drink, and the prisoner said she was going to take the bag to a friend over the bridge—my father said "How long will you be?—she said "Not long"—I said "I will help carry it if she wants me"—she said "No, I can carry it myself," and left the house with it—I did not hear my father say any<lb/>thing—I went outside and saw her go to the bridge; it was dark, and I missed her going past the only shop that is in the road—I then went in again—it was 9 o'clock when she left—it took us over an hour to walk from Rose Gardens to the Oxford and Cambridge—we did not go fast—we stopped at the Angel, and I went to a water-closet at the Royal Oak for five minutes; they were going on, and my father halloaed back for me—we were at the Oxford and Cambridge half an hour before the prisoner left with the bag; she came back without it in twenty minutes; I don't remember her saying anything as to—where she had been—she showed us three or four rings in a box like a cigar-case; I had it in my hand; she said they were her sister's, who had died, and had sent them to her; my father saw them; I cannot say whether the landlady was there—the prisoner also produced some photographs; one was as big as a shilling; she said it was her por<lb/>trait, and said "It ain't like me"—it was not like her; the other was a young woman, who she said was her sister who was dead—she gave me the rings in the cigar-case, and said "Mind these till we get home"—I said I had no good pockets, and gave the case back; she put it in her pocket, and gave me two keys, and said "Mind these; they unlock the door"—she asked if I might go to Richmond with her; he consented; it was understood I was to return the same night—I held the keys in my hand—my father went with us as far as the District Railway, Hammersmith; that is the new station to Richmond—Kate took the tickets—I heard her say that she was Mrs. Thomas—we went to the new station at Richmond, and then walked to Vine Cottage—I still had the keys—we did not stop anywhere after we got out of the train, and I do not</p>

               <p>know whether I told him or not—I have got a bad recollection—it did not strike me as very curious that she should take a box and go and meet somebody without letting me go on over the bridge—I think it was a thing she she was likely to do—I think I gave my evidence three times at the police-court—I don't know how far it is from Rose Gardens to the Oxford and Cambridge; it might take me more than half an hour to walk it, it all depends on how you walk, whether slow or fast—I did not stop at the place of convenience a quarter of an hour; it is at the Angel—I don't exactly know whether I said at either of my examinations at the police-court that my father, the prisoner, and I, all three went inside the Angel; what I said was "I carried the bag as far as the Angel, my father took it and carried it to the Oxford and Cambridge"—I did not say anything about going inside the Angel or about going to the water-closet—the prisoner gave me the keys in the Oxford and Cambridge—I might have stated that before the last examination, or I might not; I might have said so in the first place—I don't know whether I said anything about it until the 10th May—she went in at the side door—she gave as a reason for that that the lock of the front door was broken—I only thought of that yesterday—I went out at the front door sometimes—on that night I went out at the side door—there are some steps to the front door—she and I did not carry the box and bag down the stops of the front door that night; I think it was at the side door—when the prisoner first came to our house on the Tuesday, my mother was at tea with us; I can't swear it, I can't be sure she was at tea with us—she was not lying on the bed at the time we were having tea; I will swear that—I did not hear my father give evidence at the police-court—I had no conversation last night about saying my mother was at tea; nor this morning, with my father and mother—I shall not say whether she was or was not at tea with us—the prisoner might have asked my father and me to see her off to the railway station, and she might not—she wanted me to carry the bag; we walked along as far as the Angel, and my father then took the bag; he might have taken it a little before we got to the Angel—I saw my brother William at the Angel; father spoke to him and then carried the bag to the Oxford and Cambridge—I don't know whether I said anything at the police-court about meeting my brother William and going into the Angel and having some beer—I don't think I said so up at Richmond—I think it was at the Oxford and Cambridge that she asked my father to let me go home with her; that was near 8 o'clock—we started from the station for Richmond about 9 o'clock or a little after—I don't know how long it took us to get from the station to Richmond; it might take more than a quarter of an hour—I don't know what reason she gave my father for asking me to go with her to Richmond at that time of night; that is best known to himself—I did not hear her give him any reason—when we got out at the Richmond station we turned to the left, up part of the town, and then through an alley—I saw a public-house, the first public-house out of the railway station—I don't know whose house it was; the prisoner did not leave me and go in there and have a glass of ale, I am quite sure of that—when we got to the house we both had some rum—she asked me to count up the figures in the bank books and building books—I might or I might not have said that before; I don't recollect—I counted up some of them—I did not trouble how I counted—I did not count all of it up—I did not tell her any amount; I don't recollect, I won't</p>

               <p>be sure—I don't know what amount I told her—I might have told her an amount, or I might not—I have said things to-day that I did not say at Richmond—my father did not tell me that he had sworn at the police-court that one of the photographs was a photograph of the prisoner's sister—I have not heard it from anybody, only from Kate—I said she showed me three photographs, and I believed they were three females—I don't recollect that she came to tea at our house on the Wednesday after the Tuesday—I was at work that day up to half-past five—I was not at Richmond that day, only in the morning part—I did not go back to Richmond that day—I said nothing at the police-court about the rings or the sister—I might or might not have seen the prisoner at our house between that Tuesday and the 18th—I slept at my father's house every night except the Tuesday—she might and she might not have been at my father's house half a dozen times between the 4th and the 18th—I can't say whether I saw her or not between those times; I might or I might not—I might have seen her twice between those dates; I think I did—I was asked yesterday whether we went from the Hammersmith station or the Shaftesbury Road station—We did not go from the Shaftesbury Road station—when we left the Oxford and Cambridge we walked up the Bridge Road to the Broadway—we did not then go along King Street to the Angel, where my father asked the prisoner to go in and have some ale; nor did she say "No, I shall be late for the train"—we were too early for the train—when we got to the Broadway we had to wait on the platform—she and my father might have agreed to walk on to the Shaftesbury Road station and meet the train there—I did not hear them—they did not walk a little way in front of me along King Street—I am sure they did not—I did not hear my father ask her to go in anywhere and have some beer—I was only about two yards behind them—I did not hear what they were talking about—the Shaftesbury Road station is about a quarter of an hour's walk from the Hammersmith station—we waited about ten minutes at the Hammersmith station—I will undertake to swear that we did not go on to the Shaftesbury Road station—I had spoken to my father and Church about what took place on 4th March, before I gave evidence at the police-court—when it came to my knowledge on the Sunday morning, the same Sunday that I went to Barnes to identify the box, I spoke to both of them and the inspector and all; that was on the 23rd—I had not been up to the Court then; it was the day before I went before the Magistrate—I do not recollect my father hurrying me on as we were going to the railway station and saying that Kate would catch me up in a minute.</p>

I want a few things; perhaps they will suit me"—we were in front of the bar—he said if the things would suit him he would buy them; and if there were more than he wanted, he would put them in an auction sale—we were there a quarter or half an hour—I rather think we went into the bar parlour to arrange matters—Kate and I then went home to my place—I did not notice any conversation between Church and the prisoner while we were in Church's place—they spoke together; the prisoner said, "Church, don't you know me"—he said, "No, I don't"—she said, "I'm an old neighbour of Porter's"—she slept at my place that night—I saw her nearly every day up to the 18th—I heard from heron the next day or the day following, that Church had been down—on the 13th, 14th, and 15th (Thursday, Friday and Saturday), I was at the house with the prisoner and Church, looking over the furniture—I went with the other two on all three days—we were looking the furniture over to get a proper under<lb/>standing to buy it—previously to our going down he had offered 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not think it was sufficient—the prisoner and I went into each room separately—I left her to value it, knowing better what the things were worth—I put down the figures she gave me, and it made 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in my and her presence Church agreed to give that—the valuing was done on the 13th, and the extra 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was agreed to on that day, on the Friday, and he gave her a cheque; I believe it was a note—she preferred having gold instead of a note—he said, "It don't matter to me, at the corner of the Grove is my banking account You can go there in the morning and draw the gold"—the bank is in the Broadway, Hammersmith—we all three came away together—grocery was sent or brought by the prisoner to my house; she said some of it was for her own consumption and her little boy's—she was a good deal at my house from the 4th to the 18th—linen was also sent there—I brought it away from Vine Cottages on the Saturday, the 15th—the prisoner packed it up and put it in a cab—I left in the cab, leaving her there—I remember some plate being packed up by the prisoner—it was cleaned in my presence by the prisoner—that went to Church's—she said she had got the silver ready to take with her to Ireland at the same time she took the linen—the prisoner took it to Church's; she said she thought it would be safe there—on Tuesday, the 18th, in the evening, about 6, I went to the house and found there the prisoner, Church, and another man named Mary on—about 7 came the vans with the proprietor and two or three men—a chest of drawers and two or three other things were taken out of the house to the vans—Miss Ives next door spoke to Mr. "Weston—the prisoner said "Who is it inquiring after me?"—I said "The lady next door, that you say is your landlady"—she went to Miss Ives next door, and returned in a few minutes; she certainly seemed a little agitated—she said "Harry, come upstairs and take down a dress or two off the pegs; I want to send them to Hammersmith"—I went up with her and took down the dresses and a fur jacket—we came downstairs together and she went out at the front door I called Church's attention—she went out at the front door, and I saw no</p>

               <p>—we saw Miss Ives; I had the door closed in my face—I cannot tell you the date when I gave any information—the first person I informed was Mr. Menhenick, of Finsbury Park; Church and I went to him together—I don't know whether Church came to me or sent for me; he did not come and have a conversation with me in my front parlour; the conversation which resulted in our going to Menhenick was either in the public-house or my back room, but he wanted to know what had become of his 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell you whether he spoke to me in my back room or not, he had very seldom been in my house before the 18th—I don't think he ever had, only calling for cans; he never was in my house but once to my knowledge, and that was when we went boating on the river—I do not think he came on the 20th, the day before we went to Menhenick's, or that he and I went into my back room together, but I cannot swear it—I believe I had the conversation with him the same day that we went to Menhenick's, it was the evening part because we got to Menhenick's about 7 o'clock—I don't remember his mentioning anything about an inquest upon the contents of the box—I won't swear that he did not tell me that Dr. Adams had given some evidence about the bones in the box—I don't believe he ever mentioned there was likely to be a police inquiry, but I cannot swear it—he told me he had got a letter which was written by a friend of Mrs. Thomas—we were not nearly an hour talking together, nor yet a quarter of an hour—I do not know whether anybody else was present; we went away together—I did not think it was a very serious matter after hearing that there was an inquest—I did not think I need trouble myself at all; that being so we went away to Mr. Menhenick's; Church was the principal spokesman—I did not go to the police and give information when the box was found in the river, although my son had spoken about a box, because I had no sus<lb/>picion, or else I should have been the first to make a complaint and to lay information—I had a suspicion after my son told me that it was like the box, but I did not give information, because I did not suspect the prisoner in the least—Church never paid the prisoner 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my presence—I did not swear at the police-court that I saw two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes paid on one day, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold on another day, they might have been two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes; they were bank notes—I have said on two different occasions I saw 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid—I told the Justices at Richmond that I did not have any of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nor had I—I did not suggest to Church that he should send the police and try to get his 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back from the woman, until 21st March—Church did not pay a bill in my presence while the vans were waiting—Church did not speak to me between the 18th and 21st, only respecting his 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he thought was lost, he used every energy to get it back, and so did I; I did not go to the police about it, it would have been very wise if I had—when we went to Mr. Menhenick's, Church told the whole story as far as he was concerned and I said a few words—I did not tell Menhenick that I had had various pre<lb/>sents from the prisoner; I may have told him that while she was professing to have a comfortable home at Richmond, she was sleeping in my cottage at Hammersmith—most likely I told him that I was having grocery and meat and all sorts of things from Richmond at her expense—I know a person named Ricketts, he keeps a van, which I hired on Saturday, 15th March, to go to Vine Cottage and to bring the prisoner's boxes, or a portion of her things, but he came back without them; he only brought four chairs, an India-rubber plant, and five or six common flower pots; I paid him for that</p>

               <p>—I burnt those chairs before 18th March on a Sunday morning—I believe I had nothing else from Vine Cottage on the 15th; I did not come away with the prisoner, I came home with the laundry work when the chairs were brought to my house—I did not know that 12 lb. of beef was also brought away and that it went to Church's; we had a leg of mutton raw on the 15th from Vine Cottage, and it was cooked at a bake house next door to Church's—I was at Vine Cottage when the plate was taken away; that could not be on the 15th because we came home in a cab; it was in a small square basket, it could not have been brought away on the same Saturday before the furniture, because I came home with the prisoner and Church by the railway, and she had the basket with the silver in it then—she was at my house that night and slept there; I was at Church's that Saturday night, we all went in together, three or four of us; Church, Webster and I, all went from Richmond to Hammersmith in a cab together, and the plate was in a basket; that was on the Saturday—I made a mistake before when I said it was not the 15th—on the day I went down to value the furniture there was no one there but Webster, Church, and myself when the furniture was valued at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor was there the next day; we went down together the next day—before the 15th, when the plate and the chaise and the other things were removed, no other man but Church and myself was with Webster at Vine Cottage in my presence; I saw Church draw a receipt; I did not hear the prisoner ask him what he drew it for when the thing was between themselves—I did not hear her say anything about a receipt; it was drawn up before we got there—after I got down in the evening, Church asked me to get a receipt stamp, and I got two, one was for her to give a receipt to him on the bill; she did not in my presence, instead of signing the receipt for the money, say "What do you want a receipt for when the matter is between ourselves V nor did she say "To make it all square"—I fetched two stamps, because I did not think a penny stamp would receipt a 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—they had a bottle of brandy that day, and the prisoner could not find the corkscrew—I have no recollection of Church saying "I believe you have got it, Harry"—I had not got it—I did not leave, and say "I expect some of the property as well as you," Nothing of the kind—I went down more on her part to see that he paid a fair price for the furniture, and gave her the fair value—he knew no more than I did about it, and I only jumped at it—I went that she should have justice—I was never there till after the 8th; I was not there on the 6th, or the Wednesday or Thursday after the Tuesday—I was there on one or two occasions after the 8th, and I may have been there once for four or five hours—I never came home from Richmond but twice in a cab; we did come home late one night, about 10 o'clock; that would be from the 10th to the 16th; I cannot say the night—I went down about 6.30—I was all that time arranging about the furniture, and how it was going to be removed; Church, me, and the prisoner had something to drink, but very little—I cannot say whether that was Wednesday, 12th—the furniture had not been attempted to be packed—that was long before the plate was taken away—when I got down at 6.30 the prisoner did not appear the worse for drink—that was not Tuesday the 4th—I slid not leave Vine Cottage three times in the week which began on the 3rd and ended on the 8th—I never was there; I swear that.</p>

               <p>married eleven years, and have kept the Rising Sun nine years—on Sunday, 2nd March, my husband was at home all day; he opened the house at 6.5—he remained in the bar nearly all the evening—he was at home on the Monday all day—on Tuesday, the 4th, he came home at about 7 o'clock and brought some soles for tea—the first time I saw the prisoner was Sunday evening, 9th March, when she came with Porter about 8.30, who said "This is Mrs. Thomas"—I saw her again on the Monday morning, but had no conversation with her that day—she came to our place on Thursday, the 13th, and brought some of the plate in a basket; I put it upstairs in my bedroom—next day, Friday, the 14th, she brought some table-cloths, curtains, some chandeliers, and some mats, and said that they were to be left; she did not say till when—next day, Saturday, the 15th, she brought two glass vases and a carving-knife and fork, and said "These are for you"—on Sunday afternoon, the 16th, I went on the water with her in a boat, and my husband, my little girl, another little girl, and Mr. Porter, for about an hour—when we landed she came and had tea with me and then went away—on Monday, the 17th, she came about 11 a. m. and brought two pair of boots, and said that they hurt her feet, and if I could wear them I could have them—she stayed till about 12, till Church was ready—on Tuesday, the 18th, she came about 10 a.m., and waited till Church was ready to go to Richmond—a man named Merryman came about 11.30 to go with them—I saw her again that evening about 8.30; she came in through the bar and said "Will you lend me a sovereign?"—I took a half-sovereign out of my pocket and the rest I got from the till—she did not say what she wanted it for—I said "Is the van there?" she said "Yes, two"—there was a bonnet-box in the room; she picked it up and said "I shall take this with me, I am going to pack up all to-night;" she then left—she had no child with her—I think I should know the bonnet-box again—my husband came in alone about 9.30, and not long afterwards Weston brought some dresses in a bonnet-box or bandbox; this is it—I took the dresses up-stairs and put them on the club-room table, but did not examine them then; but on Friday, the 21st, I turned them over and felt in the apron pocket of the blue dress, and found this purse with a sort of diary inside, two pocket-handkerchiefs with J. Thomas on them, a pair of gloves, and this letter from Hamburgh Road, Finsbury Park, signed "E. Menhennick"—the purse contained these five rings, some stamps, a pencil, and a small comb—I took them all down to my husband and sub<lb/>sequently gave them to the police—I never was at the house at Richmond,—I only knew the prisoner as Mrs. Thomas.</p>

               <p>Richmond on the Wednesday with Porter, and got back between 10 and 11 o'clock—they told me they were going to buy some furniture—I did not hear him say that he came up from Richmond with the prisoner to the Thatched House, and left her there—he did not tell me when he came up whether he had been with Mrs. Thomas or not—on Tuesday the 11th he came home about 11.20, and told me he had been to Richmond with Mrs. Thomas—he did not tell me how long he had been there—on the Friday he went to Richmond again, and got back from 10 to 11 o'clock; it was not so late as 12 o'clock, but it was past 10 o'clock—I was not with him to see whether he was four or five hours with Mrs. Thomas—he did not tell me he had gone to a jeweller's at Richmond named Wood, and bought a pin or a ring, and she was to pay him back—I know nothing of that—he did not tell me that he drank brandy and smoked cigars with heron Friday, the 14th, she brought a great many articles for safe keeping, and for me—I believed her to be Mrs. Thomas; I knew no better—the basket of plate was brought down on Thursday—I remember my husband coming home from Richmond on Saturday night the 15th; he did not come in a cab to my knowledge—on that night a carving knife and fork and two glass vases were brought—I did not see Porter that night to my knowledge—when I asked the prisoner to tea I was not on more friendly terms with her than anybody else; I had been on the water with her—I had no meat sent by the prisoner from Richmond—I did not have a large piece of beef to my knowledge on Sunday the 16th for dinner—I do not know what I had—I never had any meat from Mrs. Thomas; she brought the boots and laid them on the sofa, and said "If you can wear these you can have them," and I took them—my husband said "I won't have the dresses," but I said "I will, she has had a sovereign from me"—I do not know his reason for refusing them—he had not told me what had passed at Richmond, but I knew there was something—he got home about 9.30, and Weston brought in the dresses soon after<lb/>wards, and placed them on the bar—it did not seem so long as two or two and a half hours afterwards—my husband had not told me that the furniture had been stopped, or that Mrs. Thomas had run away, but when he came home he seemed upset.</p>

               <p>Porter went with me to have a glass of ale—next day, Tuesday the 18th, I went down with two vans and got there before 7 o'clock; Maryon was there, but he had nothing to do with me—some things were brought out of the house and put into one of the vans—Miss Ives spoke to me in the garden at the front door of No. 2, and wanted to know where the furniture was going to be taken to—I told her I did not know exactly, and said, "There is the lady at the door," pointing to the prisoner and Church—the prisoner went on and spoke to Miss Ives, who went back into the room—Church then said, "There is something wrong, we had better fetch the goods back out of the van," and that she had led him astray, or something to that effect, and he would not have anything to do with it—I had been paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as a deposit on the 14th, and Church made it up 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the things were taken back into the house, and the prisoner brought some dresses out on her arm and threw them into the van and said, "Take them home, I am off to the station"—that was ten minutes or a quarter of a hour after she came from Miss Ives—I think she also brought out a bandbox, similar to this, but I won't be sure—she said, "Give me that black dress back," it was taken out of the van and she took it away with her and went towards the station—that was the last I saw of her—she was alone—I did not notice whether she had a bonnet on—I was in a covered van and could not see where Church was—the goods were put back, the house was shut up, and we moved off with the vans—there were three men who I took with me, and Marion, Porter, and Church—we all went away together, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the prisoner left; and went to a public-house round the corner and had some drink—I heard that Church, Porter, and Marion, went back by train and we went by van—when we got home I took the dresses and the band-box out of the van at Church's and put them on a form, and Church told me to take them to No. 10—that is Porter's, but I left them at Church's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She has always been a kind-hearted, good sort of girl, as far as I know, and affectionate and grateful for kindnesses done to her—my husband had an illness for four months, during which she nursed him and waited on him all day, and did all she could for him—she was then in a situation at Mr. Mitchell's, and came backwards and forwards simply for the purpose of being kind to my husband and bringing him things—she was fond of me and very fond of the child—I never heard her say or do anything unkind to anybody—she came to my house every Sunday night but one to see her child—I cannot recollect what Sunday that was—it was on Saturday, 8th March, that she came and said she was going to take the child away on the 12th, and I noticed that she did not come to see her child next day, Sunday, the 9th—I cannot recollect that she stayed away any other Sunday—she stayed away one very wet Sunday—I cannot remember whether she came on the Sunday before the 9th—she was never away two Sundays running—she told me that Mrs. Thomas was a very nice lady, very kind and good-hearted—she appeared very fond of her as a mistress.</p>

It is very hard the innocent should suffer for the guilty"—I had previously cautioned her not to make any statement without considering the whole thing; and I also said, "I hope you will not say a word against an innocent person"—I said that before she said a word about any other person—the night before I said that she said she intended to tell the truth and the truth only—on the steamboat between Dublin and Holyhead she made a very long statement—it was a continuous statement—she stopped sometimes because she was not very well, she was inclined to be sea sick—it was all one statement—I did not take it down as she said it—it was very rough on board—at the police station at Richmond, on 30th March, I repeated her statement verbally in her presence to Inspectors Jones and Pearman, and it was then taken down by Jones as I repeated it—then Church was called in—he was not then in custody—the statement was read over to him and the prisoner—she said it was true—during the writing down the prisoner said she wished to make some addition, which was not then taken down, but afterwards it was—at the end of the reading Webster said, "That is quite true"—Church seemed to be laughing at it—I told him to be careful, I thought it was a serious case—he said, "The lying woman, how can she say that about me? I know nothing of her"—when Church was brought in first he was introduced to identify the prisoner—he said, "I think that's Mrs. Thomas"—Church at the end of the interview was given into custody—in consequence of a letter I received I went on the 15th of April with Inspector Jones to the House of Detention—Mr. O'Brien, the prisoner's solicitor, was there with the prisoner—she made a long statement, after being cautioned, which was taken down by Inspector Jones from her lips, word for word.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of 27, Buchanan Cottages, Rose Gardens, Hammersmith—in March this year I had been three months steward of the Oak Slate Club, which met once a month, on the first Monday in the month—there is a box belonging to the club which is kept locked, and there are three keys; it cannot be opened without the three keys being there at the same time unless it is broken open—I kept one key, Mr. Taylor kept the other, and John Church, the treasurer, the other—I attended three meetings as steward, the last was on 3rd March; it began at 7 p.m.—the box was not opened till a few minutes afterwards—Mr. Wood bridge and I were then present and several others—Mr. Taylor and Mr. Church opened it, and Mr. Woodbridge, the secretary—it remained open till 10.30; during that period I kept, the money and gave it to Mr. Church, who put it in a box—at 10.30 there was a little bit of a dispute about paying some of the club members, and they kept the box open, or otherwise it would have been closed at 9 o'clock—the box was locked up and Church took it away at very nearly 11 o'clock—Mr. Rickworth and Charles Alexander and John Church locked its up with three keys—from the beginning of that meeting down to the very end, 11 o'clock, John Church was there—I left the Rising Sun about 11.4 as nearly as I can tell you, and Church was then behind the bar.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been a member of the Slate Club three years—I have not been there at other meetings—I am not steward now—I don't know whether this matter was much spoken about afterwards—I use Church's house sometimes; I live about a quarter of a mile off—Church's being given into custody for the Richmond murder was a good deal spoken of in his house—I knew his brother by sight, or her brother, I do not know which he is—I have bade him good morning—he has never spoken to me—I have been to the Slate Club one night since 3rd March—I was there at the next meeting, 3rd April, but did not stop; I came away directly; I was not steward then, Rickworth had succeeded me, that was the reason he</p>

               <p>had the key—I only stopped five minutes or a very little more—I will swear I did not stop an hour—I believe Church's being given in custody was spoken of at the Slate Club while I was there, but I do not know—Church was at the club on 3rd March, but not at the April meeting—yes, it was spoken of, but I cannot tell you by who—the conversation about it was not general while I was there, but I heard it spoken of; if I heard Alexander say anything I have forgotten it—I did not hear Rickworth say anything—the box was opened that night, the first Monday in April—Mrs. Church brought the key when he did not happen to be in the house, he left the key with her, and the two others opened the box with his key; that was so on other occasions and the key was always left with Mrs. Church—Church was not there in April, but I can swear that he was never absent from the club-room on any night before April this year, that is for the first three months; the keys were not left downstairs at Church's, I always took mine home; if I were not going I should send the key by my wife, but I never did—I can tell you when I was first asked to give evidence in this case, but my head is not so good as it used to be—I am looking at a book, it was on April 27th; my eyes are so bad, I cannot see without my glasses; these numbers in the book are the days I have been up and have had to attend here and at Rich<lb/>mond, and my railway fare, these other figures relate to my work; 40 means 40 tons of chalk washing, and 303 means 303 tons; here is "Railway fare; Richmond, 8—8—8; Old Bailey, 8—8—8," that was going to Richmond on 26th, 27th and 28th, and coming up here before the Grand Jury; this 8—8—8 means three eightpences—I don't know whether anybody was going to pay me that—I could not see the book very well without my glasses, but I could see that that gentleman Had got it wrong—I was first asked to give evidence on the Saturday before April 27th—I was not at Church's, to my knowledge, on Sunday, April 27th—I must have made a mistake if I have put down April 27th here, I took that to be the day of the month; I must have mistaken it, I cannot tell you where I was on the last Sunday in April—I have been to the Slate Club on another occasion when it was going on, but not for 12 months—I think I was in the Slate Club room on Sunday night when Church was in custody—I don't know what the date was, the room was full; I cannot say who was there; Thurlow may have been there; I did not see him—I was not talking to him—Mrs. Church's brother was not in the room with us at the time I was there—the murder case was not being talked about that I recollect—Church being in prison was talked about, but not by me; there was drink in the room and I think I paid for a pint; I did not see any given away, plenty of others paid for it—I can't say who, there were so many strangers in the room; I mean to say that I did not know every man in the room—Church first spoke to me about giving evidence after he got out of prison, he said that I should be wanted—I told him I knew nothing about the case, I did not want to have anything to do with it—I knew that I was wanted to say that he was at the Slate Club on 3rd March, he told me so himself—he did not say, "You recollect I was at the Slate Club on 3rd March;" nothing of the kind, he only said that I should be wanted; he did say that he wanted me to say that he had been at the Slate Club—I knew that I should be wanted, and that the evidence I was to give was about his being at the Slate Club on March 3rd—I knew that from Church, but he never said anything about March 3rd; he did not say anything to me about the Slate Club on 3rd March, but I knew it because</p>

               <p>I read in the paper that he said he had been at the Slate Club on 3rd March, and therefore that is what I thought I should be wanted for; plenty of the members of the club had spoken to me about Church having been there on 3rd March; they did not speak about it. that I know of, at the bar of the Rising Sun; it was publicly talked about.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was the common talk of the neighbourhood that Church was at the Slate Club on 3rd March, and he was there—he was there at each of the three meetings on which I acted as steward.</p>

I am assistant surgeon at the Westminster Hospital, and lecturer on forensic medicine there—I live at 17, Delahay Street—on the 12th March last I went to the mortuary at Barnes, and saw. some portions of a human body, but they were not then in the box, and also some portions in another box—there were the upper part of the chest, with the upper ribs, the heart and part of the right lung attached, the right shoulder and part of the right upper arm, the whole of the left upper arm, the right thigh, cut off below the joint, the right leg divided from the thigh at the knee joint, and cut off from the foot above the ankle, also a part of the pelvis, with the uterus attached, and the left foot cut off above the ankle joint—I did not notice the ovaries; they were shrivelled and dried; the soft parts appeared to have been hacked—he bones had been sawn roughly, and the division had been made without any relation to anatomical structure—the divisions of the bones might have been produced by an ordinary meat saw; with the exception of one thigh the remains were very dry, shrivelled, shrunken, and very brown, and the soft parts easily tore, the cartilage easily peeled off, and the tendons were very soft; I had no doubt that the parts had been boiled—the thigh was in a natural state; it contained fluid blood; the muscles were red, and not retracted; it appeared to have been dead a week or a fortnight, but no decomposition had taken place—that would be to some extent dependent on the weather, which was very cold at the time—I examined very carefully the articular surface of the natural thigh bone and the articular surface of the boiled lag, and found that they matched, and I also found that a bit of cartilage which had been cut off from the leg bone was adherent to the thigh bone—the pieces matched, and I formed a positive opinion that the thigh and the leg belonged to the same body—the foot had been boiled—I found no evidence</p>

               <p>of disease about it; it had been separated in the same unskilful manner as the other limbs—it was a smallish foot and matched in general size the other remains—I am sure the person to whom the remains belonged was a short person—only one long bone was entire; I measured that, it was 11 1/2in., and if we take the average of an arm bone 11 1/2in., that gives a height of a little over 5ft.—the remains were those of a woman—I found some dark-brown hair under the arm-pits, not grey—on 26th March a carpet-bag was brought to my house, tied up, containing human remains, and a little box with some burnt bones, and on the 28th I received some more bones—I have examined them, and I have recognised pieces of the left thigh bone, the small bone of the left leg, the small bone of the right arm, the hand bones of the right hand, some pieces of the haunch bone or pelvis, and some fragments of the spinal column—I found a piece of the large bone of the leg and a part of the large bone of the arm—I cannot say to which side they belonged—they had all been burnt to a cinder—there were no duplicates of those I had already found in the box—I prepared a diagram of a human skeleton, show—the burnt parts red and the missing portions differently coloured—there was no fragment of any skull—the specific gravity of the human body is such that it may float in water after death—the head will not float by itself—the body floating or not depends on the state of decomposition, and whether it is fat or not—a solid limb thrown into the water would sink, unless very much decomposed—a fat body would float while a lean one would sink—the head. would always sink—if in a box with air between the specific gravity of the wood would help it to float—I examined some black grease which the inspector produced to me in a pot, but I can only say it was black grease; it was such as would be produced by boiling any flesh, and it had been in contact with metal—that is all the remains that I had—I examined a linen cuff in the bag that came on the 26th both chemically and microscopically, and found a spot of blood on it—I found smears of blood on a house-cloth, as if it had wiped something, and a stain of blood on a flannel petticoat, as if it had soaked through some<lb/>thing; it was a pale stain—I examined the bonnet produced, and found a thick clot of blood on the velvet, a clot of blood on the rim, a clot of blood on one of the leaves, stains of blood on one of the strings, and a stain of blood on the end of one of the strings—the stains here were very thick, and looked as if the bonnet had fallen into blood—there must have been a con<lb/>siderable quantity of blood—I call it a clot in contradistinction to a stain—I examined a piece of wall paper that had been cut out and brought to me—that contained a splash of blood about three, or four inches long—it was clotted on; it must have been a big splash—I had to take part of it to examine it, and gave the rest to Inspector Pearman—the quantity of blood would be as much as from 10 to 15 drops; it had apparently struck against the wall and then run down—I also examined a little chip of wood; that also had a stain of blood on it; there was no clot there; it was as if something bloody had just touched the wood—I know it was the blood of a mammal, that is all, not that of a fish or bird; with that qualifica<lb/>tion I have no doubt whatever that it was blood.</p>

               <p>over 50—I am quite sure she was more than 4 feet unless she was deformed—I approximate it to 5 feet 2 inches—there was not the slightest means of finding out whether she came by her death naturally or by violence—a woman may die from heart disease, or apoplexy, or she may burst a blood vessel and die from vomiting or from hemorrhage—if a woman were excited and burst a blood vessel she would drop down, and there would be a copious flow of blood from the mouth—it is not possible in my point of view that they were the bones of a woman under 50—half of the pelvis has never been recovered, and a portion of the ribs and the lower portion of the body are both missing—it was never suggested to me that they were anybody's bones—I heard of a young woman being missing at East Sheen, near Richmond, but no one spoke to me about it afterwards—I had no means of judging the height by actual measurement—parts of the body had been boiled, by which I was puzzled at first—I do not agree with the theory that the remains had been in the water some days—assuming that the woman had fallen down, breaking a blood vessel, the bonnet might have fallen off and dropped into the blood-intense nervous excitement, a tremulousness of the voice, and flushing of the face, are symptoms which would naturally precede a person being attacked with a fit; if I had heard of a woman being intensely excited, so that her bonnet fell off, and her hands trembled, and her face flushed, I should con<lb/>sider those premonitory symptoms.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am a surgeon and I practise at Barnes—on 5th March I was called to the side of the river by Barnes Terrace a little before seven, where I saw a box and some human remains on the river bank—I examined them again at the mortuary—the right thigh was in a fresh condition, with fresh blood; the other portion was much shrivelled, as though it had been saturated in water or chemicals—I mentioned at the inquest that the person was probably not over 30—I thought that because of the hair of the armpit and the portion of the thigh which was unboiled—I have not made any further examination, but I have heard Mr. Bond's evidence—my opinion is the woman was over 50 years of age, and probably 5ft. 3in. or 4in. high—I cannot possibly tell within three or four inches—the body had been separated without regard to anatomical structure.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The following Statements by the Prisoner, alluded to in the evidence of the officers, were read as follows:</hi>—No. 1. "I have known John Church for nearly seven years: I first got ac<lb/>quainted when I was living two or three doors from Church's at Porter's. He used to take me out to London and to various public-houses. I met him again some months ago, and he came to my mistress's house one night worse for drink. After remaining there for some time I told him he would have to go, as I expected my mistress home from church. My mistress came home and knocked at the door, and I let her in. Church was in the back at this time. My mistress went into the front room, and she said,' Kate, don't you think I am very lute?' I said, 'No, as I have company.' He (Church) had previously told me to say that he was my brother. Mrs. Thomas said,' Who have you got here?' and I said,' My brother, who has come, to see ma' At this time he was getting sober, Mrs. Thomas went into the back room and spoke to him, and asked him to come into the front room by the fire, and she asked me if he would wish to remain all night, and he said, 'No, I must not stay all night,' and turning round to me he said, 'You know I must not stay out all night,' and I said, 'No.' Shortly after that he left. A few days after he came again into the house, and during conversation I had told him the mistress had no money in the house; he said, 'Couldn't we put the old woman out of the way?' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said,' Oh, poison her!' I said, 'You must do that yourself; I'll have nothing to do with that.' Church said,' We would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300188"/>
               <p>have her things and go off to America together and enjoy it, as I am getting tired of my old woman.' He left late in the evening. He came again on the Monday night, the 3rd of March, and bad tea with Mrs. Thomas. I waited upon them. After tea I asked Mrs. Thomas to go out to see my little boy; she said, 'Yes, Kate, and you need not hurry back.' When I returned late in the evening I noticed the light was turned down. I knocked three times at the door; the third knock Church opened the front door, when I saw Mrs. Thomas lying on the mats in the passage struggling and groaning, and he said,' Come in.' I drew back on to the step frightened to go in. At this time there was a policeman standing on the opposite side of the road, a tall dark man. Church catched me by the arm, pulled me in, and closed the door. I said, 'What<lb/>ever have you done?' He said, 'Never you mind, I have done it for her, and if you say a word about it I'll put this knife into you up to the bundle.' That was a carving knife belonging to Mrs. Thomas. I felt very faint, and when he said he would put the knife into me, I said, 'No, John, don't; I won't tell I' He offered me what I thought was a glass of water. I said, 'No, I am better now,' thinking it was poison, and that he was going to serve me the same as Mrs. Thomas. Shortly after we left the house together, leaving Mrs. Thomas there, and took a cab. I had told him I would not stay in the house by myself. We drove to near Church's house. Church saw me into Mrs. Porter's, and I remained there for the night. I got up early the next morning and went into Church's house. Mrs. Church remarked that I was out early. Church was there, and beckoned me to go up the street. I went up, and he joined me shortly afterwards, and he said, 'I can't get over to your house before one o'clock, as I got into a row with my old woman last night for being out so late again, and I must stay at home this morning to make it up with her.' I said I should not go back to the house by myself. He had the keys of the front and side door, and said be should be down by two. He asked me what time I would be down; I told him I would not be down there before night. He told me where to meet him, at the Richmond Hotel, over the bridge. I took the boy Porter with me, and as I passed the hotel I saw Church inside. I asked the boy to go on a short distance and wait. I went to the house (hotel), and spoke to Church, and he asked me what I would have to drink. I had some whisky. He then gave me the keys of the house, and said I was to go to the house, take the boy with me, and I should find a box in the back room which he had packed up tied with cord. The boy was to assist me to bring it away, not to take a cab from the house, but if we passed One on the way to the bridge we Were to take it; but we didn't, so we carried it to the bridge. Church told me to let the boy Porter keep back and not see him when I went with the box, but he would be there to see me. I took the box on to the bridge, and placed it up on the bridge; the boy went away and Church appeared. I said, 'What are you going to do with the box?' Church said, 'That is my busi<lb/>ness.' There was a tall gentleman near on the opposite side of the bridge. I left him, and he said,' Follow the boy.' I left and heard a splash in the water. I joined the boy Porter at the foot of the bridge carrying a carpet bag, which we had also brought from the house, containing books and meat. We went to the railway station and found that the last train had gone. The boy asked a cabman what he would take him home for, and he said three shillings. The boy having only two shillings, and I no change, I said,' You shall come home and sleep with me.' We both slept in one room. On going down<lb/>stairs in the kitchen I found the carpeting rolled up, and the table with a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300189"/>
               <p>leaf let down put up against the cupboard, and the boards wet, as if they had been washed, and a large fire in the kitchen, and a large saucepan on the fire full of water, but I saw no blood. About two days after, when I was cleaning up the scullery, I saw some blood on the carving knife. There was a meat saw hanging up by the fireside, but on that day I found it on a box ill the scullery quite clean. Since Mrs. Thomas disappeared, Church, Porter, and his boy has been frequently at the house, Church directing me to order meat as if it Was fur Mrs. Thomas. It has been taken to his house, cooked, and eaten there, likewise to Porter's. He called Porter in to value the goods and furniture in the house, and said to me, 'Don't you pay him for the valuation, I'll pay him.' I paid several bills; he said, 'Never mind paying them, pay Miss Ives, the landlady, to keep her quiet.' I went to pay her when they were removing the goods. I went to pay her, and she said, 'No.' She refused to take the money, and thought there was something wrong. I went back into the house and told Church, and said there was some noise being made. He said, 'I'll go out to Porter, and say I think there is some<lb/>thing wrong about this; don't move the things.' He came back and said, You will have to clear out and go to your friends,' and I left soon after. He knew where I was going; he gave me a card with his address, and said I was to write to him, and 'I'll—stop at home and braze it out,' This was on Tuesday, the 19th, and I reached my uncle's house at Greenanne on the following Friday night. I wrote to Church to his address in Hammersmith, telling him I had arrived home safely. Before leaving it was partly arranged that I should remain at home for about three weeks, that be would send me money to come back with, and then we were to go to America. I never laid a band on Mrs. Thomas, and nothing to do with murdering her, but I knew Church had done it. All the money left in the house belonging to Mrs. Thomas was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and thirty shillings. This note I changed at a fishmonger's in Richmond. Church and Porter were with me at the time. I intend to tell the whole truth, as I don't see why I should be blamed for what Church has done. I wouldn't accuse my greatest enemy of anything wrung, let alone a friend, which Church has been to me up till now."</p>
               <p>No. 2. "Mr. Church wanted to know how to get the furniture away. I told him he could manage that as well as the other business. He then asked my consent to let Porter value the furniture, so as to have a witness; he (Porter) did value the furniture at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Church drew the receipt himself, but he has not paid the money. On the next evening we were sitting on the sofa in the front room. Porter was there, and another man, I don't know his name. Church told me to look after the furniture till he removed it. He suspected Porter of moving anything. He then gave me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and called Porter's attention to it. I asked him why be wanted Porter to be acquainted with our conversation on the subject. He said,' To keep things on my side square.' Porter and the other man went on to Hammersmith. At the same time Church and I remained till the last train; that was on the Saturday night, 15th. On Sunday we went on the water. On Monday, I think about 11 or 12 o'clock, we reached down here (Richmond), and went home about half-past ten on Monday night On Tuesday morning we left home about 8 o'clock. He brought a roan with him to collect the furniture and get it ready for the vans. I asked him what he wanted to draw the receipt for, as it was between ourselves. He said, 'If I should be stopped by the landlady I shall have the receipt to produce.' The vans came at half-past 6.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300190"/>
               <p>As soon as Miss Ives saw the furniture going out, she came in and asked the carman where the furniture was going to be taken, and he declined to answer her. I was in the front room at the time with Mr. Church. He asked me who she was, and I told him the landlady; he told me not to show myself, and he would go out and tell the men to stop bringing out the furniture, and then it would not be noticed. He then returned into the house and came into the front room and asked me to go and see the landlady, and if she wanted the money for the rent he would give it to me to pay her. I asked him what I should say to the landlady. He replied, 'If she asks to see Mrs. Thomas, say she will be here in a few days' I then saw the landlady, and asked her if she wished to speak to me. She said, 'No, I want to see Mrs. Thomas.' I told her she was not at home. I asked her if she wanted her rent; she said, 'No, I want to know where the furniture is going to.' I told her it was going to Ham<lb/>mersmith. She then said, 'I will see about that.' I then went back and told Mr. Church what she said, and he said, 'I thought she was going to inform the police;' he then said, 'I have the agreement to produce, and I am not frightened, you get out of the way.' He then told me to write to him, and in case I should forget his address, he gave me his card and also his own portrait. I then left and went to Rose Gardens, and took my child away. I thought I had not enough money to travel with, and I went on to Mrs. Church's, the Rising Sun, and asked her to lend me a pound. She gave me a half-sovereign and ten shillings in silver, and I left the house. Church took the plate away on the Saturday before the Tuesday the furniture was to be removed. He was accompanied by me and Porter. We had 121b. of beef and a leg of mutton, 8lb. of cheese, 1lb. butter, 4lb. sugar, 1lb. tea, I quartern of flour, 1lb. suet, 1lb. wax candles, and 1 cake; these were taken to Church's and divided. Church taking the beef and candles and Porter the leg of mutton, cheese, butter, sugar, tea, flour, suet, and cake. All I have now told you is quite true."</p>
               <p>No. 3. 'On the 2nd of March, when Church pulled me into the house, I heard a cough in the back room, and I fell inside the front room door against the chiffonier, and upon recovering myself I saw Henry Porter standing on the mat at the front room door. He said to Church,' What is the matter with her?' Church said, 'Oh, she'll be all right in a minute,' Porter said, 'Didn't you see me coming in after you?' I said 'No.' He said, 'I was coming behind you for a long way.' I suspected he had not followed me, and I asked him,' What way did I come?' He said, "Straight up the hill by the church.' I said, 'No, I came the Cemetery way.' He then said, 'There was someone very much like you on ahead of me.' Church said, 'Don't hesitate, you both got here somehow.' Porter said, 'That's quite right, but I never saw anyone so much like her in my life.' Church and Porter then went into the back room. Alter about twenty minutes Porter came out; he turned to Church and said, 'Jack, I'll go on a little before you.' Church said, 'We are all going now in a minute.' Porter said, 'There'll be too much notice taken of us all going together.' Porter then took his hat from off the front room table, and said to Church, 'I suppose I'll see you at home to-night, and then we can talk about matters.' Porter left, and afterwards Church and me followed. We went from Richmond to Shaftesbury Road Station, and when we got to the Rising Sun, Rose Gardens, Church said, 'They are shut up; but there, come in.' I said, 'No, I won't, it is too late.' Mrs. Church then opened the door; she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300191"/>
               <p>said to Church, 'Porter is here waiting for you;' she also said, 'Isn't Kate coming in?' Church answered, 'No, she wants to get home.' Church insisted that I should go in, but I would not; he said, 'Perhaps Porter wants to see you.' I said, 'He must see me when he comes home.' I then left Church, I did not see Porter that night. I went to Porter's house, the door was opened by me, and I went into the front parlour and went to bed on the sofa. I heard Porter come in about half an hour after; he fastened the door and went into the back room, which is called the kitchen. I have often slept at the same place, and have lodged at Porter's house for six months in 1873. Shortly afterwards I heard the handle of the door of the room where I was sleeping turn, but I had it locked on the inside. I asked who was there, and Air. Porter spoke and said, It is me, Kate; I want to see you.' I told him I was undressed, and he should see me in the morning. He then said, 'Good night; I'll be going out at 5, and I'll call you.' I saw Porter at 10 minutes past 5 in the morning; he said,' I must go to work today to keep things straight; will you go home to Richmond before I come home to-night? I'll be home at 5,' I said, 'It all depends, perhaps I won't go then.' Porter said,' Church is going down, but he won't go till after dinner.' I says, 'Where did you see Church so early?' He said, 'I was there last night when you came home, didn't you know that?' I said, 'Yes; Mrs. Church said so,' He said, 'Church and me has arranged matters,' and that 'I must see him to-night if I can get off. I'll get off, for I'll not do overtime.' He then went away to his work. I stopped there till 5 o'clock that day, Monday, 3rd March, when Porter came home. I got the tea ready, as Mrs. Porter was the worse for drink. After having tea Porter said, 'Are you going down?' I said, 'Yes; I think I'll go.' He said, 'Church is to meet me as 'Hartley's. Isn't the boy going down with you, Kate?' (meaning his son Robert). I said, Yes.' The boy went to wash himself, and Porter said, 'Don't let that boy know anything only as little as you can. Porter, me, and the boy then went down Hammersmith. We went into a public-house near the old railway station and had something to drink. This was about 7 o'clock, and I said, 'Now we must get on if we are going to Richmond to-night.' We went to the new station, and finding we had some time to wait Porter said we might walk to the Shaftesbury Road. We 'done' so, and when we got to the top of the Shaftesbury Road the boy said, 'Ain't you going home now, father?' He (Porter) said yes, he would go and have another pint to himself, and then be would go. Porter asked me to come into a public-house with him, but I said, 'No, I'll lose the train if I do.' The boy was waiting for me, and he hurried him on, and said, 'Kate will catch you in a minute.' Porter arranged that he would come on to Richmond by the next train. I said, 'Can't you come by this train?' he said, 'No, I don't want the boy to know it. I don't suppose I shall see you any more to-night.' We then parted, and I went to Richmond with the boy. I saw Church at Hartley's, the Richmond Hotel. I told the boy to go on in front of me. I went in and saw Church there, and spoke to him. I told him Porter was coming by the next train; he asked me to have something to drink, and I had some whisky and water; he then gave me two keys, one of the side door, and one of the glass door at the back of the house, and said, 'You'll find a small box in the back room on the ground floor between the sofa and bookcase, it ain't very heavy. I think the boy and you can manage it; don't take a cab from the house, if you think you can't carry it; if you meet a cab you can bring it</p>

               <p>with you to Richmond Bridge; I'll be there some time before you; I'll wait here until Porter comes. Does the boy know his father is coming down?' I said, 'No, the boy suspects something, for he asked me in the train, "What is there, Kate, between father, you, and Church?" I left Church in the public-house, and joined the boy up the street, and went to the house with him. We then went in through the side entrance round to the glass door and into the back room. I he the lights, and after stopping in the house a short time we left by way of the front door, carrying between us the box mentioned by Church, and a large carpet-bag. I did not know what was in the box, but the bag contained a large family Bible and seven other books, some meat, and a number of things. We carried the box on all the way, we met no cab. Getting on the middle of the bridge we put the box down. I said to the boy, 'Now, you go on to the station and I'll catch you;' he said, 'Very well, Kate,' and went. Then Church came up to me, and I said to him, 'How long have you been here?' he said, 'Not very long;' I said,' Where is Porter, did you see him?' he said,' Yes, I waited for him; don't let the boy know we are here, go on after him as quick as you can;' I said, "Where is the cab for this box? you can't carry it;' he said, Never mind that, I'll see about it' I then left Church and, following the boy, I got a short distance away, when I heard a splash in the water. Turning round, I saw a tall dark man standing on the bridge, it was too dark to recognise him. I caught up to the boy and said, 'Did you hear anything like falling into the water?' he said, 'Yes, Kate, I thought I heard a splash of something.' We then went to the station carrying the bag between us. Finding the last train was gone for Hammer<lb/>smith, the boy insisted on going home; he had two shillings, and I having no change, I said, 'You can't get a cab for two shillings to take you.' A cabman said he would take him for three. I said, 'You had better come up and stay all night, and we'll go home in the morning early enough.' We went, and going in the same way to the house, I told him to go into the front room; I then went upstairs and took my bonnet off, coming downstairs and into the kitchen. I found a large fire there, a large iron saucepan full of water; the table with one leaf let down was removed to one side of the kitchen against the cupboard, the carpet pushed back right off the floor; the floor was all wet as if washed or scrubbed. I missed the meat saw which always hung against the fireplace, but two days afterwards, when I went into the washhouse, I found the saw standing on a large box which always stood there, and on that day I also saw a carving knife lying on the scullery floor, partly behind the box. I picked it up and found it rusty, and marks (streaky) of blood on it. I also found at that time brown paper under the sink, with dirty-looking marks upon it. The boy Porter stopped at the house all night, and slept in the same room with me. I made him a bed. I saw Church and Porter on the next evening, Tuesday, 4th of March; the two came down together about half-past 7; I had been to Hammersmith all day. Church wasn't at home, and I was home at Richmond some time before them. Church brought a bottle of brandy in his pocket; he asked me for the corkscrew, I told him I couldn't find it. I thought him or Porter had taken it. He said he didn't take it, and Porter commenced laughing. I said to Porter, You have it, then?' He said, 'Yes, of course I claim some of the things as well as other people.' Porter and Church then began talking how they would dispose of the things. I went into the back room, leaving them in</p>

               <p>the front room, and stopped there some time, then returned into the front room, and found Church and Porter in deep conversation. Porter said,' Do you know how to act, Kate?' I said, 'Yes, I know when you tell me.' Church said, 'It's easy for her to act if she'll only listen to what we tell her.' I then took a chair and sat down; I said to Church, 'Now let me hear what you have got to tell me.' Porter then said, 'If any one comes and asks for Mrs. Thomas say she is gone to the country for a few days.' He then said to Church, 'Ain't that the best thing to say?' Church said, 'Yes; and another thing you had better to do, when you want anything order it in Mrs. Thomas's name as you have always done since you have been here.' Porter then said, 'The tradespeople will think by doing that that Mrs. Thomas is here.' But I. said, 'When the bills want to be paid, she pays every week, they'll know she is not here.' Church said, 'Oh, damn the bills; we'll be moved before the bills come in. Let us get all we can while we are about it; it is no good in being too honest in this world, is there, Harry?' Porter said, 'No; if you can do it on the quiet; the thing is in not being found out' Church said, 'There is only our three selves that know it. I want a piece of the sirloin of beef for Sunday; and what do you want?' Porter said he would like a leg of mutton. Church told me when the butcher come to order it in Mrs. Thomas's name. Mrs. Thomas had two butchers, one beyond the railway station and one at the top of Richmond Hill, where the beef and mutton was got from. We bad sapper, and came off to Hammersmith. The above statement has been read over to me by Inspector Jones, in the presence of Inspector Dowdell, and is correct."</p>

C. Price—I then either took or sent it to Dr Robertson, the surrogate, to be sworn, and on his return with it either I or one of the clerks would make out the marriage licence—I find Dr. Robertson's signature to the affidavit—the marriage licence was filled up by one of the clerks; it bears the seal of the Vicar-General, and the signature of Mr. Hassard, the principal Registrar of the Arch<lb/>bishop, and it bears my initials—then, in the ordinary course, the person would pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the price of the licence, and it would be delivered to him after being read over to him to see that it was correct—I do not identify the prisoner.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This described the lady as aged 18, the daughter of Walter Thomas Hastie, Admiralty Clerk.</hi>) The age is not stated in the licence; I got that, the father's name, and all the particulars from him, and put them down as he gave them—at that time I believe I was alone with him in the vestry, he was standing close by and saw what I wrote—I noticed that the lady looked very young and spoke to Mr. White, the clergyman, about it, and he took the licence in his hand and looked at it, and said "Is this licence correct?" or some words to that effect—the prisoner said "Yes"—he stammered very much, he has an impediment in his speech, but he said it was quite correct—sir. White said, "You are sure it is all right?"—he said, "Yes, sir"—we then proceeded into the church, and the marriage was solemnised—all the parties afterwards came into the vestry, and the prisoner signed the register, Miss Hastie next, Mr. Horne next, and his wife was about to sign, but I refused to take her signature as her husband had signed, and I asked the girl to sign, and she signed Rose Rimmell.</p>

I am incumbent of St. Peter's Church, Croydon—on October 18 I remember an arrangement being made for a wedding next morning, and on the 19th at 9.30 I proceeded to the church—in conse<lb/>quence of something the clerk said, I said to the prisoner, "Is the licence correct?" he said "Yes"—he stammered very much—after that I performed the ceremony—I noticed that the lady appeared very young—after the ceremony the parties proceeded into the vestry and signed the register.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 81, Bishopsgate street Without—I have known the family of Amelia Sarah Hastie for many years—I produce a certificate of the marriage of George Hastie, stationer, and Mary Janet Drew on 19th May, 1858—also a certificate of the 'birth of Amelia Sarah Hastie on 29th May, 1862—also a certificate of the death of George Hastie, bookbinder, on 2nd March, 1869—also a certificate of marriage of John Sue Achow and Mary Janet Hastie, widow, on 22nd May, 1869—a certificate of the death of John Sue Achow on 19th November, 1871—and a certificate of marriage of Thomas Charles Price and Mary Janet Achow on 24th June, 1876—and a certificate of the death of Mary Janet Price on 24th February, 1877—I knew George Hastie and his wife—the young lady I have seen is their daughter—the mother married Mr. Achow and afterwards married the prisoner—I produce a deed dated 5th July, 1866, between George Hastie of the first' part and Mary Janet of the second part and others—it relates to certain property in which Mary Janet Hastie was to have a life-interest, and at her death, and the death of another tenant for life of a small portion, the property was to go to the daughter, Amelia Sarab, on attaining the age of 21—it is worth about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—a person named West was one of the trustees—in March, 1877, I first became acquainted with the prisoner, and by his direction I took proceedings to get a new trustee appointed, and he himself was afterwards appointed on 8th August, 1877, with a man named Ridley, who lives at Dormans<lb/>land,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at 7, Renfrew Road, Lower Kennington Lane—prior to the 10th March I was ill and unable to attend to my business—the prisoner called at my house on 10th March, but I did not see him—he called again on the 12th Or 13th, and spoke to me about the result of a matter he had in hand in the police-court, and said, "Now, with regard to my attending to the business for you, shall I account to you daily or in what way?" and he said: "All cases that can afford agency I should expect agency in; but the smaller cases I should be happy to do for nothing"—I said, "Certainly not, Mr. May, I shall do nothing of the kind"—I said first of all, "I cannot be troubled with any accounts; I cannot expect you to do my business except upon condition that you receive one-half of all the fees you take at the police-court, be good enough to keep an exact account of what you receive and pay away and then when I am well enough we can see what money there is coming to me'—the next day he sent up 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to me—the conversation took place in my bedroom—on 3rd April I saw him again in my parlour with a client who had instructed me to prosecute a man named Lytton, and I advised him, in May's presence, and a day or so afterwards I asked May what counsel he intended having, as I should like Mr. Besley to lead—he said "I should like to give young Mr. Metcalfe a brief." I said "Certainly." I do not know Mr. Metcalfe, but I should like Mr. Besley to lead; do not mark Mr. Besley's brief, less than seven guineas and two guineas, and do not mark Mr. Metcalfe's brief, if you engage him, less than four and one," and I drew a cheque for Â£20 and handed it to May—I went out of town for a week, and saw May on 22nd April, on my return—I asked him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300201"/>
               <p>how Lytton's matter was going on, and said, "Is there anything more you want to say to me?"—he said "Oh, yes, I shall want some more money in that case of Lytton's." I said "Have you spent all that £20?"—he said "Oh, yes, I had to have several conferences with Besley and Metcalfe, and had to pay them their consultations and the fees on their briefs, and the prosecutors are going on with the indictment in Davis's case; I therefore had to brief Besley and Metcalfe in that as well—I said, "Very well, Mr. May, if you have spent the money properly I bad better give you some more," and, belie ring his statement, I drew and handed him a cheque for £15—on the 22nd April a lady called at my office and from information received I made inquiries as to whether he had been in consultation with Messrs. Besley and Metcalfe, and afterwards saw May at the Middlesex Sessions—I said, "Where are the briefs and papers?"—he said, "I have got them, and I mean to keep them!"—I said, "You had better mind what you are doing. I shall give you until 10 o'clock to-morrow morning, and if you do not hand them over to me by that time you must take the consequences," and next morning I received this (<hi rend="italic">Letter "C"</hi>), which is in his handwriting. ("77, Chancery Lane, 23rd April, 1879, <hi rend="italic">Reg. v. Lytton, and several prosecutions.</hi> I will be at your place with papers, &amp;c., and list of items of expenditure to<lb/>morrow at 10.30. You will no doubt, with your usual sense of propriety and professional honour, feel it just to make me some substantial remunera<lb/>tion, in lieu of agency, for the care and labour bestowed on this case in now bringing it to an issue: I shall be happy to afford you every informa<lb/>tion respecting any other matter I may have been concerned in. I shall, however, have to adopt the ordinary means of protecting myself against the results of your threats. Notwithstanding the effect of the statements of the plausible widow, whose claim (especially under the circumstances) would have been settled long ago, <hi rend="italic">if just</hi>, and whom you sent up by my discharged clerk simply to annoy me, I have the satisfaction of believing you will, on inquiry, credit me with having treated you and regarded your interests in a gentlemanly and conscientious way. As you referred to the subject, I may inform you, if it interests you, that, believing it to be the duty of a man (if it be possible) to have his wife under his own roof, arrangements are now being made to this end. How often does it happen in life that when one is in the act of retrieving the past, that past comes or ward in some shape or other, and prevents his accomplishing the ends desired. This portion of my letter is written aurente catarne, and I trust to your honour to let it remain private. Yours'truly, Alfred H. May.") The next day, the 24th, before I had received that letter, he came to my office and handed me Lytton's papers—I said "Now, where is the money?"—he said, "Oh, what money?"—I said "That 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you got. from me"—he said "Oh! that's a matter of account"—I had not then seen the briefs—I said "A matter of account! What do you mean? I handed you first 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and then 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that special purpose, I want to know what you have done with it"—he said "Oh! that is a matter of account"—I said "I do not understand what you mean by a matter of account; I want to know what you have done with that money which you obtained from me for that sole purpose"—I said "There is the money you have taken since you have been here, and I have not received that"—he said "That is a matter of arrangement"—I said "That is enough.

               <p>away"—he said "Will you let me make out a statement?"—I said "You can do what you like, so long as you go out of my office," and he made out a statement and brought it to me—I said "How dare you make out this, and call this a statement? I know nothing about this. Have you got the money? Are you going to hand me over the money?"—he said "No, I have not got it"—I subsequently gave him notice and took proceedings against him before Mr. Chance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I have seen you at the Thames Police Court once—I cannot say I have known you as a Criminal and County Court advocate, but I have heard you were—I have not heard that you have practised your profession with success in the advocacy department, but quite the contrary—that did not induce me to enter into an arrange<lb/>ment with you to conduct my criminal cases—I have gained the informa<lb/>tion since I had you—probably I said before the Magistrate, "On the 10th March, in consequence of my illness, I was obliged to get some one to superintend my business, and the prisoner called at my house and offered to give me some assistance. I spoke to him and told him I should be very happy to have his assistance, and said, 'I am afraid it will interfere too much with your business.' He said, 'No; my partner Lewis can attend to that'"—I am not pasitive whether it was the 10th or 12th—you first called on the 10th, but I believe I did not see you till the 12th; but I have the papers here, and can show you—I did not say it was on the 10th—you called on the 10th, and transacted the first business for me on the 10th, but I think it was the 12th I first saw you—on the 12th I sent to Sergeant 'n wood to say that Mr. May would attend to all my cases—you attended to some cases on the Monday before I saw you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a prisoner awaiting sentence in the Wandsworth House of Correction—I have Known Patterson about 16 months—I first saw him in March, 1878 at Workman's house, 42, Stafford Street, High Street, Peckham, and was introduced to him by Workman at my lodgings, 14, Cork Street, Camberwell, early in May, 1878—Workman told me that Patterson was his brother-in-law—I had previously had a conversation with Workman about Maudsley's—he said, "J will use my influence with Pat, who is my brother-in-law, that you shall take Old George's place"—Old George was George Fossitt, who used to lodge at Workman's—Old George was to have taken the outside and Workman the inside part to rob Messrs. Maudsley's of two bags of money, which was taken from the Bank and deposited in a large safe, or strong room, every Friday night to pay the men's wages on Saturday morning—Workman and Patterson told me that the premises could be entered by climbing a low portico in front, about six or seven feet high, and on to the roof of the offices about four feet higher, and then, by going down some steps, or slanting roof into the yard, to enter at the back by a small circular window leading to the model-room, and then by opening one of the doors into the passage access would be got to the whole of the place—I had subsequent conversations at different tirnes with Patterson and Workman—I used to see them nearly every Sunday at my lodgings or Workman's, and sometimes in the streets—our conversation was generally about Maudsley's premises, and the robbery—before introducing Patterson Workman had mentioned the keys to me, and promised to introduce Patterson to show them to me—Patterson showed me the keys in Workman's presence and said they were the keys that would do the place where the money was kept—he said the money was kept in a small wooden cupboard in one of the strong rooms which opened into the passage with a thumb-spring—he said there were two safes, one contained petty cash and the other the wages money—he showed me two</p>

               <p>keys—I had seen one of the keys being manufactured at Workman's by Fossitt from impressions taken in wax by Patterson—Patterson told me he could get impressions of any of Maudsley's keys—he said the amount of money on the premises on Friday nights varied from 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and sometimes over—Workman told me be went out with Fossitt on Easter Monday to a Volunteer Review at Staines Common and Fossitt got into trouble about some housebreaking affair, and he (Workman) escaped—Patterson was introduced to me by Workman as "Mr. Baker, the party I spoke to you about to take Old George's place"—Workman called him "Pat"—that was at the Red Cap publichouse Camberwell Green—Workman said he had been and had a view of Maudsley's place and his wife went with him, and that they tried the keys and found they would do, and it was arranged I should take the outside part instead of Fossitt, and that a cabman named Gurney should have a cab waiting outside on the night of the robbery and take the money away to Patterson's house—it was to be divided into three parts, Workman and his wife taking one part, Patterson another, and myself another, but I was to give Fossitt 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my share when he came out of prison—the month of November last was fixed for carrying out the scheme—I continually saw Workman and Patter<lb/>son up to September last—when Workman, a man named Rogers, and myself, broke into some premises in the Old Kent Road and Workman was caught. I was the outside man in that case—I kept out of the way and did not see Patterson again till the first week in November, when I went to see him—Workman was still in custody—I said to Patterson, "Has Workman said anything about this affair, or have you seen any<lb/>thing at Maudsley's to lead you to suppose there is any suspicion?" he said, "No; all things are going on as usual. I have not observed anything. Can you get another man to assist you in carrying out the robbery in place of Workman?" I said, "Yes, I can"—I had prior to this known Jones—he visited me at my lodgings several times—I told him that Maudsley's affair was on and proposed he should assist, and I subsequently introduced him to Patterson on Saturday night, November 16th, at the Elephant and Castle—Jones said to Patterson, "Are you still willing to carry out this affair, and have you been talking to any one else except the persons named?" meaning Fossitt and Workman; Patter<lb/>son said, "No. No one knows anything of it except the persons that were mentioned"—Jones asked him a few more questions about the place; if he was sure the amount of money was there, and so on, and then said, "I'll assist"—I knew at that time William Chandler and his wife, of Waterloo Street, Camberwell Park—T had previously lodged with them at 14, Cork Street, and Patterson had visited me there several times, and Workman came a great many times—on several occasions we wore all there together—Jones has been there to see me—at Workman's house Mrs. Workman was always present, taking a part in the conversation when we spoke about Maudsley's—I went down to Slough with Jones on 8th March, and we were taken into custody and convicted—I was sen<lb/>tenced to 12 months' imprisonment for the Slough affair—I am waiting sentence for the old Kent Road burglary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am undergoing penal servitude in Pentonville Prison—I was sentenced at the Surrey Sessions, April 9th, 1879, and had been in Wandsworth Prison from 5th November, 1877, to 3rd August, 1878—I knew Patterson seven or eight years ago—I did not know him personally, but a man named Charles Wells, of Camberwell, showed him to me—I have known Workman and his wife for some years—the witness Harding lodged in the name of Baker at 14, Cork Street, and he was lodging there in August, 1878—I have not seen Baker at my house in company with either of the other prisoners except Workman—Workman has been there hundreds of times, and visited Harding (or Baker) there a good many times—Baker and I were out housebreaking together almost daily—about the middle of August, 1878, I saw Patterson and Workman talking together at the Station Tavern, Beresford Street, Walworth Road, but I did not hear what they said—when we came away Workman said, "Do you know that party?" I said, "I have seen him before;" he said, "That's Pat, my brother-in-law. That's the party that's putting up the place in Westminster Bridge Road"—"putting up "a place means to commit a burglary Or robbery—Baker, Workman, and Dowthwaite, alias Rogers, were all out housebreaking together last year—Baker is the cleverest man—I have five or six times heard Baker and Workman, at my place, talking about Maudsley's place, Westminster Bridge Road, and concocting how to do it—I met Workman by the Crown, London Road, coming from Water<lb/>loo, about the middle of August—I said, "Hallo! Arthur. What's yer game?" he said, "I have just been down to see Pat." We went inside and had something to drink, and he said, "I've just been down and fetched these from him," showing me two keys, one a pipe key and the other not—I did not notice, I was a disinterested party—I said, "Is there two safes, Arthur?" and he said, "Yes, sometimes they put the money in one and sometimes in the other, so, to make sure we have had two made"—I said, "Well, if you open them with keys, Arthur, they will think it is some one about the place"—he said, "Pat will leave a few weeks before the job comes off, and they won't suspect him"—in August</p>

               <p>Workman asked me to lend him 57. till November and he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, as he should have a fortune then—I said, "I have not got it," and offered to stand for a loan for him—the loan was for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we each had half—on a Monday or Tuesday night towards the end of August I went through Addington Squire, Camberwell, with Workman, and we met Patterson there, and went back to the Anchor and Hope and had something to drink, and they talked for a few minutes, and then Patterson went towards Peckham, and Workman and myself towards Camberwell—later in August I was going to the Strand with my pony and cart I have been a baker for 22 years, collecting sweepings and stale sacks from bakers, and kept a pony and cart—I was at 14, Cork Street, and offered to give Baker a ride to Pimlico—just before starting Workman came in and said, "I might at well go with you"—when we got to Westminster Bridge Road opposite a chapel near Oakley Street, he said, "Stop there, Bill; that's the place we are going to do,' pointing to a place with a coat of arms over it painted white—there was a wall about eight feet high, where they said they were going to get over to do it; and then on three or four occasions afterwards, after Workman had got into trouble, Baker had a look at the place when I gave him a ride—Baker often came in an afternoon or evening and said, "I must go round and see Patterson and his wife, and if the job comes off right I'll give Mrs. Workman 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my corner, the others could give what they liked"—I knew Dowthwaite—Workman four or five times said, "Don't take any notice to Bob, as we don't want him to know, because we don't want to give him any of it; we only want to keep it between three, Patter<lb/>son, me, and Baker"—that was after Fossitt had got into trouble—Fossitt made the keys, and when he got into trouble Baker was introduced into the case.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Inspecter P.</hi>). I and Chamberlain had Work<lb/>man in custody last September—I know his wife and Rogers, alias Dowthwaite—Workman made certain communications to me before his conviction, and subsequently his wife also made certain communications to me—I was at Slough on 26th March, when Davis and Harding were tried and convicted—Harding, alias Biker, made a statement to me before his conviction, and at three interviews after his conviction, in consequence of which I saw Mrs. Chandler—I obtained an order from the Home Secretary and saw William Chandler, and made certain inquiries, and then reported to Scotland Yard, and this prosecution was instituted—I obtained an order to see Workman, and saw him at Wandsworth on 24th May, and told him the object of my visit, and that Patterson was in custody with others on this charge, and said, "Now do you know anything about the case?"—he said, "No; I can have nothing to say in the case"—I said, "Do you know Patterson?"—he said, "Yes; I have known him about 16 years"—I said, "We are in possession of the whole facts of the case. We know that you can give evidence in this case if you like. Will you do it?"—he said, "No; I can have nothing to do with that job; I can't give evidence against my brother-in-law. Besides that, it was nearly two years ago it was talked about?—I said, "Do you recollect being in a certain public-house when the keys were shown to Baker by Patterson in your presence?"—he said, "Yes, I recollect being in a public-house with Patterson and Baker at the Father Red Cap, Camber well Green, one Sunday evening last May (1876), but Patterson did not show Baker the keys. In fact, I do net think Baker ever saw them. I went with my wife once about fifteen months ago, and had a look ever the place referring to Maudsley's. Patterson showed us over the premises and showed us the models"—he declined to give further testimony—on 23rd May with Inspector Chamberlain I saw Mrs. Workman at the Orange Tree Beerhouse, Avill Street, camberwell—I said, "Patterson is in custody charged with others conspiring to commit a burglary at Messrs. Maudsley's and it is said you have been there and know all about it; will you tell us what you know I"—she said, "No. I shall have nothing at all to do with it. I know nothing about it; I have heard it was intended to break in; but that was sometime ago"—I said, "Well, if you decline to give the necessary infor<lb/>mation there are plenty others who can," mentioning Chandler and his wile—she said, "Mrs. Chandler, let her say what she likes. She is only wild she didn't have the job to climb blooming well herself"—I asked her if I should see her again in the evening, and she said "Yes, come alone. See me at 7 o'clock at my house"—I called there about 6.30, and she was not at home—I saw her about 7 with Mrs. Patterson, the prisoner's wife, leaving the house, and after she had left Mrs. Patterson I spoke to her again about giving me information and told her I was going to see her husband—she said, "I'll wait and see what Arthur does"—she said she could not give in<lb/>formation as she had not been paid for the last job—she had given evidence in Harding's case—she said, if her husband gave evidence she would do the same—she afterwards said, "As Patterson has found me and ray children food and shelter for two months after Arthur was put away, I cannot find it in my</p>

               <p>heart to hurt him. I know the affair was arranged and would have come off had it been kept quiet. I think it is nearly two years ago it was first talked about. I went with my husband once into Mr. Maudsley's place. We went to see the models. Patterson showed us over the premises. We had some ale there—I know some keys were made, two lots, and I believe that Baker had them with him when he was taken at Slough As the job did not come off you can do nothing with it. You can do nothing with Patterson—Patterson and Baker did come to my house several times—I intended to wait until the job was done, and if a reward was offered, to give informa<lb/>tion—lid you expect to find the keys when you reached Patterson's house?" I said "Yes, I suppose they did. I was not there myself." She said, "Ah! clever men never keep those things in their own houses"—I said, well! if the affair had taken place she would not have got so much as she thought, perhaps. She said, "If it had been done at the right time, there would have been a good lot there, and they did not mean to do it except when there was plenty there. Sometimes it's more than at others. I will think the matter over, and perhaps I'll tell you more about it. I'll wait and see what Arthur does."</p>

Patterson took him and me in. They didn't allow me to go over the place with them. They shut me in a room whilst they went and done what they wanted"—I said, "Why did they do that?"—she said, "Patterson was afraid that the persons in the next house might see a woman in the house, which would cause some suspicion."</p>
