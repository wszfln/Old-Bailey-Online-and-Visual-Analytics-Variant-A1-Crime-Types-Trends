             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Trebeck. I am foreman to Mr. Stowe, gardener and farmer: On the evening of the 24th of October, 1798, I was with Potts; I met the prisoner about seven o'clock at night; I had locked the door before I came out; when I returned, after I had been with Potts, I missed a sack of onions; I am sure it was my master's sack; he threw it into the ditch, and ran away; I carried them home and kept them for a twelvemonth, till they were quite rotten; the prisoner had worked for me about two months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming along and picked up these onions; I did not throw them into the ditch.</p>

Yes; I had seen him on the Tuesday in the Christmas week; he came into Brown's house, and Smith asked him to drink out of our pint of beer; he had a sinock frock on; I had a good deal of talk with him; he asked me if that was not Mr. Wigstead's team, I told him it was; I pulled my money out, and said I did not think Mr. Brown had settled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020007"/>right for the hay; he looked at the Bank-note, and gave it me again; I went to Shoreditch-church, and left him in the house; he asked me where I was going with my hay; I told him to London-wall; I went on as far as <placeName id="t18000402-7-crimeloc36">Enfield-park</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you speak of the house being fastened of your own knowledge, or from the information of the servant? - A. I put out the fire, and I observed that the bolt of the lock of the kitchen-door was put in a little way, but not sufficient to resist; I saw it in a little way, but I cannot say how much; that was the door where they must have got in.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been in the habit of apprehending many persons, and bringing them to justice in this Court; I was coming by this court, and heard the cry of stop thief; I saw a man come out of the court as fast as possible, and throw the bundle down; I caught hold of the bundle to secure it, and followed after him; the butcher who is in Court laid hold of me; I told him I was pursuing the man, and he let me go; I pursued the man, and Stephens then came up again, and knocked the bundle out of my hand; they took me back; I was searched by the constable; I had nothing about me but this handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where does Mr. Palmer live? - A. No. 21, Great George-street, Brick-lane; I live in White-court, Spitalfields; I was going into the Borough afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. How long has he been a customer of your's? - A. I never made him but one pair of shoes; he is a watch-maker; he asked me if I would take a walk with him into the Borough; I told him I was going to Mint-street myself.</p>
               <p>Q. The invitation came from Palmer to you then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take a walk with Palmer before that night? - A.Never; we had been in company before.</p>
               <p>Q. You went next day before the Magistrate? - A. No; the business was over before I could get there, or else I would have done the man the service to speak the truth, that I have spoke now.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there a great number of people when the man ran away? - A. He was too light-heeled for that.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go in pursuit? - A. I was not very well in health that night.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a watch-maker, No. 21, Great George-street, Brick-lane, Spitalfields: I was in Tower-street when the prisoner was apprehended; Pinches was with me; he brought me home a pair of shoes; I mentioned that I had some business to do over the water in the King's Bench; he said he had some business over in the Borough, and if it was agreeable to me he would accompany me; as we came through Tower-street a man ran across the way from the court; to the best of my recollection the prisoner at the bar was coming the contrary way; he picked up the bundle and put it under his arm, and he turned short upon his heel and was directly laid hold of; the man let him go again, and he pursued after the man; that was a man considerably taller than the prisoner; and then the prisoner was stopped again; there were several people in Tower-street; the man that ran away went down Water-street; I told the people he was the wrong man, but I might as well have talked to a parcel of mad bulls; I heard somebody talk about giving him a night's lodging in the Compter, and I went to the Compter and made some enquiries, and left my address, and likewise Pinches's address.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you ever walk with your shoe-maker before? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - A. About six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately may he have made any shoes for you? - A. I suppose within these three months.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair has he ever made? - A. I believe two pair, and has mended several pair.</p>
               <p>Q. He has not delivered you any shoes later than three months? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. He has not delivered you any this year? - A. It may be on this side Christmas, I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. It is three months, however, since he delivered you any shoes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were going to the King's Bench? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Pinches going? - A. I do not know; he came to bring me a new pair of shoes that night.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that three months ago? - A. It was on the 4th of February.</p>

On Thursday the 20th of March, I went with Mead and Clark to the Fleet-prison; Clark searched her, and she had no money about her, but the marked money that he gave her; I went up into Pougher's room, and found in Mary Mead's right-hand pocket, a paper, containing five seven shilling pieces and a half-guinea, and a half-crown, loose in her pocket; a half-guinea with a piece out of it, and a half-crown loose in her pocket, which I had seen delivered to her.

             sworn. - On the 3d of March, there were four iron bars stole from the back part of my house, they were fixed to the main beam of the house, in the area; they were wrenched off; I saw them on the 4th of March at Cockran's, Donaldson was with me; Jones told me he took them from the back part of my house, and sold them to Cockran.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to induce him to confess? - A. No; he said he forced them up with a large iron bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no threats, or promises, used, to induce him to confess? - A. No; as soon as he was taken he confessed it; I found the bars underneath the counter in Cockran's shop, among many other articles of iron bars and lead; Cockran owned that he bought the bars of the boy; I think he said he had given him a penny a pound for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you think a little boy like that, or two or three little boys, could have forced up these bars? - A. I should think not; he said there were others with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Little boys like himself? - A. Yes, some bigger and some less.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that he said there were some bigger than himself? - A. No; there were fifteen of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he said there were fifteen? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - In consequence of a search-warrant I went, on the 4th of March, along with Kendal, a constable, to search the house of Cockran, Mr. Nicholson was with us; among a parcel of leaden pipes, and iron, I found these four bars underneath the counter; as soon as I took them, and put them upon the counter, Jones said to Nicholson, directly, these are your bars; I took them to Bow-street, and Nicholson swore to them. (Produces the bars).</p>
               <p>Nicholson. I took one of the bars off the same area, and took it to Bow-street, it was exactly the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try the bars with the place from whence you supposed they were taken? - A. No; they were the same length, and the same size.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. There is a piece broke off of one of them; if you had gone and fitted that to the place, you would have been able to ascertain whether it came from your place or not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ISAAC KENDAL sworn. - I am constable of the night: I took this boy in charge, he was brought in by the patrol, or the watchman, I do not know which; there were no promises made him; he said there were fourteen or fifteen of them concerned; he mentioned several places where he had been taking iron from, I cannot say whether he mentioned Nicholson's or not; I went with him to Cockran's with Donaldson, Jones was present, and he said they had stole such and such iron from such a place, and such and such lead from such a place, and he pointed out this iron of Nicholson's; Cockran said, he had been in business but a little time, and it was an unfortunate circumstance, he hardly had been in that house three months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Cockran is a shoemaker? - A. A boot-closer.</p>
               <p>Q. This shop is kept by his wife? - A. I fancy it is.</p>
               <p>Jones did not say any thing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Cockran's defence. Jones brought the bars to me, and I asked him who he came from; he said his father had sent him with them; I asked him where he come from; he said from Round-court; then I weighed them, and paid him a penny a pound for them, and he went away; I knew nothing more of it till Donaldson came.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Jones, called one, and Cockran four witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

               <p>Essex. I have not the least doubt that those are my pistols; the prisoner's person I am very positive of, but as to the pistols, there are so many made like one another, that I cannot positively swear to this; when I went with him to the watch-house, he complained of cold for want of his great coat and boots; I said, if he would let me know where his lodgings were, I would go with the constable for his great coat and boots, and perhaps I might see my other pistol; I went to the lodgings of a Mr. Cardon, No. 15, Fenchurch-buildings, and sent the coat and boots; I got some information about the other pistol; I got a search-warrant, and found the pistol in Mr. Cardon's room, with whom the prisoner lodged.</p>

               <p>MARY KEEFE sworn. - The prisoner knocked at my door; he had a cheese under his arm; and he asked me to weigh the cheese for him; I keep a rag-shop; I weighed the cheese for him, and he said, stop a bit; I did not see him when he went; but I missed him; and he left the cheese; then some people came, and demanded it; and upon my oath, I never denied having the cheese.

               <p>ROBERT WINTER sworn. - I received an alarm from the last witness, on the 17th of February; upon coming to the door, Duncan was standing on the threshold, he desired me to follow those two men, pointing to the two prisoners at the bar; I pursued them immediately; they had each of them a large bundle upon their backs; I followed them till I got round the corner, into St. Alban's-street; I was then out of breath with running so fast, and immediately called stop thief; I was then within from twenty to thirty yards of the prisoners, they were, as near as I can recollect, six or seven yards apart; on calling out, stop thief, Smith, who had a blue coat on, turned his head round quite facing of me, and upon seeing me so near him, he threw down his bundle immediately; Yeomans turned round also to see from whence the noise proceeded; he carried his bundle five or six yards further, to the other side of the Strand; he threw it down in the kennel, just by the side of the pavement; he then ran as fast as Smith, towards Market-street, in going out of St. Alban's-street, I turned to the right; I pursued them a little further along Market-street; Yeomans, and another person, that ran with them, turned to the left hand, that was a person that I suspected of being an accomplice, he was in my house not half a minute, before Duncan gave the alarm; Smith turned to the right towards Market-lane; I pursued Yeomans into Norris-street, and there I recollected the goods, and I went back to look for them, about one hundred yards, and I found them where they had been thrown away; a soldier assisted me in carrying them; upon going up stairs, I found my own key in the room door, a back-room, up two pair of stairs; I found the room stripped of all the linen that was in it, and every thing, excepting the beds; a female servant had been the last person intrusted with the key; the next observation I made was, that one of the bureaus, there were three in the room, was broke open; I missed some new silver coin, to the value of four shillings, but I cannot say so many pieces; I then missed my watch off the window; I had laid it there when I got up, the key used to be kept in the bar; I can speak to the property when it is produced; as soon as I had secured the property, I came down stairs, and Duncan came in at the same time at the outer door; I was then informed that Yeomans was taken with my watch to St. Martin's watch-house; on coming there, Yeomans was sitting on a seat, I said, that is one of the men that had part of my property upon his back; there were a great number of other people there, eight or nine to the best of my recollection; I gave a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020022"/>description of the maker's name and number, and a bruise in it; then the watch was shewn me, and I knew it to be mine; in about ten minutes after that, Smith was brought in, and I immediately said, that is the first man that threw down my bundle; I am very sure the two prisoners are the same men that I saw with my property.</p>
               <p>Yeomans. Q.What coloured coat had I on? - A. I cannot take upon me to say the exact colour, it was a dark colour, something like a snuff colour.</p>
               <p>Yeomans. Q. How was the person, you suppose to be the accomplice, drest? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.You are positive to my being one of the persons that carried the bundle? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you not say that he turned round and looked at you? - A. Yes; I saw his face at that time as plain as I see your's now; I was not then further than 30 yards from him, it was then nearly as light as it is now.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the lamps lit? - A. No; I had never seen either of the prisoners before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Keeping a public-house, I suppose your outer door generally stands open? - A. Always.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 22, St. Alban's-street, with Messrs. Scott and Randall, apothecaries: On Monday the 17th of February, I think, a little after five, I am not quite certain; I saw two or three men on the other side of the way, in St. Alban's-street, two of them had bundles on their backs running fast; they were running from Charles-street; across St. Alban's-street, towards Market-street; I looked down the street, and saw somebody crying stop thief; a man ran first without a bundle, Yeomans ran next, and Smith a few yards after him; when they heard stop thief called, they each of them threw down their bundles about seven or eight yards distant from each other; they turned the corner, and ran towards Norris-street, Smith ran down Market-lane; I saw no one follow them, and therefore I followed Smith, calling stop thief, but no one ran after him but me; I pursued him round Pall-mall, and into the Hay-market; I then saw him reeling from one side of the pavement to the other, like a drunken man; I pursued, and called stop thief; as soon as he heard that call behind him, he looked round, and seeing me, he ran across the Hay-market, and down Little Suffolk-street; I pursued him, calling stop thief; a great many people were collected together, running after him; I pursued him down Great Suffolk-street, and there I lost sight of him, and did not see him again till he was in Mr. Amies's shop in Whitcomb-street; he was secured in Amies's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time you first saw him, till you saw him in Amies's shop? - A. Scarcely five minutes, for I ran as hard as I could; I can speak positively to the face of Smith; I cannot speak so distinctly to Yeomans', it was Smith that I followed; Smith had a blue coat on, with a velvet collar; the other had a brown coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been reeling before he got into the Hay-market? - A. No; he ran as fast as any sober man could do.</p>
               <p>Q.And that you are very positive was Smith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. How came you not to come to the second examination at Bow-street? - A. My master could not spare me from business; I was there at the first examination.</p>
               <p>- AMIES sworn. - I keep a broker's shop, in Whitcomb-street: The prisoner, Smith, came into my shop about a quarter past five o'clock, he appeared very much agitated and frightened; I asked him who he was, and what he wanted; he gave me no answer; I asked him a second time what he wanted, and who he was, and then I seized him by the arm; at that moment two or three people came rushing into the shop, and Williams said, that is he, this is the man; there were a great number of people at the door, and several people asked him who he was, and he said he was a gentleman; and then he was taken out of my shop to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Smith. Q.Was I not very much in liquor? - A. He appeared very much agitated; I cannot tell whether it was from agitation or liquor, but he smelt of liquor certainly.</p>
               <p>ROBERT RITCHIES sworn. - I am a watchman in St. Martin's parish: I was coming from the Hay-market, across St. James's Market, I heard a cry of stop thief; I looked up, and saw the prisoner, Yeomans, running; that is the man, (points to him); he was coming from the bottom of the Hay-market up James-street; I immediately pursued him, and about the middle of James-street, somebody crossing obstructed his running, and I immediately caught hold of him; when I had laid hold of him, I saw him throw away a watch; I saw the watch perfectly, he threw it into the middle of the street, near to the kennel, with his left-hand; the watch was picked up immediately, by some man who said, here is your watch, I cannot say who it was; the watch was brought to the watch-house by a person that is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure, that what the person threw from him was a watch? - A. Yes, perfectly.</p>
               <p>Yeomans. Q. Did I not come up the east side of St. James's Market with you? - A. No; I never saw him till I got almost into James-street.</p>
               <p>Yeomans. Q. Did you give the same account at Bow-street? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020023"/>the prisoner, Yeomans, in custody of the last witness; it happened to be very near the watch-house, and I went up to see what was the matter, and he was then very refractory; I had very great difficulty to secure him and get him into the watch-house; in a very few minutes after we got into the watch house, a Mr. Brookes brought in the watch, and delivered it to me; I asked Mr. Brookes from whom he got it; the prisoner heard all that passed; he said, there was a great concourse of people, he could not tell who he received it from; in a few minutes after that, the prosecutor, Winter, came in; he said he had lost his watch, Smith was not there then, but he fixed upon Yeomans immediately; the watch-house was as full as it could hold, I suppose there were fifty there, and he pointed to Yeoman's, and said, that is the man; he told me the maker's name, and number of the watch, and I stepped on one side, and found it was as he described it.

               <p>Q.(To Winter.) Can you undertake to say, that every article in these two bundles came out of your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Among these various articles, what value do you set upon that property, independent of the watch? - A.The value I have set upon them is about ten pounds, but they are worth more than double that.</p>
               <p>Yeomans's defence. On the evening of the robbery, I had been down to Pimlico to see a friend of mine, in Eaton-street, that keeps a baker's shop there; on my return home, crossing St. James's-square, I came up Charles-street, and getting towards St. Alban's-street I saw the watchman, and two or three people; somebody said, that is him in blue; and running along Norris-street, I crossed over the Hay-market, a considerable crowd of people were running, I crossed over into James-street, and crossing the bottom of Oxendon-street, a stout man, with an apron on like a butcher, caught hold of me by the handkerchief, and stopped me; says I, you are mistaken, my friend, and he let me go; I stood still, and presently after, this watchman, and two or three more people, came up and collared me.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence. I have hardly any thing to say, I was fuddled; we neither of us expected our trials to come on so soon, and our friends are not here.</p>

(Produces the property).</p>

               <p>ANN BLOOMFIELD sworn. - I am the wife of Henry Bloomfield: I saw my husband shut up the shop that night; he locked it up; there are sliding shutters in grooves upon the counter; and there was a little place where he got in, between the window-shutters; a little place that we could not suppose a man could get in at; there were no paper parcels in the shop when we went to bed; we were alarmed between two and three o'clock; I got up and saw some parcels containing tea and sugar; it had been put up in parcels in the course of the night; I had left a great deal of copper in the till, I cannot tell to what amount; there was enough taken out for me to miss them; there were a quantity of penny-pieces among them, I cannot say how many; the bag that the sugar was in I made up myself; the prisoner had lodged in our house thirteen months, he is a journeyman tailor.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these articles, and see if you know any of them? - A. I have every reason to believe they are mine; these are the same kind of bags that I make up; I missed both green and black tea, the canisters were not so heavy as they were when I left them the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I went up to go to bed I found the halfpence and the pins and the Spanish liquorice concealed in the closet; I immediately took it up, and put it in my pocket, with intention to enquire about it the next morning, but was prevented by being distubed by the watchman; as to the tea and sugar, I never saw it till the watchman came to disturb me. As for the halfpence that I had in the drawers, I had taken some time before; they are bad halfpence that were not current.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Rosemary-lane: Cogin was a ship-mate of mine for a few months in the year 1795; I met him and another person in Rosemary-lane, he asked me to go and drink with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. That is not the man; he was a man about five feet ten or eleven; the person that was with him took off his hat, and he was not like the prisoner; I had never seen him before I saw him at Bow-street; they were both very much in liquor, and I was sober; I am a salesman; they said they would call in the afternoon, and buy some clothes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you had no acquaintance with the prisoner? - A. None; I saw the man that was with Cogin again the same afternoon; I saw him go into the Clothes-exchange and buy some clothes; I saw him with a coat that he had bought, a dark-coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. But who that strange man was, you cannot tell? - A. No; he had a full head of hair.*</p>
               <p>*The prisoner was bald.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cogin.) Were you sober? - A. I was sober enough to know him at any rate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not change your companion between Darkhouse-lane and Rosemary-lane? - A. No; if I wanted to part with him he did not intend to part with me; he was too fond of me. When this man was before Mr. Bond, he said he had never seen the crown of his head.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Holland.) Did you say any thing before the Magistrate about his head? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you, if there was so much difference as you speak of? - A. I was not asked about it, and I forgot it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing of the matter; I was not there; I know nothing at all of the man; I was in Salisbury at the time.</p>
               <p>Holland. Last Thursday or Friday was a week Cogin came to me with a subpoena; and I said, if you say this is the man you were in company with, I must swear to it, and I do not like to go before a Justice; then he said I should have half the benefit if the man was hung; I made answer, no, I would sooner give you the money out of my pocket, than be taken before a Justice or a Jury, that I never was before in my life; he said, never mind, you shall have the benefit of it; you shall be well paid for your trouble; I told him I did not want any thing of the kind; then I went to Bow-street, and there I saw the prisoner at night about eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you saw him without his hat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And yet you did not take any notice to the Justice of the difference of the bald head? - A. No, I did not; I forgot it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see who was in company with the prosecutor? - A. I saw him in company with a stout man, at about twenty yards distance, at a public-house door, the Blue-boar in Rosemary-lane; I saw them afterwards again; he was a very tall stout man; he was, I dare say, five feet eleven inches high; the prisoner at the bar is not the man that was in company with Cogin.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am foreman at the shop where the prisoner used to work, Mr. Rice's, Whitecross-street, Cripplegate: On Sunday the 16th of February, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner at my master's shop-door, as I was going out to get shaved; he was crying, he had a bundle in his hand; I asked him, what was the matter; he said he had had an accident, his child was dead; I asked him how it came; he said he would tell me presently; he went up stairs to my lodgings in the foundery, we took a pint of beer up with us, and then he said, his wife persuaded him to make his escape; I told him, if he offered to make his escape, or run away, people would say he had done it wilfully; and being persuaded by me, he did not offer to go, he staid with me that day; then I said, I would go and try if I could not see his wife; I went to the place where they lodged, she was not at home, and I came and told him that she was not at home; he said he knew where she was gone to, and he went up the street with me towards his lodgings, and we met with her in Old-street, and all three came home to his lodgings together; she began to say what a sad accident it was, and she was in tears, and persuaded him to make his escape, in my presence, for she said she could not bear to see him any more in her sight; and the answer he made was, he should not make away with himself yet; he then left the room; I did not see the prisoner again, to speak to him, till the Tuesday evening following, the 18th; the Coroner's Inquest had sat that evening, I attended the Inquest, and after the verdict was given, I went, with one of the other men that works in our shop, to the prisoner's lodgings, his name is John Burbidge, he was not at the Coroner's Inquest; I called him by name, Jem; I will not be positive whether he answered the first time, or whether I called a second time, he was in bed, it might be then between ten and eleven o'clock; he raised himself up in the bed.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that the same lodgings he had lived at before? - A. No, it was in a court in Golden-lane; he raised himself up in the bed, and I said, Jem, they have brought it in accidental; and he said, you are not a joking, are you; I put out my hand to him, says I, there is my hand, for truth; and to the best of my knowledge, he pulled out a book, whether from some part of the bed, or whether from his pocket, I cannot say, it was a prayer-book consisting of prayers, and he said, he had been reading of that in the evening; then he rose from the bed, and put on his things, and came with me and Burbidge away from that house to the end of Shrewsbury-court, where he formerly lived, and I went up to the door of his lodgings with him; I went into the lodgings, and he stopped at the door, his wife came out into the passage and spoke to me; after that, I gave the prisoner a shilling to get something to eat, he said he was in want, he then left me; he was gone, to the best of my knowledge, about half an hour; while he was gone, I had some conversation with his wife, his cousin, and his cousin's wife; and I saw Burbidge again before I saw the prisoner; I went to the prisoner at the Swan, in Whitecross-street, where he went to get his refreshment; I said to him, so, Jem, you have been and owned to it; I asked him how he came to own to it; did you do it, says I, for the purpose; he said, yes; I said, with what; he said, it was aqua-fortis; I asked him where he bought it; he said, at Macdonald's; and I said, no, you did not.</p>

Did you know the place he meant? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020030"/>Yes, perfectly well; it is a chemist's and druggist's; he said, yes he did, and I told him they denied it; then I asked him whether he asked for that stuff or no; he said, yes, he asked for two-pennyworth of aqua-fortis; I said, did not they say any thing to you about it; he said, no, he laid the two-pence down, and said, if you do not like them I will change them; then I asked him if that was the bottle that he took from our shop on Saturday evening, and he said, yes; then, says I, you thought of doing it he said, he had thought of that two or three months past; that is all that past, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear at that time to be perfectly collected, and seem to have a recollection of what he was about? - A.Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be at all in liquor at that time? - A. I did not see that he was at all intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you ever seen him with this child? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was always very fond of the child? - A. He seemed always remarkably fond of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he worked in this foundery with you? - A. Ever since the 15th of last July.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a young man, very much liked among you, as a very worthy, civil, young wan? - A. Yes, a very civil young man, he always behaved very civil.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not a sort of a person from whom you would have expected an act of cruelty or barbarity? - A. No, he was not, very far from it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, when you went to him, after the Coroner's Inquisition, he was at another lodging? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not concealed at all there? - A.From his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. He and his wife had had some words, but you knew where he was? - A. No, I did not; only the man that got him the lodgings, Burbidge, I was informed by him where he was, and I went to him, thinking it would ease his mind.</p>

             sworn. - I am a fellow-workman with the prisoner, at Mr. Rice's; I had my beer with him, on Saturday the 15th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular that he did on the Saturday? - A. No; on the Sunday, I was informed of the accident, by Bell, the foreman; I then went to the prisoner's lodgings, but he was not at home, his wife was at home; I saw him in the afternoon of the Sunday, between four and five o'clock, or it might be sooner, I cannot say exactly; I saw him at the public-house, opposite the shop where we work.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he at that time sober? - A. He appeared to me very sober, I did not see that he had been drinking any thing at all; when I went first into the tap-room, I did not see him till he spoke to me; he said, Jack, is that you? then I called him out of the box where he was sitting with some more men; he came and sat along with me, I said to him, for God's sake, Jem, what have you been doing at home; I said, Jem, were you drunk last night, or were you out of your mind; I then asked him what he had been about; then I asked him where he had got the stuff from, he told me, from Mr. Macdonald's; he said, he went there and asked for two pennyworth of aqua-fortis; I said to him, Jem, had you any thought of this? - Yes, he says, I have had it in my head a long time, but he did not think, he said, it would kill the child so soon; then I got up out of the box and left him; I had seen the child that morning, dead, it looked very much burnt, sadly burnt about the mouth, and on the left hand, I think, but I am not quite certain which hand; I left the box where he was sitting, I would not sit with him any longer; I staid in the house till about nine o'clock, in another box; about that time, he asked me if I would go with him to get him a lodging; I went with him, and got him a lodging; I left him at his lodgings in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the Coroner's Inquest? - A. I was not before the Jury, but I was in the house; it was a public-house in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were in the house, how happened it that you were not examined? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you told any body of this conversation? - A. Yes, I had told Bell, and ever so many of my shop-mates.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And yet you did not offer to tell what you knew before the Coroner? - A. No, I did not; I saw the prisoner again on the Tuesday night after the verdict; Mr. Bell and I went after him, we found him in bed at his lodgings, in Golden-lane; either Mr. Bell, or else me, said, Jem, every thing is all right, and he could hardly believe it; and Bell offered his hand to him, as much as to say that it was the truth, and he made answer and said, thank God Almighty, for I have been here a praying, and I am very hungry; he had a book, but I cannot read, I do not know what book it was, he got up, and went along with Bell and me.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any money of his own, do you know? - A. I do not know; we then went to the end of Shrewsbury-court, and there I left him, very near his door, where he had formerly lived; I went to the house where my shop-mates were, opposite the shop where we work, that might be about ten o'clock at night; it was a public-house; I left that house, and I saw the prisoner again the same evening; I went with my shop-mates to the Swan, and there we found the prisoner; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020031"/>him, Jem, are not you glad that you got off in this manner, he said, yes; and I asked him then, whether he had an intention, or a thought to destroy the child, he said, yes, and then I left him, and went to another part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Tuckey there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Tuckey come to fetch her husband home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing more after that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The conversation you had with him on the Sunday, you told Bell, before the Coroner's Jury sat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Bell of it on the Monday or the Tuesday morning? - A. I mentioned it on the Monday, but I do not know whether I told Bell of it on the Monday or not.</p>
               <p>Q.But you told Bell of it before the Coroner's Jury sat? - A. Yes; I told all my shop-mates of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Bell.) Q.Before the Coroner's Jury sat, had Burbidge told you that the prisoner said he had had it in his head a long time, but did not think it would kill the child so soon? - A. Not to my recollection; I do not remember that he told me of it till after the Jury had sat, when he told me of it at the Swan door.</p>
               <p>Q. But before the Jury had sat, he did not mention it to you? - A. Not to my knowledge; he might have mentioned it in the shop, but not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Barbidge.) Q. You say, you told your shop-mates of it on the Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you remember whether Bell was among those shop-mates to whom you mentioned it? - A. I cannot rightly say; I do not remember who was there.</p>
               <p>Q.What makes you sure that you had told Bell before the Coroner's Jury sat? - A. I cannot rightly say that Bell was there, when I told of the conversation that I had had with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were your shop-mates at that time? - A. In the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember telling Bell of it, on the Tuesday night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then it is most probable you had not told him before? - A. I do not rightly remember my telling him of it on the Monday.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM TUCKEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a brother workman with the prisoner; I went to the Swan public-house on the Tuesday night, after the Coroner's Jury had sat; Burbidge went with me, I believe it was somewhere about ten o'clock, we found the prisoner there, he was talking to Burbidge; I heard him say he gave it to the child on purpose, I did not hear him say what; my wife came in just afterwards to fetch me home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.How long have you worked with the prisoner? - A.Ever since about a week before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him with his child? - A. Many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a man more fond of a child than he was? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not a very worthy humane man; I never saw any thing bad of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a man from whom you would have expected any barbarity? - A. No.</p>
               <p>MARY TUCKEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am the wife of the last witness; on the Tuesday evening, after the Coroner's Jury had sat, I went over to the Swan, to my husband, and the prisoner was there, talking to his shop-mates; I heard him say he gave a drop out of the spoon, and then a drop out of the bottle; it gave me such a turn, that I turned myself away, and heard no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Had you ever seen him with this child? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a very affectionate father, was he not? - A. Yes, very fond of his child indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think him a likely man to murder his child? - A. I do not think he did it on purpose.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer of Hatton-garden: The prisoner was brought to our office; the Magistrate had then left the office; I then took him to the Hat and Tun in Hatton-wall; he sat in the taproom some time, and I thought that was not the proper place to ask him any thing, I thought it was too public; we went backwards into the parlour with some more of his shop-mates with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Why were you to question him? - A. We thought he would tell us the facts that he had told the other men before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.When you took him into the parlour, did you tell him he had better confess? - A. I believe some of his shop-mates did.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a surgeon: In consequence of an application from the overseers of the parish, I went to see the body of a dead male child, in a court in Whitecross-street, on the morning of the day on which the Coroner's Inquest sat; the child appeared to be about six months old; the lips were discoloured; about the size of a small saucer upon its left breast, and about the size of a crown by the thumb, upon the back of the left hand; I then opened the body, but found that no part of the fluid which had stained the mouth and lips, and breast and hand, had got farther than the mouth; the appearances upon dissection proved the child to have been ailing; the liver was twice its natural<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020032"/>size, and must, even before the stomach was half full, have produced vomitings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you able to judge from your observations, what was the immediate cause of the child's death? - A. The fluid that had been put to the mouth I knew immediately was aqua-fortis; I then asked to examine the bottle that the fluid might have been in.</p>
               <p>Q. If aqua-fortis got into the mouth of the child it might produce a suffocation from whence death might ensue? - A. I do believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you believe the appearances upon the mouth of the child were the effect of aqua-fortis? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Then are you inclined, upon the whole, to think that aqua-fortis put into the mouth of the child was the cause of the death? - A. I believe so, it appeared to me as if the child had lifted its hand up to its mouth to wipe off the aqua fortis; from the direction of the stain upon the hand, it appeared to me it had been done in that manner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Look at those two bottles; is the one aqua-fortis and the other Dalby's carminative? - A.This appears to me to be what is called Dalby's carminative; but I am no farther acquainted with it than from its appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. The colour of the one is not at all like the colour of the other? - A. In the appearance in which you now see them, they are not of the same colour; but the carminative will, I believe, upon standing, have a sediment at the bottom; and I believe the carminative itself will be of a brownish red.</p>
               <p>Q. Even after it might have stood a considerable time, would it then have the appearance of aquafortis, as to colour? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I take it they would have both much the same appearance in the dark? - A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the two bottles had been of the same form, a person would not find out in the dark, the one from the other? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This supernatural swelling of the liver must have been of a dangerous tendency? - A. It must have produced other disorders.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to state perfectly that the death of that child was owing to aqua-fortis? - A. I cannot perfectly state that; I would not presume to state that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. From the appearance of the mouth, do you think aqua-fortis sufficient to produce early suffocation and death? - A. I think it is likely to produce suffocation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any natural causes, upon dissection, to which you could ascribe sudden death, independent of this aqua-fortis? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not open the head of the child? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The opening of the head might have enabled you to discover other causes, that you are now ignorant of? - A. It frequently has.</p>
               <p>Q.Probably you have known instances of violent vomitings, producing suffocations, and ruptures of blood-vessels in the head? - A. Not suffocations; I have known instances of ruptures of blood-vessels in the head.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. No part of the aqua-fortis had found its way down the throat? - A. No part.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that aqua-fortis had been used, before you were told any thing about it? - A. I had had no information whatever respecting it; but the moment I saw it, I knew it was aquafortis.</p>
               <p>Q. Could that discolouration be occasioned by any thing else? - A. No; unless it was spirits of nitre.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. How the aqua-fortis came into the house I do not know; I did it accidentaily.(Mr. Miles proved that Shrewsbury-court was in the county of Middlesex.)</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure before they hustled you, that you had your watch in your pocket? - A. Yes, I am well assured of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen it? - A. Not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you miss your watch? - A. In a quarter of a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Smith and Ennis were two of these persons? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Beville. Q.Did you ever see these men before? - A. I have seen their persons in the street.</p>
               <p>Q.When was the last time you saw them before this happened? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at any time that you had seen them before, take any particular notice of them? - A. No, only when I see a press-gang it is natural to look at them.</p>
               <p>Q. One press-gang is not like another then, I suppose? - A. No, no more than other men.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever taken particular notice of the countenances of these men? - A. Yes, I am clear I had seen them before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you know the countenances of all the press-gangs you ever saw? - A. By no means; but I had seen these two before, and knew them again.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you cannot tell us at what time you had seen them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour was this offence committed? - A. Almost half past ten.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark, was it not? - A. Yes, very dark.</p>
               <p>Q.From what reason can you swear that these two men were the identical persons that robbed you? - A.When I saw them at Dr. Morgan's door with a candle at the door, I saw them between me and the candle, and am sure they are the same men.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What do you mean by their being between you and the candle? - A. So that the candle shone upon their faces.</p>

Yes, he was in company with me and the other officers; he pointed out Ennis and Smith from five other men; I searched them, and found upon Smith, who was the master of the gang, a paper,(producing it;) he said he was authorised by Mr. Whiteway to press men; he stands upon Towerhill to get all the seamen he can.</p>
               <p>Q. A crimp, I suppose? - A. Yes; I apprehended them, and took them before the Magistrates at Shadwell; and there the prosecutor swore positively to Ennis and Smith; he never had the least doubt about them; the watch has never been found.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know either of the prisoners? - A. Yes, all of them; two I know particularly, Ennis and Brewer, I saw them in the street that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020034"/>might; I was knocked down by three or four men, and the man that was delivered to me got away, but when I self upon the ground, I saw Ennis and Brewer run away; Ennis made a reply to his other comrades, come up this place, that was White's-yard; upon that I went to the watch-house and gave information; when the prosecutor gave me charge of the first man, I told him what gang they were, they used to go a pressing of a night.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BARWELL sworn. - I am a firkinman; I buy table-beer and ale to sell again: I went to New Basinghall-street with some trunks from Mr. Moberley's, No. 12, Percy-street, Rathbone-place; there were two trunks, an empty portmantua, and some writing-desks; I took them on a dray, on Tuesday the 11th of March, about seven in the evening; I was going past the Old Bell in Holborn, and a man told me he would give me sixpence to take two prickles of bottles down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020039"/>Chick-lane for him; that was a man of the name of Anstey; I took the bottles; then two other men came up, one of them got up in the dray, and another followed; I think the man that followed was the prisoner Howard; they said they would give me a pot of beer extraordinary to take up a bed; Anstey went alongside the dray; I do not know whether the man in the dray was either of the other prisoners; and as we were going up Snow-hill I missed the trunk, and then I stopped; the man that rode was gone, and the man that walked behind; Anstey kept on; as soon as I missed the trunk, I went back as far as Fleet-market, but could see nothing of them; I then returned to the dray, and detained Anstey; I thought he was concerned; I met with two constables just in Smithfield, and they went after the three prisoners, and took them; they told me to go on to Basinghall-street, which I did; they lodged the prisoners in the watch-house, with the trunk; the trunk contained the articles mentioned in the indictment; Mr. Moberly delivered the trunk to me; Mr. Moberly saw the trunk again at Guildhall; I lost the trunk about the middle of Snow-hill; I saw it twice after I left Fleet-market; I saw it again the next day at Guildhall; I am certain it was the same trunk; it was a smooth black trunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.What is a firkinman? - A. I buy table-beer to sell again.</p>
               <p>Q. You sell stale beer for good beer? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Moberly, the prosecutor of this indictment? - A. A gentleman that is in Scotland, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. He has got all his property with him in Scotland, has he not? - A. No; the trunk is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have undertaken to say who that trunk belonged to, if you had not been told so at Guildhall? - A. Yes, I have seen the trunk several times before; I had lived servant with the family.</p>
               <p>Q. A smooth black trunk is no uncommon description, there are many such about town? - A. To be sure there are.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Mr. Moberly pack up the trunk? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to suppose they were his property? - A. I know the trunk was his.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing you had seen the trunk at any other part of the town, would you have said it was Mr. Moberley's? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the contents of the trunk till you got to Guildhall? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have been answerable, would you not, for the trunk and its contents, if you had not found it, and brought this prosecution? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ANSTEY sworn. - I am a broker: On Tuesday the 11th of March last, about half past seven in the evening, I was standing at the Old Bell in Holborn, with some goods which I had bought at a sale; they consisted of two prickles of empty bottles, and a bed; I wanted the bottles taken to a bottle-merchant in Chick-lane; had been there but a few minutes when I saw a dray come past with a trunk and a box or two, and a boy riding upon one of the boxes; I called to the boy once or twice before he answered; at last he answered, and called his master; his master came up, and I told him I had some things to take to Chick-lane; the prisoner Howard was present, to the best of my knowledge; I told the man I would give him sixpence to take the bottles; the carman hesitated, and there were two men standing at my right hand; one of them said, you will take them, won't you, Tom; who he addressed I do not know; he then said to me, I will lend you a hand up with them, master; we then went to the bottles, which were standing upon the pavement, under the Belltap window, put them upon his back, and he put them on to the dray; that was Howard; but it being a dray, we had some difficulty to make them stand upright; he said, master, you had better jump up; I did not like to do that, for I had a bed lying there, and it being dark I thought I might lose it; he then said to his companion, which was Taylor, to the best of my knowledge, Jack, do you jump up; Taylor then jumped up into the cart, and held the prickle of bottles, while Howard and I fetched the other prickle; the last prickle was not like the other, it leaned forward and I expected the bottles would fall out, and I put the bed up to prevent it; Jack, as he called him, which was Taylor, got up in the cart, and Howard followed behind, and I kept along by the cart; as we were going down Holborn, the prisoner Howard asked me what part of Chick-lane the bottles were going to; I told him to Mr. Riber's bottle-warehouse; he said he knew it very well, and described it; as we were going up Snow-hill one of the empty bottles sell out of the prickle upon the stones; the prisoner Howard came forward to me, and said, master, you will lose all your bottles; with that I put my hand to the bed, and pressed it; immediately after that the drayman said, I have lost the trunk; I looked round, and the two men were both gone; I was then detained till I gave a satisfactory account where I bought my goods, and where I was going to take them; I know nothing of the prisoner Daly; I verily believe that Howard and Taylor are the two men, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You and Howard have been old acquaintances? - A. No, I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020040"/>saw him before; I thought he belonged to the drayman, and the drayman thought he belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Howard dressed? - A. He had a jacket on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the man now called Hayward was taken within half an hour? - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. That man was dressed in a jacket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the man you called Howard, when he was taken, was dressed in a great coat? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had never seen him before? - A. Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life are you in? - A. A broker; I had been buying goods at a sale of Mr. Winstanley's.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the town did you live in? - A. Pentonville; I bought these things at a sale in Wimpole-street.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a charge against you for this business? - A. Yes; the man had a right to charge me, seeing them so familiar with me.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not attempt to charge Howard till after you were charged yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw him at the Magistrate's, did you venture to swear he was the man? - A. I said, as I say now, that I verily believe he was the man, but he was then in a different dress to what he was when he assisted me.</p>
               <p>JOHN POPE sworn. - I am a constable under the Marshal's direction: On the 11th of March, between seven and eight in the evening, I was coming from my own house, in Robinhood-court, Shoe-lane, through Eagle and Child-alley, and I was obliged to come back, by a person coming through the narrow part of the passage, into Shoe-lane, and then I observed four or five men coming with a box; they crossed the way, and turned to the right-hand, towards Holborn; I then went on towards Smithfield, and in Smithfield I met with a parcel of people round a dray; I was told that a box was lost; I asked what sort of a one, I was told it was a large black trunk; we went back into Shoe-lane, and got intelligence of it; we found it in Plumbtree-court, Shoe-lane, No. 20, up two pair of stairs; Mr. Thrale opened the door, and saw the box, and the three prisoners in the room; Mr. Thrale said, gentlemen, we are come for this box; they desired us to come in, they behaved very quietly, and made no resistance; we sent the box away by a porter to Mr. Thrale's house, and we took the prisoners to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the porter here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark the box before you sent it to Thrale's? - A. No, no further than putting a cord round it; I can almost swear it was the same box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.They came very willingly with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear to this black box by the tying of it? - A. I think it is the same box.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not 
               <persName id="t18000402-46-person373">Howard</persName>
             a great-coat on when he was taken? - A. Yes, exactly as he is dressed now.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was within twenty minutes after the offence was committed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - I am constable and beadle of the parish of St. Sepulchre's; on Tuesday the 11th of March, I was upon evening duty with the patrole; going down Snow-hill, there was a dray stopped, with a number of people about it, I enquired what was the matter; I then went in pursuit of the trunk, with Dennis; we went a little way down Snow-hill, and detained the man that was with the bottles; we then got intelligence, and went to Plumb-tree-court, Shoe-lane, No. 20; we went up two pair of stairs, there were the three prisoners in the room; Dennis had a cutlass drawn, we went in, and the men made no resistance at all; there was the trunk in the room; I sent the trunk to Mr. Ashmore's, the Ward-beadle, by Mr. Ashmore's porter; I did not see him take it there; I went with the prisoners to the Compter, then I went back to Mr. Ashmore's, and took the trunk into my custody, and have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the trunk again? - A. Yes; I did not put any mark upon it, but when I found the trunk at the house, I opened it, and saw some of the contents, so that I am pretty sure it was the same; it was a black trunk with small nails, the top of the hasp was burst from the lid; I have had it ever since, except Dennis bringing it here backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.How do you know that the contents of the trunk were the same? - A. I can swear to it, because there was a particular mark; there was a square book in the trunk, with two green strings to it, and that book was in it when I saw it at Mr. Ashmore's; I could not swear to the trunk; I suppose those that made it, could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>JOHN DENNIS sworn. - I was present with the last witness, at Plumb-tree-court, Shoe-lane; the three prisoners were in the room, with the trunk; we sent the trunk to Mr. Ashmore's, by the porter; and I went with it, and helped the porter down with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.The house you took them in was a common lodging-house? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. They behaved very well, did they not? - A. Yes, they did. (The trunk produced, and part of the articles deposed to by Mr. Moberley, brother to the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Howard's defence. They were pressed several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020041"/>times before the Magistrate to swear to me, and they would not, because, they said, I had changed my cloaths; I met with Daly, and he promised to give me a bit of paint to paint my box, and I went up into the room with him, and the trunk was in the room when we went up, and these gentlemen came in and took us away; I knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Taylor's defence. Howard and I went into the market to buy something for supper, and met with this young man, and Howard asked him to give him a bit of paint to paint his box, and he said he would, if he would go home with him, and I went with them; I should not know the house again, if I was to see it.</p>
               <p>Daly's defence. I met with these two young men in Fleet-market, and Howard asked me for a bit of paint; I went into the room, and saw the trunk there; I was going out of the room to enquire how it came there, when these gentlemen came in and seized us.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Howard called one, Taylor one, and Daly three witnesses, who gave them a good character. Howard, <rs id="t18000402-46-verdict262" type="verdictDescription">

            , lottery-office-keepers and stock-brokers, at Charing-cross, and Cornhill: On the 5th of March last, the prisoner came to the office at Charing-cross, to demand the sixteenth part of a one thousand pound prize, (produces it); it is now exactly in the same state in which he brought it; he presented it to the numerical book to be examined, I heard another clerk inform him that the figure had been altered; I examined the share to see whether it was drawn or undrawn, I told him that the figure o had been altered to a 2; he said it was in the same state as when he purchased it, he insisted upon its being a 2, and that it had been drawn a one thousand pound prize; by that time Mr. Richardson came into the office, and we gave him that share; Mr. Richardson desired him to walk into the back office, which he did, and I also accompanied him; Mr. Richardson informed him, that what he had uttered was of very serious consequence, and, if he persisted in it, it might affect his life; Mr. Richardson then asked him who he was, and who he lived with; he said he lived with a Mr. Moore, a tin-plate worker, and had been intrusted with a great deal of property, and could have a very good character; Mr. Richardson informed him that the figure had been altered, by whom he could not pretend to say, but if he would bring Mr. Moore with him, and some of the other members, for it belonged to a club, he would convince him of his error, by having such books from the City-office, that would convince him the original figure was an o, and that we did not share that ticket that it purported to belong to; he still persisted, and Mr. Richardson informed him, after what he said, that if he persisted in demanding the payment of it, that he must take him to Bow-street; he demanded payment of it, and of course he was taken there.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe there is a bar above and under the o, which you suppose it originally was, are those bars above and under any thing but an o? - A. No, they are not; they are put to prevent its being altered to a 6 or a 9.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they fixed in such a manner as an o can possibly be made to resemble a 2, as you make it? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these; are these original tickets before the lottery began? - A. The two first are original tickets from the Stamp-office, they have been shared.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the figure 2 ever made with a strait bar? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, in this which has been produced, the bottom of these two bars which is now made to be the bottom of the 2, is below the centre bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Is that ever the case in the genuine figures of 2? - A. It is always placed upon the line of the centre bar.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is not the 2, both at the top and the bottom, made in the same line with the other figures of that number? - A. Yes; the figures in our shares may not be made so well as in the original ticket, but they are all made in one way.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe the ink with which your figures are written is of a particular colour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the object of that particularity? - A. To prevent the figures being altered or taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the connecting stroke of this o, and the lower bar, made with that ink, or a different ink? - A. With a different ink.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q.You are perfectly conversant with tickets, and all the different forms in which they are made? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This ticket being presented, it was impossible to impose upon you? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the custom of the office when the shares are exposed? - A. They are never exposed but at the time of felling them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many clerks might there be in the office at that time? - A.Three.</p>
               <p>Q. Men or boys? - A.Men; there are two lads, but not in the share department.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not in their power to get at them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not pens and ink about the counter? - A. Yes, of course.</p>
               <p>Q. Do your customers never come and use pens and ink? - A. Not upon the shares.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner came to your shop with great confidence? - A.Apparently with confidence.</p>
               <p>Q. He was immediately apprised it was a forgery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He still persisted it was in the state in which he bought it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Richardson advised him not to persist, but to go about his business? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And told him, if he persisted it might affect his life? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And, notwithstanding all this admonition, he did persist? - A. He did; Mr. Richardson refused to return him the share, or else I believe he would have gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the registry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020044"/>of these numbers that he had bought? - A. Yes, they were registered; we have a copy of the register. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when the registry was made? - A. I believe the 1st of February.</p>
               <p>Q. A month before the drawing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the share registered by you correspondent to this register, 9392? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And made a month before, at your office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When any body purchased that share was it registered as 9390, or 9392? - A. It was registered as 9392.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so registered when it was purchased? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.When was it so registered? - A. The 1st of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the day it was purchased? - A. I cannot say; it might have been bought three weeks before, or it might have been that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not then the practice to register the share at the time they buy it? - A. In general it is the practice; but it is very often registered after it is bought.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the purpose of registering? - A. To send an account when it is drawn, whether it is a blank or prize.</p>
               <p>Q.Then a person may register a share that is not bought at your office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the register you are now speaking of, 9392, registered as a share or a ticket? - A.As a sixteenth.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q.Have you inspected your book so as to know whether this ticket was not registered at the very time it was bought? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Have not you an opportunity to know from your books the day of the month when this was registered at your office? - A. Yes; but we cannot pretend to say the day of the month that it was sold.</p>
               <p>Q. The 1st of February was above a month before the drawing of the lottery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When were you first desired to look at your register of this ticket? - A. Before the prisoner came, we found that it had been registered wrong, knowing that we did not share the ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon finding that you had a wrong register, did you conclude that some mistake had happened in your shop? - A. No; we concluded that he called the o as a 2.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you discover you had registered the wrong number? - A. Immediately upon the ticket being drawn.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon the ticket being drawn, and your referring to your register, you would suppose of course that your office was liable to pay the one thousand pounds? - A. No; we did not share the ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate this mistake to Mr. Richardson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon the ticket being drawn, you say you found you had the register of 9392, but that you had not sold that ticket? - A.Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Richardson say any thing with respect to that? - A. He said we had called it wrong, or the prisoner had; or we had copied it wrong; Mr. Richardson sent to Mr. Arnull, and Mr. Arnull said it was a mistake; it was 9390 that we sold; people very often call a 2 for an o in registering, though they are not at all alike.</p>
               <p>Q. This number was drawn on the 3d of March? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell this young man that you had discovered the mistake? - A. He was told it was a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any share registered from the party who registered this list of numbers, of 9390? - A. None at all; I can very easily account for the register being wrong; the prisoner mentioned at Bow-street -</p>
               <p>Q. Was it taken down in writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not tell us what he mentioned. - When he came to the office, and Mr. Richardson saw him, did he communicate to him that you had discovered the mistake in the register, about that very ticket? - A. No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a month before the drawing of the lottery that this was registered? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q.Does the registering-clerk copy the ticket, or does the person holding the ticket tell him the number? - A. Sometimes one way, and sometimes the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible the registering-clerk could take this for a 2, if he saw it himself? - A.Impossible.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a clerk in the Stamp-office, in the department of receiving tickets that are to be shared, and give them stamps back in return; we retain the original ticket; we keep the ticket three clear days after it is drawn, and then they have a right to demand it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you do any thing to the shares to authenticate them before you deliver them? - A. Yes, they are stamped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this very ticket, 9390, shared? - A. Yes, into sixteenths; which sixteenths we stamped.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this one of those that you so stamped? - A. I would not take upon me to swear that this did not pass through in the state that it now is; it was stamped, no doubt, by the stamper in our office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether 9392 was shared? - A. Yes, by Mr. Hornsby; and divided into two quarters, two eights, and four sixteenths, on the very same day that the other was divided by Mr. Richardson, the 29th of January.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NORMAN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a clerk in the Stamp-office; it is my business to enter the original ticket, with the number of shares into which it is divided, the day on which it is divided, and the name of the office-keeper by whom it is divided.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they entered to see that no more shares than they purport to be, are passed? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that share; should you have passed that for 9392? - A. By no means, on account of the difference there is between this 2 and the 2's which are in general made.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. You do not think it would pass upon you or any lottery-office keeper? - A. Certainly not, because there is no figure that has a bar to it but the o.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you happen to know who gave you the numbers so registered? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Q.Look at that share; had that been put before you to be registered, should you have registered it? - A. I should have seen it had been altered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have now been told there is a mistake in it, or an alteration? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body hint that there was an alteration till the ticket was drawn a prize of one thousand pounds? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, was not this a number registered by you as a number bought at your office, for which your office is responsible? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not registered as a ticket bought at your office? - A. Yes, it is.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you mean to say you have any doubt that it was bought on the 1st of February? - A. I have no doubt, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not enter in a book the day the different shares are sold? - A. No, not the shares.</p>
               <p>Q.How many days after this was shared at the Stamp-officer, was it before it was sold? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Norman.) Can you say you passed the shares of 9390? - A. It was divided on the 29th of January; they were delivered to the office-keeper that day, from the entry in the book, I should imagine between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Frost.) Did you register this singly, or with a number of others? - A.With a number of others, from the same person.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, from the time that you discovered it was a prize till the time he came to claim it, send him any notice of it? - A. No, I did not; because I knew we had not shared that number.</p>

I should be glad to know, for it wants a little explanation, when you found that this man had really registered this number, and then found that register a mistake, and knew where he lived; how came you not to inform him of it? - A.Knowing that he did not hold a share of that number.</p>
               <p>Q.But you had taken the sixpence for registering that number, and therefore at the least you might have informed him it was a register of a forged share? - A. We did not know it was forged at that time.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. On the 5th of March, I saw the prisoner in our office; one of the clerks in the office came to acquaint me in the back office, that I was wanted in the fore office; in consequence of that, I went into the front office, the prisoner at that time was in an altercation with my clerk, seemingly warm; I therefore desired him to come into the back office, with Mr. Goddard; Mr. Goddard informed me, in the prisoner's presence, that he had brought a share of ours, the number of which had been altered; I received the share into my possession, and immediately discovered the alteration; I observed to the prisoner, that the had presented an instrument to me that would be attended with very serious consequences, if he came to demand payment for it, and desired that he would be very cautious in what answer he made me; he then told me that it was a sixteenth of a one thousand pound prize, and that he came for payment; I told him the number had been altered form 9390, to 9392, but that it had been altered in such a manner as could not impose upon us; I begged of him to bring his friend or any body that he thought proper, and it would be explained satisfactorily to them what the number of the share really was; he answered me, that he knew it to be 9392, as such he had bought it of us, it had not been altered since he bought it, that he had that number with others, printed on a card, and that he would not be hummed, or humbugged, that it was registered, that he had copied the numbers upon a piece of paper, and that he had so registered them; I told him, that in consequence of the o's having bars at top and bottom, they were very frequently read for 2's, that he must originally have made a mistake, but that mistake could transfer nothing to the real share; he persisted in the same over and over again, and I thought it proper to recommend it to him to wait till the next morning; but he observed, as I had threatened him with taking him to Bow-street, he certainly would go there, and I took him there.</p>

               <p>Q.When you have registered tickets, you send notice to the persons so registering? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to give him notice? - A. There were very strong reasons to induce me to believe, that the prisoner or some other person had made a mistake in registering that number; I saw that number in the midst of nine others, all of which, excepting that number, were sold by us; I believe this was the strong circumstance which induced me to think that a mistake had arose in the registering; I therefore did prevent the letter from being sent to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You have told my Lord, that notwithstanding all your expostulations, and all your menaces, the poor fellow insisted upon it that he would not be harmed, and would go to Bow-street? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had an opportunity of seeing, by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020047"/>your book, when that share was sold? - A. No; we have issued twenty-six or twenty-seven thousand sixteenths-alone, it is hardly possible to do it; whole tickets we do make a memorandum of.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner said it was so registered, did you refer to the register? - A. No; I knew before that it was a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. That register was made by your clerk; from what he made it you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That was made a month before? - A. Yes; it is impossible that the prisoner could have a design, previous to the lottery being drawn, nor could we.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact, in that registery, there was no such number as the real number 9390? - A. No. (The share read. )</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The numbers were called over to that gentleman by another clerk in the same office, from the original numbers on the Saturday night.</p>

             Sworn - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am the sister of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his shewing, you any tickets? - A. Yes; on Saturday the 1st of February, after eight o'clock in the evening, at No. 2, Adelphi-terrace; he shewed me six sixteenths, and four eighths.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you remember that particular number? - A. I repeated them to my brother, and he took these numbers down as I repeated them, upon a piece of paper; after that I repeated them again-and they corresponded with the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that one of those numbers was 9392? - A. Yes; after I had repeated them twice over, I particularly remarked that number to my brother, saying, Thomas, this is the date of the year that you and I came to London, 92.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come to London in the year 1792? - A. Yes, I did, and my brother likewise; the list that my brother took from the tickets, I gave to Edward Stinton, Mr. Cleland's butter, for him to get the list printed; he was one of the club.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many belonged to that club, to be entitled to the benefit of that share? - A. Twenty-nine people.</p>
               <p>Q.How were they to be printed? - A.Upon cards, in order to be distributed to the different members for their satisfaction.</p>

               <p>Q. This was an extremely important fact of the year ninety-two, being the year you came to London, how came that not to be in the affidavit? - A. I told Mr. Pincutt of it, if it is any neglect it is his.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, it was not in the affidavit? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any shares of tickets that the prisoner had purchased? - A. I do; I took a list of them upon this piece of tin, from the shares themselves; (produces it;) I took them down on Monday morning, the 3d of February; when he brought the shares into the shop, he said it was very necessary that somebody should take down the numbers from the shares, for their own satisfaction, and I did it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Do you know when he bought them? - A. On the Saturday night before; I had not seen him till the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing particular occur to you upon the shares? - A. No; after I had taken them down he wrote them upon a piece of board with chalk over the fire-place; and then we compared both what he had wrote, and what I had wrote upon the tin, with the original shares, and found they were correct; I was very particular about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at that share? - A. I can swear it is the same number; but I cannot swear it is the same sixteenth.</p>

Six hundred and fifty pounds each, (Produces them); I have had them ever since, excepting when they were before the Magistrate, and the Grand Jury; when I received them, I desired the prisoner to endorse them, which he did in my presence; I then took possession of the bills, and gave him the money for both, deducting the discount.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember how you paid him? - A. Yes; I gave him a one thousand pound note, two one hundred pound notes, a fifty pounds note, a thirty pound note, and seven pounds seventeen shillings and ten-pence in money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Have you not recollected this from referring to your book? - A. The book is here, (produces it); I took the notes from Mr. Potts, who made the entry; I was present when the prisoner was apprehended the day following, Sunday the 16th, at a pastrycook's-shop, in Newgate-street; from that pastrycook's, he was taken to Mr. Burton's Finsbury-terrace.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear from the prisoner where he lodged? - A. I heard him say, at the pastrycook's, that the notes were at his father-in-law's, in Finsbury-terrace; in consequence of which we went to Mr. Burton's; I went up stairs, and he desired them to be brought, and the notes were all brought down except the thousand pound note, and the thirty; there were others which I did not claim; the notes were delivered to Carpmeal.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen them since? - A. Yes, I saw them at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those notes part of the notes that you had paid to Mr. Dawson at the time you discounted the bills? - A. Yes; I asked him what had become of the thirty pound note -</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Had you not stated to him that he had better confess? - A. I believe, something of that sort might be said.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020049"/>Mr. Knapp. Then we must not hear any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fuller. I received the notes at Bow-street, after the examination, they were delivered to me by Sir William Addington. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing at all about the one thousand pound note? - A. Yes; at Finsbury-square I had a one thousand pound note delivered to me by Mr. Burton, the father-in-law of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the one thousand pound note that you had given to the prisoner at the time he produced the bills to discount? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation respecting it, in the prefence of Mr. Dawson? - A. Yes; I asked for the one thousand pound note, and I was informed, by some person present in the room, that Mr. Burton had received that note, and was gone to look for it for me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q.Which of your partners was it that you gave the six hundred and fifty pound bill to? - A.

               <p>THOMAS CARPMEAL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I was employed to apprehend the prisoner: I went with Mr. Fuller, about four o'clock on Sunday the 16th of February, to a pastrycook's-shop, of the name of Nicholl, I think, in Newgate-street; upon going into a back-parlour I found the gentleman at the bar, and a man with him; we put him into a coach, and took him to Mr. Burton's, at Finsbury-terrace, where he said he lived; I took him into the parlour where his mother, Mrs. Burton, was; I had been in the morning and searched the place, but could not find the notes; she said, that after I was gone, she had broke open a bureau, or a scrutoire, I don't know which, and took out these notes belonging to him; we waited till Mr. Burton came in, which was in about half an hour; there were several inquiries made of him where he had been, and he produced a one thousand pound note, and Mr. Fulier said it was not belonging to him; Mr. Burton said, he had received it in a note sent from the prisoner that morning, he said that in the prisoner's presence; he then produced another one thousand pound note, saying he had received it from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Are you sure the prisoner was present at this time? - A. I have no doubt of it; that second one thousand pound note Mr. Fuller said was his; I said, very likely the other belonged to somebody else, and I should keep them both; I took possession of them, and of the notes that I received from Mrs. Burton, I kept them till we got to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this sealed parcel? - A. This is the parcel containing the notes, there are two of one thousand pound, two of one hundred pound, a fifty pound, two of twenty pound, and three of ten pound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fuller. The one thousand pound note, the two of one hundred, and the fifty, are part of the notes that I paid for the bills.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. There is one observation I wish to make: Carpmeal just now observed I was present at the time Mrs. Burton gave him up the notes; I was not present; for I never saw Mr. Burton from the time that he came into the house till I went out, for when these notes were given up, they were up stairs and I was below.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Carpmeal.) Q. Was the prisoner present or not? - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fuller. The notes delivered by Mrs. Burton, were delivered in the presence of the prisoner; the one thousand pound note delivered by Mr. Burton was delivered in his absence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called Mr. Whitfield, of Covent-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020050"/>Garden Theatre, and Mr. Boulton, of Charing-cross, who deposed that his character had been perfectly honourable upon all occasions.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure they were taken out? - A. Yes; they were completely taken out by both hands, before I got over the counter; there were a number of smaller articles that were gone altogether, there were two tristing things picked up at a little distance from the house; the prisoner was brought back to the house by two watchmen, and I gave charge of him, James Rose was one of the watchmen; upon looking at the door, I found the pendant ring of the lock of the door broke off; I looked round, and to the scraper I saw tied a piece of new cord, and at the other end of it the pendant ring, it had broke in getting the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite positive you saw them go out at the window? - A. Yes; I saw a man's hands take them out.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth? - A. They cost us more than twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What shop do you keep? - A. A silversmith's and jeweller's shop; my husband is an optician by prosession; I am sure they are my husband's property.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am assistant elder in the India Company's warehouses: In consequence of information that I had received, on Monday the 10th of March, I went down into the privy, where I found marks of tea spilt upon the floor; the prisoner was a labourer in the warehouses; I summoned all the labourers together, the prisoner was among them; he produced to me a quantity of tea from his breeches, secreted in a small bag; he took it out himself upon my challenging the labourers, he came forward and said he was guilty, and produced the tea; it is impossible to say whose tea it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of any promise, or threat, to induce him to confess? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a young hand in the warehouses, I acknowledged that I had taken some waste tea, I did not know it was of any consequence; it was not tea answerable to the sample that was found in the privy; I have a wife and four children; I took it as waste tea; I leave it to your Lordship and the Jury.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. She first of all refused to own the things? - A. Yes; she was a long time before the Magistrate, and after some conversation she owned one of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that conversation a threat to commit her? - A. Yes; the Magistrate asked her if she knew the consequence of not swearing the truth, that she was liable to be committed for perjury.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate order her out for commitment before she would swear to any of the property? - A. She was ordered out with a young man that was with her.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Lambeth-street: On the 21st of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I went to the prosecutor's house, in Baker's row; I found the prisoner in custody in a room adjoining the bar, he was delivered up to me, and I took him into the parlour, he was crying very much; I said, I am sorry to see you in this situation, your father being a respectable man in the parish; he said, he had been drinking with some sailers in that house for about an hour, and that he was very much in liquor or he should not have done it; he seemed as if he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not so much in liquor as not to know what he was about? - A. I do not think he was; he said he did take them, and that he carried them home to his own house, but he did not think any body saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any promise, or offer of favour? - A. None at all; he said he carried them up two pair of stairs, and threw them into the chimney-place; I asked him if he took them through distress; he said, he was very short of money, and what he earned would not support him and his wife; and that he had applied to his father several times, and he could not get any thing from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were he and you the only persons in the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you gave him no hopes if he told the truth? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that his parents were respectable, and wondered that he could have done such a thing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He seemed to you as if he had drank a great deal of liquor? - A. He did; he said he should not have done it if he had not been so much in liquor.(The property was produced).</p>
               <p>Lee. These are Mrs. Harrison's; here is one of them marked A H.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You did not know these things before the Magistrate? - A. Mr. Tweed, and his friends, persuaded us not to own the things, because of hurting his son.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020056"/>Q. Did you not swear, before the Justice, that you did not know that property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harrison. I know these to be mine; there are the initials of my own name and my daughter's upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you not tell the Justice you could not swear to them? - A. Yes, because I did not look over them; the prisoner's father said, for God's sake do not look at them; but when I did look at them, I was sure they were mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>BARNETT QUINTON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Beville. On the 20th of November the prisoner Deakin and I went out in a one-horse cart, and Smith went on horseback, down the Edmonton road; and just beyond Ponder's-end we robbed this coach; I cannot say what coach it was; we took seven boxes and a brown paper parcel from the boot behind.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get at them? - A. Deakin got in and put them out to Smith, and I took them to the cart; the coach was going on at the time; it was just after dusk in the evening; they were all brought to Deakin's house; one box contained three watches, a hunting-watch not finished, and a case of another; eight table-spoons, four small desert-spoons, five dozen tea-spoons, five watch-chains, a quantity of watch keys and watch-glasses, three gown-pieces, two pieces of silk handkerchiefs, a hat in a box, a hat in another box, and a bonnet; I do not recollect any thing else; Deakin had a dozen of small spoons and a watch; Smith kept a dozen, two large spoons, and a watch; I had a dozen also, and two large ones, and a watch; the remainder of the things were sold, and the money divided; I cannot say whether they are the same spoons or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.How long have you been a thief? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you to a year or two? - A. I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you not treat him with great cruelty? - </p>
               <p>Court. Nothing can appear worse, with respect to his character, than his own account to-day; he ought not to be credited in a tittle in which he is not confirmed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.You do not know what coach this was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor what day it was? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was the 20th.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to go out with a cart with other people to rob carts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to go out with a man of the name of Ryland? - A. Yes, that I have answered for.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you always said these were the two men that were with you in this robbery? - A. I have always said so.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath did you not twice say they were not the men? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate, I know nothing against these men? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing of that kind? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. How often were these men brought up for examination before you swore to them? - A. I was there twice without them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not recollect the Magistrate telling you, all this amounts to nothing if you cannot speak to these being the men? - A. I always said they were the men.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not charge a man of the name of Ryland with this robbery? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020058"/>Q. The Magistrate discharged Ryland? - A. Yes; there were no owners for the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beville. My Lord, there is a mistake in the indictment, in the names of the proprietors; I must now prove the property in the coachman.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is answerable to the proprietors? - A.Nobody.</p>

I staid up later than usual on account of a suspicious noise that I had heard in the house; I had seen all the doors and windows fastened, I heard no noise after I went to bed, I was not the first up in the morning. I saw the yard and premises at twelve o'clock for the last time, while in the yard I heard St. Paul's clock strike twelve; I looked into the back shop and saw leather lying in various directions at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the back shop a part of your house? - A. No; I also saw a blue coat hanging on a nail; I shut the shop-door, looked at the back-door, which opens into Alfred-buildings, it was locked and barred with iron, and stapled in; I then came in, and went into the kitchen for a few minutes, and then into the parlour, we have a communication from that parlour to the back shop; while I was in the parlour, I heard a noise, which appeared to me to he either in the back shop, or the yard, which is altogether; the back shop opens into the yard and into the parlour too; for the moment I was much alarmed, and immediately went to the kitchen; as soon as I came into the kitchen, I observed a man looking down the kitchen area, in the front of the Row, it is a very private place; I expressed my alarm to the maid servant, and immediately locked myself in the kitchen, and staid there till near two o'clock; at length I saw no person in front of the Row, I went up stairs into my own bed-room, and looked out at the window which looks over the back yard and premises, hoping I might discover what the alarm had been, I did not observe any body; then I looked at Mr. Ellis's watch, it was ten minutes past two; I went to take my own watch to wind up; I looked out at the window, and heard voices distinctly, in low conversation, it appeared to me to he in Alfred-buildings, which is at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020059"/>back of our premises; after listening for some time I thought they were gone, and I went to bed.</p>

               <p>Q.This shop is a continuation of buildings? - A. It is, from the front to the back, it leaves room for a passage and stair-case, it is enclosed at the end of the premises chiefly by buildings, and a wall ten feet high.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there an immediate communication between your back shop and the house? - A.Immediately from the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q.Is there a communication between the front and the back shop? - A. Yes, through the parlour; there is a glass light between, with a door, but the door is never opened; it is all inclosed with a brick wall, and buildings, which incloses the whole; there is a door out of the back shop into the yard; I shut that door, and latched it, but I cannot say that I locked it; the door that leads into Alfred-buildings was locked and barred with iron.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you think you had got a good bargain? - A.

               <p>Q. What business are you? - A. I keep carts and horses for moving goods and rubbish.</p>
               <p>Q.This horse was traced into your possession? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were charged with having stole the horse yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you fixed upon the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; and by the description I gave Mr. Ramsden, he knew the person; I was coming our<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020062"/>of my yard after setting my people to work; it was about fifty or sixty yards from my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him to your house? - A. No; we went to a public-house, and there I wrote the note.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not ask him how he came by it till after you had paid him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had no suspicion, from seeing a cord instead of a halter? - A. No, he told such a good story; because if it was tied behind a load of bay, being lame, if it gave a snatch, it would break the halter.</p>

             sworn. - I keep a slaughter-house for horses at Haggerston: On the 25th of March, Mr. Archer brought a lame blind black stone-horse into my yard, a little after nine in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you live from Mr. Archer's? - A. Not quite half a mile; he asked me two pounds for it, he would not take less; I bought it of him; it staid all day in the yard for our inspector to see it; when he had seen it, I sent that and another black horse up to the slaughter-house; the inspector's name is Daniel Hartshorn; the next day, Wednesday, the horse was slaughtered; we always bring the hides from the slaughtering-house to the place where I live; the hide of this horse was brought down; I shewed it to Mr. Ramsden, and he claimed it; Mr. Ramsden had picked out the legs from among others before he saw the hide.</p>

             sworn. - I am inspector of this slaughtering-house: I went down to Mr. Marsh's house on the 25th of March, Tuesday, and the horse was standing in the yard; I asked him who he had bought the horse of; he told me he had bought it of Mr. Archer, in Kingsland-road. On the 1st of April I went to the shed where they kill, and got intelligence that a person had been enquiring about such a horse; and I immediately went over to Mr. Ramsden: (reads his entry;) "March 25, 1800. A black stone-horse, six years old, fifteen hands high, blaze down his face, near heel behind white, long tail, from

               <p>Q.(To Ramsden.) Had you been at the slaughter-house before you saw Hartshorn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Marsh. I was not in the way; when I came home at night, my man told me a person had been enquiring about a black blind stone-horse; and that he had said there was no such horse; I told him there were three, and immediately sent the inspector to enquire who this gentleman was that had been making the enquiry.</p>
               <p>Ramsden. The prisoner has been a labourer to me, and drove this horse at water-cart last summer for me; he lives within two hundred yards of my house; from the description Archer gave, I knew he was the man, and I apprehended him last Wednesday.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 23, Noel-street, Soho: I have known the prisoner about three years; he has been a helper in a stable-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020063"/>yard at the bottom of Swallow-street: On Sunday evening, the 16th of March, I happened to be in liquor and went into a public-house where he was, I was so intoxicated that I could hardly walk; he went, out of friendship, to see me home; that was nearly about twelve o'clock; there was another person with me whose surname I do not know, his christian name is Thomas; we went on to the corner of Marshall-street and Silver-street; we stopped round the corner, and there were the patrols coming along, and there being three of us, there was not room for them to pass, and I being in liquor interrupted one of them, and the patrol caught hold of me immediately by the collar; it seems I made some resistance, and he sprung his rattle; immediately some other watchmen came up, to prevent his striking me, as they told me afterwards; I was taken into custody both by the hands and by the collar, and hurried away among them; the prosecutor then came out of the wine-vaults, he came out without his hat, and wished to intercede for me, seeing that I was in liquor; the patrol told him I had interrupted him in his duty, and I saw no more of it till I had got near the bottom of Golden-square; one of them, in scuffing with me, I found had cut me on the head; I was not sensible of it at the time of receiving the wound; I asked the liberty to let me tie a handkerchief round my head; I was without my hat; my hands were then at liberty for the first time during the scuffle; I knew I had a watch, and as soon as my handkerchief was tied round my head, I clapped my hand down to my pocket to feel if I had got my watch, and I found my watch was gone; I instantly put my hands into my waistcoat-pocket, being frightened, and I found in this pocket a watch that seemed to be very small; I took it into my hand and felt it; I said to the patrol, surely this cannot be my watch, it is so very small; I then put it into this waistcoat-pocket, thinking no more of the matter, not being certain; and when I came to the watch-house, I said, surely gentlemen, this is not my watch that I have got in my pocket, by the size of it; I then pulled it out, and the prosecutor owned it, and at the same moment I saw my own watch lie upon the table; but how it came there I cannot tell; I asked the prisoner if he knew how that watch came to be put upon me, and he said he could not tell; he said he had taken my watch to take care of, that I should not lose it in the scuffle; I never saw this gentleman's watch till I got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Court. I do not recollect seeing the last witness till I had got to the watch-house; I thought I had seen him in the crowd.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he appear to you to be sober? - A. No, he was not; he was very drunk.</p>
               <p>GEORGE-COURTNEY TURNER sworn. - I was going home about twelve o'clock; I heard a noise, and I heard Mr. Court's voice; I asked him what was the matter; he said the prisoner at the bar had taken his watch; I immediately secured one of his hands, and Mr. Court secured the other; Mr. Court had hold of him when I came up.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Craighton to Mr. Court? - A. I did not see him to my knowledge till we got to the watch-house; when we got to the watch-house I opened one hand, and Mr. Court opened the other; I thought I had got a watch in the hand that I had hold of, but it was only part of a chain, with the seal to it; I said, that is not Mr. Court's watch; the prisoner said he did not know any thing at all about it; then I saw Craighton come in, with his head wounded; I asked him if he had got it, and he said he had got a watch that did not belong to him; his was a silver one; he was very much intoxicated; I questioned him how he came by the watch; he pointed to several people that were sitting there, and said, that is the man; and afterwards he pointed to the prisoner at the bar, and said that was the man that gave him the watch.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say that was the man that had given him the watch? - A. Yes; and the prisoner did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. I see you gave a different account before the Magistrate; there you say, you heard Craighton say, in the presence of Etherington, that he had taken his watch out of his pocket, to which Etherington seemed to agree? - A. That was afterwards; after the prisoner was in the watch-house, the prisoner said he had taken Craighton's watch out of his pocket to take care of it; when I made enquiry after Mr. Court's watch, Craighton gave up the watch very readily.</p>

               <p>JAMES LORN sworn. - I was going home, after twelve o'clock; I heard the rattles spring, and I came back to see what was the matter; and the patrol came up to Mr. Court's assistance; I helped to take him to the watch-house, and we were pulling and hauling, and Mr. Court came up, and said he would be his friend; the prisoner came up and said, Mr. Craighton, I have got your watch safe, do not be afraid of it; Mr. Court felt, and said, you have taken mine, you villain, stop thief, stop thief; and we took all three; the prisoner said, I have not got your watch, I have got no watch but my friend's; here it is, and I will take care of it; Mr. Court laid hold of his hand, and in it was a silver watch; the prosecutor said, that is not mine; afterwards Craighton produced a gold watch, and Mr. Court said that was his.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. In the crowd I took Mr. Craighton's watch to take care of, as I knew he had a good watch; somebody made a snatch at it, and broke the chain; then Mr. Court came up and said, I had got his watch; I said I had not any but Craighton's, and that I would take to the watch-house; and they took me there; if I had had the gentleman's watch I might have gone, for I was not in custody till after I had got Craighton's watch from him.(The watch was deposed to by Mr. Court.)</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk at the Hambro' wharf: The last witness acquainted me with what he had seen, and I saw this flax secreted in the covering that he had to cover his goods with; there is full ten pounds of it; it came from Mr. Walker, of Mark-lane, in Mr. Bryant's waggon; he is a carrier, and brought it to the wharf for shipping.</p>
               <p>Earle. (Produces the flax;) I have kept it ever since; he had some loose in the waggon, but I saw him pull this out of the mat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not load the waggon, and I found this loose in the waggon; I had some loose flax to deliver at the New Inn in the Old Bailey, and I thought it belonged to that.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. This gentleman hired me upon the stand; he said there were a few boxes; I asked him if he wanted any help, and he said, yes; I fetched the goods down two pair of stairs, and I told him I would not take less than three shillings and sixpence; I charged him two shillings and two-pence for the cartage, and one shilling and a pot of beer for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Roach.) What did you agree with the prisoner for? - A. For three shillings and sixpence for the hire of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you to pay him a sum for carrying the goods? - A. Yes; when I paid him the three shillings and sixpence, he asked me if I would give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020066"/>him something to drink, I gave him a pot of beer; he did help me down stairs with some of the goods.</p>
               <p>Rainsdon. They are generally paid something for their trouble; a pot of beer, or sixpence.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.What is the fare from Creechurch-lane to the Borough? - A. For household furniture we charge more; the regular fare is two shillings and nine-pence, but for household furniture we are paid so much an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was paid by time, do you think it would come to three shillings and sixpence? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that that is a fair charge for time? - A. I think it is too much.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you were to deduct one shilling and four-pence from three shillings and sixpence, would that be a reasonable charge? - A. No; it is not enough.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Barnjam.) What would be a fair charge for carrying these household goods? - A. I think three shillings and sixpence a fair charge.</p>
               <p>Q. According to the distance, or time? - A. According to the distance, and according to the time; household furniture is very different from merchandize, because it takes a great deal more time.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure he must have come into the shop? - A. I am quite sure of it; the prisoner told me that a gentleman had given it him to carry, at my door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At the time this ticking was taken out of your shop you were in the kitchen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nobody in the shop when you came up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up the man had run away, and you ran after him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had you then of seeing his face? - A. He turned, repeatedly, to see if I was coming after him, and when he got to the pales, I almost caught hold of his hand.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Woodsall. On the 28th of February, I sent a letter by the Post to Bury St. Edmund's, directed to Mrs. Holland, my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter? - A. This is the same letter: I put a guinea, and a seven-shilling-piece, into it, wrapped in a small piece of paper; they put three seals upon the letter, one seal stamped in the middle, and a bit of sealing-wax at each end; and there is another seal upon it, but that was put upon it at the Post-office; I gave the letter to the Postman on the 28th of February.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Was it so covered that it was possible that the guinea and seven-shilling-piece could have sell out? - A. No; the paper was closed all round, that it was impossible it could slip out.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Myers. I am a letter-carrier, in the Finsbury-square division: On the 28th of February, I delivered at the Post-office all the letters that were delivered to me in that division.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Holland) Q. Where did you live at the time you gave this letter to the postman? - A. At Mr. Brookes's, in Finsbury-square; Richards was the man I gave it to.</p>
               <p>JOHN-BAPTIST AUSTIN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I was presiding officer in the Post-office: On the night of the 28th of February, being on the opposite side of the table to the prisoner at the bar, I observed him with a letter in his hand; I thought he was adjusting the sold of it, I thought the sold of the letter might have slipped out; I did not suspect any thing then, till I observed him put the letter on one side upon the table; he was a facer; the letters are thrown promiscuously upon the table, and they face the letters all one way for the convenience of receiving the stamp; they lay them before the stamp, and another person stamps them; he should have faced that letter, and laid it down with the rest; instead of which, he went away with it, and took it to the further corner of the office.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you distant from where he was first employed? - A. About the length of this room; I then communicated what I had observed to Marshall, and desired that he would send the prisoner into the West-India room; I went into the West-India room, and the prisoner followed me; when he came into the room, he brought the letter in one hand and the money in the other; there was a guinea and a seven-shilling piece; I told him what I had observed; he delivered the letter and the money to me, and said he was looking for me to give it me; I told him he had certainly not been looking for me, because I was near enough to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the letter that he delivered to you? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the guinea and seven-shilling-piece wrapped up in a paper? - A. No; it was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When he delivered the letter to you, did he deliver it to you sealed or unsealed? - A. These two packets of wax were burst, the principal seal was entire.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, how were the guinea and seven-shilling-piece got out? - A. I suppose, the sold being narrow, it was shook out at the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing it possible that it might be shook out at the end, is it possible that he might have taken it out for security? - A. He might.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Woodfall. I am a messenger in the Inland-office at the Post-office: On the 28th of February last, in the evening, I told the prisoner Mr. Austin wanted him in the West-India room; Mr. Austin was not far from the prisoner, he turned round and went into the West-India room, and the prisoner fol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020068"/>lowed him; and as soon as he went in, he presented Mr. Austin the letter, and the money separate from the letter; he said to Mr. Austin, he hoped he had no doubt of his having an inclination to secrete the letter; Mr. Austin said, he did not know what to think of the matter, for he had seen him with the letter some time before; Mr. Austin said, he was very sorry that he saw any thing of the kind happen; then Mr. Austin said, I must suspend you; and he would not suffer him to finish his duty, but sent him about his business, and desired him, in the morning to wait on Mr. Stowe, the superintending president; accordingly the prisoner at the bar attended the next morning, very early, to see Mr. Stowe; Mr. Austin was sent for, and I was sent for after; and then the prisoner at the bar related the circumstance to Mr. Stowe, and he ordered Mr. Austin and I to go to Mr. Parkins, the Solicitor for the Post-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. He came voluntarily to Mr. Stowe's, as he was desired, the next morning? - A. He did, very early.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It wanted then but ten minutes of seven; I had a letter in my pocket which was to go into the country, and if I had not delivered it to the carrier before seven it could not go that night; it is very customary if a letter comes to the office, with any thing in it, to shake it; I shook this, and the money dropped out; there are above twenty of us stand all in a row, it is hardly possible to secrete a letter, and I went round with letters to the sixth division; I am remarkably short-sighted, I could not see Mr. Austin, or a friend, six yards from me.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Austin.) Q. Is it not recommended by the office to persons not to send money, but to bring it to the office, and they would be answerable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. I believe there is the word single written upon the letter, is there not? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When he had so produced the letter, what passed? - A. Nothing particular; he was in liquor,(the letter produced); this is the letter; it was not opened till he was in the presence of the solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a customary thing for him to get drunk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Hurst is not the money clerk? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that person here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After being told by Hurst, you found him at the sorting-table, where you would have expected him to be found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had elapsed between the time of Hurst giving you the information, and the time you found him at the sorting-table? - A. About three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Long enough to have got out of the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he did not recollect that he had done it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in liquor, and was addicted to liquor? - A. Yes; he seemed to be very stupid.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hulme. These are the bills of exchange that I put up in that letter; they are all unsatisfied, except one upon ourselves.(One of the bills read).</p>

               <p>Dr. WILLIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I have known the prisoner at the bar twenty-five years: I have prescribed several times for him, and attended him for the purpose of assisting a derangement in his head; his relations and friends said he was very much deranged, and I have often perceived it myself; I exerted myself for him to the utmost of my ability; about two years ago, I believe It was in March, I was given over by my medical friends, I had an asthmatical complaint; Mr. Piers suddenly broke into my chamber, being in the habits of intimacy, he came in in a very wild manner, and clapped me upon my back, and as I lay, very weak and low, with my head upon the pillow upon the table, and said, Doctor, you are a dead man, you are a dead man; your friends do not know your complaint, or do not understand your complaint; nor I do not believe you think yourself so bad as you are; I was exceedingly startled, being low; and my wife was very much frightened, for fear it should take a bad effect upon me; it appeared to be a wild derangement of mind; about a fortnight before this affair happened, he met me in the Borough, just at the turnpike at Newington-causeway, he took and turned me round all on a sudden, being weak, and said, how goes the world with you, doctor; I said, I think it turns round with me at present; it was done with all that flightiness that one would expect from a deranged man; he answered, never mind, Doctor, It will turn round right for an honest man; I attended too at his last examination, at Mrs. Piers's earnest request, and I was then not well at all; I stood under the dial at Bow-street, and after the witnesses were examined, he was very much deranged, and stood like an ideot, picking his nose, and appeared very much deranged; it was impossible to have any other opinion of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Having seen him at the time of his examination, are you of opinion that he is deranged? - A. Undoubtedly, at times; he seems at times a little sensible, but it goes off again very quickly.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I have known the prisoner seven years; for the last six or eight months I have seen him very frequently; his mind has been certainly much deranged at times; in the course of that time, about five months ago, I came to town from Beckenham, in Kent, and brought my daughter with me; Mr. Piers knew of my marriage, four years ago, with Mr. Coxen; I came to see his eldest daughter, that I had been particularly intimate with, and bringing my daughter with me, he asked me how I came by a child, where I had picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know that you had a child by your marriage? - A. Most certainly; it will be twelve months old to-morrow; he asked me who I was, where I came from, and what my name was, though he had seen me several times, at his own house, during my pregnancy; he asked me a number of questions, and then entered into a latin discourse, which he knew I was not conversant with, and then told me I was a fool for not understanding it; his daughter has some knowledge of latin, and she told me it was latin; so, from that time, whatever Mr. Piers has said to me, at different times, I have never answered, or took notice of, being quite inconsistent with any thing that is reasonable; I saw him about a month before this business occurred, he came home while I was in the house, his conduct appeared then exactly in the same manner as it had done for four or five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you, from your observation of his conduct, that he had possession of his mind? - A. No; he certainly was deranged at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his conduct, at the various times you saw him, wholly inconsistent? - A. Yes; within these eight months particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect any particular expressions that he has made use of? - A. No; I paid no attention to any thing that he said, he was so inconsistent.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt, from your observation, that his mind was deranged? - A. I always thought his mind was deranged.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever communicate that opinion of your's? - A. No; it was public to every one in the office.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you observed his conversation at any time? - A. Yes; I have had a great many conversations with him; his conduct has been totally irregular, and he flies off, and becomes confused; he has not the least rational way of connecting his ideas for any time.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020071"/>Q. This was known to a great many in the office as well as yourself? - A. Yes; to those that have had the same opportunity.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his conduct such as to induce you to believe he was deranged in his intellects? - A. In some small degree I should think so, at times; I recollect his observing to me, one morning, that when he was post-master general he would give me a better situation.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you observed him to be a man perfectly possessed of his reason? - A. I have observed him at some times to be completely deranged; I have observed a variety of circumstances; in fact, he has always shewn confusion and irregularity in his ideas and conversation, a flightiness and unsettledness, that has convinced me that his mind has been totally deranged at times; I have observed it down to the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you can tell us why, under these circumstances, he has been continued in his situation? - A.From motives of humanity, the superior officer forbore to make a report; I believe he has been in the office upwards of thirty years.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he has a wife and six children? - A. Yes; he has maintained a very good character, so much so, that he has been put in very responsible situations in the office.</p>
               <p>- BALLENTINE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk of the third division of the inland department of the Post-office: About September last, not being in the habits of speaking to the prisoner at the bar, the prisoner saw me at a little distance, where there is a gate to come in; he called to me, and said, here; which I remarked as very extraordinary, not in general speaking to him; there was a small piece of stagnated water before the window where I live, at Walworth; he asked me if I was found of fish; I said, yes; he said, what a fool you must be, here is plenty of fish; he said one of his sons had caught six pounds in a morning; when I returned, I made the observation at the time, that the man must be mad, for there was no fish there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he is deranged in his mind? - A. At times, certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. What has been his character for honestly during all that time? - A. I never heard that he was dishonest, I always looked upon him as a very eccentric and inconsistent character, a man that seemed to be at war with his own interest in general; I have known him refuse very good situations which have been offered him by his friends, from whim or caprice, though his children at that time might be wanting bread; I found that he was a man that could not be served, which arose from his eccentricity; at the same I believe him a man, when in possession of a found mind, incapable of doing an action morally wrong.</p>

               <p>CHARLES-RUNNINGTON BROUGHTON, Esq. sworn. - I have known the prisoner at the bar upwards of twenty years; I have observed him to be extremely eccentric, and in a disordered state of mind; his character has been always that of a perfectly honest man; I have considered him to be a strictly honourable character; I have had an opportunity frequently of being employed to write in the Secretary of State's office; I employed him to copy a paper to be laid before Parliament, which I could by no means have done if I had had any doubts of his strict honour; that was about three years since; I should not do justice to the man if I did not say he is one of the last men in the world that would, I believe, be guilty of such an action as he now stands at that bar to answer for.</p>

Yes; I believe it was pawned in my wife's name; she gave the duplicate to her mother, I believe; I was at home when he received the money, and he took me to the White-hart and gave me some ale; the things in the sack consisted of some dowlas, frocking for smock-frocks, and some children's frocking; he was backwards and forwards with me for a week, that I can swear for, I was in his company almost every day while he was there; he told me if I would bring a punt to the Hambro' Wharf he knew how to get some more out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he got it? - A. Yes; he said he took it out of a small truss, put it in his smock-frock, and brought it home to his lodgings in the dusk of the evening; I was taken up, and had before Mr. Pigeon at the White-horse; I was confined one night by Mr. Pigeon's order; Mr. Pigeon took notice of a frock that my child had on; the stuff it was made with I had from the prisoner at the bar, part of what he gave me in London; I know that my wife disposed of what I brought from from London; my wife put the money into a little wooden dish, and I gave it into his hand, it was silver and halfpence, and a seven shilling-piece; it was kept apart from my own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. He has been tried at Aylesbury himself? - A. Yes; a man at Langley swore against me for some fowls, and I was acquitted, at the sessions, before my Lord Temple.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. He has been tried four or five times? - A. I never was but once in my life in prison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. The constable will prove it; did not you propose to me to leave the wharf for a night, and you would rob the wharf with a punt? - A. No such thing.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am porter to William Wallace and John Harding, linen-drapers, in Cheapside, they have no other partners: I delivered a bale of linens and cottons on the 21st of December, to go to Whitchurch, for one Richardson, by the Basingstoke canal; I I took it to the Hambro' Wharf myself, and delivered it to one of the clerks; I saw it again about three weeks after, Mr. Pigeon shewed it to me, cut open, and some goods taken out; I packed up the goods myself; I missed from the truss a whole piece of printed calico, a piece of Hambro' rough, which is a coarse linen cloth, that they make smock-frocks and bags of; I also missed a piece of Irish linen dyed blue.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that piece.(The piece that was pawned)? - A. I have no doubt but this is the same; it is the same quality, and firmness, and of the same pattern; it is in every respect like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that piece. (The piece found at Day's)? - A. I believe this to be a part of the piece that was lost from the truss, it is fine calico; I really do believe it is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that piece of blue Irish? - A. This is of the same quality and pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two pieces. (from Mrs. East's)? - A. I believe these to be the very same.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live next door to the Pantheon, in Oxford-street; Henry Nowland has been in my service about sixteen months, and Bryan came a few months after Henry: On Monday the 24th of February, in consequence of information, I went to their lodgings in Adam and Eve-court; Boswell went up with me into the back room up one pair of stairs, where I saw a bundle tied up in a coarse cloth, containing twenty-four blue and white plates; I found it near the bed, rather under it; there was a box in the room, which I just poised, and found it excessively heavy; I then went to Marlborough-street for a search-warrant; I then went again with an officer; I called at home and desired the prisoner, Bryan, to take a basket, and follow me; when we had got over the way into the court, I told him a discovery had been made of some earthen-ware in his apartments, and it would be necessary that he should give an account of it; the officer untied the bundle, and took out the plates; I then desired Bryan to open the box; and he said it was his brother's, and he had not the key; the officer then broke it open, and we found in it all the rest of the articles mentioned in the indictment, except the pen knife, which was in a bundle of dirty linen upon the box; the officer took possession of the property; they were all new plates, quite bright and clean, they had not the least appearance of having been used, but they were interspersed with small straws; we had unpacked, within a few days, a great many goods from both our manufacturers, and on account of the quantity, they were put upon the shelves without wiping them, as we usually do; I have no doubt that they were a part of my stock; there were two cut glass salts, and a plain one, the cut glass salts were of the same pattern, but different in size from each other; with respect to the large one, I had, a little time before, written to my manufacturer to send me twenty-four a little larger, and they had arrived three or four days before this discovery; I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020080"/>put them in a glass case in the accompting-house; the prisoner, Bryan, used to light the fire in the accompring-house before the clerk came; I had not sold any of them; I went home and examined the cut glass salts, and found but twenty-three instead of twenty-four; they were wrapped up in a greyish kind of paper, very different from any paper used in our shop; and the one that I found in the prisoner's box was in a paper exactly resembling that paper; I have no doubt but that was one of the twenty-four; the pen-knife I had missed about ten days before, and made a good deal of inquiry after it but heard nothing of it. (William Jackson, the offer, produced the property).</p>
               <p>Phillips. I am sure this knife is mine, there is a small bit chipped off the end of it on the ivory part; after I had returned home, the other prisoner came in; I told him some earthen-ware had been found in his apartments; I asked him for the key of the box; he said he had not had it, for several days past, and appeared exceedingly confused; I desired him to go with me over to his lodgings; he went with me to the door, and there he ran away; on the Wednesday following I took him again at the lodging; he was taken before a Magistrate; Bryan had declared, with many oaths and imprecations, that he knew nothing about it, and wished his brother at the devil for running away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I believe one of the prisoners had lived with a Mr. Minton, in the same business? - A. He had; that was Henry.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not counted over the number of plates in your house? - A. No; I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. They might have been stolen from Mr. Minton for any thing you know? - A. No; Mr. Minton's brother supplies him entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took up Bryan first, did he not say, that his brother Henry was totally innocent, and knew nothing of the transaction? - A. He did.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner, Henry, lived with me formerly, he went from me to Mr. Phillips's; Mr. Phillips did not ask me for a character of him, if he had I should have given him a most excellent one; after this discovery was made, he called at my house, and told me that there had been some things found in his brother's lodging, and his; I then asked him if he knew any thing of them; he said, no, he did not, and wished me to go to his master; I told him if I could be of any service to him, as an honest man, I would; but if he was guilty, I would certainly assist in bringing him to justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those plates, have you any patterns of that sort in your stock? - A. Not exactly; my brother, and several others, make of the same pattern, with the only difference of their being different manufacturers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. He might have stole them from you? - A. He had opportunities enough.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Meredith: On Monday the 3d of March, I went to identify a pair of boots at the prisoner's lodgings in Bethlem-court; he was in our service at the time he was taken up; I found a pair of boots unfinished, with my mark upon them, and I brought them away with me; I found them in a corner of the room by the bed-side; they had never been sold from our house; I put my mark upon them before they were manufactured; they are an article that we do not fell, they are manufactured for the West-India trade, they were made in January last; on the 18th of January, when we took stock, these boots were taken up stairs, with other goods of a like description, there might be four or five dozen, I missed only this pair; this pair had a particular mark upon them, a double ten, because the men should not be deceived, they being awkward sized legs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.These boots were found when the prisoner was not present, but in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a common lodging-house, is it not? - A. Not that I know of; there is another person lodges in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you had not put a double ten upon a pair of boots within a month before? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>JAMES CORNWALL sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Meredith: I recollect seeing this pair of boots previous to the 18th of January, they were carried up stairs; and I can take my oath that I never sold them out of the shop. (The boots produced.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. These are old boots, I see? - A. Yes; they were new when they went out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have observed these boots if you had seen him with them on? - A. I never saw him with a pair of boots on in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was at work at your house every day in the week days? - A. Yes; but he might walk in them on Sundays.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose, that in ten days they could have been worn down in that manner? - A. I think they might; he was three days gone down to Gravesend.</p>
               <p>Mr. Meredith. These boots are my property; I know them by my man's mark inside; they are made for a particular trade; and in two days they might have been in the state in which they now are; they are made very flight for that trade.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the charge; I never saw the boots to my knowledge; I had opportunities if I had wished to steal from Mr. Meredith, he has trusted me with large parcels, and with money to his banker's. <rs id="t18000402-92-verdict506" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Where there any pole ewe sheep? - A. Yes; nine of the lot that were missing; they were penned in a pen by themselves, about eleven o'clock in the day, after which I did not give any body authority to take them away; I sold them to a man of the name of Taylorson; I have not been paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the custom of Smithfield Market to deliver the sheep before the money is received for them? - A. No; sometime after two o'clock I dis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020082"/>covered that the nine pole ewe sheep were gone; they were marked over the loins with the country mark; with oker; there was no brand in particular that I observed.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose pen of that day was this pen near to? - A. It was near to Mr. Hebb's, opposite to it.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had so missed the sheep, did you see any thing further of them? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any part of them after they were slaughtered? - A. Yes; I saw one skin at Islington; I am sure that that was one of those nine pole sheep that I lost, it was produced by the constable; I saw none of the live ones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe the removal of sheep to and from the different pens is conducted by the drovers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This young man was a drover? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 10th of March? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Hebb constantly attend Smithfield Market? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was it that this young man was taken up-was it not a fortnight? - A. Not quite, I believe, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this lad there, in the market, on the Friday following, and the Monday after that? - A. I cannot say; I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. He carries on the business of a drover under his father and brother? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when a purchase is made, the drover is generally directed to what pen he should drive the sheep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then the drover takes them where he is directed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. Was the prisoner employed, as a drover, by you, on the 10th of March? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the Monday? - A. Yes; and he was taken on the Saturday in the week following, I believe, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. At the time he was taken, he was attending at the Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not a man been taken up before for stealing these sheep, of the name of Filaster? - A. No; he was not taken up, he was only charged with it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. After you have sold sheep, do the drovers remove them from one pen to another? - A. Yes; it is done by my own drovers, and by my own orders.</p>
               <p>Q. After they are sold? - A. Yes; to make room for other.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these sheep moved by your orders, after they were sold? - A. Yes; by my drover, and Taylorson, to another pen that I had, the same day, opposite Mr. Hebb's; my pens were all fronting of Mr. Hebb's.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did you not, upon their being lost, actually pay Taylorson for them as Taylorson's sheep? - A. No, I did not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a salesman in Smithfield: On Monday, the 10th of March, my pens were opposite to Mr. Tingey's; between half past one and two, which we call late in the day, I observed some sheep in a pen which was next to mine, they were small pole-sheep, I supposed them to be Nottinghamshire sheep; I cannot say whether they were ewes or not, as they had no butcher's mark upon them; that is a mark put upon them by the butcher soon after they are bought, I looked upon it that they were unsold; and several butchers asked me the price of the sheep; there was a saint mark upon them, that appeared to have been on for a month or six weeks; it was an oker mark across the loins; they had the appearance of being from eight to twelve sheep, but the particular number I did not notice; about half past one, or from that to half past two, I cannot be particular to half an hour, I had sold four sheep to a person of the name of Worrall; somebody asked me if those sheep opposite mine were mine; I said, no; and in about half a minute after that, I saw the prisoner go into the pen and drive these sheep out; there were a number of drovers about; just at the close of the market it is very common for the drovers to assist in clearing the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the skin since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the skin of one of those sheep that you saw drove out? - A. I cannot swear that; it was like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Tingey there at that time? - A. No; I did not see any body there that belonged to him at that time, or after.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was the prisoner? - A. Yes, he was a butcher's drover; I had seen him for about six months before it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This was done when there were a great number of drovers about, in the open market? - A. Yes; Smithfield is always open.</p>
               <p>Q. Every person there must see what he was about? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that was with him was not the prisoner's brother? - A. I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for sheep that are sold to have the butcher's mark put upon them? - A. It is very common.</p>
               <p>Q. These sheep had not the butcher's mark? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if they had been sold to Taylorson, they would have had his mark? - A. It is not a certain rule.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner in the market since that day? - A. No, I have not, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Before these sheep were driven away, had they any butcher's marks? - A. They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020083"/>had not; there is one set of drovers to the salesmen, and the other butchers drovers, to drive the sheep to where the butchers live; but the butchers drovers do not assist the salesmens' drovers in removing sheep from one pen to another.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you see the prisoner at the Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He came there voluntarily, did not he? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing at the bar? - A. When I was there I saw him standing at the bar, by the side of his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not there to see his brother, who was charged with she offence? - A. I do not know what he came for; I saw him at the bar, and then I pointed him out to the Magistrates.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any sheep stopped at your house all night? - A. Somebody holloaed out from the door to leave some sheep for William Field; I was in the bar; I did not see who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, did they leave any sheep? - A. I believe they did; I never saw any in particular, any fasther than a large drove before the bar-window.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did the drove consist of? - A. Six or seven score.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheep were left with you? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Recollect you are upon your oath, and before a Court that have the power to commit you if you do not speak truth? - A. I do; I was out all day on Tuesday, and did not see any delivered.</p>

               <p>Q. Who paid you for those that were taken in? - A. I never take any money but what is spent in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was taken in the house that night for these sheep? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that ever happen to you before? - A.Repeatedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other cattle of any other description that night? - A. There might be, I cannot say; the stable were open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Court. Q. Recollect yourself, and mind what answers you give me; have you ever said at any time, the number of sheep that were left? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself; I will have a positive answer-did you ever, at any time, mention the number of sheep that were left? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never did? - A. I do not believe I ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me caution you? - A. I have heard people say there were nine sheep, and I may have said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you never swear that nine sheep were left? - A. I never swore that, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What, do you swear without knowing what you swear? - A. I never swore it, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say to whom they were delivered? - A. I was not at home at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath, whether you did not say to whom the sheep were delivered? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that; is that your hand-writing? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sworn to that, and you signed it? - A. I signed a paper, but I never saw it, at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you sign it, if you did not see it? - A. I never read it; they told me to put my name down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ever read? - A. I do not remember any thing being read particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you, upon the oath you have taken, swear that that deposition, taken before the Lord-Mayor, was not read to you before you signed it? - A. No, I will not; they were all read over.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not desired to attend to it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you again-did you not mention the number of sheep? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have a positive answer; did you or not swear before the Lord-Mayor, to the number of sheep? - A. Upon my word I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have a direct answer, or commit you? - A. I believe I said something about nine sheep before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sworn before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Not the last time.</p>
               <p>Q. But you were when you signed it? - A. Then I must have sworn to the nine sheep; if I swore there were nine sheep I did very wrong, for I never saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear to whom they were delivered? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear not only that there were nine sheep, but that they were delivered to H<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020084"/>man; recollect yourself? - A. To the best of my knowledge I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. That will not do, I will have a positive answer; you shall not escape justice in that kind of way; did you or did you not swear that the nine sheep were delivered to Harman? - A. I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did or did not? - A. I cannot say; I might swear it, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you account so little of an oath that you do not take notice what you swear; this was read over to you, and you swore to it, and signed it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then upon your oath do not you recollect? - A. I do not recollect, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. I expect an immediate answer whether you swore that before the Magistrate? - A. I dare say the paper is right.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to tell me just now, that you did not know the number of the sheep? - A. I never saw the sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to say there were nine? - A. They told me to swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who? - A. The Lord-Mayor's clerk, him that wrote it down, told me to swear to what was wrote there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not take it down from your own words? - A. I was not examined that day at all.</p>
               <p>Q. He asked you if what you signed was true, and you said, yes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined the day before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was put down upon paper, and read to you the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had time to recollect yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the prisoner's voice very well? - A. I have been in his company two or three times; I am very intimate with his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is your practice to take in from any body that comes, any articles they choose to bring? - A. If they say who they come from.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton reads - "Informant says, that nine sheep were brought to his house at Ponder's-end, late on Monday evening, the 10th of March, and the next day delivered to Joseph Harman."</p>
               <p>Q. Is that true, or not? - A. The nine sheep I cannot say; the other part I believe is true; my wife told me they were delivered to

               <p>(The case was opened by Mr. Knowlys.)</p>
               <p>MARY LOCKE sworn. - I am the wife of Thomas Locke, who keeps <placeName id="t18000402-96-crimeloc524">the Bell, in Warwick-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18000402-96-crimeloc524" type="placeName"

               <p>THOMAS LOCKE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I keep the Bell in Warwick-lane: My wife shewed me two shillings, which I knew to be bad; directly after that,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020087"/>Elton came in, and tendered 2 shilling for a glass of gin; I told him it was bad; they seemed to be all exactly of the same make; I said it was a bad one, and he without putting his hand into his pocket to feel for more money, put a good one into my hand; he went away, and I followed him, and saw all the three women prisoners standing together at the corner of Rose-street, in Newgate-market; and when they got towards Giltspur-street from Newgate-street, they all joined company and conversation; they all went to the door of the constable, who keeps a public-house near the corner of Hosier-lane; they staid there in conversation I suppose a minute; they left that house without going in; I went in and enquired for an officer, and he said he was an officer; I took him with me, and we watched them to another public-house in Hosier-lane, kept I believe by a Mr. Pettit, the Coachmaker's-arms; I saw Mincher and Elton standing at the door; Ladbroke took them into custody, and I went into the house; the prisoner Dunn had a screw-box in her hand, and a shilling lying before her upon the barcounter, of the same make; Dunlap was standing by the side of her; then they were taken into custody; I delivered the two shillings that my wife gave me, to the officer; I marked them with the letter I before I gave them to him.</p>
               <p>- LADBROKE sworn. - I am an officer: (Produces the two shillings.)</p>
               <p>Locke. These are the two that I delivered to the officer, which I received from my wife.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Locke. The same shillings that I gave to my husband, I received from the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Ladbroke. I keep a public-house the corner of Hosier-lane: I went with Mr. Locke and apprehended Elton and Mincher at Mr. Pettit's door; the other two were in doors; I waited till Mr. Locke brought them out; I searched the man and the woman that was at the door; I found upon Elton one shilling, and as soon as I laid hold of it, I said, this is a bad one; and he had some small change in his pocket, which I knew was good, which I returned to him, there were about eight or nine-pennyworth of halfpence as near as I could guess; Mincher had a sixpence and some halfpence, altogether to the amount of about one shilling and sixpence; the other two I did not search till I got them to the Compter; Dunlap had change, in halfpence, to the amount of nine-pence or ten-pence; they were good, and I returned them; upon Frances I found about eighteen-pence, sixpence in silver, and the rest in halfpence; they made use of very ill language, and said they would go along with me, but I should not find any thing about them; and some person holloaed out that I had not got the right of the swag; but it being dusk, I could not see who it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. WILLIAM PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. These shillings are both counterfeit; they are both newly coloured, and both of the same manufacture.</p>
               <p>(Ladbroke produced the shilling he found upon Elton.)</p>
               <p>Parker. This is a counterfeit of the same manufacture; they appear to be all alike; they have not been in circulation since they have been coloured.</p>
               <p>Dunlap's defence. I took it in the street; I go out with a barrow of cats and dogs' meat; I took it of a footman, but I do not know the family he lives in.</p>
               <p>Frances's defence. I was very much in distress, going to the parish to get some relief if I could; my child was crying for bread, and I was crying, and a gentleman in Smithfield gave me that shilling.</p>
               <p>Mincher's defence. I pledged an apron for one shilling and sixpence; and received that shilling at Mr. Berry's, upon snow-hill.</p>
               <p>Elton's defence. I had taken that shilling over night; I did not know it was a bad shilling.</p>
               <p>Dunlap called her landlady, who gave her a good character. All Four <rs id="t18000402-96-verdict525" type="verdictDescription">
