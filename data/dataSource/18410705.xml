At a quarter before three o'clock, on the 17th of June, I was walking round the back gangway of the warehouse, which had about 12,000 hogsheads of tobacco in it—I saw a cask of tobacco lying on the ground, turned over, the head had been forced out—I saw a quantity of tobacco had been taken from it—on looking over a cask, I saw the prisoner stooping down—I went towards him—his trowsers were down, and some tobacco was sticking out of them—I was near enough to be certain of that, and there was tobacco lying by his side—I asked what he was doing there—he said, "I am taken very bad, I am come to ease myself"—there were privies two hundred yards off—I said he must come along with me—he pretended to be bad, and began to cry, like—I told him he must come along with me—I wanted to lay hold of him—he jumped over the cask, and ran down the gangway—I lost sight of him—I ordered the warehouse doors to be shut, which was done immediately—that would prevent any one going out—the prisoner had no right there at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Oliver, of Bishopsgate-street. About four o'clock in the evening of the 28th of June, I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner approach the door post, snatch down two boots, and go away with them—I followed him—he turned the first turning, and I lost sight of him for about two minutes—when I turned the corner he still had them in his hand, and seeing me he threw them on the other side of the street—I took them up, stopped him, and asked why he took them—he said he had not taken them, nor seen them before—I am certain he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He asked what I had been doing—I said "Nothing"—he said, "Why did you pull them down?"—I said, "I never pulled them down."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen draper, and live in Conduit-street, in partnership with my brother—the prisoner was our shopman between two and three years. On the 19th of June I marked all the silver there was in the till, and put it in the till again—I cannot say the amount—the first time I marked about sixteen shillings—the prisoner was out at the time—he returned between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning—he re<lb/>mained at home a short period—after he was gone out a second time I marked some more money, which made up twenty-six shillings, and put</p>

My daughter, Mary Ann Hemmings, is six years old—she went out to play on the 23rd of June, between five and six o'clock in the evening—she had her petticoat and shift on—I did not see her again till half-past eight in the evening, when I heard she was taken away, and I went in search of her—I was in great anxiety about her—I looked about for her—she was brought home from the watch house—she had been stripped of her shift and petticoat—I never saw the prisoner.</p>

I went out to play in the street after tea-time—the prisoner came and spoke to me—she asked me to go on an errand for her, and said, "Come along with me, and I will give you a new white frock with two flounces"—she said she would give me a new shift and a new pinafore, and a pair of white Adelaide boots—she took me into the fields, and asked me to sit down—she said, "Let me look at the pattern of your frock"—then she took off my shift and petti<lb/>coat, and put them in her apron, and then got up and walked on, and went away with me, when the gentleman came up and took hold of her.</p>

I was in my house on the evening of the 25th of June, about seven o'clock—in conse<lb/>quence of hearing a noise in the street, I looked out of window, and saw Long and the deceased standing on the opposite side of the way—Long was standing alongside of him—she was abusing him with very bad lan<lb/>guage—I saw her strike him a blow on the face with her fist—before that I saw Covington strike him with her fist in the face—the deceased then rose up his stick and struck at Covington—I did not notice whether he struck her—I did not see him do any thing before Long struck him—I saw Hill there—the deceased turned back, and then Covington hit him another blow in the face with her fist—I did not see the deceased do any thing with the stick except raise it up—I do not know what became of the stick—when he stood against the wall I saw blood come from his nose—when Long struck him his hat was on—it fell off—I saw him go in at Mrs. Harvey's door—that was all I saw of him—I never quitted my room.</p>

               <p>good health the same as usual—he appeared to be quite sober—about ten minutes after he left I heard a noise in the street, and went to see what was the matter—I saw the deceased close to my door—he was bleeding dreadfully at the nose and mouth—his face was all over blood that I could scarcely tell where the marks of violence were—he appeared to be <hi rend="italic">stagnated</hi> with the effect of the ill usage—I saw the prisoner Long at my door—I did not see any blow struck—Long, in the act of bringing him into my house, said, "You b—y old b—you have been the cause of my mo<lb/>ther's death, and I will be the cause of yours"—I endeavoured to assist the deceased into my house, and Long endeavoured to keep him back by holding him by the arm—I succeeded in getting him into the house—I sat him on a chair, and my brother went out into the yard to get a little water, and he fell off the chair—I tried to lift him up, and called out, "John, my landlord is fainting"—he fell off the chair—I tried to lift him up, but could not—seeing him turn black and blue I sent for Dr. Bird, who lives close by—I put a bolster under his head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and live in Rateliffe-highway. I was called to a house in Bluegate-fields, on the 25th of June, a little after seven o'clock—I saw the deceased there lying on the floor on his back, supported by two policemen—he was quite dead—he had a severe bruise over the right eye and temple—blood was oozing from his nostrils, and his face was very livid—he had all the appearance of a person having died of apoplexy—the livid appearance of the face led me to suppose so—the livid appearance proceeded from disorder—I afterwards examined his body externally at the workhouse—the scrotum was very much discoloured—there was a small wound on his right side covered with a piece of plaster—it was an old wound—there was a recent bruise at the back part of his head—on the following morning I made an examination of his head in company with another medical man—on removing the scalp a vast quantity of extra<lb/>vasated blood escaped, more particularly from the parts which had received the injury externally—I removed the scull cap, and there was an immense escape of blood on the brain, a pint at least—I never inspected a head where there was so great an effusion—the nose was broken—the cause of death was the effusion of blood on the brain—that would be produced by blows on the head and face—violent blows on the head and face would bring on apoplexy in a person who had a tendency to it—there was disco<lb/>loration of the scrotum—that was quite recent—that could have nothing to do with the effusion of blood on the head—his brain showed a predisposi<lb/>tion to apoplexy—he did not die of apoplexy, but of effusion of blood on the brain—the appearances of apoplexy are very different to those appear<lb/>ances, you have not so much extravasation, and death is more sudden generally—knocking his head against the wall created perhaps the com<lb/>mencement of the mischief, and the blood was oozing all the way probably till he got to Mrs. Harvey's, and when put on the chair he dropped down dead—the effusion of blood was the result of violence—the vessels were so gorged with blood they gave way—it was not from natural apoplexy, but from external violence that he died—I think so from the appearance of the brain on opening the head, the immense effusion—the effusion in apoplexy is not so great by a twentieth part—it varies—it depends on the nature of the vessel ruptured—there was no fracture of the skull, nor any injury to it—Mr. Pretty inspected the deceased with me.</p>

On Monday, the 24th of May, I left it about two o'clock in the day, not intending to return that day—I locked it up—it has a spring lock—as soon as the door is turned it locks, and then I turn the key which fastens it more—every thing was right in the shop then—I returned at seven o'clock next morning, and found the shop door open, the box of the lock was forced away, and hanging down by one screw—on going in I missed some articles, and found some of them exposed for sale on the Thursday fortnight following.</p>

               <p>were both in the service—they were chiefly employed in stamping the labels and putting them on—I said to Tibb, "Where are you going?" he said he lived about there—I said, "What have you got?"—he said he did not know—I said, "Don't you know where you are going to?"—he said "Not exactly"—I said, "Who gave you this?"—he said some words, and then said a man in Francis-street gave it him—I said, "Don't you know what you have got?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Let me see"—I took the hamper down, and desired him to open it—he did so—I saw they were bottles—my suspicions were excited—I again asked him where he was going to—he said, "To 34, Grafton-street"—I doubted it, and said I would go with him—he began to cry, and said, "No, it is not so, if you won't hurt me, I will tell you all about it"—I did not make him any reply—he said the truth was, Dimmock had given them to him, and told him to make what be could of them, and he again said if I would let him go or promise not to hurt him, he would tell me all about it—I said I could make no promise, his master must know about it—he then again said Dimmock gave them to him from the warehouse—he said Dimmock let him into the warehouse, and had given him the bottles, and he was to make what he could of them—in consequence of that I sent my servant for a po<lb/>liceman.</p>

The prisoner was my wagoner—on the 29th of June I sent him to London—he was al<lb/>lowed three bushels of beans, and three pecks of pollard and chaff a week for each of his horses—it is mixed, and he goes into the mill, and has it as he requires it during the week—a man in the mill measures it to him—he is allowed about a sack at a time, sometimes two sacks—he takes it into the stable, and puts it into his bin, and takes as much as he requires—the largest quantity he takes to London is about two bushels—here is from two to five bushels, and it is mixed up as mine is—I have no doubt about its being mine—he would not be allowed to take as much as this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the City of London. On the 25th of June I watched at Messrs. Cramer's premises, and saw the prisoner leave—I followed him in a gig—he went to No. 12, Berkley-street, and I saw him in the act of getting out of the cart with a basket which contained a dozen bottles, which appeared to be full—the door of No. 12 was opened—he handed in the bottles, and the basket was returned to him empty—he returned to the cart with it—he returned to the house again with an um<lb/>brella, then got into the cart, and went on to his other places—I commu<lb/>nicated this to the prosecutors, and what has been stated is correct—I went to the house, and found a dozen bottles of porter there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Union-street, Hackney-road. On the night of the 26th of June I was in Hackney-road, near St. Tho<lb/>mas's-street, a little after ten o'clock—it was not a very clear night, nor yet very dark—I observed a two-wheeled gig coming towards London, and three persons in it—It was drawn by one horse—the prisoner Bryant was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184107050068"/>
               <p>driving, and Nind was on the left-hand side in the gig—Bryant was in the middle, and a person not present was on his right hand—they were coming at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour—Bryant sometimes sat for<lb/>ward, and sometimes backwards—it was not a very large gig—I saw Nind's hat fall—the gig was pulled up to pick up the hat—somebody walking along picked it up, and gave it to Nind—I was about 200 yards off, on the right-hand side—the gig was going from me—I saw it start again at about the same rate as before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Marlow, in Buckinghamshire. On Friday, the 18th of June, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was coming from Hampton to Marlow alone, in a one-horse chaise—about half a mile from the turnpike beyond Staines, in the public highway, I saw the prisoner Hodges, and another man, whom I cannot recognise, on the footpath—when I was within twenty yards of them, as I drew near to them, Hodges drew near the middle of the road, and made a grasp at my horse's bridle—my horse had ran into a smart pace, and some part of it hit against him, so that he could not get the rein, and I drove on—the other man was standing on the path, and did nothing—when I got about twenty yards further, they hallooed out, "Which is the way to Staines?"—they did not run after me—it was not very dark—I never saw the men before—but I saw him well, his clothes, and dress, and every thing—I noticed him, being fearful of him—he was on the left-hand side of the road—I was on the near side of the gig, and he on die off side—I gave an alarm when I got to the turnpike, to two policemen—I did not go with them—I saw Hodges again on the following Wednesday.</p>

We came to where there are two roads and a finger-post: I asked this young man if he would lift me up to the post, to see the direc<lb/>tion. I stood on his shoulder; I slipped down, and that is the way my jacket got torn. I lifted him up afterwards on my shoulders, but he could not make out the words on the post: he said, "Here is a person coming on, ask him;" and I asked the gentleman in a gig.

I said I had not much. I knew he was the same trade as myself, a car<lb/>penter—he said he must have some money; and if he could not get it in any other way, he must sell some of his tools—he went away, and re<lb/>turned almost immediately with the basket of tools, and asked if I knew where he could sell them. I said I knew Long, who had bought some<lb/>thing of the sort before, and would show him where Long lived, or, if he wished, I would take them myself—he said, "If you will give me a crown for them, you can make the best bargain you can with Long." I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., being all I had. I went to Long, and was given into custody for the offence I was charged with yesterday.

About seven o'clock, on the morning of the 27th of May, I was called up by my servants—I went down stairs, and found the front door of the premises, which opens into the street, open—I then went into the parlour behind the shop, on the ground-floor—I found a box that was there had been broken open, and copper money, to the amount of about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., taken away—it was done up in five-shilling papers—I also lost a silver pencil-case from an inkstand on the sideboard in the same room—there were marks of a chisel, or instrument of that sort, being applied to the box to force it open—I was the last person up on the premises the night before—the front door was then secured by a lock, a bar, and two bolts—the pri<lb/>soner Morley was in our service at the time as an errand-boy—the witness Thomas Fisher was my apprentice—neither of them slept on the premises—they left their work at eight o'clock in the evening—they ought to come in the morning at seven—on the morning I discovered this robbery Morley came a little after seven, and Fisher a little after nine—I immediately sent to the police—Inspector Penny came to my house—he asked Morley if he knew any thing of the robbery, as he was suspected—he said no, he was at home and in bed all night—that was before Fisher came to work, I think—I had Fisher and Morley taken into custody that evening, in consequence of a communication made to me by Porter, my foreman—they were taken before the Magistrate—Fisher then said he was at home and in bed, and slept with his father that night—the Magistrate gave him time to produce his father to prove that—he was produced, and examined that afternoon; and on his being examined the Magistrate discharged Fisher—after that, Porter made a statement to me, which led me to Fisher, and he made a state<lb/>ment to me—there is an area-gate in the front of the premises, the key of which hung on a hook over the desk in the front shop—in consequence of Fisher's communication, I and the policeman looked into a hole in the area on the 3rd of June, and there found twelve five-shilling papers of halfpence, similar to those I lost, wrapped up in a towel of which I know nothing—it did not belong to the premises—I looked for the key of the area-gate on the day of the robbery, and found it hanging up in its usual place.</p>

                  </hi>. I shall be nineteen years old next December—I am now lodging with my father, at No. 8, Morton-street, London-street, London-road—I am apprenticed to Messrs. Newton—I had been lodging at my father's for about four or five weeks before the robbery—before that I had been lodging at Mrs. Monroe's, by the side of the Elephant-and-Castle—I do not know the name of the row—the prisoner Morley lodged there at the same time—I know Davis by sight—I saw him first, I believe, at Mrs. Monroe's—I do not believe I had any conversation with him at that time—the next time I saw him was at the Alfred's Head, in the London-road, on the other side of the water, about three weeks before the robbery—Morley was there at the same time—he went away to get a little some<lb/>thing for smoking, I believe, leaving Davis and me together—Davis then told me that Morley had spoken to him about some money—I asked him what money—he asked me if I did not know—I said I did not know—we said nothing more to each other that day—I had some conversation with him once or twice after that, up at the shop—twice, I believe—he came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184107050076"/>
               <p>to my master's shop one day, and asked for Morley—I told him I believed he was out—I then left him to go to dinner—that was all that passed that day—I saw him again at the shop about nine days before the robbery—he asked me again for Morley—I cannot positively say whether he was at home then; I believe not—I had no other conversation with Davis then besides his asking if Morley was at home—I had no other conversation with Davig, except when he spoke to me about the money at the Alfred's Head—he did not at any time give me any explanation of what he meant—the day after that conversation with Davis, I asked Morley what money it was that lie had been speaking to Davis about—he said, Davis and some others were going to <hi rend="italic">crack</hi> the master's <hi rend="italic">crib</hi>—I did not say any more to him that day—next day he told me, if I did not say any thing about it, that I should have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made no answer to that—I went away and left him—it was after that that Davis called once or twice, and asked for Morley—about nine days be<lb/>fore the robbery Morley asked me, if he gave me down the key, would I open the gate, and I told him "Yes"—it was the small key belonging to the padlock, which was on the area-gate—I received the key from Morley that night, opened the padlock, and left it hanging on the chain, so that any person could get in—I gave the key back to Morley—I saw Morley on the following morning—I do not recollect any conversation passing—I told Morley afterwards that they had not done it that night, and I would have no more to do with it—I said that the day after the gate had been found open, which I believe was on a Thursday—the gate was discovered open by Francis Porter—on the morning before the robbery, (Wednesday the 26th,) Morley told me that he had been een in the street by a police<lb/>man, and that he had on him three small keys, a file, and a key which he had been filing, to try to make it fit the padlock—he showed me the filed key in the burning-place, and I pressed the ward off with my thumb, be<lb/>cause he should not do it with that—in the evening I saw Morley take the key of the area gate off the hook, after Mr. James Newton had hung a bunch of keys on it—when I left work that evening I went away, in company with Morley and James Beverstock, to a bath in Oakley-street, Westminster-road, to bathe—I did not take any towel with me—I cannot say whether the others did—I parted with Morley at the corner of London-street, about half-past ten o'clock that night—Beverstock had left us before—I told Morley at parting that I hoped he would not do what he was going to do, I should have nothing to do with it myself—I went to my father's house and slept there that night with my brother—I went to my work next morning about a quarter to nine—I saw Morley at my master's—he came down into the workshop where I Was at work—he did not address himself to me, because there were others in the shop—he merely said his master had been robbed—about twelve I saw him in the burning-place—he then told me Davis and he had committed the robbery, that he entered the place by the assistance of the key he had taken away, and undid the padlock, and after he got in he locked the gate after him again—by undoing the padlock he could get to the workshop, as there is a door on the top of the stairs that is not kept locked—a person getting through the area gate could get to the room where the money is kept without breaking any other room—he said he took the bar from the street-door, and placed it against the parlour-door, and then he let Davis in at the front-door—that Davis cut away the box, and carried away 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he carried away 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that they went as far as Farringdon-street, and then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184107050077"/>
               <p>they took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and went over the water in it—he also told me he had left the 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the pencil-case with Davis, and that he had left 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a hole in the right-hand side of the area—I told him there it might be, I would not touch it, for I would not have any thing to do with any of the robbery—he told me the money was in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers, in a towel—I was taken into custody—my father was examined before the Magistrate, and I was discharged—the first person I made any communication to was Porter, the foreman—that was on Tuesday night after I had been taken up on the Thursday—I afterwards made a statement to my master—I had not inter<lb/>fered with the money up to that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not tell your master of this before he was robbed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I was afraid, that was the only reason—I bad not the same reason for not telling him afterwards—when I was accused of being pre<lb/>sent at the robbery, I said I slept with my father that night—that was true—I slept at my father's house that night, and I slept with my father in the same bed with my father and my brother too—my father is here, my brother is not—he is at work, I believe—I slept with my father and brother the night before the robbery—it was on a Wednesday night—I cannot answer for the day of the month, but it was about the 26th or 27th of May—I was in bed before eleven o'clock—my brother was in bed when I went to bed—he is fourteen years old—my father was also in bed—I am quite sure of that—I did not see him go to bed that night—I found him in bed—he was awake, I spoke to him—I cannot tell what I spoke to him about—I have no recollection—it was not a remarkable night with me, no more than usual—I did not consider it so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Nothing remarkable at all in the planning of your master's robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had no planning of it whatever—I knew all about it before it took place—I knew it was going to be done—my reason for pressing the ward of the key off was in order that it should. not be done at all—one of my motives was that it should not be the instrument to open the premises with—it did not signify to me what instrument it was done with—I pressed off the ward that it should not be done at all—I have said it was that it should not be the instrument to open the premises—that was one of my motives, and nothing further that I know—I cannot recollect any con<lb/>versation I had with my father that night when I went to bed—I cannot say whether my brother was awake—I cannot tell whether he spoke to me,</p>

On the night of the 15th of June I was called to Dr. Catherwood's, in consequence of a fire that occur<lb/>red in the house—I suggested that the prisoner's box should be searched—the prisoner was called, and I told her I intended to search her box—I got the key from her, and went into the room—she pointed out the box to me, and I unlocked it in her presence—I round a variety of articles in it, and some duplicates, one of which relates to this pair of sheets and table cloth—I examined a band-box, and found in it a carpenter's gouge—by the prisoner's request, I tried her fellow-servant's key, and that opened the prisoner's box also.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gunner and driver in the eighth battalion of Artillery, at Woolwich. On the 14th of June, in the evening, I was in the Barrack-yard, washing some tables—I could see the window of the room No. 64—I saw John Grice at the window of that room—he was leaning on a small desk on the window board, writing—I saw the flash of a musket, and heard the report, and immediately after heard him cry out, "I am shot"—I immediately ran up the steps, and down the stairs, and went to the room where he was, No. 64—I saw John Grice, the bom<lb/>bardier, leaning on the window cill—he had not fallen on the floor—the prisoner came forward, and said, "I am the man who shot him"—Grice was bleeding, and was wounded—I saw the blood—I did not see the pri<lb/>soner at first—he came as it were from behind the door—any body might bare left the room and run up the stairs before I got there—the prisoner had nothing in his hand—there were twelve beds in the room, six on each side—they were turned up—the bedsteads turn up—I cannot say who came in after me—I saw a cartridge burning under Grice's face, it was the paper out of the musket—Grice was carried away, and the prisoner given into custody—I went out of the room into the yard, and shortly after returned into the room, looked behind the door, and saw a musket standing against the wall—I did not examine it then, I did a few minutes after<lb/>wards, and it appeared as if it had been recently fired—I was near enough to the deceased to have heard him speak if lie had been speaking before the flash—I was four or five yards from the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sergeant-major of the sixth battalion of Artillery, at Woolwich.
