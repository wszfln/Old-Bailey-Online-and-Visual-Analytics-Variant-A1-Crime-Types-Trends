                  </hi>. I have been blind since 1829. I know the defendant by his having worked for the gentlemen I dealt with eighteen years, and I have dealt with him since—I carry on the business of a matmaker, at No. 1, Red Lion-passage, Red Lion-street, Holborn; the defendant is a ropemaker, in North-street, Limehouse-fields; I have dealt with him about four or five years—in the course of last year there were disputes between us as to the amount I was indebted to him—he claimed an amount from me—I remember his calling on me on the evening of 17th Aug. last, he brought me some goods—he had previously sent me an account or two that were incorrect; I told him that they were so, and I did not owe him anything, I believed he had rather overdrawn the amount, and that he was a little in my debt—on the 17th, when he brought the goods, I said, "Haveyoubrought me a proper account?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Why not bring a proper account with you?" He said to his boy, "Thomas, have you got a bill with you?"—he said, "Yes; I told you 1 bad two bills of Mr. Stone's"—he produced one of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I said, "I don't owe you this or any part of it, I believe"—my wife then went and fetched some receipts which I had by me; they were bills which I had paid Mr. Allen at different times, I believe there were as many as ten or eleven, or more—my wife brought them, and put one into Mr. Allen's hand, and he denied that he had receipted it—I said, "Why, man, you must be mad to say such a thing as that, you don't suppose that I would be guilty of getting any one to receipt it, of course I could not do it myself, because I am blind"—he said, "I did not sign it"—I</p>

               <p>said, "Well, if you don't believe me, ask my wife"—he said, "Oh! as to you and your wife you will swear anything"—I believe my son-in-law put six bills into his hand after my wife had left the room—they were all paid he was looking at them, he did not make any remark—my wife went into the shop—my son-in-law was there all the time—I said to the prisoner, "I shall not think of paying money in this way"—he said, "Well, perhapsyouwill pay me for the goods I have brought in now?"—I said, "I don't know about that, I will tell you what I will do, because I want the thing fairly settled; if you are in want of a little money I will give you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this bill," and he took the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and put paid to the bill; that was in part payment of the goods he brought then—I went upstairs and took two sovereigns out of my watch fob, brought them down, and gave them to him—after he left I missed the receipts, it was two or three, or it might be four minutes after he left—Hecalled on me again in two or three weeks—I did not then tell him that the papers were lost, what I said was, "Mr. Allen, I told you whenyouwere here last, that I did not owe you anything, and I brought my receipts down to convince you"—and he said, in a sneering way, "Can you produce those receipts?"—I made no remark whatever—my wife was there, I do not think she said anything; yes, she did, she was stooping down at the fire-place, and she said, "Oh, yes, them bills! there will be something else to be heard about them bills"—he called again in about another fortnight or three weeks, and I still adhered to the same thing, that I could not think of settling it in that way—I said, "Mr. Allen, you know I don't owe you this money, not a penny"—he said, "Never mind that, I will have it"—I said, "You will, will you?"—he said, "Yes, I will"—and I said, "Then if you have it, you will have it in an unjust way"—in Jan. last, I was summoned for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the Judge found a verdict against me for the amount and costs—I afterwards made a motion for a new trial, it was refused; I do not know whether it was refused by the same Judge that tried the cause; the application for a new trial was made by affidavit—I heard Allen sworn at the trial; I heard the oath administered to him—I heard him examined as to a sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he denied that he had ever signed the bill, and he denied ever having received the money—as near as I can recollect, he was asked if this was his hand writing, and he said, "No;" and if he had received that amount, and he said, "No"—in the particulars of demand there is an item of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in April, 1852, for matting cord—I remember the payment of this money; I believe it was on Monday, 12th April, I am not positive whether it was Monday or Tuesday—he came to my house and brought some of the cord with him—I was down stairs at work, I came up, and said, "Well, Mr. Allen, you have brought my goods then"—he said, "Yes"—he came in and sit down; I said, "What is the amount, what have you brought?"—he said, "One cwt. and a few pounds over"—I said, What does it come to?"—he said, "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "Well, I may as well pay you this small amount, it is not worth while to let that stand"—he said, "I am much obliged to you"—I said to my wife, "Mary, go up and fetch me down a sove-reign:"she did so, and I said, "Now Mr. Allen, be good enough to receipt that bill, and I will give you the money"—he drew a chair up to the table, and I heard the pen going, and after he had written it he read it to me; "paid, J. Allen, April," (<hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>, I am no scholar, I cannot read)—he read that to me—my wife was present—after he read it to me, he gave the bill to my wife, and said, "That will do"—and I said, "All right, Mr. Allen, hold your hand for the money?" he held his hand, and I put the sovereign into it, and put my hand into my pocket, and took out 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and gave</p>

I cannot say what I owed him; it is a long time back—it was not so much as 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not believe it was anything of the kind—I have not had the bills examined—I did not owe him any such thing on 11 April; I cannot tell how much I did owe him—the reason I paid him the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was because it was a small sum, and I have paid him other small sums—I owed him smaller sums—I cannot say why I paid him that particular sum; all I can say is, that he brought in the goods, and I paid him the sum, as I had done at some other times when it was a small account; the man wanted money—I do not know that this 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is one of the largest sums in the whole account; I think not—I do not believe it was an unusually large bill—I believe there were frequently as large; I will swear it—I will swear that in the last year. there have been half a dozen at large—they were not usually sums varying from 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was examined at the County Court—they would not let me tell the whole story there as I have told it here, the clerk of the Court stopped me; there are other witnesses who know the same—I was telling the story, and the clerk of the Court rose up and said, "Oh, I see the Court must settle this business, we shall be here all day; you must pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month;" and the Judge made only one remark—the clerk of the Court addressed these words, whether to me or not I do not know—I believe it was the clerk of the Court, it was not the Judge—the clerk settled the business; he never heard one witness on either side—I swear that not one witness was heard on either side—Allen was examined—I swear they did not examine any of my witnesses—Allen was examined, and his boy was called; he only asked his boy if that was his writing, and he said, "No"—I had an attorney; he ought to have known what he was about—I cannot say whether he did; at all events, he said to the clerk, "Perhaps you will hear the defendant's witnesses;" and I got up into the witness-box, and was sworn—Allen had no attorney—I was not examined by my attorney, he only asked me just to make a statement of the case—my wife was not called, nor my son-in-law; they were there—they joined in the affidavit to obtain a new trial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I know the defendant—in the autumn of last year there were disputes between him and my husband as to the amount that was owing—I recollect his coming there on 17th Aug., and there was an altercation between them respecting the amount of money—I was not in the room the whole of the time—I fetched some papers down to convince Mr. Allen that there were bills that had been paid and receipted—I think there were six or eight papers—I brought them down for them to convince each other which was right and which was wrong; with that T had nothing to do—I told the prisoner that that bill had been paid—that was one which he held in his hand—he told me he had not signed it—I told him he had—my son, Joseph Edridge, was there; he is my son by a former marriage—that was all the part I took in the matter—I afterwards left the room to attend to my business—directly after the prisoner was gone 1 missed the papers, within a very few minutes—I have never seen them since—I was present when the prisoner called again—I cannot say how long that was after 17th Aug.—he said he had called for some money, he wanted some money—my husband said, "Then you will have none of me till I have a right account; bring me a bill of that which I do owe, not of that I don't owe"—Allen said, "Can you show your receipts?"—my husband did not make any answer to that, only told him he should have no more money till he brought a right account; he was sure he owed him nothing if things were made correct—I believe he afterwards called again—my husband was afterwards summoned to the County Court—I heard Allen sworn and examined—I know this bill (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—that is one of the bills that was paid; it was produced at the County Court; that bill was paid in my presence—I know this <hi rend="italic">bill</hi> (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>); it is for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was shown to Allen, and he denied receiving the money, or signing the bill, on his oath; but eventually the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was allowed to my husband—it is in Allen's handwriting, the whole of it—I cannot say that I remember the payment of this 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as there had been various payments—I cannot write, but I can read any writing in the English language—I mean, either written or printed—I know this to be Allen's writing, because he wrote it in my presence—I have seen him write repeatedly, and heard him repeat what he has written; his general way was to sign it, and say to my husband what he had written, and ask him if that would do—I believe these receipts at the back to be Allen's writing—I remember the payment of this 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it being on a particular day—there was no one else in the room but my husband, myself, and Allen—my husband told me I must fetch him some money down stairs—I said, "How much?"—he said, "If you fetch a sovereign that will do, as I have a little silver in my pocket"—I fetched the sovereign, and placed it in my husband's hand, and he held it while Allen signed the bill—I handed the pen and ink to him, and saw him sign the bill—after he had written it he read it to my husband; and he paid him a sovereign, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, the odd penny was to be settled in a pot of beer; that was the way in which it was paid—I am quite positive that on that occasion my husband paid him the money, and that I saw the prisoner write that, and read it after he wrote it—I was present in the County Court—I was not examined; I was there, ready to be examined, and my son also—I do not know how it was that we were not examined, there was no witness called on either side—Allen was called, and put on his oath—there was no person called but Mr. Allen—I cannot say why we were not called—I did not hear any parti<lb/>cular</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Mrs. Stone, and live with her and her husband. I know Allen, and that he had dealings with Mr. Stone—there were disputes in the autumn about the accounts—I recollect Allen coming on 17th Aug.—I was present the whole of the time he was there—there were six or seven receipted bills brought down stairs, and given into Allen's hands—he read them over, and disputed one of them—before they were fetched, Allen said he should like to see them; and when my mother brought them down, she said she had brought all the bills and receipts; she gave them to me, and I spread them out on the table, and handed them to Alien, one at a time—after Allen left I missed those receipts; I have never seen them since—I was not present when he called afterwards—I can read and write—I saw this receipt for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the back of one of these bills at the County Court—I heard the clerk of the Court ask Allen if this was his handwriting, and he said it was not—the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was eventually allowed by the clerk, Mr. Cheer—I believe it to be Allen's writing, and this other bill also—I have got a bill of his in ray pocket—I have seen him write several times—I gave him a pen and ink to write that—I was present whilst this case was beard at the County Court—I was not examined, or my mother; only Mr. Stone—I heard Allen examined, and he asked his son if he ever wrote a receipt to a bill—he said, "No"—I have seen the son here to-day outside; he is fourteen or fifteen years old—I was at the Court, ready to be examined—I cannot tell why I was not—the clerk of the Court hurried the case on all he could—he asked Mr. Nuckey for the bills, to get on with it as quick as he could—he said he should be kept there all day.</p>

I saw some watches at the Custom House—these five (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) seem to have the appearance of what I saw—they were imported from abroad, and exported again directly—these chains I know to be the same; they came from the Continent, and I had them in my possession six or seven weeks, and then put them into the box with the watches—the box was about the size of this book, almost square—a Custom House officer was sent with a clerk of mine to the ship with them, on, I think, the 17th.</p>

I picked them off the floor this morning, and there was a wrapper round them"—he said it was the first thing he had ever done, and begged to be forgiven—these are the penholders, and this is the invoice.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040019"/>
               <p>—on that morning I left home about 8 o'clock, and returned about 25 minute or half-past 10 o'clock, when a communication was made to me by my wife and I went with a policeman to Newland's stable—I went in by myself and found him cutting a truss of hay up—I asked him how he got it; he said he bought it in Tottenham Court-road the night before—I told him it was my hay out of my loft, I had every reason to believe brought out that morning—I found no other hay in the place—Hack then came in, and his attention was first drawn to the corn-box, which was locked—he called out to Newland for the key, and he gave him the key down out of the loft—he unlocked it, and we discovered about a bushel or a bushel and a half of oats—we had not an opportunity of measuring them—I identified them directly as part of my property—I went over with Hack to match them with mine, and when we came back, Newland was in the act of trying to mix the chaff and oats to prevent us from taking a sample—they were the same description of oats as mine—Hack went into the stable, and I went to Miss Scott, who told me what she had seen—her house looks into the yard—I was absent five or ten minutes, or not so long—Hack then went into my stable with me, and we measured the oats—there was a little better than a bushel and a half left in the bin; there would be about two bushels and a half gone, but then I must allow for my horses being fed—they could not have eaten two bushels and a half in the time they had; perhaps they might have eaten a bushel—the ten horses were not fed from it that morning, only nine.</p>

Novell said, "No; but if I had seen him, I would have given him a <hi rend="italic">clip</hi> under the ear"—Scott said that Smith took it into Mr. Newland's stable, and I said, if he did not like to believe it, I saw the boy Smith, too, with the truss of hay, and that he had taken it round by the pig-stye and by the dunghill, and when begot to the stable he threw it down and got sight of me, but did not notice me much; and I watched too, and he opened Mr. Newland's stable, went in with the truss, and shut himself in—if he had gone straight across instead of going round by the dunghill, any one might have seen him through the gate, which opens on to the street, and which stood wide open, but they would not the way he went—Novell said to me, "Don't make a bother about it"—Smith was not there at that time, but not a great time afterwards he went up into the loft, came down again, and said, "Do you think there is any gone?" Novell said, "Yes, I think there is one bundle gone"—I did not go into the loft, but I went into the stable—afterwards, about 10 minutes to 11 o'clock, I saw Newland go into his stable and shut himself in—I heard him lift up what appeared to be the lid of a corn-bin, and let it down again—I waited there, and two or three minutes afterwards I heard him begin to cut chaff—about half-past 8 o'clock that morning I saw my mistress give Novell a sack of corn—she did that every morning.</p>

From information I received from Mr. Hall, I went with him to Newland's stable, and found him cutting hay into chaff—there was about three parts of a truss of hay, and a portion cut into chaff, and another portion in the box—there was no other hay on the premises at all—I examined both his loft and his stable——Hesaid he bought the bay in Tottenham Court-road—I have compared it with the hay on Mr. Hall's premises, and there is no difference that I can see—I examined the corn-bin and found a quantity of oats—I went across to Mr. Hall's premises to compare them together—I returned again shortly, and found Newland mixing some chaff with the oats which I had left—I compared them with Mr. Hall's, and believe them to be the same oats—I took Newland and Smith into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker, in the City of London, and live at Wellington-chambers, London-wall. On Tuesday, 15th March, I had been to the warehouse of Mr. Penson, No. 43, Newgate-street—I had my pocket book out while I was in the warehouse, and I presume I put it in the inside pocket of my coat; that was my usual place of putting it; I am almost certain I put it there, but I may not have put it properly in—I then buttoned up my coat, and went towards Cheapside, on the right hand side of the street—I then went to post a letter, which I had forgotten to do at the West end; opened my pocket to pay for the letter, as it had no stamp on it—I did not take the letter from the same pocket where I had put my pocket book—after posting the letter, and leaving the Post-office, when I had got just close to Goldsmiths'-hall, I felt that my pocket book was gone—it contained three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, several papers, and five or six cards, with my name and address on them—I have never seen my property since—I had not the numbers of the notes at the time, but I recollected where I got them, at Messrs. Herries, the bankers—I stopped them at the Bank, but they were paid in through a banker's, and therefore the Bank of England was bound to pay them; they have all been traced—it was about o'clock in the morning when I lost my pocket book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a single woman. On Tuesday, 15th March, Mary Greville slept in the same room with me—we retired to rest as nearly as possible about 12 o'clock—Miss Greville went to bed last—about 2 o'clock in the morning I was aroused by the growling of my dog, who sleeps outside of the door of my bedroom—we both heard a violent skiffle with the dog—he seemed to seize something and pursue something down stairs, and I heard something fall, and afterwards found something which had been placed to keep him up stairs had fallen—Miss Greville got up, took a candle, lighted it by the night light, and went into the dressing-room adjoining, which does not open into the bedroom—I heard her scream out in a very terrified manner, "A man! a man!"—she then came back into my room, and closed the door—I opened the window of the house, gave an alarm, and the police came—I refused to go down stairs then, but I did afterwards, and found a constable at the back door—it was then very nearly half past 2 o'clock, not quite half an hour after I was first alarmed—since that some difficulty had been found in opening the door, and this morning I tried it myself, and after much difficulty did lock it, and this piece of iron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dropped out of the lock—I found a small press ransacked, and the floor strewed with burning of papers which appeared to have been lighted for some purpose—a candle was turned down on the bed—things were distributed all over the kitchen—a barometer had been taken from the staircase where it had been hanging up, and placed in the kitchen—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner was soon afterwards brought to the house by a constable—this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—it was kept in a press in the dressing-room—I am confident it was there up to the time the man came into the house—I had seen it constantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It is my handkerchief; I was taken half a mile from the house, and taken back. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not miss the handkerchief till it was found, but its peculiar history makes it impossible for me to have the least doubt about it—I sewed the border on to it for the purposes of my profession, and I have worn it on my head upwards of two hundred times for a particular purpose; for thirty-five years.</p>

                  </hi>. I was residing with Miss Kelly. Early in the morning of the 16th I was aroused by the dog barking, and distinctly heard something fall down stairs—I got out of bed, took a candle, went into the dressing-room, and saw a man who resembles the prisoner standing facing me—I feel convinced he is the person—I called out, "A man!" and, having</p>

The prisoner was in my service—on 8th March, he was going to his dinner about 12 o'clock—he left his work in the shop—he was away about an hour—after he returned from his dinner I spoke to a policeman, and about an hour after the prisoner returned I missed two pairs of boot legs—he afterwards went out again, and I did not see him again till I saw him at the station-house—I saw two pairs of boot legs there—they were what I had lost—they have two private marks on them.</p>

               <p>of cotton—it was, to make two frocks for two of my children—She went out for the purpose of getting the stuff from the pawnbroker's to make the dress—it was merino—there were five or six yards of it—I should know it again—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I know it by the colour—it is merino, and of the same quantity, five or six yards—it had been pawned about ten or eleven months—she was to redeem it, and to buy some lining, trimming, and buttons, to make it up on the same day, or Tuesday—I expected her back in half an hour, if they did not keep her at the pawnbroker's—she did not return—I never saw her again alive—I afterwards saw her dead body at St. Pancras-workhouse—I had never been to her lodgings in Townsend-cottages—she got her living by going out to work at ironing at a laundress's.</p>

               <p>buttons, some gimp, and a reel of cotton—after she showed me the things the parcel was done up again—she made some inquiry of me about the prisoner, in consequence of which I went with her to Kensington—he was not there—we then returned, and went to Henry-street, Margaret-street, Oxford-street—there is a church building there—we found the prisoner at work there—it was about 20 minutes past 5 o'clock when we got there—the deceased spoke to him—I did not hear what passed—after she had spoken to him he went in and fetched out his basket—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a basket produced by the policeman</hi>)—I cannot say that this is the basket, it was such a basket as this, and there was a tin bottle like this—I cannot tell whether he put it into the basket or not—he carried the basket with him, and came with us—the deceased and he and I came away together—we went into a public house close by the building, and had a pot of beer there—Eliza Lea paid for it, it came to fourpence—we then left the house.</p>

               <p>her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a quarter to 11 o'clock, in the Hampstead-road; they appeared on the best of terms when they left my house—it was to the Queen's-road, Kensington, that she and I went; that is close to Kensington palace—I dare say that is four miles or more from the Hampstead road—we walked there—she said she heard that the prisoner was at work there, and asked me to go with her to find him—we did not have any dinner that day—we had a biscuit and some cheese—I cannot tell you where that was, but I think it was in Oxford-street—we did not have any regular dinner—I have known her for some years, and the prisoner also—for very nearly seven years—the biscuit and cheese was the only refreshment we had up to a quarter to 5 o'clock, when we got to Margaret-street—we walked all the way back from Kensington to Margaret-street—she appeared in good spirits—she seemed very lively that day, more so than usual—she was not singing as we went along, walking and talking, nothing else—we got to my house at about a quarter to 8 o'clock—the prisoner was at work in Margaret-street—we did not see him at work—she asked a man for him, and the man sent him out—we had some beer at the public house—it was before we went in that she said "I will stand a pot of beer, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, if I never see you again"—he told her that he was married, and then she said, "I will stand a pot of beer, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, if I never see you again"—she had no spirits there, I am almost sure of that—there was only a pot of beer; it was a pot of beer that we had at my house; she had no spirits at my house—she did not send for any—she paid for the little refreshment we had in the course of the day, as I was going with her at her wish—when we saw the prisoner he asked when my husband would come home, and he said as he had got so far he would come up and see him—she sang at my house, and he sang also—she insisted on his singing—she was rather in additional spirits then; in better spirits than she had been during the day—the song she sang was, "As I wandered by the brook side, as I wandered by the mill," or something of that sort—it was a sentimental song—before she left she asked me to take care of her parcel, and take it to her mother's, which I declined—she did not say she could not go home to her mother's because she had spent her money—she simply asked me to take it for her the next day—they were at my house for about two hours—it was a very dark night, very foggy—yon could hardly see your hand before you when they left—it was one of the very foggy nights which we had about that time—I have never seen the deceased in hysterics—she used occasionlly to get intoxicated.</p>

On Monday night, 31st Jan., I remember seeing the prisoner at our house, about half past 10 o'clock; there was a female with him—they came to the front of the bar, and had something to drink—it was a quartern of gin—I cannot say that I noticed the prisoner having a basket with him, but I believe he did have one—I had seen the female before—I did not see them leave the house—I believe they were sober—on the same night, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I saw the dead body of a woman, at the Regalia public house—I believe it was the body of the woman whom I had seen alive that night—I have no doubt upon the subject—I cannot say that I saw her clothes—I did not see the prisoner again that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pianoforte maker. At the time in question I lived at No. 2, Henry-street, Cumberland-market—I have since removed to No. 16, Gloucester-place—on 31st Jan. I was at the Regalia public house, in Augustus-street, from 9 o'clock in the evening till very nearly 2 o'clock in the morning—about 11 o'clock that night I had occasion to go into the back garden—there is a canal at the bottom of the garden, and a passage at the left hand side, running parallel with the garden—whilst I was in the garden I heard the sounds of some one in the water, apparently a woman—it was a gurgling sound, as of a person attempting to make a cry, but smothered by the water—I could make out no word—I heard no sound of the water at all—before I moved from the spot, I heard the sound of a man running up this passage from the canal—I heard that very distinctly—he appeared to be running fast—I ran from the garden through the house—Mr. Wolfe, the landlord, was in the bar—I called out to him, "Wolfe, Wolfe! here is something the matter!" and ran through the house, and turned to the top of the passage to go to the canal—that was the same passage of which I have spoken, which the man was running up—I met a man there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you speak as to that man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief, but I cannot swear to him—to the best of my belief it was Thomas Mackett, the prisoner—I ran quite close to the man—he had on a light jacket and light trowsers, and a white cap, and a basket or bundle under his arm—I noticed his height; it was apparently about five feet eight, or something near that—I spoke to him, and asked him what was the matter—he replied, "I think therein woman thrown herself in the water"—I did not say anything to him then—Mr. Wolfe spoke to him—he had followed me—the man appeared in mind very cool and collected—what Mr. Wolfe said was to the effect, "Come down and give her assistance then"—he said that to the man—we then proceeded down to the canal, Mr. Wolfe going first, followed by the prisoner, and I following after him—when I got down to the canal I still heard the gurgling sounds once or twice, and several splashes in the water—Mr. Wolfe said he would go and fetch a light, and he went up the passage, followed by the prisoner—I remained at the water's edge—I did not move from the spot till Mr. Wolfe returned with the light—the man whom I suppose to be the prisoner did not return with Mr. Wolfe—I immediately went in search of him, in consequence of something which Mr. Wolfe said, and attempted to find him—I went down Augustus-street, towards Cumberland-market—I did not find the man—I met the policeman, 144, I think, and he returned with me to the canal—there were several more persons at the edge of the wafer at that time, and I saw Percival the policeman with a rope, which Mr. Wolfe had brought when he brought the candle—they tied a stone to it—Percival threw it in—it caught under the arm of the deceased woman, and she was gently drawn in to the water's edge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first heard the footsteps coming up the passage, could you form any opinion as to whether they were near, or at some distance from the canal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Close to the edge—I should imagine they proceeded from almost the immediate edge of the water—I was not far from the edge myself—I do not know the width of the towing path; it is something about thirteen feet perhaps—I believe the distance from the spot at which I first heard the footsteps to the spot where I first met the man, as measured in the plan produced, is 119 feet—that would be about the distance—the distance from the spot in the garden where I was to the spot where I met the prisoner was about sixty feet—immediately I heard the footsteps I went into the house—I ran at the top of my speed, but I had to open two doors.</p>

Q.</hi> You have not been asked this question, but I think it was so foggy thatyoucould hardly see a foot into the water, could yon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the body of the deceased was found rather towards the opposite side of the canal—I should say the width of the canal is about thirty feet, or nearly that—the body was found fifteen or eighteen feet, I should think, from the edge of the towing-path—the passage that I speak of is used for the purpose of attaching the horses to the barges at the basin—it is the commencement of the towing-path—it is well known in the neighbourhood—I do not know that men and women go down there of an evening—I have never witnessed anything of the kind—I have used that passage myself as a means of going to Primrose-hill—it is a short cut—it brings you out a considerable distance above the York and Albany—you get out close by Primrose-hill—it may be nearly a quarter of a mile long, or probably not so much—I have always declined to swear positively to this man, and have always expressed myself in the same way as I have to-day—I could not swear whether it was a bundle or a basket that he had.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Regalia public house, in Augustus-street. On the night of the 31st Jan., in consequence of a communication made to me by Mr. Wilson, I went out of my house—when I had gone a few yards out of my house with Mr. Wilson, I met a man—I am not able to say that I see that man in Court—I did not distinguish his features at all—it was a dark, foggy night, and, going from the light, and understanding there was something wrong, my attention was taken to the water, so that I did not distinguish the features of the man at all—he bad on a white dress, I could see that—it was a light-coloured dress, but I could not distinguish what texture it was—it was a jacket—I noticed the man's stature—when I met him, I said, "Halloa! what's the matter?" and he made answer, "I think there is a woman in the water"—I do not know what he was doing at that time, for I felt a little <hi rend="italic">irritated</hi> myself—I did not know at the moment whether he was standing still or walking, but I thought perhaps he bad turned in the gateway, hearing the noise—I do not know whether he was walking towards us, or whether he had just turned in—I did not notice which way he was standing—he appeared to be standing half-sideways like when I went in—I said to him, "Let us see whether we cannot assist her"—his observation to me was, "I think there is a woman in the water," or, "I think there is somebody in the water"—it was one or the other—it was words to that effect—when I said, "Let us see if we cannot help her," I ran down to the canal, and left Mr. Wilson and the man behind me—they followed me to the water's edge—when I got to the bank I heard a gurgling noise in the water, a stifling, as if of choking from the water—I went to get a light, and left Mr. Wilson and the man there—I returned in a few minutes with a light—I then only saw Mr. Wilson there—the man was not there—after some exertions, we succeeded in getting the body of the woman out shortly afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a constable in the police force. On 25th Feb. I lived at No. 133, Sloane-street—the prisoner is my nephew—he had been in the habit of visiting roe, this was his fourth visit since Christmas—he came to the door on Friday, the 25th, I let him in—he laid he had been on business into the King's-road; he said, "Is uncle gone?"—I said, "Yes"—I asked him to come in—he came in, and sat down in his uncle's chair—I asked him if he would take supper—he said he would—I asked if he would take a cup of coffee—he said he preferred water—I put supper on the table, he helped himself, and I then cleared away the supper—he said he had a sovereign, which he could not get changed anywhere, and asked me if I thought I could accommodate him—I told him I would—I got the change, counted it out, and put it on the table for him—he did not produce the sovereign, or take the change; he sat there, and talked till 10 o'clock—I was ironing some things—about 10 minutes before 10 o'clock I told him if he did not go, he would not be able to get across the park—he said, then he must go round it—he said he had a violent toothache, and I gave him some ginger for it—it was then about 10 o'clock, as near as could be—I told him be had better go—he then buttoned up his coat, rose up out of the chair, and then unbuttoning his coat, he said, "I forgot the change"—I said, "If you are not particular, I do not want to part with it, because it is all I have;" meaning that the change would be more acceptable than the sovereign—he said, "I am not particular"—I then took it up, and put it into my own pocket—he put his hands into his two waistcoat pockets, and feeling, said, "I have dropped my sovereign"—I stooped to look for it, and the prisoner immediately seized on my head with his left hand, and squeezed my head down on the carpet; he held it down, put out the candle, and <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> a razor across my throat—I could not see the razor at the time—it was something sharp, like a razor—I threw him off, and pushed the razor from my neck, and said, "George, George! if you are doing this for money tell me, and you shall</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040059"/>
               <p>have money"—he said, "Then give it me, then give it me;" still seizing my head—he would not let me get up—he took hold of my head again between his legs, or his feet, and tried to put the razor to my neck again—I put up my hand, and prevented it—the blade was in my hand, and I broke the razor, as I held the blade in my hand—I did not see the handle till the policeman showed it to roe—I escaped through the prisoner's legs, as he was holding me by the head, and <hi rend="italic">lolling</hi> himself over my back to keep roe down—I tried to get away, he seized on me again, and held me by the neck, so that I could not speak—I forced one of his hands from my neck, and he took the other away, and held my dress behind—I was trying to go to the window—he put his hand behind him, and reached my poker; it was in the fireplace, close by where he bad been sitting—as I was raising my arm to open the shutters, he struck me a violent blow across my shoulder—he then pushed me against the bed, and hammered my head with the poker, until I got possession of the poker myself—I begged of him several times to spare my life, for the sake of my children—he tried to take the poker away from me, but he did not succeed—I then tried to get to the door, as we were holding the poker—he put his back against the door—we had a severe struggle, to see which would get the poker, but we both kept hold of it—I asked him why he had been using me in the manner he had—he said he had parted from his master, and his father had forbade him the house—I then asked him what I should give him to go, and not hit me any more—he said, "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and light the candle"—I bled very much from my throat and hand—I was wearing a piece of velvet tape round my neck, which the policeman has; and I was wearing this brooch at the throat, and the razor cut across the brooch and cut the velvet—when the prisoner said "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and light the candle," I said, "I will give you the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if you will go with me up to the front door"—he said, "You will halloo"—I said, "I will not light the candle; as you put the candle out, you may light it;" he then put his arm round me and kissed me, and said, "My dear aunt, we will go together and light the candle"—we had a little more conversation, but I cannot call it to mind; it was all of the same nature—he said he was sorry, and said, "Give me a knife, and I will cut my own head off"—I talked to him for several minutes—he dropped the poker into my hand, and turned from the door—I threw the door open, and ran up to the front door and gave the alarm; the gentleman from No. 135, and the cook from the next door (No. 132) came down—the policeman came down about three minutes after—the prisoner was then sitting on the bed—I went to him and talked to him, but he would not answer me—I told the policeman where he had attacked me—he lighted the candle, and the gentleman and the cook also brought in lights, and the policeman picked up the handle of the razor—I said, "I don't know whether it was a knife or a razor, it was very sharp"—the policeman said, "Here is the handle of the razor"—I said, "I threw the blade somewhere, I don't know where;" and he looked in the fireplace, and found it there—I then gave him the poker, and the piece of velvet—I was afterwards attended by a surgeon—it was a fortnight before I was out of my room—I was six months gone in the family way at the time—no sovereign was found—the policeman searched in my presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WHITMORE</hi>. I am a surgeon, living at 124, Sloane-street. I was called in to see the prosecutrix—I found her sitting on a chair—I found a superficial wound on the neck, and a number of smaller incisions, but none of any importance, none that required me to attend to them more than once—I found two wounds on the head; they were deep, cut to the bone—I also found a little wound on the cheek, and others on the right hand, and a number of smaller abrasions or scratches on the palm of the hand—the wounds on the head were very severe; they must have been done with a blunt instrument, such as a poker, from the fact that the hair was not divided; it was split; it seemed as if the scalp had been split by the weight of the weapon—she was quite conscious, but agitated and exhausted—this was perhaps half an hour after the attack—there was not much blood running at the time, but I think, judging from the blood that had coagulated, she had lost a good deal—the piece of velvet round her neck would in some measure blunt the edge of the instrument—the injuries on the head and cheek were decidedly inflicted by a sharp instrument—she was threatened with premature labour—I consider her quite well now—she had occasion to keep her bed for about a fortnight—during that time I cannot say she was ever in great danger, not in any immediate danger; but there was the chance of premature labour coming on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the depth of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Barely through the skin—if it was done with great violence the velvet would not have prevented it, the brooch would—I have seen some cases of madness—I have read Beck's "Medical Jurisprudence," and Dr. Taylor and Dr. Conolly's works—there are generally premonitory symptoms of insanity—there have been cases</p>

I was on duty in Friday-street on the night of 26th Feb.—about 11 o'clock I saw a person back a light spring cart from Cheapside to the door of Mr. Rutter's warehouse, which is the first house from Cheapside—I am not positive as to the men that were on the pavement or in the doorway, but I saw one man in the cart, and I am certain there were two men in the doorway—the man in the cart was dressed in a dark top coat, either dark brown or dark blue, and a <hi rend="italic">wide-awake</hi>—two or three bundles were instantly thrown into the cart by the men who were not in the cart—I was some distance down Friday-street; I was going down, and I turned round, hearing the noise of something come into the street—as soon as these bundles were thrown into the cart it darted into Cheapside, and I was not able to catch it by any means—I went to the house, and found the door had been opened, but it was then shut; that had not been forced open, but the inner door had—we got a ladder, and got in at the first floor—the persons who threw the bundles in the cart had pulled the outer door close after them; it went on a spring lock—the inner warehouse door had been broken open—there is a light spring cart here, which is similar to the cart I saw, and here is a <hi rend="italic">wide awake</hi> and a top coat—this coat resembles the coat which the man in the cart had—the <hi rend="italic">wide awake</hi> hat was like this, but they are so much alike I cannot say.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the business you carry on extensive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there are two persons in the establishment besides myself—Mr. Taylor only is authorised to sell goods—if Mr. Taylor and myself were absent, the boy would of course be forced to sell—it may be so that there have been instances in which goods have been sent out without labels—I am not aware of it—it might have occurred—the same sort of goods are made by other manufacturers in the trade, but they are made up in a different manner—there are several other manufacturers at Leek, but our goods are made up differently to any other manufacturer—they differ in the way in which the twist is put on the reel, and if you take the twist off you will find there is a small bit of paper on the reel under the twist—I will undertake to say that that peculiarity is not to be found in the twist of any other manufacturer—that I say positively—I have been at Leek and seen the twist wound, and it is known in the trade—I could bring twenty persons to prove it—this black sewing silk was ours—I cannot undertake to say it was not sold—I have always considered the prisoner to be a respectable man—his name is Griffith—I did not know him passing by any other name—I did not know him in the country—I have known him in London about four years; he came to the warehouse to see Mr. Taylor almost every day—I do not know the nature of the business there was between them—I saw him leave the establishment day after day—he did not always leave the premises in company with some one—we never thought of watching him—when I have been in the counting house, I have frequently seen him go out—I could see him from the counting-house to the door—we only sell to wholesale houses—I cannot say to how many in London—we send to Manchester—I know that from Leek they send everywhere, and all the goods are made up in the same way—we took stock on 31st Dec.—not at the end of Jan.—I cannot say that I know that the prisoner was in pecuniary difficulties.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant in the establishment of Mr. Worthington—I have been there ten years—I know the prisoner by the name of William Griffiths, never by any other name—it is the custom in our business when this twist is sold always to put on it a label, which we have engraved in London for our own use for the London house—that is our invariable practice, we never send them out without such a label—I never knew an instance in which it was done—this parcel has our boy's mark on it, and this other has Mr. Russell's mark—this drab twist is our manufacture—I am quite certain this has been in our possession—supposing it had been sold, it would not have been sold with this mark on it—this mark, 1 lb. 8oz., is the mark of our boy at the time of stock taking, on 31st Dec. 1852—I can speak to this grey silk; it was dyed to eight different shades—there are eight different shades in each bundle; about the beginning of Feb., we had about 30 lbs. come up, dyed to our own patterns and shades—they were in six different packages, eight shades in a bundle—I have not the least doubt that this property was in the possession of my employers—I went carefully over the stock when they were taking stock, and I went over it to see if anything was missing about fortnight ago—we are short altogether in the aggregate, about 150 lbs. weight—Mr. Russell and myself, and the porter are in our establishment—if Mr. Russell and I should be absent, which is a very rare occurrence, the porter would sell things and make a memorandum, and we should enter it when we came in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the age of the boy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About nineteen—when Mr. Russell and I are absent he serves, but that does not happen once in three months—Mr. Russell has not been ill since Christmas—his father died, and in consequence he was absent one day—if I were away during his absence, the porter would have the charge of the house—I am certain this grey silk is of different shades—it is common to have silk dyed in different shades, these are for tailors—it is customary to have various shades dyed—the mark on this paper is the handwriting of the porter—it is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was the stocktaking mark, but there is more in it now—we fill up papers</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Pope, of Isleworth. On Thursday night, 10th Feb., my husband was from home—I closed up the doors, locked up the house, and went to bed—during the night I heard a noise like the slamming of a shutter next door—I got up about a quarter to 7 o'clock in the morning—I unfastened the stairfoot door, and found the shutter wrenched aside and an inner door open, leading into a little room; the back door was wide open—I ran out of doors, and saw the glass and part of the window frame lying down, and a steel and knife belonging to my husband; the window frame was broken all to pieces, and was taken out, which left a space large enough to admit a man—on searching the house I missed a drawer, containing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of farthings and twenty-five slate pencils—the till had been emptied; it had contained 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of halfpence the night before, besides farthings; I had taken out the silver—I also missed a bottle of sweets, some Spanish liquorice, and a piece of meat—there was one coin, marked "2 cents;" I saw that on the Thursday afternoon, because I picked some of the farthings from the halfpence, and put them into the till; the two cent piece was put into the bowl in the till in the afternoon—I took a bad farthing of a man that Thursday afternoon; there were two 2's on it, the date of the year, and it was likewise bent—I had also another farthing with three holes in it, also a bent farthing, and there were six farthings all alike—I have known the prisoners ever since I have been at the shop, four yean, and they have all been there.</p>

I am now in custody for robbing my employer—I have been seven years in Mr. Harriss's employment as clerk—I have known the prisoners between three and four years; they were customers of my master for sponges, but never in a regular way for anything else—I have been in the habit of meeting them occasionally at other places, besides my master's, generally in Hayley-street—I recollect seeing David Alexander on one occasion, when I was in want of money, at the Green Man, between five and six months ago—at that time I had committed no robbery on my employers—I asked David to lend me some money—he said he could not, as he had been buying so much sponge lately, but that if I could get some sponge out he would sell it, and let me have the money—I told him I could not, because that was not my line of business; the sponge was not under my care—he asked me if I could get any composition out, that is harness composition—I told him I could do so, but should not like—he said that out of the quantity my master had he would not miss few dozen, and a few dozen would put me all right—(the sum I wanted to borrow</p>

               <p>was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—this was at dinner-time, 1 o'clock—David said he would send his brother Joseph round about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and at 5 o'clock the prisoner Joseph came to the window of the warehouse, and I gave him a parcel of composition—this was in Aug., as near as I can recollect—I saw David the next day—he asked me if I could not get any more out, as that was so small a quantity, and I gave him another parcel after that—about 21st Aug. I sent away a cask, by my master's cart, to Joseph Alexander's house, containing about forty dozen boxes of composition—Christmas was the driver of the cart—I delivered the cask to him from the shop—I had the prisoner's direction written down, and I gave it to him—I saw Joseph the same day at the usual place, in Haley-street, not at a public house—he said that it was all right, he had sent it off by rail to Birmingham, and it was not in the house five minutes—I cannot say whether I saw David about it at all; I do not recollect any conversation with him about it—I delivered some more in Sept.; David paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—I also sent away a cask by Christmas in Sept., directed "D. Simpson, to be left at the Birmingham Railway-station, at Birmingham"—it had been agreed on between David Alexander and me to direct it to Simpson—I cannot recollect whether he proposed that name or whether it was agreed on between us—he said he would write and send the money up by a Post-office older, at the Whitechapel post-office, and he would address me as T. Cameron; that was to be my name—after I had sent the composition to Birmingham I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I cannot say in whose handwriting it is, or the direction—I expected to receive it—it was agreed between me and David that I was to call at the Whitechapel post-office to see if there was a letter left.</p>

On Sat, 5th March, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner passed me in Bishopsgate-street; he said something to another man, and I passed him—I had never seen him before, he seemed to be very much in liquor—he then overtook me and said something in his own language, I said nothing to him; he came alongside of me, and said in English, "Look at my nose?" I turned round to look at it, and he up with a knife, and cut my forehead (I have had two or three half pints of porter, but it has not hurt me), my forehead bled very much indeed; the prisoner said something and walked off—I went to a doctor—I was quite sober, I bad not bad my week's money five minutes.</p>

On 12th Feb., the prisoner Wellfare came into our shop about a quarter or half past 3 o'clock in the afternoon—she purchased a few articles, amounting to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I made out a bill of parcels, and a duplicate of it—this is the duplicate which I made out (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I retained it, she gave me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note in payment—I gave it to the cashier Clewet, and he gave me a check for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gold and silver in exchange—this check (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I believe to be the one he gave me—I gave the same check that I received from Clewet to Wellfare—another of the assistants named Stocks was near me when the purchase was made—I heard him offer to send the parcel, and I heard her say, "No thank you, I'll take it myself," and I think she said that she lived close at hand in King-street—something was said in reference to living in King-street—I heard the words "King-street"—she then went away, and took the parcel with her.</p>

If that were made out, the act of each vat the act of both; and, upon that principle, the first uttering would be the act of Brown, the second that of Wellfare. Taking the different items of evidence proved—the living together, their denial of each other, the disposal of the check, &amp;c, coupled with the fact about to be proved, that both notes came from the same plate, there was reasonable evidence of co-operation to go to the Jury; at the same time, he cautioned the Jury that unless they were of opinion that both the prisoners co-operated in the uttering on the 12th, the forthcoming evidence was not to be taken into their consideration as against Brown.</hi>

                  </hi>. I was the plaintiff in a cause of Abrahams <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Price tried at the Court of Exchequer, Guildhall, last February—it was an action brought upon two bills of Exchange for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I had those bills in my possession at that time—these are the bills that have been produced—I discounted them for the prisoner and a person of the name of Thompson—Thompson was with her—it was on 23rd April, at Bristol, where I reside—I had seen the prisoner and Thompson on the subject of the bills before the 23rd April, I could not swear positively to the day, but five or six days—they left the first bills with me to inquire as to their validity—they were two bills for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—they wished me to discount them—I did not do so because they were on a wrong stamp—they were handed back to them, and five or six days afterwards they brought me these two bills—the first two bills were by the same acceptor as these.</p>

I was the defendant in an action tried before him, in Feb. last, of Abrahams <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Price—I was present at the trial, during the time I gave my evidence; I was not in the Court at the close of the case—I know the prisoner; I think the first time I saw her was in Aug., 1851—I have made her some advances by means of my acceptances—this letter, dated 26th March, 1852, is in her writing—I received it from her about the time of its date; I was then at Torquay—it enclosed two bills to be accepted by me, at six months date, of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—there were four bills in the letter, two of which I had given dated 16th Oct., 1851, at twelve months' date, for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, which were returned to me with the other two, dated 26th March, at six months, which were to be accepted in lieu of those two that would become due on 49th Oct., with a request that I would destroy them, and return these in lieu of them—I accordingly destroyed the old bills, accepted the new ones, and returned them to Mrs. Hamblett (<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>:—"Sir,—In your last letter to me, you again reminded me of meeting the bills due in April.

I thought you would have no objection to accept them; and if you destroyed these yourself, and if you do this it will enable me to meet the others without having recourse to the Thompsons, as it will be my strict endeavour to avoid them in future.

If, however, you can induce them to cash them for you, they may rely on my punctually sending the money to their bank when due on 26th Sept. next. I am, Madam, yours, &amp;c, <hi rend="smallCaps">F. R. PRICE</hi>,") These two bills of exchange are neither of them accepted by me; there is none of my handwriting on them, not the least—I did not authorise anybody to accept them in my name (<hi rend="italic">the two bills were here read, dated</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th March</hi>, 1852, <hi rend="italic">drawn by C.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What I understand from you is, that you deny that in the letter you wrote the amount of 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was mentioned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; I deny that upon my oath—no portion of these bills are in my handwriting, not even the name, across the signature—I know Hearder's Hotel, at Torquay—I have very seldom been in the habit of going there; I have gone there sometimes to get postage stamps—I do not live at Torquay; I am staying there at present—I swear, beyond all question, that I was not there on 17th April—I threw nothing into the fire there on that day—I never threw any-thing into the fire there, certainly not; nor did I say, "D—n the things, let them go!" I never use such words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not want there to be any mistake about this; are you quite certain?—do you pledge your oath that you were not at Hearder's Hotel on 17th April? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot positively say I was not, but I have no reason to think I was; if I was, it was only to get postage stamps—I can almost positively swear I was not there—I certainly did swear at the trial at the Exchequer that I was not at Hearder's Hotel that day at all—I made no exception there about going for postage stamps, but I am sure I did not go for the purpose of meeting anybody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you pledge yourself not to have been there for any purpose on 17th April? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not; I pledge my oath that 1 was not there, either for postage stamps or any other purpose—I cannot fix a day, but I am positively sure I was not there on the 17th for postage stamps.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought you had not known her before 1851? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know her personally—I burnt the letter that began our correspondence—I had never seen her before 1851, but I think I had written to her, though not often; I cannot charge my memory as to how long before—I had not known that she was married to a person named Pickford; I never knew that she went by that name till 1851—I do not know how she happened to go by that name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She swore, in the Court of Exchequer, that it was by your desire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was certainly not by my desire, I swear that; nor that she should call herself Pickford—I never desired that she should sign her name Pickford, or use that name in any way; I swear that—I should think this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is in my writing (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>:—"Thursday. Madam,—I have just received the enclosed bill from Mr. Thompson, and forward it to you by his desire: you must sign it, 'C. Pickford.' It is drawn at two months, which is, I am sorry to say, very inconvenient to me, as having, as you know, to provide for a very large bill by 1st Jan. I am extremely doubtful about being able to meet this one in the same month; but as you said you would provide for a portion of that bill due 11th Jan., I trust, if I can meet the whole of that, you will do your utmost endeavours to meet this when it is due on 18th Jan., as it is not in my power to meet all those large sums. I cannot understand how the mistake has occurred; as I most certainly thought I had paid every bill that was due until Jan. When the bill is taken up due this month, be so good as to send it to me; but do not write until then, and merely direct, 'Torquay, Devonshire,' as the letters directed to the post office are not kept there until I call for them, but sent by the letter carrier. I am glad to bear you are better. P. S.—It would be better if you would get Mr. Thompson to alter the two months to three months, which would make it more convenient; and I perceive the stamp is equally good for three as for two months. I shall write to Mr. T. by this post on the subject. ") That was written after 1851, when I knew she went by the name of Pickford.</p>

Now I must roost plainly tell you that I really will not accept any more bills, as what I have already done is very much more than 1 can afford to do; and I trust if you succeed in your business, you will repay me some portion of what I have advanced you, and I trust what I have now done will prove advantageous. I must request that my name may not appear in the business in any way. Be so good as to sign your name to the bill Ch., and not your Christian name at full length.") <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You see there you desire she should sign merely with the initials of her Christian name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not mean her regular name—I really cannot say any particular reason why that was; I thought it might be better; it was "C.," and it might be considered either to be "Charles" or "Charlotte," either a man or a woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not wish a lady to be the drawer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I fancy that was my motive—I believe it was—there had been a great many bills with her name in full—we had not negotiated bills together to the amount of many</p>

               <p>thousands; I cannot say the exact sum—I enclosed the two bills, which I say were for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, in a letter; I should think that was on 27th March—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter—(<hi rend="italic">read—</hi>"March 27th.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the bills you enclosed payable at the Gloucester Bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at the County of Gloucester Bank—there was no blank for the drawer's name; I cannot explain the reason of that; I do not know the meaning of that, but I certainly enclosed those two bills in that letter.</p>

I did not return in time to answer it by yesterday's post I am most particularly desirous you should not attempt to come down to see me here, as it might, I can assure you, be productive of serious consequences. If, however, you should persist in your determination to come, you had better assume some other name; and when you arrive, go to the Swan hotel, in High-street. If you do this, you must write from London, by to-morrow's post. Say what time you shall be here, and also in what name; and I will endeavour to see you as soon after as I can. But direct to me, 'Post office, to be left till called for,' or the letter may not reach me. I must, however, for many reasons, earnestly request you will not come; and as I have, at very great inconvenience to myself, rendered you very considerable assistance, I really think I have some right to expect you will acquiesce in my wishes—it is not improbable but that I may be in London ere long, and would inform you if I am.

BALLANTINE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">handing a number of letters to the witness, who examined them.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You need only just look at those letters generally; are they in jour handwriting? do you believe them to be? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner has carried on business at Cheltenham, to my knowledge—I cannot say as to whether she carried on business at Bristol—her husband was formerly in my service as a postilion—he did not marry the prisoner while he was in my ser<lb/>vice; I suppose it was afterwards—he left my service, I should think, upwards of twenty years ago, or thereabouts—I never met her with her husband in the Royal York-crescent, Clifton, not to know her—I did not meet a woman with him—I mean to say that seriously—I was walking in the Crescent, where we were then lodging, at Clifton, and he came up to me—I did not see anybody with him—I did not speak to any woman that I am aware of—I did not say that I hoped she would prosper in her business; I do not think I used such words—I should say certainly I did not; I have no recollection of it—I cannot swear to a thing that I have no recollection of—I did not know that she was carrying on an upholstery business in the Mall at Clifton—I did not know her there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you always promised to do what you could for her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said I would assist her—I did not promise her husband before his death that I would do what I could for her; I never said anything about it—I have no recollection of having done anything of the sort—it is a good many years ago; I cannot call to mind that I said anything of the sort—I am aware that it is a peculiar matter—it is possible that I may have made such a promise and for<lb/>gotten it, but I do not believe I did—I cannot swear I did not—she kept an upholsterer's shop at Cheltenham—I was there a few times, not several times; I should say not more than three or four times—to the best of my recollection, I do not think I was in her shop more than four or five times at the outside. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not visit her more intimately than at the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I went up stairs into a sitting-room; she took me there—that was in the autumn of 1851—her husband had then been dead three or four years, I believe—I am a married man—I think I was up in the sitting-room several times; she asked me to go up—I did not go of my own accord, she asked me—I was not there more than from four to five times—I have not been there three times in one day—I think I recollect being there twice in one day—I think I have some recollection that I went in the morning, and I think, for some reason or other, I was obliged to go again, but I cannot tell you exactly why; I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you directed her to draw bills in the name of Hamblett? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that I ever gave her any particular directions—I know that she has done so, and in the name of Pickford; never in any other names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have occasionally received money out of them, have you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think I ever received anything but one sum, I believe, of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not recollect ever receiving any more—I have most certainly not received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040091"/>
               <p>considerable sums of money out of the discount of theft bills—I was in France in 1850.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you keep up a correspondence with her while there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wrote to her from France, certainly; but if she had not written to me I should not have written at all—I wrote several times to her; I answered her letters.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you say the first you knew of this woman was receiving what you call a kind of threatening letter from her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think that is about five years ago, shortly after her husband's death—I destroyed that letter—I cannot remember the substance of it, I do not exactly recollect the nature of the threat; I forget the exact nature of it—she said her husband had told her it would be prejudicial to me, as I understood, and I gave way to that—she alluded to something that she said her husband had told her—she did not describe the nature of what her husband had told her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There are one or two letters in which you say you think some inquiries may be made of her as to what assistance she had received from you, had you directed any inquiries to be made of her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not at all—it is impossible for me to say by whom the two bills in question are written—if you will allow me to look at them, I will see whether I know the handwriting (<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>)—I should say, to the best of my belief, that they were Mrs. Hamblett's handwriting, but I cannot swear to a thing that I did not see done—to the best of my belief they are in her handwriting.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you say about the clerk then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps being in a hurry I did not think of all those little things; I said I had refreshed my memory by the books, that was relative to the luncheon—the books are here, the clerk has them—the entries in them are not made by me, he books it from what I tell him—I left the hotel in May—I left of my own pleasure, the situation did not suit me, it was not exactly lucrative enough for me; and I left and went to Manchester, and am there now—Mrs. Hamblett came by the 12 o'clock omnibus, and left by the half past 3, or quarter to 4 omnibus, for the station—I do not know what distance Torquay is from Cheltenham; you cannot get there in half an hour—it is not likely if she was at our place at a quarter to 4 that she was at Cheltenham at 4, the train does not start till after 4.</p>

I shipped on board an English ship, the <hi rend="italic">Affghan</hi>, from Calcutta to China. and from China to this country; I was <hi rend="italic">Burra Tindall</hi>; next under the Serang—the Serang was the head of our men—I was above the other men, and the Serang was above me—there were English sailors on board; there were three boys, and the prisoner, and another officer, and the captain, besides the coloured men—Rahmet Alli was on board—he was a Lascar, a common sailor—he joined the ship at Calcutta—I remember something happening on board the ship—I do sot exactly know the name of the month—I remember going to the police office here—it was rather better than a month before that, about a month before we reached England—the ship was then at sea—it was after we left St. Helena—at that time Rahmet Alli and others were engaged in pulling a rope called the main tack—it is a rope with which they pull the mainsail aft—I was on the rigging—Rahmet Alli was on the deck, pulling the rope on the right side—the prisoner was on the rail of the ship, on the side—while they were pulling, the rope broke—the prisoner said to Rahmet Alli, "Bring another rope"—Rahmet Alli did not know any English—he stood still, end the prisoner jumped down from the rail, and struck him under his neck with his fist, and he fell down with the first blow—there was a block of wood on the deck, on which the carpenter used to work—when Rahmet Alli fell, his head fell against the edge of the main hatch, and his back on the block—the block was not quite a foot high—while Rahmet Alli was lying down, the prisoner stood over him, one foot on each side of him, and began to beat him with his fists, and to kick him—he hit him with his fists on both sides of his face, and kicked him with his foot on the sides and the chest—he hit him about eight or nine times, in the face—they were very hard blows—I did not keep account of how many times he kicked him; perhaps ten or twelve times—they were very violent kicks, so that he could not speak afterwards—the mate had boots on at the time, and while he was kicking him, Rahmet Alli was crying out, "He has killed me, he has killed me!"—I came down from the rigging after the beating was over; Jetoo was with me on the rigging, and he and I lifted up Rahmet Alli, and carried him to the forecastle, and a boy gave us some assistance—Rahmet Alli was not able to speak; he was quite in a helpless state—I next saw him in the evening—he was lying still in the forecastle, not speaking—Hegot the beating about two o'clock one day—the next day, past 2 o'clock, was one day; and the following morning, at 4 o'clock, he died—I did not see him die—I came in, and saw him dead—I examined his body—it was quite swollen—as he was entirely swollen, I could not easily distinguish any marks on his body—I observed his hips and sides—they were swollen, and there were some marks which were black—he was not a very dark man—not so dark as me—I am very dark—there were black marks on his hips, chest, sides, and face—they were bruises, not cuts</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040097"/>
               <p>—I saw blood coming out of his nose after he was dead—when it was day-light, the captain gave orders, and we tied him up, and threw him into the sea—before this beating, he was in a healthy state, working in the tops—he had been accustomed to go aloft; he had messed with the Serang—he and I had slept in different places—I had associated with him—we were all together, coming from one country—he did no work after the beating—he remained lying in the forecastle all the time after the beating, till his death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Used the Serang to have a thick rope, that he kept fastened round his body, that he used to beat the men with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he only had a handker-chief round his loins—I did not wear anything round me—I never beat the men—we had not time to do anything on board the ship, hardly breathing time; I had no time to beat my comrades—they were not a lazy set; they were all clean—there were three white men on board, three boys, and the mates and captain—I do not reckon the cook and the carpenter amongst the sailors.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having heard that Rahmet Alli was knocked down, his head coming against the hatchway, and his back against the log of wood with violence, in your opinion could those causes produce injury sufficient to cause death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If be were in perfect health previous to those injuries I should say it would—I mean to say that I think a person in perfect health might be killed in that way—I think concussion might be produced by his head coming in contact with the hatchway, and, supposing he had been otherwise diseased, concussion might have been produced by that, as well as if be were in perfect health—his back coming against a log of wood in the fall might have caused a rupture of the internal viscera.</p>

I cannot tell how long this person had the scurvy.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing concussion of the brain to follow the blow, what would be the symptom? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Insensibility; but it may not take place for some hours—I don't think a man saying, "I am dead, I am dead; what are you beating me for?" would prevent its being a concussion—the body swells in the lifetime from scurvy—I am not able to tell whether in case of death from scurvy swelling would come on after death—supposing an internal rupture of the lungs or liver to have taken place that would not cause any swelling after death—supposing the body to be saturated with mercury that would cause a swelling before death, not afterwards—some bodies swell more than others after death; but that is after some little while—I cannot account</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040101"/>
               <p>for the swelling of the body in this case—scurvy would be more or less local not all over the body—it would be in the arms or legs.</p>

The ship <hi rend="italic">Affghan</hi> went from Liverpool to Calcutta—when I got there I was short of hands, several of my men left me—I was obliged to hire other hands; I hired twenty-four Lascars—I saw the whole of them sign these articles—from Calcutta I went to Singapore and Hong Kong—twelve of the Lascars deserted in Shang Hai—it is a common thing for these men to desert in Shanghai; wages there are very high, and sailors difficult to obtain, so that they often desert—the other men did not desert; I set a watch to prevent them from deserting—I believe the whole of them made attempts to desert—I am not aware that there had been any ill treatment of any of these men up to that time—when I found these men attempted to desert, I made application to the British Consul—I made a complaint to him, and the matter was investigated; my complaint was heard, and their answer; and the result was they were put in prison till the ship was ready to sail, and they were sent on board under a guard—the chief officer kept the log, but I kept the official log—these men behaved pretty well; they are very active in warm weather, but slothful in cold weather—a person came on board, called the Serang; he joined at Calcutta—he had the management of the coloured men—he was one of the twelve who were put in prison—there was another man, called Sumshere, the <hi rend="italic">Burra Tindall</hi>—he generally carried a piece of rope round his waist, with a knot to it, to start the men an end when they were lazy, and there was any particular work to do—I have seen him do that frequently; I have occasionally told him to do it—the orders are generally given through the Serang; I have sometimes given orders to the Serang, and sometimes to the <hi rend="italic">Burra Tindall</hi>—I have never committed any act of violence to them; I state that on my deliberate oath—I knew the deceased; he was ill about six days before he died—I saw him from time to time during the whole of that time up to the time of his death—I really cannot say what was the matter with him—I was under the impression that he was labouring under secondary symptoms of the venereal disease; his mouth was sore, and the whole of his head was swollen—there were no marks about him that I saw—he was sensible up to his death, at least, up to the evening before his death—he died in the middle watch, on 8th Feb., 15° 20' N. latitude, and 33° 20' W. longitude; it was very wet—I have an entry of the whole (<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>:—"On 2nd July, Rahmet Alli and two others sick; at their own request, gave them a dose of castor oil. (There is a difficulty about getting these men to take medicine, I have had to force them to it; my intention was to give them a dose of salts, but they requested to have castor oil.) On the 3rd, the above men complaining of pains all over, T gave them soap liniment and a dose of salts: on the 4th, they still complaining, ordered them to bathe their feet in hot salt water, they declining to take medicine; on the 5th, the above men sick, gave them soap liniment; on the 6th, the above men sick, gave them a dose of castor oil; on the 7th, two of the men a little better. Rahmet Alli came aft to see if the master could do anything for him; his head was much swollen—gave him a dose of castor oil and vinegar. On 8th Feb., 2 a.m., Rahmet Alli, Lascar seaman, was found dead on deck; the Serang reported that he got up to go on deck, and on returning he fell down dead at the forecastle door; he had lost no flesh; he looked as full of flesh as when alive. He was interred by</p>

               <p>his own shipmates, according to their own religion.") Those entries were all made at the time—there was a complaint made to me about two days before this man died; the man himself complained that the chief officer, and also the second officer, had ill used him—I made inquiries into it at the time—I am quite sure that the man himself came and complained to me, and I called the <hi rend="italic">Burra Tindall</hi> and investigated the matter—the <hi rend="italic">Burra Tindall</hi> I used as an interpreter; he understood the English language perfectly, and could speak it perfectly—I was particular in Calcutta. I requested the shipper of these men to ship me a <hi rend="italic">Tindall</hi> that understood the English language, as my officers did not understand the Bengalee.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 59, Whittlebury-street, Euston-square, and am at present living on my means The prisoner formerly lived under my protection—we separated in the early part or middle of Jan. last—on the night of 7th March, I was at the Scotch Supper-rooms in company with a female—the prisoner came in a few minutes before 12 o'clock—after seeing that I was there she left very quickly, and did not return—I apprehended violence from her, and not wishing to subject the young lady with me to violence, went down stairs, put her into a Hansom's <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> which was drawn up at the door, and immediately got in myself—I saw the prisoner standing by the door of the rooms, between the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and the door; I kept my eye on her, and as the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> was about to start the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, she rushed forward and threw the contents of a phial into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I placed myself before the lady to pro<lb/>tect her or her dress—as I saw the glitter of the phial, I put up my bands to cover my face, and the contents of it went on my gloves and on my cost sleeves, and a trifle on my face—the colour was entirely taken out of my gloves and coat—I was burnt a little on my throat and forehead, and felt a slight tingling sensation; the skin subsequently peeled off—I threw open the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> doors, seized the prisoner, and shouted for the police—I charged her on the spot with throwing corrosive liquid over me; 1 do not recollect clearly what she answered—there was a great crowd and a din of voices.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 23, Little Pulteney-street, Golden-square. On Monday, 7th March, the prisoner came to my shop to purchase some oil of vitriol—I asked her if she was aware it was poison, and for what purpose she wanted it—she said she did not know it was poison, but wanted it for the purpose of cleaning a fender she had purchased, to get the rust off—I supplied her with six drachms of diluted sulphuric acid—I said, "I will write on the label, 'Vitriol—poison;' be careful of it, because if it is taken it will injure any person, or if it is thrown on anybody it will injure them;" I did not mean <hi rend="italic">thrown</hi>, I meant <hi rend="italic">spilt</hi>—I cannot say that this produced is the phial, but the label is the same that I put on, and this phial would contain that quantity—I examined it at the police court, and there was a very slight portion of liquid remaining in it, which I ascertained to be an acid, and I should imagine it to be diluted sulphuric acid—the burns on these gloves would arise from the sprinkling of diluted sulphuric acid upon them—almost any acid would produce them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jeremiah Smith, of No, 4, Apple-yard, Seward-street, Goswell-street; he works at an iron foundry. The prisoner lived in the same house that I did six months—a man used to live with her until Saturday, 5th March; they lived as man and wife, but I am certain he was not her husband—when she first came her habits were very sober and quiet; afterwards, she slowly took to drinking, and followed it up very strongly—for about ten days prior to this matter she had been getting intoxicated almost every day—that was after the man had left her; she was getting tipsy when he left her, but she got worse afterwards—on Friday mowing, 11th March, a knock came to my door; I opened it, and saw the prisoner standing before me with her child in her arms—it was about half past 10 o'clock—she did not speak—the child's face was very dirty; it seemed as if it had been rubbing its hands over its face—J have heard the prisoner say it is fourteen months old—finding she did not speak, I looked at the child and saw blood on its neck, and then I looked and saw a wound on its throat—I said, "Whatever have you done? you have cut your child's throat!"—she did not answer me—I took the child into my own room, and locked the door—the prisoner got hold of the handle of the door, shook it very much, and</p>

               <p>said, "Give me my child! give me my child!"—in a minute or two I went to the door with the child in my arms, called the neighbours in, and at that moment a policeman came up, and I told him the prisoner had cut the child's throat—she was still in the passage—I gave the child up to some one else—I heard the prisoner say at the station house that she intended to destroy herself and the child too—she was drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the carpenters employed by Messrs. Hill and Moore, contractors for the Stratford Extension Railway works, in the parish of West Ham. I know the prisoner; he was one of the carpenters under me—on Monday evening, 28th March, he was employed in one of the sheds of Messrs. Hill and Moore—about half past 6 o'clock, as I was walking down the shed, I saw the prisoner coming down the ladder leading from the shed to the ground with a basket in his hand, which looked heavy—he went towards the railway arch—he did not go out at the gate but got over the wall—I got over the wall twenty yards from him, called him back, and asked him what he had got in the basket; he said he had a few pieces of lead to run a <hi rend="italic">plumb bob</hi> with—that would take from a quarter of a pound up to a pound and a half, not more—I asked him who give Mm leave to take it; he said, "Young Farrow, the plumber's son"—I told him he had no business to take it, and said young Farrow had no business to give him anything—he said he was very sorry, he would take it back; I said I would take care of it myself—I looked inside the basket and found some lead, which turned out at the station to weigh 15 lbs.—I locked it up in the office, and sent the key to Mr. Dollamore, who is here—no one had the least authority to give the prisoner</p>

He lives in High-street, Woolwich—he is a potato-dealer—I am a potato-dealer, and so was my father—on 16th March, at the prosecutor's request, I followed Hicks from near the Dockyard-gate at Deptford to Woolwich; he was driving a horse and cart, with twelve sacks of potatoes—it was covered with a tarpaulin, but I saw the sacks myself at Deptford, and again at Woolwich—he stopped, with his cart, at the door where I live, at Deptford—I was not dressed as I usually was—I knew Hicks—I followed him in the Lower road—as I followed him, I saw biro get on the cart, and raise the tarpaulin, and take potatoes from the full sacks, and place them in an empty sack, which was on the top of the cart—he was engaged in doing so about five minutes—he held the sack with his left hand, and took the potatoes with his right—I was about 200 yards from him—between the Union and the Antigallican I lost sight of him—it was just before he got to the Union that I saw him do what he did—there were fields there, on both sides of the road—when I lost sight of him, I ran, and the cart was stopped at the Antigallican, and Hicks was on the top of the cart, spreading an empty sack—he remained at the Anti-gallican upwards of an hour—I still stayed, and watched; he then proceeded to Woolwich; I saw him arrive, with the cart, at my brother's house—I saw him remove four of the sacks—the first three were good weight, the fourth was upwards of 7 lbs. deficient—a full sack of potatoes ought to weigh a hundred and a half, which is 168 lbs.—they were all weighed by sworn meters—a sack means a certain weight, not what a sack will hold—the first three sacks were full weight—the weights were in the other scale, three half-hundreds and 4 lbs., as the balance of the sack—the fourth sack was upwards of 7 lbs. deficient—a 7 lb. weight was placed in it, and it did not take it down—my brother said to Hicks, "This is a pretty sack of potatoes, is it not; I can dispense with your services, you had better go"—Hicks replied in language not fit to mention.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potato dealer, and live in High street, Woolwich. Hicks was in my employ as carman—on 16th March I went with him to London—about 9 o'clock that morning I had fifteen sacks lying in my shop, close to the street door—I told Hicks to count them—he did, and said there were fourteen—I told him to count them again, and he would find fifteen—he did, and said there were fifteen—he put them into the cart—I went to the tail of the cart, and took one from him, leaving fourteen—I then proceeded towards London—in passing through Deptford, where my brother lives, I called, and spoke to him—I then proceeded to London, but not in my own cart—I went to Beale's-wharf, Mill-lane, Bermondsey—I bought there ten sacks of French potatoes—I saw the whole of the ten sacks weighed, and they were conveyed by the fellowship porters to my cart—Hicks had arrived with my cart, and the potatoes were put into my sacks and weighed—I was on board the vessel, and saw them weighed—I only saw the prisoner take into the cart the last two sacks—each sack weighed three half hundreds, 168 lbs. net—I got two other sacks from the warehouse; and after they were loaded, I told the prisoner to go on, and to call for my great-coat at my grandfather's, at Deptford, where my brother lives—that was in order that my brother might know that he passed—I went home to Woolwich by the train—I was at home some considerable time before Hicks arrived—before the cart was unloaded, my brother came to the shop, and gave me some information—I directed the prisoner to take the potatoes out of the cart and put them on the weighing machine—I put in the opposite scale three half-cwts. and a 4lbs. weight—I was not in the habit of weighing the potatoes when they came home—the first two sacks were red potatoes, which I had at the warehouse, and were full weight; the third, which was one that came from the vessel was full weight; the fourth, which was the second that came from the vessel, was 7lbs. light—I asked him if he did not think that was a pretty sack of potatoes to bring home—I asked him if that was the same he got from London—he said, "Yes," and he began swearing, and abused me—there were two policemen passing by—I went and stated the case to them, and gave him into custody—I and my brother went to the station—when I returned to my shop I saw the remaining sacks of potatoes—the cart had been unloaded—the sacks stood in the centre of the shop—there were eight sacks remaining—I weighed them; they were all deficient in weight, excepting one; they varied from 7lbs. to 9lbs. less than 168lbs.—the sack that was weight was tied; it was what we call a rider—it was laid on the copse of the cart to balance it—that was tied, and that was full weight—I sent Hicks with fourteen sacks to London—this sack produced by the policeman is mine; it is marked with my name.</p>

I recollect on 16th March my husband returning from town, having gone in the morning—to the best of my recollection he returned before Hicks did—I was in the shop when Hicks arrived with a cart of potatoes—my brother-in-law was there—my husband told Hicks to place the sack of potatoes on the balance—I had not seen what weights were placed in the opposite scale—Hicks did place a sack in the balance—I did not see whether it was the right—weight; I was serving a customer—my husband spoke to Hicks; he gave him in charge, and they went away immediately—when they went away, to the best of my recollection, there were eight or nine sacks left in the cart—they were taken from the cart in my presence, and by my wish—a customer of ours chanced to be in the shop—he offered to take them out, and I accepted his offer—they were placed on the balance, one by one, as they came in—they were all short of</p>

G."on it—when Gladwin lifted up the lid he said, "Here they are"—Jenner said, "I do not know anything about them"—Minter said, in the hearing of Jenner, that he wished he had been up, for it would not have happened—he had a fistula on his thumb, and his arm in a sling—I took the potatoes and the sack, and Gladwin took the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Charles John Moakes, who has a warehouse in Great Dover-street, in the parish of Newington. On Saturday night, 26th March, about 11 o'clock, I secured the warehouse with a padlock and two bolts—the counting house leads to the warehouse—it is under the tame roof, next to it—you can go out of one into the other—there is a door between them—I locked the counting house as well—it opens into the passage leading to the back door of the warehouse—I fastened that door with a spring latch, but there is no bolt—that door goes into the passage which leads to the dwelling house, and there is also a door into the street—I fastened two doors with a latch, and the outside door I shut and barred—next morning, between 6 and 7 o'clock I was called up—I examined the premises between 9 and 10 o'clock—I observed the gate of the warehouse which opens into Napier-street—the hasp was forced off, and the padlock was left on the hasp; they could then draw the bolts and get in—the bolts were drawn—I went into the counting house, and missed a cloak, and from the passage a copper coalscuttle, and two bares which were hanging up—the door between the warehouse and the passage was open—I know the prisoner—I saw him on Saturday night, the 26th, from 10 to 11 o'clock, about the premises of the coal shed—Mr. Moakes had got tickets of a charitable institution for Easter; coals are delivered to people, and those who are not able to fetch them pay persons to do so—I believe the prisoner came to take away some coals—I expect he got over the wall, and broke into the counting house first—I found the counting house door open in the morning—it opens with a spring lock, which must have been opened with a latch key—there was a mark as of force on the lock.</p>

Q.</hi> Who do you work for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For Mr. Burnet, of Newington-causeway—I have worked for him fourteen or fifteen months; I have seen the prisoner several times, but know nothing of him—I went to the Prince a few minutes after 12 o'clock, I went to have something to drink—I had come by myself from Salter's beer shop, London-road—there were two or three, strangers to me, standing at the bar when I went in—the prisoner came in afterwards, and two or three others came in with him; I cannot say who they were; he was not the only man I knew, I knew Mr. James—Mr. James did not ask me to become a witness; I came on my own account, nobody asked me to—I heard of it in the public house on a Sunday night or Monday morning, and I said I was in his company—I was not at the Hand-in-Hand on this night—I know that it was a few minutes after 12 o'clock, because I went straight there—the beer shop is 120 or 130 yards from the Prince—the prisoner was not out of my sight above two or three minutes at the outside—he went through a little door into the front parlour, but did not remain more than two or three minutes, at the outside—I did not hear a disturbance going on in another room, there is no other room that I am aware of; there were a few words in the side box in the room where I was—I left the prisoner at the Prince at 25 minutes to 2 o'clock—I am certain of the time, because I looked at the clock when I left—I know nothing of James, and do not know Glover—I had been in James's company before, but was not on that evening to my recollection—I was not in anybody's company—Mr. Clayton himself was serving at the Prince, nobody else—the prisoner was drinking and talking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a zinc worker, of No. 35, Old-street, St. Luke's. On 14th March I was at the Princess, that is the name of the public house; it is at the corner of London-road; James was there with me—I left at the same time as him, at a quarter past 1 o'clock; I cannot say to a minute—we went there about 12 o'clock, and the prisoner came in soon afterwards—during the time I was there I only lost sight of him while he went from one box to another, which was not more than a minute and a half or two minutes.</p>

Q.</hi> The London-road is a long way from Old-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but I formerly lived in Newington, and had acquaintance with Mr. James, and went there to see him, and I went from Mr. Bunyan's, where I first met him, to the Princess—I was with him at the beer shop I should think two hours, I saw the prisoner there, he was standing in the room; I saw him several times take beer from the counter—I went with Mr. James alone, from the beer shop to the Princess, but one or two followed from there who I do not know—I have known the prisoner by seeing him backwards and forwards something like two months—I am not there every night; I have been there twenty times in the last two months; I do a great deal of work there—James is a tailor—I am my own master—I left the Princess about a quarter past 1 o'clock—I know that because I kept looking at the clock, thinking I should be late, being at a distance from home—I know Duffett; I rather think we left him there when we left; I know Glover by sight, but do not know where he lives, he did not leave with us, we left him there—I went straight home from the Princess, leaving the prisoner there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at Brixton Oval. I am a member of the College of Surgeons—I have been in the habit of attending the late Mr. Jones medically for the last eighteen years—I have known the prisoner for that time—she lived in the house as his housekeeper for about thirteen or fourteen years—on 10th Jan. last I was called to Mr. Jones's house about half past 5 o'clock in the morning by Evans—I did not get there till a little after 8 o'clock—will you allow me to explain why I did not go before, as observations have been made about my being so long in going? I was sent for to another patient, who died that morning, and I could not get there before—I found Mr. Jones in the back parlour, lying on his back on the sofa; he was quite dead—he had his usual dress on, except his coat—I am not quite sure whether he had his coat on, I think not—I saw the prisoner there—she was in the room when I came in—I asked her some questions about his death—she said he died about half past 3 o'clock—I asked what time be had been down—she said he was lying there all the night—I said, "Why not get him to bed?"—she said he was so helpless the night before that she could not get him up to bed, and he requested her to sit up with him, which she did; that he lay on the sofa till about half past 3 o'clock; that she gave him a little water, and immediately upon giving him that he died—I asked her what time he came down on the Sunday, the day previous—she seemed to be unable to tell me, till at last I found that he came down about 4 o'clock on the Sunday afternoon, that he had his dinner in bed, and came down after dinner, and that he had not gone up stairs again—I asked her if he made any noise, any snoring, or any symptom of apoplexy—she said no—I asked if he had said anything—she said he asked her for some water—I said, "Did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040130"/>
               <p>be say nothing more?"—it was a very confused account that she gave me—I did not make any further inquiry with regard to his state during the night—I do not remember asking as to his being insensible or not—by his asking for the water I considered he was sensible—I then proceeded to make an examination of the body—I examined the whole of it externally—I saw several bruises on the head, principally the right temple, and one at the back part of the head—they were contusions, not wounds; the skin was not broken—there were several marks on the top of the head and slight abrasions of the skin, but the two principal ones were the one on the right temple and the one at the back of the head (<hi rend="italic">pointing out their position</hi>)—there were also two on the forehead—they were old affairs—I mean they might have been done ten days or a fortnight before—among the bruises I saw, some appeared to have been inflicted a longer time than others—those on the forehead were the remains of former bruises—the contusion on the right temple might have been done within a week, or it might have been done within much less time—that at the back of the head might have been done within five or six days, or a week, or it might have been done very recently—it was rather more puffy than the one on the temple, rather more swollen—that would lead me to believe that it had been done a shorter time than the other—this was my opinion from viewing the wounds externally—there was also another wound on the lower part of the middle cartilage of the nose, that part which divides the nostrils—I cannot say it was broken, but it was in a state of ulceration—I cannot say whether that was from a fall or a blow-—it had been done a longer time, I should think—the septum of the nose was ulcerated—that might have been from violence, or be might have had a fall—the ulceration might have been caused by violence or by a fall—what I mean is, I do not think it was done by disease—that injury must have been done more than a fortnight, it was not of recent occurrence—there was a bruise on the right knee, and an appearance as I thought of a burn on the left knee—the injury on the right knee might have occurred from a fall on the knee or the side of the knee—it might have been produced by his falling on his knee—it was a very slight bruise, there was very little appearance of it—I think those were all the external injuries that I observed—I afterwards proceeded to make an internal examination of the head—on taking off the scalp I found a number of patches of extravasation on the right side of the head, corresponding with the external bruise on the right temple, and effusion of blood—the extravasation was on the scalp, under the bruise—the effusion was inside the head—the patches of extravasated blood were outside the head, beneath the scalp, between the scalp and the bone, and the effusion was inside the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is effusion of blood different from extravasation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Extravasation is a small effusion, and when it is in a large quantity then it is called effusion—that was at the same side as the bruise on the left temple.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HODSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the blood that was effused there immediately in contact with the brain or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because there was the membrane between—I found effusion of blood between the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, which is the external covering of the brain, I should think to the extent of an ounce and a half or two ounces—that amount of blood in that position would cause a pressure on the brain, and that pressure would be sufficient to cause death—the substance of the brain itself, independent of the pressure, was perfectly healthy—it is possible, notwithstanding that pressure, that he might continue to have his senses down to the act of death, or within a few minutes of death; because it does not follow that the effusion took place immediately upon the violence used; I mean it might have accumulated gradually.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you have any conversation with the prisoner about what you found in the internal examination, or about the bruises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Upon being asked about the nose, she explained that he had fallen on the stairs, and that he was always falling about; that he had a fall in the garden—I think she said the fall on the stairs was a long time ago—I do not know that she said when it was that he fell in the garden—I had seen Mr. Jones about two months before; he was then perfectly well in health; I did not observe any bruises about him at that time; I had on previous occasions; about the beginning of Aug., last year—except being subject to the gout, I should say he was a perfectly healthy man—I saw him about the first weeek in Aug., about the 7th or 8th Aug.—I then observed that he had some bruises on his face—the prisoner was present when I saw him in Aug.—I asked him, in her presence, how he came by the bruises—she said, "Don't tell him," and he did not answer me—she was very abusive to me—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted, that what occurred in August could have no bearing upon an inquiry into the cause of death in January.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">suggested, that the evidence should be confined to that which was connected with the cause of death, and to that which had a tendency to show a malicious motive.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated, that it was upon the latter ground that the evidence was tendered</hi>)—she was very abusive to me for speaking to Mr. Jones—when I asked Mr. Jones how he came by those bruises, she said, "Don't tell him;" and she said, "I have got the money, and you told Mr. Jones not to do it"—I told her that I had given Mr. Jones conscientious advice—I had given Mr. Jones advice about money—I think I had had conversation with the prisoner before, on the subject of Mr. Jones's money, but not upon that individual point, the transfer of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I said I bad given him conscientious advice, she said that she had got the money, and that I had advised Mr. Jones not to do it—she went on for about an hour—it was mere personal abuse—if I was to give you the whole of the conversation, you would think I was casting ridicule on the Court—her conduct towards me was more from a personal quarrel, that I had advised Mr. Jones not to do this—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE ERLE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">thought this personal altercation could not be relevant; the evidence was not pursued</hi>)—I produce the probate of the will of the late Mr. Jones—I am the executor under it—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HODSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that the will was dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1850, <hi rend="italic">and that the prisoner was made residuary legatee</hi>)—I think I had seen Mr. Jones once or twice since Aug.; I have been to the house once or twice; I have not always seen him when I have been; sometimes I could not get in; that was previous to Aug., from May to Aug.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you made this will? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did—I made it myself, with the knowledge of the prisoner—she did not send for me to make it—Mr. Jones first spoke to me about it—at the time I was called in to make the will, she was his only attendant, she did not say anything about making the will—Mr. Jones spoke to me about it; I went to make the will by the appointment of Mr. Jones—she was not present when I was making it; I made it at my own house—the first time Mr. Jones spoke to me about making the will was seven or eight years ago—the will I made was upon the instructions that he gave me seven or eight years ago—the present will was not made upon those instructions—he gave me fresh instructions, not renewing those of seven or eight years ago in every point, because he altered it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe he felt it due to you to leave you 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I duly inserted that in the will, assuredly—will you allow me to state what he first said about the will?—I did not draw it at my own house, and then take it to him</p>

               <p>to be executed; I drew it at my own house, and took it to him to look over it; and when he had read it, I told him to bring it down to my house, and he should execute it—he did bring it down to my house—nobody came with him, he came by himself—I had not told him to come by himself, nor suggested that he had better not bring Mrs. Vickers with him—he came alone, as he had always done previously—I have drawn many wills before; I have drawn the will of a person dying of cholera when an attorney was not to be found—no attorney was present at the drawing of this will, nor any one on Mr. Jones's behalf; I am no relation of his, only an old friend—it was in Aug. last that the prisoner's abuse of me took place; she did not refer to the legacy that I had left to myself; not at all—that was not a part or a principal part of the abuse; it was not referred to—I only wanted to know how he got those black eyes—she did not say a word to me about how I got the legacy—I think the prisoner had lived with Mr. Jones in his wife's lifetime; I think she came to him before his wife died, I am not quite sure—she died in 1838—the prisoner had been in attendance upon Mr. Jones from 1838—he had no domestic servant except her—she had to perform all the offices of the house, and to attend to him, and to all his wants—he suffered from chalk stones, that arises from gout—they ulcerated, especially about the heels and hands—that would render him extremely feeble—he might be liable to tumble if left alone; I cannot say that he would not tumble down; still it did not impede his walking very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should you, as a medical man, leave a patient of yours, of eighty years of age, and upwards, with ulcerated chalk stones, to walk about by himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, he could walk by himself, and walk very well—you ask me would I leave him alone; and I say I should not have had the least hesitation in leaving him alone—he could walk about alone—I certainly should not have the least hesitation in leaving a patient of mine in Mr. Jones's state to walk about alone—he could come down to my house—he has been to my house much within a year and a half ago—he might have come down alone once or twice within the last two years—I cannot tell you any time at which be came—I should say he has come to my house alone within the last two years—I have no doubt that he might; but I cannot say—I cannot say positively—if I could remember the date I could swear to it—he often used to come in when he was passing—when I saw him at his own house in October, he walked up and down stairs, and walked about very well—I would not undertake to swear that he walked down to my house within the last two years, not without being able to give you a date—I should say that within these two years he was fully competent to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Nobody asked you that—you are asked for a fact—you say you should say he has come to your house within two years—the learned counsel has asked you to carry back your recollection, and collect your thoughts, and then asks if you are certain of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect from any particular circumstance that he was there within two years—he was at my house at the date of the will—that I can swear—and that is not much above two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did any other gentleman besides yourself make a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, or assist? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My brother went with me—he is not here—he did assist me, but not with his medical knowledge—he is a student—there was an ulceration of the cartilage of the nose; the cartilage was entirely gone—that would not be from defective circulation—I never saw a case of ulceration ensuing from a slight scratch in old persons, in consequence of a languid circulation—I cannot say it might not exist—that had nothing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040133"/>
               <p>at all to do with his death—there were bruises on the forehead—they had nothing to do with his death—there was an extravasation of blood between the bone and the scalp, a bruise on the right temple, and one at the back of the head—there was extravasation there, in the scalp, but not in the head—I cannot say that that had nothing to do with the death—there was extravasation under the scalp; but there was no effusion in the head—the contusion at the back of the head might have caused death, from concussion only—there might be concussion without any mark at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What I want to get at is, not a speculation about concussion, but whether there was any blood, connected with that bruise, which was in any way whatever connected with his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no effusion from that contusion at the back of the head that would cause death; but he might have had concussion—I do not mean to say that that bruise had nothing to do with his death—it possibly might, by concussion—if there had been no effusion at all in the head, I should have said he died from the effects of concussion—concussion does not cause blood at all—if vessels get full and burst, that it not concussion—concussion does cause that—I do not know that apoplexy is constantly caused by concussion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have spoken of two blows on the forehead which might have caused concussion; was there any difference between the blow at the back of the head and the two on the forehead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most assuredly; the one at the back of the head appeared more extensive, it is a more important part of the head—a blow there would be more likely to shake a person—there was no effusion of blood there, still he might have died from the effects of that blow—I suppose that bruise at the back of the head had existed, it might have been, three or four days—not so much as a week or ten days; four or five days was the utmost—concussion would cause insensibility at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">IS</hi> that your mind?" The blow at the back of the head was within four or five days; if death had been caused from this blood from concussion, immediate insensibility would have followed the blow;" is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but the effusion might have taken place in much less time than three or four days, it is impossible to say—I say the bruise could not have been caused longer than five or six days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I rightly reporting what you have said, that if that had caused concussion five or six days before, insensibility would have supervened immediately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Supposing it bad been done that time—if it had been within a few hours of his death it would have had the same appearance as if it was four or five days before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, whenever it occurred, there would have been insensibility from the time of its occurrence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the man might recover from the effects of concussion in a few hours—if he died of it, he would not recover—a man when he becomes insensible from a blow, may recover, or he may die in a few minutes—with respect to the blow on the right temple, I not only found extravasation beneath the skin, but effusion on the brain—that was quite sufficient to account for the death, if there had been no other blow; and supposing I had seen no other bruise than that on the back of the head, I should have said, "This man died from concussion," because it left nothing at all behind it—if I also found effusion of blood, I should say either one or the other caused death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the least doubt in the world that death was caused by effusion of blood from the blow on the right temple? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that death was caused by violence; he might have died from the effect of concussion—I have not the least doubt that the quantity of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040134"/>
               <p>blood I found effused on the brain would cause death; I say it was quite sufficient to cause it; or he might have died from the effects of concussion from the blow at the back of the head—there was sufficient evidence of the blood effused on the brain having caused death, I firmly believe that that was the cause of death; or it might be the effect of the blow at the back; it is impossible for me to say which of the two blows caused it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I must have an answer to my question in the form in which I put it. Do you, as a medical man, believe that death was caused by the effusion of blood on the brain; you must have some belief, surely? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was evidence enough of it, I can say no more—there was quite sufficient to account for death—I can only answer your question as I did just now; it was either from that, or the effect of concussion—I should say there was quite evidence enough that it did cause it—I believe that the effusion of blood was occasioned by the blow on the right temple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear a man of the name of Collins examined before the Coroner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Collins was examined before the Coroner—I heard him examined—I think I was in the room at the time he gave his evidence—I do not think I have any doubt about it—I am not quite sure—I have no doubt I was in the room at the time he was examined—I do not think I said, after hearing what Collins said, "This will account for his death."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">considered it admissible</hi>)—I have no doubt I heard Collins examined; according to my belief I was in the room at the time, I dare say I was—I think I heard him examined—I was out of the room a good many times—I should say I did hear him examined—well, I say yes—I was in the room at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And directly he was examined, did you not say "This fully accounts for the death?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not use those words—Collins was speaking of the deceased having a fall in the garden—the Coroner wanted to know whether that might have been the effect of a fall—I do not remember making use of that observation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whatever you may have said touching Collins' evidence was it, or not, in answer to a question put to you by the Coroner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was from the Coroner.</p>

HODSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Areyoustill of opinion that the bruise on the temple may have been produced by a fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might; and so might the bruise at the back of the head—I should think, I should rather say, that the effusion of blood was the immediate cause of death; it is impossible to say whether he might have died from the effects of the blow producing concussion, or whether he might have died from effusion; he might have died from the effects of effusion, or he might have died instantly from concussion—not having seen him alive it is a very difficult thing to say—the concussion would not have caused death through effusion of blood, merely from the depression of the vital power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person to have had an injury on the right temple, which caused a congestion of the vessels in the interior of the head underneath it, but not an actual effusion of blood, and then a blow on the back of the head, might that blow at the back of the head have caused an effusion underneath the temple? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I t possibly might; a blow on one side of the head will produce effusion on the other side—the blow at the back of the head might have been the cause of the effusion on the brain under the temple, but I can<lb/>not say that it was; it is impossible to say—it probably, in my judgment, arose from the blow on the temple—the blow on the back was the more recent—the bruise on the temple might have been received, and might injure the parts, and yet effusion not immediately follow—in that case I think a subsequent blow at the back of the head would be likely to produce the effusion—effusion might take place gradually, or it might not—-a subsequent blow would still further lacerate the vessels, and cause effusion to take place immediately, so that it might have been possible that he may have gone for a few days and not become insensible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, attached to University College Hospital. I have heard from Mr. Key a description of the injury said to have been received by the deceased on the right temple, and the appearance of the head, on <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, having an extravasation of about an ounce or an ounce and a half of blood pressing on the brain—I have also heard a description of the puffy wound at the back of the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person to have received, either by accident or design, a blow or injury on the temple, and to have remained for some time after in a state of consciousness, and after death to have presented the appearances that Mr. Key has described in this case, in your judgment is it probable that the first injury on the temple might have congested the vessels of the brain, and that a subsequent blow or injury might have caused a lesion, and so a suffusion of blood on the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it probable that a blow on the right temple at a previous period would render a man more likely to suffer from a second blow, and to suffer more severely than if no such previous blow had taken place—I do not enter into a physiological explanation, but so far as the facts are concerned, I think a previous blow would render a man more likely to suffer severely from a second blow, and in a different part of the head—a blow on the temple, not followed by such a suffusion of blood as to cause insensibility, would be likely to be followed by a highly congested state of the vessels—I think the vessels of the head in that congested state would be more likely to be ruptured by a subsequent-blow, even of a slight character, than if they were in a state of health—I think a subsequent blow in any part of the head might have that effect—it would be more likely than under any other circumstances; anything that increased the circulation would have a tendency to produce extravasation in the part.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it not repudiate the notion of concussion producing the death, the result of the blow behind, when you imagine it possible that the blow behind might have produced the effusion that was found under the scalp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The two suppositions of course could not exist at the same time, though they are not incompatible—they are incompatible, but they are allowable as suppositions—I never saw the body—I think it would be highly dangerous for me to take on myself to say what caused the death, and I should not wish to undertake to do so—I think the circumstances detailed by Mr. Key render it impossible to say what was the cause of death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>found no other cause; I should say, in all probability that did cause it—if the general appearance of the body was healthy, I should say the very strong probability would be that the cause of death was injury to the head; I would not say what injury, but seeing a number of bruises external and internal, unless I saw the patient during life, I could not say what was the cause of death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a single woman, residing at No. 5, Springfield cottages, Acre-lane, Brixton. I have lived there more than fourteen years; before Mr. Jones came—I lived next door to Mr. Jones, and was in the habit of seeing him daily—I remember his coming to me on New Year's day—he came to the garden fence, which is a low fence, between my house and his—on his coming to the fence, I saw that he had a large bruise, a large lump on the right temple, about the size of a walnut—and just above that there was a large wound on the right side of his head, about the size of a moderate sized teacup, as though the flesh and hair were cut off it—it was bleeding—it appeared as though it had been inflicted about a day and a half—blood was issuing from it—I observed nothing on the left side of the temple—I observed nothing more on that occasion with respect to his appearance—he appeared in good health and cheerful, he was quite jocular with me—formerly I saw him daily—before New Year's day I saw him only about once in two or three weeks—I have seen him frequently at the fence, and sometimes at the side door—he would have to walk from his house to my fence not so far as from this rail to that corner (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the rail of the witness box and the corner opposite</hi>)—he walked without support—he was able to walk some distance about the garden, and run if occasion required—I last saw him before 1st Jan. at the door—I had not seen him in the garden with the prisoner for a long time before that—I should say the last time I saw him in the garden with her was about six months ago—after New Year's day the prisoner came to me—I recollect when she spoke to me about some money—it was last spring—she told me that Mr. Jones had promised to make over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to her, but that Mr. Key had prevented his doing so, but that she had defeated Mr. Key, for she had got it done, and as soon as the breath was out of Mr. Jones's body she could go to the Bank and take the money—she said she was tired of waiting for an old man, and then she would get married to a young one—she said that she would make Mr. Jones remember going from his promise as long as he lived—nothing more passed on that occasion—she has repeatedly come again to me, and spoken upon that matter since then—on the Thursday before his death she did so—she said she was tired of her job, and should be glad to get rid of it, that was, waiting on Mr. Jones—she then said he would never go where he had been the Thursday before—that was to take an annuity—I said to her, "Why, Elizabeth, you alarm me by saying so"—I said, "Is Mr. Jones ill? because if he is, and you want assistance, call me, and I will come at any time; I will fetch Mr. Key or any other doctor you choose"—she said, "Oh, no, he is very well, but I shall know where to come to if I want assistance; but I tell you he will never go where he was last Thursday, though he eats and drinks very well; but I shall be glad to get rid of my job," and she then went in doors—this was all at one time, on the Thursday previous to his death—I heard of his death on Monday morning, 10th Jan.—on the Friday before his death I remember the prisoner coming to the house—it was a little after 11 o'clock at night—I was near the fence I have been speaking of, close to the house, very near the front door, Mr. Jones's side door—I was looking out, and saw her lying on the ground, near the door—she was very much intoxicated—she</p>

               <p>said had she been at borne when Mr. Key was there, and Mr. Jones let him in, she would have kicked him out—when she said this she addressed a policeman, who was standing over her—I do not know his name—the policeman was nearer than I, because he was by her—he was speaking to her—she said if she had been at home when Mr. Jones let Mr. Key in she would have kicked, him out, and if she had been at home when the police came in she would have kicked them out; and she was calling out, "Old Jones, let me in, let me in!" repeatedly—after lying there about half an hour the door opened, and was immediately shut again; as the door opened I could not see who it was inside—the policeman was there at that time, entreating. her to get up and go in—she did not go in then—when the door opened I did not hear any one speak—the policeman endeavoured to get her up for a long time—she said no, she would not go in while he was there—the policeman said, "We do not want to go in, I want to get you up to get you in;" but are could not prevail upon her to get up—then he withdrew for a short time—he went to the end of the house, and looked towards the gate, and saw several persons standing there—he then came back to the door, and assisted her up—the door then opened, and she went in—I could not see who was inside the door—the door was not latched, it was put to—she went in, and the door fell to—the door opens inside—I cannot tell who opened it—it was opened by a person inside; but I cannot say who, and then the door shut to—in a few minutes after the door shut to, I heard a heavy fall in the passage—it was the fall of a person—I heard no words—the stairs are not above three feet, I should say, from the door—the staircase is quite straight—the fall appeared to be as though a person bad fallen on the stairs—after this I left, and went to my bedroom—-my bedroom is so situated that I could hear what passed in the room, if there were, anything like words, or anything of that kind—I heard no noise before I went to bed—I went to bed immediately—that was 20 minutes to 12—I heard nothing till 7 o'clock the next morning (Saturday)—I then heard the door shut—the side door of Mr. Jones's house, which I had seen fall to the night before—I got up about 8 o'clock, and found the house closed—by the side door I mean the same door she got in at the night before—the shutters were shut back and front, and the blinds all drawn—I had only seen the house so before on one occasion; that was somewhere in the autumn—on Saturday the house was closed the whole of the day—during that day I saw the prisoner at 1 o'clock—I saw her come out at the side door, go to the front of the house, and give some musicians that were playing some money and some drink, and they then went away—I went out to meet her to ask how Mr. Jones was, fearing he was ill, and she avoided me—she walked in very fast, finding I was going to speak to her—she shut the door after her—I did not see her any more that day—I went to bed as usual—I did not hear anything on the Saturday night—I frequently listened at the house to hear if I could hear Mr. Jones; he was accustomed to cough frequently—on that Saturday night I heard no cough, or any noise whatever the whole night—I was awake at different parts of that night, I am frequently up during the whole of the night, attending to my afflicted father; he was then ill, and that accounts for my being awake—I did not see the prisoner again on Sunday morning—at 9 o'clock on Sunday morning the postman came as usual with newspapers, he came into my garden, and threw two over the fence at the back door—they remained there till 11 o'clock—the house at that time was closed, the same as on Saturday, the whole day; but I think I had better tell you what occurred on the Sunday—I left at 11 o'clock to go to church, and listened then to hear if I could hear Mr. Jones</p>

I will kick the life out of you;" and then she kicked him, and he fell down and groaned, and cried most bitterly—then she says, "Now come, get up, get up;" and she still kept hitting him and beating him—I could hear that it was with a heavy stick, as well as kicking him—I heard her say she would kick him, and kick the life out of him—then she says, "Come, get up, get up on the sofa. for I want to go out again"—I did not hear Mr. Jones speak after that, but she went out shortly after.</p>

               <p>not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was about showing himself out, because she had for many months kept him shut in, not allowing him to go out—she did not know of his seeing me; that, poor man, he did in her absence—she would not let him go out if she knew of it—this occurred the night after he was so jocular with me—I saw him about 3 o'clock, and this occurred at 5 o'clock—this was not the means by which he got the wound I have spoken of—he had that wound before—nobody was with me when I heard all this, I was outside—Mr. Jones had told me that he feared he should be a murdered man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you think it worth while to go and prevent his being murdered at 5 o'clock that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, Sir, I had been told that unless I heard him cry "Murder!"I could not have the house entered—I have heard that from several persons—I had inquired, and learned that unless he called "Murder!" I must not go in, and the police had not power to enter the house till "Murder!" was called, and Mr. Key had told me to call "Murder!" and "Police!" and then I should have some one in—I know Mr. Key as a neighbour, nothing more—he said that in my presence—it was when Mr. Jones was showing his bruises to Mr. Key, and Mr. Key wished to take him away and place him in apartments, fearing what would be the end, from what Mr. Jones had told him—I mean to swear it was from what Mr. Jones had told him—it was from being told that I could not go into the house without hearing "Murder!" called that I did not interfere on that occasion—that was the reason, or I should have done it—that was the reason why I did not call the police, or interfere—I was at the fence when I heard Mr. Jones beaten, the garden fence, close by his parlour window, between the two houses—he was being beaten in the back parlour—I was very near the parlour window.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not knock at the window, or break it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was broken, and that was the reason I heard it all so plainly—I state facts to you—persons have been to the house when he was being beaten, and could not get in—I did not look in at the window because the blind was drawn—I noticed that—I did not try to get in—I could not look through the blind—I tried to look through the window—I did not touch the blind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not move aside the blind, and see what was doing; if there is one word of truth in what you have sworn, why not have screamed out to your neighbours and called attention to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew they were about taking him away; means were being used to take him away, and I was to tell Mr. Key of all that occurred—whenever I heard the beating I was to tell Mr. Key, but I did not tell of that till after his death—it was not in my power to extricate him—I was watching for the purpose of telling Mr. Key—the reason I did not interfere at that moment was because I intended letting Mr. Key know, in case they had the power to do something—if I could have seen him out of the house, I should have dragged him down to Mr. Key's house—I had seen him that afternoon, but this dreadful beating was afterwards—he had a bruise when I saw him in the afternoon—it was a wound—I had then made up my mind when I saw him again to take him to Mr. Key's—if he had called "Murder!" I should have gone to the police—the only reason why I did not go the police was because he did not cry "Murder!"—this beating continued for about half an hour from the beginning to the end—I was standing at the paling—his groaning was at the last—I was at the fence then—I did not attempt to look through the hole in the window, because the blind was drawn—I never called anybody's attention to it—I intended to—I have frequently heard him beaten, and he has come to me afterwards—I am sure it was a stick that I heard him beaten with—he must</p>

               <p>have had a good many blows—the first blow I heard appeared as though it was on the face; that appeared with the hand, after that she used the stick—I think it was a broomstick; there was scarcely a broom in the house but the handles were broken off—I have since understood that they were broken off in this way—when the door has been open I have seen long brooms without handles, and one I know was purchased, she told me so herself, not a long time back—I thought at the time it was a broomstick—all the brooms are broken—I have seen them standing there when the door has been left open—I have very little doubt they were broken about Mr. Jones's head, from hearing him beaten—months back I heard him beaten with a small stick like a cane, but since Christmas it has been with a broomstick—not a day since Christmas but he has been beaten with a very heavy weapon—I heard her beating him on this occasion I should say pretty nearly half an hour—I heard blows of different kinds—I should say nearly half that time she was beating him with the broomstick—I have not a doubt it was a quarter of an hour—it was not gently, but very heavy—she seemed to be doing it as hard as she could, it sounded like it—I could hear it was blows falling on a person, and I heard him say "Don't, don't 1 oh, don't! oh, don't!" several times—I had no doubt what was going on—I did not interfere because I knew it was Mr. Key's intention to take him away, and I knew his nephews would take him away as soon as they could get him outside of the house—they have been repeatedly to take him away, and the door has been shut in their face, and she would not let them enter, and I was looking for them to come to put an end to this—I did not expect them to come at that moment. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But <hi rend="italic">do</hi> not you see, here is an old man, eighty-three years of age, being beaten in a way that must have soon killed him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> And I have heard him beaten quite as much as that, and seen him the next day with black eyes; I have seen him with three bruises on his head at the same time, therefore I hoped I should see him again, and I was in hopes of seeing a policeman to take him away to Mr. Key, the executor—I could not do it—my father was in my house at the time, nobody else, I am sure of that—this is a retired neighbourhood, there are not many persons passing; where we live it is very retired—a gardener lives in the next house, his name is Conolly—I did not knock at his door—they are people that have not interfered in the business—I should have let Mr. Key know—the Conollys bad not the power to take him away; that is what I mean; they had not the power to interfere in the business any more than I had; it was the executor and the nephews that could interfere, I could not—I had a very good reason for not speaking to Conolly—he is no more than a private individual—it had been the opinion of the neighbourhood for a long time that Mr. Jones would be found murdered; but they said Mr. Key and the relations were about to interfere, and they would not do anything in it—I knew, that without bearing, "Police!" or "Murder!" cried, Conolly could not have had the house entered any more than me; and then he is very deaf, that he could not have heard it if I had called him—I feel persuaded he could not have heard Mr. Jones, he is too deaf; he might have heard me, but I dare say he would not have gone upon what I said; he must hear himself, to go before a Magistrate or to the police—I do not think he could have heard Mr. Jones—I did not think of that at the time, it is your speaking of it makes me say it—Miss Hammond lives at No, 3—she is not deaf—she has no servant—I did not think of knocking them up; I did not know them at that time—during the whole of this half hour I did not see a person pass by—I think I should have seen them if they bad; it was dusk; I cannot tell you anything</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. In Jan. last I went to live at No. 8, Springfield-cottages—that is the house immediately adjoining the one where Mr. Jones lived—-a brick wall separates the two—you can hear in one house any noise in the other—I remember hearing of Mr. Jones's death on the morning of the 10th—on the Sunday night before that Monday I slept in the back parlour, which is even with Mr. Jones's sitting room—I was awoke about 8 o'clock, or from that to half past 3 o'clock in the morning, by a heavy fall—it appeared as if he had either fallen out of his chair, or off his couch in the back parlour—I did not hear more than one fall, and after that there was quite a dead silence—I had not heard anything before the fall—the dead silence continued not more than a few minutes—I then heard some one go out of the house—it appeared as if it was to get some assistance—in the course of the night I heard the deceased's voice—it was very trifling indeed, no more than saying,"Eh, what?"—whether it was him or no I could not say—I could not distinguish whether it was his voice or no—I knew his voice he was very hard of hearing—I had gone to bed about half past 10 o'clock, or from that to 11 o'clock; I was awoke by the fall—I did not hear anything between the time of my going to bed and the fall—before I went to bed I heard a very great deal of angry talking—I heard it the whole of the Sunday evening, from 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I heard that Vickers was talking to some one there—I heard no one answer, except, "Eh! what doyousay?" and "Eh! what?"—I heard that from 4 o'clock till the time I went to bed—there was a great deal of angry talking—I could distinguish Vickers' voice—I could not say that I distinctly heard what she said—yon may hear angry talk, but may not distinguish what the words are—the voice that said, "Eh! what?" appeared to me the way in which Mr. Jones generally answered—I heard some one talking to Vickers up stairs on the Sunday; I cannot say it was him—that was even with the bedroom that I was in—the front room first floor—I heard Vickers talking to some other person in that room from 8 to half past 4 o'clock in the afternoon—there was a great deal of angry talk up stairs, and then they came down into the back room, ground floor, the room adjoining the one where I slept.</p>
