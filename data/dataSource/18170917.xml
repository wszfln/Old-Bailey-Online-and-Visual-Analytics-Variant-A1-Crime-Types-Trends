On Sunday, the 1st of December, the prisoner went out about one o'clock, after dinner - I did not see him again. Ayres went out about six o'clock in the evening, leaving me and Howard at home-we were sitting by the fire in the kitchen, on the ground-floor. I sat with the door at my side, and Howard sat opposite me, facing the door; I had lit the candle for him to light his pipe. I heard the door either pushed open or unlatched, thinking it was Ayres, I said, "is it you, Tom?" The moment I spoke I received a violent blow on my head, and also several other blows, which stunned me, but never saw any body. I heard Howard groaning violently - He was in the ninety-first year of his age. I do not know what passed afterwards. When I came to myself the prisoner, Bond, spoke to me; but I do not know how long it was after I had received the blows. The prisoner used to receive Howard's dividends, and pay them to him, and Howard used to put the money into a private drawer in his bureau, and keep the key in his purse in his right hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. The prisoner is the son of Howard's daughter; he had lived with his grandfather ever since he was twenty-two years of age - He used to manage his affairs, Howard told him he had left him in his will 200l. I afterwards heard him say he meant to alter it to 400l. 3 per cents. Howard died the next day; he was not sensible after I heard him groan. The prisoner never wanted money. Howard offered to pay him his wages, and he said he did not want them yet. The prisoner generally went out after dinner and returned about seven o'clock.</p>

            , we then went to the Trunk public-house, which is a short distance from the house; as we returned we met a man coming in a direction from the house - I called to him, that he had missed his way - He went away towards the bridge, through some water-he passed about ten yards from me. About a quarter before seven o'clock the prisoner came into the public-house, and said,"for God's sake come, for somebody has killed Sarah and the old man!" Several of us, who were in the public-house, went to the house with the prisoner, we there found the old lady and gentleman in their chairs, they could not speak - They were both very bloody; the blood ran out of the old gentleman's mouth and nose, and there was a great deal of blood on the floor. The prisoner got some brandy, and rubbed the old man's temples, he said,"Don't, John, it is so cold;" he left off and helped him up stairs to bed. I never heard him speak afterwards. I went for the doctor. When I first came into the house a man brought a swingle into the kitchen, this was on the bacon-rack - A person could see it if he looked up to the ceiling when he came into the kitchen; the prisoner knew it was kept there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. The prisoner sent me for the doctor. The lane where I met the man leads to Howard's house, and no where else; a person in that lane must be either going to, or coming from his house-he was coming from the house, and walked through the water to avoid us; there was a board over the water as a bridge, he must have passed us to go over it. The prisoner set up the whole night with Howard, and went several miles after a man who was suspected to have committed the murder.</p>

On the 1st of December, 1816, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was at the deceased's house, the prisoner asked me to go and search the bureau; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170004"/>him where the key and padlock were; I found them inside the bureau, which had been broken open-the prisoner found it there-it had not been opened with the key; I searched it as well as I could; but I have seen it since, and find there is a secret drawer which I did not search. I did not discover that I had not searched it all until August last, when the bureau had been sold.</p>

            . I am twelve years of age. On the 26th of July, 1816, the prisoner came into my bedroom after I had been in bed about an hour (he was Mr. Jones's servant, and lived in the house), he said he would kill me if I did not tell him where my mother kept her money; I said I did not know; he then said he would force the drawers open. I said nothing to him about drawers - He had a hammer and a chisel in his hand; I saw him open one of the drawers with them, in my room, and take a piece of paper out of my mother's purse, which I thought was a 1l. note; I also saw him take two watches out of my mother's drawers, I saw him do it as I laid in bed; he took the drawer out, put it on a chair, and took my mother's keys out into Mr. Jones's room, which was the next room. Before he went out of my room, I said I knew there were some persons about the house - He said he had killed my brother. I had a little brother in the house. He went into the next room, which was Mr. Jones's, and I immediately heard a hammering, as if he was breaking open something, after that he went to the door, I heard somebody talking, but I heard no more of him. There is a door that leads out of my room into Mr. Jones's. When Houghton came home, I told her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I was frightened, I did not attempt to get under the clothes, I screamed out. The drawers fronted my bed. I told my mother when she came home; when I got up I saw the keys which he took out of the drawers lying on the table by the desk. I am sure the prisoner is the man, I used to see him every day.</p>

The shop street - door was only bolted at the bottom, they are folding-doors - They were bolted at the top the night before; any person could bolt those bolts when outside; by slamming the doors they would fall into the holes. The wire-guard over the skylight in the back-parlour, was taken up, and a pane of glass taken out; there were marks of feet, as if they had come down that way.</p>

On the 15th of August I took the prisoner into custody in Rupert-street; he said he had slept in the Park the night before - He had only 1s. 6d. about him; he said he had paid a man in the room twelve shillings; I asked him where he got it; he said he received a 1l. note from Mr. Baynam, No. 8, Little Nelson-street, City-road. I took Mr. Baynam to him, and the prisoner said he had the money of him; Mr. Baynam said, "I cannot admit that, for if I say so, I must swear to it." He then said he knew he had told me an untruth, but he had received 3l. from a woman who was now married to a publican over Blackfriars Bridge, that she had lived two years with Mr. Brand, and her name was Mary; he could not say where she lived, or what her name was now. On the Monday following I found a pair of stockings on his legs with the tops cut off, which Mrs. Nicholay claimed.</p>

I told the elder, and was set to watch; the next morning I saw the prisoner come with a great coat under his arm; he went immediately to the spot, took the tea out, and wrapped it up in his great coat - He began running, I told him it was useless to run for I knew him, and gave the alarm-Hardy stopped him. I took the bag of tea from him.</p>

I immediately felt my watch drawn out of my fob; I laid hold of Dixon, and told her I had lost my watch, and she was the cause of it. Rowland passed me very quickly, and joined his companion. I took Dixon to the watch-house. I described the man to Collingwood, and he said, "it must be Rowland." I am sure he is the man. Dixon said it was not Rowland, but she knew who it was.</p>

About a quarter after nine o'clock, I heard a cry of stop thief; I ran up and met the prisoner running towards me in the road; I tried to lay hold of him, he struck me on the head, I struck him on the back and seized him. Just as as I had got hold of him a person came behind and struck me on the nose - I kept my hold; while I was in the act of striking the man the prisoner got away. I pursued, he knocked down a boy-he was stopped. I never lost sight of him. About a quarter before ten o'clock I picked up a broken seal, and the next morning I found the ring near the spot where the robbery was committed.</p>

On the 29th of August, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop and asked to look at a gold-chain which hung in the window, and was marked ten guineas; I shewed it to him and gave it into his hands; he asked me if I would warrant it being gold, and took the ticket off. I concluded he was going to buy it, and asked him if I should put it in paper, he said no, it was of no consequence. He put his hand into his pocket and took out a piece of paper, and put the chain in it, and put it into his right hand coat pocket. After searching his different pockets he pulled out a small box which contained only sixteen shillings; he hesitated, and said he had forgot his money and must leave it and call again. He put his hand into his pocket and returned me a parcel about the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170010"/>size as that the chain was wrapped, in a piece of paper of the same appearance exactly; he put it on the counter; I took the parcel up, he seeing me going to open it said I have made a mistake-it contained some plated pieces of chain; he then returned me the real one. I told him I must send for an officer. He ran out of the shop, I pursued, took him on Holborn-hill, and gave him in charge. He did not say he had made a mistake until I opened the first parcel.</p>

I put the note into a tin box with a gold ring; the prisoner breakfasted in my room-as he was removing I accommodated him with water; he then went out and returned in about an hour and a half, saying he was going to fetch a broker to sell his furniture-The broker took the goods; the prisoner went out with him; he returned again saying, he was ill, and asked me to give him some water for his tea, which I did; he stopped a long time; it was geting late and rained very hard; he went out to buy some stockings, I went with him, and returned; he supped with me and seemed to stop a long time; I took the note out and put it in again; the prisoner said he wished he had a 10l. note. I then asked him to go home, he said it rained very hard and he had the tooth-ache, and I was a hard-hearted woman to turn him out of doors, as he did not know where to go for he could not get into his lodgings, and if I would let him lay on a chair in my room, and make a fire, he would recompense me. I could not get him out, and let him sit up on a chair, I had told him he should not, but he would. I took my pocket off and put it under my pillow. In the morning, about four o'clock, I felt his hand under my pillow, I asked him what he was doing, he said he was raising my head as it was too low (my husband is at sea), I told him I always laid so, he said he wished it was day-light; I told him it was light. He then said he had to go over the water. I believe he went away about five o'clock - He said he would return at nine o'clock. I got up at eight o'clock and found my pocket untied, and the box, with the note and ring, gone; I gave the alarm. The prisoner was no acquaintance of mine - He would stop in the room.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. My husband is at sea. I did not want him to stop; there was nothing wrong between us; I do not cohabit with him. The money had been left me by my uncle.</p>
               <p>ELIZA LANKINALL. On the 19th of August, the prisoner came to my house at eight o'clock in the morning, and paid me 2l. 12s., which he had owed me for five years, he gave me a 10l. note, saying, that if I would change it he would pay me. I gave the same note to Croston, to get it changed at Anderson's.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CROSTON. I received the note, and took the same one to Anderson and changed it.</p>

I lost sight of the prisoner for about a minute, when he turned the corner. I am certain he is the boy who was in the kitchen.

               <p>MOSES MOSES. I live in Parson's-street, East Smithfield. On the 25th of July the prisoner came to my shop, and offered me a gold watch-chain for sale; I asked him if it was his own, he said it was-it had no ring to it. Suspecting him, I asked him what he wanted for it; he said, either fifty shillings or fifteen shillings, I do not know which; I told him I was doubtful of its being gold, and would take it to a neighbour to try it - He said I should not take it without he went with me. I took him to Nathan (he is an officer), which was within a few yards of me, and Nathan told him he must detain him on suspicion - He made a very great resistance, so that four of us could hardly take him to the watch-house. Several broaches and other things were found upon him.</p>

            . I am a headborough of St. John's, Wapping. The prisoner was brought to me by Moses, who spoke to me in Hebrew. I asked the prisoner what had become of the ring of the watch, and the chain and seals? he said they were gone. I told him that I was an officer, and must search him. The moment I spoke he turned to go out; I secured him, with the assistance of three or four others - We could hardly get him to the watch-house; I told him I must search him there - He said he would not let me. He took some things out of his breeches pocket, and some I took from him myself. I also found the following articles upon him - A coral, a toothpick-case, the rings which belong to the chain, a gold ring, a gold broach, a pair of silver studs, a silver<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170012"/>earpick, a toothpick, a gold ear-ring, a silver stockbuckle, two pair of silver clasps, a hair watch-chain, a tobacco-box, and a Norfolk latch-key, which will open any door.

I was going home; he said he would have something more to drink. I took the bottle and went down, under pretence of geting something merely to get away, his wife went down with me to take the bottle up again; we waited some time and then went up, thinking he would be asleep - We did not mean to get any liquor; when we got up she asked him what was the matter with him. We sat down and he stood in the middle of the room with a large stick in his hand, two inches and a half thick; the prisoner took a knife in her hand to cut a piece of meat, the deceased fell upon her directly, and struck her a violent blow on the head; I was going to her assistance; he fell backward immediately-she had a bonnet on - I did not see what caused him to fall, it was so instantaneous - He bled very much; she jumped up, and said, "good God, what have I done!" He was wounded in the left breast. I ran out for assistance, and several of the nighbours came in; she was crying over him, and trying to stop the blood; he was taken to the hospital, and I sat up with him.</p>

I saw the deceased at the London Hospital; he had a wound in the left side of his chest, he lived about six hours and a half-the wound was three or four inches deep, and had punctured the heart, it appeared to have been done with a sharp instrument; there is no doubt but the wound was the cause of his death.</p>

On the 3d of July, about eleven o'clock at night, I locked my desk, which had about 40l. in Bank of England notes, and a great deal of silver, in a private drawer, in it-the prisoner often saw me put my notes in the private drawer; my family were at Brighton, and he was going to them the next morning. On the 3d of July, about a quarter after six o'clock in the morning, he tapped at my bed-room door, and told me that thieves had been in the house; I went down without dressing myself, and followed him into the front parlour, which looks into the street, I found the left window-shutters entirely demolished and part of the shutters laying in the room, I asked him if there had been any plate on the side-board the night before? He said there were four spoons and the sugar-tongs. I said, I hope William they have not been in the counting-house. He said I hope not Sir. I went there to my private drawer in my desk, where I always put my notes, it was locked - I found it very difficult to unlock it being very much mutilated. After some trouble I unlocked it and found all the notes which I had put there the night before gone. There were one 10l. and three 2l. notes among them - I always write on my notes. I lent the prisoner 2l. the first day he came to me-it might have been a 2l. note, I had upwards of 20l. in 1l. notes, in my drawer. I found the bottom of the drawer had been forced up with some instrument, and the notes drawn out with the hand. I also lost a black pocket-book with memorandums out of the drawer. The prisoner said what a shocking place London was to live in, and he must go again to his own country - He had only lived a month with me. I did not suspect him at all. He was going to Brighton at two o'clock, and he asked me to let him go to the west end of the town before he went. He returned and went to Brighton; after he was gone my attention was directed to the window blind; I found it was impossible for any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170013"/>person to have come in from the outside, as the blind must have been broken for them to get down, and it was not injured in the least, it became evident to me that it must have been done inside; upon which I went to Lambeth-street Office; Miller was sent to Brighton on Friday, and brought the prisoner to town.</p>

            . I am a gardener at Fulham. On the day after the robbery, about two o'clock, the prisoner came to me and said, "I suppose you have heard about my affair; I told him I had, and was very sorry; he said,"what do you think they can do to me?" I told him he had better surrender and impeach the rest - He shook his head, but made no reply. I told him if the guilt was brought home to him the law would transport him; he said some advised him to surrender and some not. I then left him, and did not see him after. I used to pass his garden two or three times daily, but never saw him - I used to see him every day before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have told the very words he said. He said some told him to surrender to get his son off.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner at the Duke's Head, at Walthamstow, Essex, on Sunday, the 27th of July, I knew him before; I found some tools in his pocket, and believe he has worked at the shoe-making business since he returned.</p>

            . I am turnkey of Newgate, and was so in the fifty-fourth year of the present reign. I was present here in the April Sessions that year when the prisoner was convicted; I delivered him myself on board the Retribution hulk, at Sheerness. He is the same person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. I have delivered a great many men. I know the prisoner very well.</p>

               <p>The prisoner produced two witnesses, who gave him a good character; and stated him to have been industriously employed since he returned.</p>

On the 9th of August, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop, and brought us three bags, which he took out of a larger bag; I left him in the shop, and when he went out I thought his bag appeared fuller than it was before. I followed him, and went with him to Bank-buildings, and told him Mr. Rutt thought he had some of our paper; he said, "No, does he?" He dropped the bag and ran away, I picked it up-it contained three reams of paper. About an hour after he saw me at the door and beckoned to me, I went to him, when he said he was very sorry he had made the mistake. I told him he had better come in, which he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. There was a great deal of paper about. He appeared intoxicated when he returned. I do not think he could have taken it by mistake.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Fetter-lane. I was passing through Long-lane, about ten minutes after one o'clock, and heard the alarm, I went up-when the prosecutor said, "you have drawn my watch," and called out. I saw him struggling with the prisoner. He said another man had taken it out of the prisoner's hand.</p>

I gave her in charge. The next day I met Kempshaw at the Mansion-house, and gave her in charge.</p>

            ; I have been their clerk twelve years. Mr. Robert Atcheson has kept cash there about two years; I sometimes pay the drafts which are presented. On the 2d of August the prisoner came to our house in Birchin-lane, Cornhill, and presented a check for 225l., I thought it was not Mr. Atcheson's hand-writing, and asked him where he got it; he said a gentleman came to Mr. Davison's, his master, gave him the check, and asked him to go to the banking-house and receive it for him; I showed it to Mr. Burgess, who stood by me, the prisoner was present; in consequence of what passed between us Mr. Burgess asked the prisoner to walk into the counting-house, which he did - I do not know what passed (looking at the check), This is the one presented. I have a perfect knowledge of Mr. Atcheson's hand-writing from seeing and paying his drafts, I have every means of judging, and believe it not to be his hand-writing, it does not resemble it much, the signature does not in the least resemble it; as soon as I saw it I thought it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I do not know whether the prisoner has brought drafts to our house before; he presented it in the usual way, and showed no inclination to escape; we were about two minutes conversing about it. When asked concerning it, he immediately gave the account which I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. If he had been disposed to run out could he - A. There were several persons between him and the door; he might, perhaps, have escaped.</p>
               <p>MR. W M. HUGH BURGESS. I am one of the partners in the house, Robinson has given the names correct. I know Mr. Atcheson's hand-writing(looks at the check), I do not believe it to be his hand-writing; the prisoner was brought to me when it was presented, and said he had presented it for payment. I desired him to walk into the counting-house, told him it was a forgery, and asked him where he got it; he said he was standing at his master's door, when a person came up and said he owed his master some money, that he had a check on a banking-house in the city, and that he must get him to receive it for him. I do not immediately recollect the very words. I do not know whether he said the man said "You must go and receive the check for me, or you must go with me and receive it"-the impression upon my mind was that the man wanted him to receive it for him. I think I asked him where he was to meet the man again - He said "in some street by here;" I asked him what street? - after a great deal of hesitation and confusion, he said Nicholas-lane, he believed. I believe I asked him if he was to meet him at the Black Boy public-house - He said "Yes," I believe. I am not sure whether I asked him about the public-house, but I am sure he said Nicholas-lane. I told him I must send for a constable. When the constable came, I desired him to describe the dress of the man to him. I then desired the constable to go into Nicholas-lane, and see if he could find a person of that description. He came back in two or three minutes, saying he could not find any such person-the prisoner was present. Mr. Davison lives in Fleet-street, which is about a mile from my house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long did he stay in your house before the constable took him away - A. About ten minutes. I do not recollect whether he said any thing when the constable said he could not find the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was about one or two o'clock. The house was in full business. He would have found it difficult to escape.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170017"/>Q. You say he hesitated in naming the street - A. When I asked him if it was Nicholas-lane, I did not ask about his description of the man - He said he had pantaloons on, but I do not remember what colour he said.</p>

             SMITH. I am a constable. On the 2d of August I was sent for, and found the prisoner with Mr. Burgess, who stated the check to be a forgery. The prisoner said a man gave it to him. I asked him what sort of a man he was? He said he was about my height, but not so stout, and dressed in a black coat, blue Wellington pantaloons, and boots. I asked him where he left him? he said, it was at the bottom of the lane - I said, in Lombard-street? he said, No; at a public-house at the bottom of the lane; he said the man was to wait at the public-house for him - He said he did not know the sign. I asked him if it was the public-house just across the way, and told him that was the Black Boy; I told him it was crossing the lane at he bottom. He said that must be it by the description. I left him with Mr. Burgess, and went to the house to see if I could find a man answering that description - I could not. I looked both right and left about the street, in my way to the house, and in the tap-room and parlour in the house - I made no inquiry there. I saw the waiter; there was only one gentleman there. I got another officer to mind the prisoner, while I searched the house better; I returned with the prisoner to the public-house. He went willingly with me. I looked over, and saw the same persons as before - He said that was the house he meant. I asked the prisoner if he was sure the man had a black coat on? he said Yes. The gentleman that was there was dressed all in black; I thought I would bring him to the door to shew him to the prisoner, he had black pantaloons on; the prisoner said that was not him. I said I could wait no longer, and took him to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Might there not have been a person whom you did not see - A. There might.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went out, might not a person see you come out - A. They could not know me. There might have been a person waiting, who might have got to the public-house as soon as I could.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Atcheson.(looking at the check). I do not believe it to be his handwriting. I have seen him write frequently - I have been thirteen years with him. I have not the least doubt that it is not his hand-writing. He is a solicitor, and employs Mr. Davison as his printer. I do not know whether Mr. Atcheson ever paid Mr. Davison a check.</p>

             M'GREGOR. I am errand-boy to Mr. Davison, printer, in Lombard-street, Whitefriars. The prisoner was employed to hang the sheets up to dry when they came out of the press, and to give out the gatherings. We had a work printing in the office, entitled the Picture of Paris. On the morning of the day that he was taken up he sent me to Charing-cross with a letter, it was directed to Mr. Dejean, 33, Charing-cross, I was to wait for an answer. When I got there, I was told that he did not reside there, but that he might be found in Thanet-place, Temple-bar. I took it there, and found Mr. Dejean; he gave me a message, that he could not give it to the prisoner unless he came himself, or sent a letter by the two-penny post, informing him which road he meant to take to go to Cambray-this was all he said to me. I returned, and delivered his message to the prisoner, who said, "Very well." I asked him if it was for himself (I meant the passport - I only guessed it by what Mr. Dejean said). The prisoner said it was for a soldier named Brown. I did not see the letter, though I carried it-(looks at it) - I cannot say whether this is it or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never saw the inside of the letter. The prisoner did not tell me to keep it a secret-he never shewed me the contents of it; the prisoner said it was for Brown.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DEJEAN. I am a foreigner, and contract to convey persons to France (looks at the letter). This was brought to me by the last witness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The direction is torn off - A. Yes, I put it in my pocket with other letters. I receive a great many letters - I know it to be the same by the contents; I tore the address off when I gave it to the boy. I believe the boy asked me for the letter he delivered to me in the name of Brown. I had no other of that name. I believe I asked him if it was the letter. I am certain it is the same by its contents-(read).</p>
               <p>SIR,</p>
               <p>As I understand you convey passengers who wish to visit France, and your charge is nine Napoleons; as business calls me there, I have no objection to agree to your proposition to carry me and a female, round by Calais to Cambray. Return an answer, with particulars, by the-bearer.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Davison, printer, Whitefriars. In August last the prisoner was in his employ-he keeps cash at Brooks's, in Chancery-lane, and at Messrs. Williams's and Co. - Mr. Atcheson is a customer of Mr. Davison's. He has paid us checks on his banker's. The prisoner has been employed to carry money to Messrs. Williams's, and to receive it also. From Mr. Atcheson's checks going through that house, the prisoner had the means of knowing that Messrs. Williams were also his banker's. The prisoner was taken up on the 2d of 
               <persName id="t18170917-55-person393">August. On</persName>
             that day I went to him in consequence of receiving a letter-he was then in Giltspur-street Compter. I asked him on what charge he was apprehended? he said, at dinner-time a man called at Mr. Davison's, and inquired if he was at home, saying he had 50l. to pay him, and asked who he was to leave it with? that he (the prisoner) told him there was no person to take it but himself, that the man said he must go with him into the city to get the check changed; that they went together-when they came near the banker's, the man gave the check into his hands, and while the man went to get a draught of porter, he was to get it cashed, and bring the man the money; and that on presenting it he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170018"/>was told it was a forgery, in consequence of which he was apprehended. I asked him if he ever saw the man before? he said, No. His letter to me made the same statement. The Guide to Paris was printed at our office-the prisoner had an opportunity of seeing it, he would have to hang the sheets up to dry-there is a reference to Mr. Dejean, in the Haymarket. I do not know that the prisoner had any order from my master to go to Paris.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. This is the sixth edition of the Picture of Paris; many thousands persons might have the same knowledge of Mr. Dejean as the prisoner. It was not his employment to read. The prisoner had been in the office upwards of four years, andhad a very good character.</p>
               <p>ANN BIRCH. I keep the Black-Boy public-house, at the end of Nicholas-lane, Lombard-street. On the 2d of August, about ten o'clock in the morning, several persons were in my passage - I cannot say whether any man dressed in a black coat, Wellington pantaloons, and boots, came there or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man dressed in a black coat and blue pantaloons called at my master's, saying he wanted to pay 50l., and asked who he was to pay it to; I told him there was nobody but myself - He asked me to give the difference of the check, saying it was a very good one - He wished it was for a 1000l. After some persuasion, I consented to go with him to receive it at the banker's. As we went along, he said I was to go and receive it, while he went and had a drop of beer - I was told it was a forgery.</p>

            . The prisoner has been our clerk about a year and a quarter. On the 5th of August, I had occasion to give him directions to write a letter to Messrs. Williams's house, which he did, and brought the letter to me for my signature (looks at it) The words also, "Lieut. R. Mace, on his application for the same, 400l." was not there when I signed it-it is in the prisoner's hand-writing. Our house had no correspondence with Lieut. R. Mace. Messrs. Williams and Co. are our town correspondents. I had not given the prisoner authority todirect them to pay Lieutenant R. Mace 400l. When I went to the office on the 8th of August the prisoner was absent - We had not sent him any where; he never returned, until he was in custody.</p>

             I believe a person came to our office in Birchin-lane on that day, and inquired of me whether we had an order from the Gravesend Bank to pay Lieut. R. Mace 400l.? - I believe the prisoner was the man - I will not positively swear to him; the order being quite fresh in my recollection, I said, yes, there was. I accordingly found the letter, and asked him if his name was Mace? he said, yes; I then filled up the body of a blank check, and gave it to him to put his signature to it, which he did (looks at it)-this is it. I took it back to compare it with the signature in the letter, found that they corresponded, and put my initials to it for it to pass to the cashier, or he would not pay it; I gave it back to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I gave it to him, supposing him to be Lieut. R. Mace. It would not have been paid, if I had not put my initials to it-it is an order for the cashier to pay it-(letter read).</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information which I received, I pursued the prisoner to Abbeville, in France, and apprehended him there. I told him he was charged with receiving 400l. from Messrs. Williams and Co. of Birchin-lane, on account of Messrs. Brenchley and Co., of Gravesend. He said he had received the 400l., and that they paid him a 300l. bank note,(I neither threatened nor persuaded him). I asked him where the notes were? he said he had changed the 300l. note at the Bank of England for small notes, and the 100l. note he had then in his possession, which he produced from his pocket-book. I searched his trunk, and found 200l. in 1l. and 2l. notes, and a gold watch, chain, and seals, which he said he purchased with part of the money (looks at the note). This is the 100l. note, No. 11,282; the rest of the money he said he had paid in post<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170019"/>chaise hire from London to Dover, and from Calais to Abbeville.</p>

               <p>SUSAN PITHOUSE. I live in Seacoal-lane. On the 17th of September, Mrs. Redgrave passed my window; she had a little girl, about two years and a half old, on her right hand - A dray was coming along, the horses were on a quick trot, and touched her arm-she was close to the window; the pavement is about a yard wide-the child was next the wheel; it turned the woman round. A girl brought the child in soon after, and gave it to me-it was very bloody.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE EDWARDS. I lived with Mr. Pithouse. I came out, hearing a scream, and found the child lying on the ground with its head against the wheel-the dray was on the pavement-before I could get it up the wheel went against her head; I got under and pulled it out by its legs-it appeared to be dead.</p>

I saw the child bleeding on Mrs. Pithouse's arm.</p>
               <p>JOHN WEBSTER. I was in Seacoal-lane, and heard the woman scream, the dray had stopped; the man held the horse by the head-if it had moved two or three inches further it would have been over the woman also. I saw the child brought out from under the dray.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WEBSTER. I was in Mr. Woodfall's printing-office, in Seacoal-lane, and saw the dray going fast down the lane; as it came towards Mrs. Redgrave's, she pushed the child towards Newcastle-street - the child slipped out of her hand and fell-its feet were off the curb, its head was on the pavement. The wheel went over the neck of the child, and a girl picked it up.</p>

             MITRE. I am the surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The child was brought there on the 17th of September, between twelve and one o'clock-it was dead. It had a severe fracture on the head. I have no doubt but that was the cause of its death.</p>

On 18th of July, about eleven o'clock, I received information, ran out of the shop, and saw two men walking very fast-one of them had something wrapped up in a great coat; I followed them, they turned down Wimpole-street, when they got to the middle of the street, one of them turned round and saw me following them, they immediately ran off to the corner of Henrietta-street. I saw the prisoner drop the two pieces of cotton - I was within ten yards of him; I am certain he is the man. I told Cockrain to pick them up, and I pursued. He ran through Cavendish-square into Oxford-street, down Shepherd-street, into a public-house there; I went in and found him hid behind the bar - I secured him; I never lost sight of him. He was about twenty yards off when I first saw him. Cockrain produced the cotton, which I knew to be Mr. Wilson's property-it is worth 5l.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hepworth who is a stationer in Poland-street. On the 18th of July, I was passing Mr. Wilson's, and saw two men go into the shop, and take out the pieces of cotton; there was no person in the shop at the time - I do not know the men. I told Norton, and he pursued after them.</p>
               <p>JOHN COCKRAIN. I am servant to Mr. Parwicke, in Welbeck-street. I heard Goddard give information as I stood by the shop - I saw no person come from the shop. I first caught sight of the two men at the corner of Wimpole-street - they had something wrapped in a great coat. I followed them, they turned round and saw us, and ran. I saw one of them drop a piece of cotton, I picked it up - I believe it was the prisoner; I saw his features. Norton followed him; the prisoner stopped in a very few minutes. I am certain the prisoner who was stopped is the man. I saw him run away - He was never out of my sight above five minutes. When he was stopped, he said it was not him. I asked him why he ran away if he did not commit the theft? I am certain he is the man.</p>

The prisoner drew my watch out of my fob-one of the others shoved me behind; I called out, and Smith came to my assistance-Johnston and I secured the prisoner, the others ran away. It was done instantaneously; he struck me on the breast before he drew my watch out-the others tried to rescue him; he never got out of my sight.</p>
               <p>GEORGE JOHNSON. I am a stationer, and live in Buckle-street, Red Lion-street, Whitechapel. I saw the prisoner and several others, one of them pushed Garrett behind; he was quite close to him; the prisoner gave him a blow on the breast and then took his watch; he turned round and was going to make his escape, I collared him; he dropped the watch; I caught it before it got to the ground; the others tried to rescue him. I kept my hold.</p>

I picked it up; it is worth 2l.6s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I had left nobody in the shop-my parlour has a glass by which I can see into the shop - I did not see anybody; there were other persons in the parlour, they could not see into the shop. I sat opposite the glass.</p>

About two o'clock the constable came for me, I came home, went up stairs, and found my room door broken open-Slack, the constable, had been up before; the screws were forced, and the box of the lock forced back; I looked into my boxes and cupboard, all the things were turned over, and the articles stated in the indictment gone. I saw them all again at Worship-street, except the money. The prisoner was not in the house when I returned - He had only been two nights in the house.</p>

            . I am a headborough of Clerkenwell. On the 18th of July I saw the prisoner at the end of Rawstorne-street, opposite Islington-road, he was reading a duplicate; knowing him before, I watched him, and saw him go into a shop and buy some ham and bread, he came out, eat some of it, and threw the rest in the kennel, he then went and laid down on the steps of a door; I went up and asked him if he was out of work, he said, "Yes." I told him there was plenty of hay-making; he said he could get nothing to do. I asked him how long he had been out of work; he said, a great while, and that his uncle, who lived in Whitecross-street, kept him - He then said he lived in Coleman-street. I asked him if had a duplicate about him, he said, No; I said he had one; he said he had not, for he had given it to a boy named Gunn. I told him no boy had been with him since I saw him reading it, and that he had it about him; he said if he had it was nothing to me, I had no business with it; I pulled out my staff, and shewed it to him; he then said he had torn it and thrown it away - I told him to shew me where he threw it, he said he would when the crowd were gone; he took me to the place, where I found the duplicate torn in pieces; I endeavoured to collect them, but could only make out that it was something pledged for two shillings, and asked him what it was - He said it was a pair of gaiters. I told him he must go with me, and asked him if he pledged them, he said, No; I then asked him who did, he said a boy. I told him to come with me to the King's Arms public-house, in Rawstorne-street - as we went along he said he had seven pence, which he would give me to let him go. I searched him, and found a row of beads, a gold ring, an hymn book, and 7s. 2d. in money; I left him with Morgan while I took some more boys into custody, who were by; I was absent about half an hour, and when I returned he told me it was not a pair of gaiters that were pledged but a gown, which was pledged at Mrs. Nichols's, near Finsbury-square - I went there, produced the pieces of the duplicate, and got the gown; as I was taking him to the office, he said he had broken into a young woman's room, which she rented in his uncle's house, and took the property out; he then took a pocket-book out of his hat, and said, you may as well take this, as it cannot be worse than it is. I went to the prosecutrix's house about half-past two o'clock, found the outer door open, and went up to her room with a little girl who lived near, and found the screws of the lock quite wrenched from the woodwork-the box of the lock was quite loose. I saw the prosecutrix about three o'clock,she was not at home when I first went.</p>

On the 18th of July Slack left the prisoner in my charge, at the King's Arms in Rawstorne-street; he said they were not gaiters that he had pledged, but a gown - I said nothing to induce him to confess.

On the 15th of July, the prisoner came into our shop and asked for some ribbon; I put the ribbon drawer on the counter, and went to the door to take some goods in, on my return she said there was none to suit her, and left the shop-after she was gone I missed a piece of ribbon, I did not see her take it. I went out, overtook her, and saw the ribbon hanging out of her pocket-handkerchief, which was in her hand; I brought her back and gave her in charge.</p>

He said nothing - He put his hand up my petticoats, and forced it up to my back. I did not know him before. He forced me on the ground-as he threw me down, the bundle slipped out of my hand, he immediately snatched it up and ran away. He offered me no other violence. I I cried out that there was a man coming, and called out murder! until assistance came, and followed him - He went towards Holloway; a person came up and stopped with me, and I followed him the best part of three fields. I saw my bundle again in half an hour in the officer's hands - I am positive the prisoner is the man; he was taken in half an hour-it was near Copenhagen House.</p>

On the 11th of September, I was going to Copenhagen House about nine o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner loitering about the lane;I passed him, and walked some distance up the lane, and frequently looked after him; when I got into the fields I still saw him. I got over the ditch to go to Copenhagen House; when I got about a hundred yards from the field I heard the cry of murder! I called to some men - We all ran across the field, and saw him crossing Ring Common. I saw him before me for half a mile, and lost sight of him-Kempton followed him. I got sight of him again in a moment; he was secured in a garden. I saw him drop the bundle. I am sure heis the man.</p>

On the th of August, about two o'clock in the morning I was going home; I was rather intoxicated,but knew what I was about. I was knocked down by two men, I could not see their faces; they took my jacket and waistcoat, handkerchief and stiffner, and hat off, and left me. I was stunned by the fall, and remained on the ground ten minutes. I was taken to the watch-house, and found the prisoner there, he had my waistcoat on. I described it to the watchman before I saw him; I told him there were four cards of address in it.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SUMMERS. I am headborough of St. George's in the East. About a quarter before two o'clock the prisoner was brought into the watch-house. I searched him, and found he had a waistcoat on over his own, and a great coat on over them. I locked him up. The prosecutor was brought in also, who said he was knocked down by two men and robbed of his straw hat, blue jacket and waistcoat, a silk handkercheif, and a stiffener. When I brought the prisoner out, he immediately said the waistcoat which he had on was his; he described it to me before he saw it, and said there was a blue ribbon and several cards of address of different persons in the pocket, mentioning their names. We pulled it off, and found the cards he mentioned and the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prosecutor was rather in liquor, but knew what he was about. The prisoner was put in a place by himself; he could not have made way with the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>JOHN PETERSON. I am a watchman. I was going my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170024"/>rounds about ten minutes after two o'clock, and saw something lying on the ground; before I went up to it I stopped at the corner of Old Gravel-lane to have some coffee. I got more towards the end of the lane, and saw the prisoner and another man leave the thing and come towards me, but crossed on the other side from me. I let them pass, and found it was Mackay whom they came from. I had seen the prisoner about three times that night before Mackay was stripped; I asked him where his clothes were? In consequence of what he said, I went after the men; I missed them for about five minutes, and was told two men were gone towards St. George's watch-house. I followed, and came up with the prisoner - the other man was on the other side of the way. The prisoner had the stiffener in his hand; I took him to the watch-house; he dropped it at the door - I picked it up. I then went and brought Mackay in; he described the waistcoat very particularly before he saw it; it was taken off the prisoner - He had two waistcoats on, his coat was open</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw Mackay was he stripped - A. I was about twenty steps from him. I saw two men moving about him. I thought he was drunk. As soon as I began to call the hour they left him.</p>

He said he had changed the notes for smaller ones. I found twenty-nine 1l. notes on him - I found him within six miles of the British Channel. He said he took some plate out of pledge with the money. He said the small notes were part of the produce of them; I also found a gold watch on him.</p>

            . On the 13th of July I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock, and secured the back and front doors; I did not look at the windows; I was the last up. About three o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by my fellow-servant, she was up before me. I went down below, and found the shoe-room window, which looks into the backyard, open-it was day-light; I missed the articles stated in the indictment out of the laundry, which communicates with the shoe-room.

             re-examined. The house appeared to have been entered by putting the sash of the shoe-room window down; I observed it at three o'clock in the morning. I do not know whether it was fastened the overnight or not; there were no marks of violence on it. There is a private bolt, which goes across the laundry-door-it goes by the kitchen-door, through the wall, into the laundry-door; it is impossible for any one to enter the laundry without getting the bolt out. I found the crossbolt on the ground in the kitchen-the kitchen and laundry-doors were open, and one of the back-doors, which goes out of the laundry. We were not alarmed till the servants came down in the morning to wash. Mr. Fry is one of my assistants. All the things were taken out of the laundry. The property was worth four or five pounds at the lowest.</p>

On the 13th of July, between four and five o'clock in morning, I was coming-from Kentish-town to Covent-garden-market, and met Mr. Smith's son, he told me if I met the prisoner (he described Macdonald Smith), to apprehend him; about half-past seven o'clock, as I returned from Covent-garden, I met the prisoners, Gutteridge and Smith, at the end of Pancras-street, Tottenham-court-road, each of them had a bundle - I stopped my cart, got down, and asked Smith what he had got in the bundle? he said he had his clothes. I told him they were stolen, and he was my prisoner, and I must apprehend him. He attempted to run away; I overtook. and secured him with the bundle. Gutteridge ran away with his bundle. As I was taking him to the watch-house, I met Squib. We took him to a public-house, and took two silver table-spoons, one tea-spoon, a knife, a rummer, and the hat-lining from his pocket.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 5th of July, about three o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner and another man in Dean-street, Soho, I asked him what he had in his bundle, he said it was nothing to me, he ran away - I secured the other, Adams stopped him-the bundle contained two curtains - We could not find who they belonged to and the men were discharged. I took the prisoner again on the Saturday following. I am certain he is the man.</p>

               <p>MR. WILLIAM AMORY. I live at Clapton. A man named Loveday, came into my employ in November 1815 or 1816 - I laid in fifteen quarter of oats-they went very quick, I told Loveday of it, I found the remainder lasted much longer in proportion - I discharged him. He afterwards applied to me for a character, which I refused-some time after he gave me some information about the oats. The prisoner was my gardener. I suppose I lost three or four sacks of oats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I did not see the oats delivered; other people had access to the stable.</p>

            . On the 17th of September, I was Mr. Amory's servant. The prisoner applied to me several times for oats, saying, he used to get them from the other servant. In October he asked me again for some, I let him have them-he took them away in a sack-he gave me money sometimes for them. Wright passed by once when he was paying me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Some of the servants kept rabbits - I never asked Mr. Amory for a character. I did not tell of it to get a character, but because I repented.</p>

            . I live in Dean-street, Holborn. In consequence of a recommendation from a woman of the name of Isaacs, I waited on the prisoner in July with some patterns of flowers, at Langbourn-chambers, Fenchurch-street, I found the prisoner there and a clerk writing at the desk; I shewed him some flowers, having a note of introduction from Isaacs; he asked what quantity I could get done for him by Saturday - He asked if I could get 20l. worth, I said I could not, but would get as many ready as I could-the agreement was for ready money. He said I must make haste with them as he should have an order for 90l. worth next week - I told him I was a poor man and could not go on without the money, he said I should receive the money immediately I brought home the goods. I went home and prepared them; I got the articles to make them which came to 6l.6s. On the Saturday at eleven o'clock he sent me a letter, stating, that he should feel obliged by my sending them in an hour or two, as the ship was to go down the river to-morrow morning, and the package must be at the water-side before half-past two, to be shipped by four o'clock; he called himself about an hour after, and asked me if I had received the letter, I said I had - He wanted to know if the goods were ready, I said I was packing them - He went away - I told him I would be at his chambers as soon as him - I got there first with them, about ten o'clock, my wife was with me-the flowers were in my boxes - I was to have the boxes returned-the prisoner came in about half an hour after-as he went into the office he made a motion, and said he would speak to me directly; he came out upon the landing-place to me - I had left the flowers and boxes in the office - He pulled out his pocket-book and took out a note, and said he was going to his banker's in Chancery-lane, to get, cash for the note, saying, it was for 100l. and told me to wait till four o'clock, when he would return and pay me. I waited in the neighbourhood till four, and went there but he had not returned; I staid till nine o'clock, he never returned. On the Monday at six o'clock in the morning I went again - I got admission at nine and found the clerk there, I staid till three o'clock in the afternoon, but could not see him, or either get the flowers or money; I got a constable who found the prisoner - I took him before a magistrate. The next day he was examined; after that my flowers were produced to me by the officer, they were very much injured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. He told me it was a 100l. bank of England note - I saw the figures 100 on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the figures 100 on a bank note - A. I do not know - He was to pay me at four o'clock - I did not ask him for 2l. on account - I do not give credit - I could not.</p>
               <p>MARY KELLY. I am the wife of Thomas Kelly. I went with him, the prisoner said he should be paid by half-past four o'clock; he had a 100l. check or note, he said he was going to send to his banker's in Chancery-lane, and would pay at half-past four.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. They were to be paid for on delivery.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITEHORN. I keep the Angel, public-house, in Fenchurch-street. On the Saturday before the prisoner was apprehended he came to my house at seven o'clock in the evening, and stopped until near eleven-he had 6s.9d. to pay - He said he had no cash; I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself to come to a house and not be able to pay so small a reckoning; he said he would call next morning at ten o'clock and pay it, but he did not. He came to me in my yard, and asked me to lend him a little cash, saying, he had nothing but a 100l. note about him; I told him if it was 100l. note, although it was late I could get it changed; he then pulled out his pocket-book, and told me it was 100l. bill, payable in ten days - I told him I was astonished at him. He asked me to advance him a little cash.</p>

The next morning at the Mansion-House, a little boy, named Isaacs, came to ask for him; from information which I received I went to his chambers on the Sunday, and found four dozen and ten flowers, laying in a chest on a chair-the boxes were down stairs; we got the key from Isaacs.</p>

On the 9th of August the prisoner came to see me, and stopped with me until the 31st, as my master and mistress were out of town; she brought a bunch of keys with her, she used to carry them about with her - She said they belonged to some of her boxes in the country; on Monday the 25th, she said she had lost the keys; on the 26th she brought a band-box nearly full of her clothes, and the next morning she packed it up - She saw me looking at her-and said that dirty linen would not lay so close as clean, as she could not easily get all the things in; she took it away on the 31st, and left the house for good at ten o'clock the same night; in about a quarter of an hour after she was gone, I missed the property. I got an officer and went to her lodgings, we found one pair of my mistresses stockings there - We lost a great many more articles.</p>

As I crossed Henrietta-street I saw her again, asking a woman to assist her in covering the cotton over; I went and told her she had stolen the things, and to take them back to where she took them from; she said,</p>
               <p>"Hush, never mind that, come with me, and you and I will settle it." I told her she should go with me, and took her back. She carried the bundle into the shop.</p>

On Saturday, the 16th of August, between nine and ten o'clock at night, he went through my shop into the parlour, and staid there about half an hour - I was busy in the shop; it was dark-my candles were lit. In about half an hour he came through the shop and went ou - I noticed his looking very pale-the shop-door was open; I did not speak to him. I keep my notes and money in a trunk in my bed-room, which is on the first-floor, over my parlour. He came from the parlour through the shop; there is a door opens out of my parlour into the passage, and up to the bed-room-there is only a latch to the door; he had nothing about him. He went out between nine and ten o'clock-two of my children were in the parlour with him; one of them is nine, and the other fourteen years old. I saw them both asleep in the parlour while he was there-one of them goes early to market with me. I went up to bed about half-past twelve o'clock, and missed my trunk out of the bedroom. I had seen it safe in the morning - I was at home all day. The trunk was locked, and contained six 1l. notes, thirteen silver tea and salt-spoons, different writings, and linen; I had the key down stairs with me. My bed room door was not locked. I have no lodgers.</p>

Soon afterwards I went up stairs, through the parlour, and as I came down, I found the private street - door open-it is usually shut and chained.

            . I am the watchman of the liberty of Holywell, in Shoreditch. On Sunday morning, the 17th of August, at two o'clock, the prisoner, William Pack (who is a spare watchman on duty also), came and told me his brother had committed a robbery the night before; that he had stolen a portmauteau from behind a post-chaise. I asked him what it contained? he said several notes, silver spoons, napkins, and papers, and that they had bought a watch with the notes at Mr. Lormier's, in Shoreditch; and they had passed the notes in the name of Bailey. He went to his duty, returned at four o'clock, and told me the same story. I asked him if there were any initials on the spoons? he said there was S.H. At five o'clock I came off duty, and told Gibbs of it; we then informed Sorry, the headborough, and all three of us went to Saunders William Pack's master's house, in Gloucester-street, where he lived. This was on Sunday, it was about a quarter after five o'clock. We did not like to alarm the house, and went to

            , about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 17th of August, at Mrs. Noble's house. I found him there, and asked him what he had done with the things which were in the trunk? he said, he picked it up in a field at the bottom of Gloucester-street, and he and his brother opened it at his mother's house. He took the notes and plate out-the other things, he said were cumbersome, and not so easy to be got away, and they were burnt by his brother's advice-the trunk was thrown away in Hare-street - fields, and he bought a watch at Mr. Lormier's, in Shoreditch, with three of the notes, and got tipsey with another 1l. note, at a public-house in Shoreditch. He did not know what became of the rest, for he was very much intoxicated. I asked him where the watch was that he had bought? he said, it was at his master's house, nearly opposite the side of the bed. I went there with him - He pointed out the place - I broke open a board and took it out. He said the plate was at No. 5, Thompson's-court, Half-moon-alley, Bishopsgate. I told him I should go there, and leave him in custody the while; he said it was of no use, it was in such a particular place I could not find it - I took him there; it was at Mrs. Hoiles's house. He took me up to a front room on the first floor - I asked Mrs. Hoiles where it was? she said, "O, my G-d, it is here, I wish I had never known any thing about it." I told Pack to take it out. He took a pair of pincers and broke open a board over the window-ledge, and at the bottom of the window he took up a cloth in which were eleven spoons.</p>

            , we live in Kent. On the 27th of May, I took a coach at Hatton-garden to take me into the city. I had my son and grandson with me. I gave my luggage to the coachman; among other bundles, there was one in a red handkerchief, which I took into the coach - I pinned each corner of it-it contained a bag, with my red pocketbook and two 10l. bank notes in it. I got out of the coach at Copthall-court-the bundle was then safe. I staid there about half an hour; I had left my son and grandson in the coach-when I returned, I found them walking about by the coach. I discovered nothing till I got to the inn in Gracechurch-street, I then found my bundle had been unpinned, the bag opened, and the pocket-book, with its contents, gone. The coachman was searched before he left me.</p>

             BLACKBURN. I was with my mother. I noticed the prisoner riding behind the coach as we went along all the way from Hatton-garden - He was with the coachman when I called it off the stand. When my mother went into Copthall-court, I and my companion got out and left the door open, and walked about-we did not go far from it. My mother returned, and we went to the coachoffice in Gracechurch-street. I never saw the prisoner after my mother got out. The coachman was searched before he went from us.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Rodgers, of Kensington. On the 16th of August, enquiry was made about the child, I remembered seeing the prisoner cross the road opposite our shop, she looked through the window as if she wanted to buy something, she had no child with her then - She threw up her veil - I observed her features, which were remarkable-she walked backwards and forwards for about five minutes at the window - I saw her talking to two little girls, one of whom had a child, after that she came to the window with the same child, moistened a bit of bread in her mouth, and fed it. I am positive she is the woman-in a quarter of an hour I saw the child's parents and told them.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness, I went in pursuit of the child, from information which I received; I got Ruthven's assistance, and found the prisoner, on Wednesday the 19th; the officer brought the prisoner and child to me; I took the child out of the prisoner's arms and knew it again directly; it was almost famished for want, and appeared not likely to live; my daughter knew it again immediately; while the cart was coming along, she called out, that the prisoner was the woman. I never saw the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RUTHVEN. I am an officer of Bow-street. I went to Alresford, to West District Common, about six miles from Alresford, and found the prisoner there; I had learnt her name, and said,</p>
               <p>"Well Eliza, how is the child,"(she had it with her), she said it was very well; I asked her how old it was, she said a month; I asked her if she suckled it, she said her milk was gone. I asked her how she came to take the child away from the girl at Kensington, she said she did not, it was her own. As we came along, she wanted to know what I knew about it, and said, if it is not mine, whose is it; I told her she had taken it from Kensington, she said, "yes I did; I have not hurt it, and hope its parents will not hurt me." I took her in a cart to the public-house; the father and mother knew it again; the little girl pointed the prisoner out at Alresford, and said she was the woman. The child was very bad.</p>

On the 23d of July, I had a truss of goods in my cart, directed to Mr. Hayward, of Lawrence-lane, which came by the Salisbury coach. I stopped at Old-street turnpike, and left the cart to deliver a parcel; when I returned I missed the truss - A person passed by, in consequence of what he said, I saw a mob running, and followed them, and found the prisoner in charge.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURDETT. I am a shoemaker. Dr. Smith sent me after the man which I saw with the truss by the turnpike. Dr. Smith called out Stop thief! the maR dropped it.

I was going up Holborn-place between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, on Monday, the 15th of September, towards Gardiner's house, and saw the prisoner come out of his door with a large bundle under his arm; I saw Bottomley in the court, and shewed the prisoner to him, and said he had come out of Gardiner's house, he said there was nobody at home there, and ran after him immediately - I never lost sight of him until he was taken, and am certain he is the man-it was between two and three o'clock.</p>

            . I am a porter at the top of the court. Mrs. Adams came up and asked me if I had seen the man go by with the bundle, I said, No; and she said there is the man on the other side of the way, with the bundle, come out of Gardiner's house. I followed him, he went along Shoe-lane, until he got into Chancery-lane, to the corner of White's-alley; he stopped there, a woman came up to him, and they walked on together - I kept behind them; when they got to No. 66, Chancery-lane, he put the bundle down and sat up on it, wiping his face-the woman sat by his side for about ten minutes; he told her to mind the bundle while he called a coach, I heard him plainly - He left the bundle; I collared him, and told him to take it back to where he brought it from, as I knew it was stolen. I looked into the bundle it contained the clothes tied up in a sheet; I told him I should keep him until an officer came - I could not find one. The gentleman at No. 66, took the bundle in; I took him to the Compter; when I got there they told me to get an officer to give him in charge, they kept him there the while; the officer searched him, but found nothing on him. We went back to Gardiner's house, and found the one pair of stairs room door open, and two of the drawer locks in a chest broken off, and one of the sheets gone off the bed. I fetched Gardiner, and told him the bundle was at No. 66, Chancery-lane; I took him there, it was delivered into my hands, and he claimed the property.</p>

The prisoner was my <rs id="t18170917-122-deflabel609" type="occupation">footboy</rs>, and waited upon the gentlemen - He had lived a fortnight with me. On the 21st of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, he absconded - I missed the gold snuff-box, silver fruit-knife, and 15s. in money, about an hour after-the fruit-knife was Mr. Packer's, who lodged with me, he had been sent on an errand. I applied for an officer, and the prisoner was brought to me at two o'clock on Tuesday morning; on the 22d of July, which was the next morning, he was examined, and committed for trial. I found the snuff-box with the book-keeper of the Black Bear, Piccadilly, and the knife at a pawnbroker's in Tottenham-court-road. When the prisoner was brought to me I took him there at five o'clock in the morning. I have the property.</p>
               <p>JOHN DANIEL SMITH. I am a waterman at the coach-stand, Cheapside. On the 21st of July I went in search of the prisoner, and found him between one and two o'clock in the morning of the 22d, behind a hackney coach, with four or five more, and took him into custody - I knew Lim before. I asked him why he left his mistress, and he said he would not be brow beat by the servants any longer. I told him his mistress wished to see him, he said, very well, I will go and see her. I took him to her house immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not say if I told you where the property was, you would not hurt a hair of my head - A. I told him that if he told where the property was, and it could be recovered, he might go about his business. His mistress told me to say so. He told me where it was.</p>

On the 21st of July, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our counting-house over the booking-office, he was accustomed to come there when he was an hackney coachman; he said he had had a lucky find on Monday before, he was driving a hackney coach and took up a gentleman, set him down in Cheapside, and he had left a snuff-box in the coach, on the back seat; I asked him to show it me - He did - I said it was a very valuable one, it would be sure to be owned or advertised; I asked him if he had got any body to look at the papers, he said he had done that himself; I told him it was worth ten guineas second-hand; he asked me if I would give him five for it - I told him I would not buy it at any price, and begged of him to keep it; he took it away and went up stairs and sent my porter down to ask me to lend him 5s., on it as he had no money; my man said he knew the man very well, it was all right; I refused to lend the money on it; about half an hour after he came down again himself and asked me to lend him 3s., on it, as he had had no victuals that day, I lent him 3s., and said I would search the papers myself; I locked it up in my desk one night, and the next morning at a quarter before six, the prisoner, the prosecutrix, and J.D. Smith, sent for me to the Boltin-Tun, Fleet-street; we all rode up to our office, and I gave her the box.</p>

The deceased was getting out of the way and ran against the horse, the collar struck him on his breast, he fell on his back, the front wheel went over him, the hind wheel bruised his shoulder and turned him on his side-he got up, pressed his breast-the prisoner stopped about six yards from him.</p>

My pocket-book, containing the 417l. was kept in my bed, between the bed and mattress - I saw it the day before, and missed it on the next morning-the goods were then moved. I asked the prisoner if he remembered who moved the bed? he said he did not. He came to my house again at two o'clock; I asked him again. He said I had asked him before. I told him I had reasons for so doing. He asked me if I had lost any thing? I told him I had missed a pocket-book, with 400l. in it. He expressed great surprise, and said he would do what he could to assist in finding out who had got it. I gave him in charge. I saw him searched, and my pocket-book, with a 300l. note in it, was found in his bosom, next to his skin. He said he had no more. They found 45l. in his hat, one 10l. and one 5l. note.</p>

             is the landlady. We took the house on the 25th of July for two months certain; her furniture and servant remain in the house; we had all the rooms in the house; her servant slept in one by my permission-it was her intention to remain. On Saturday evening, the 13th of September, I and my husband saw all the doors and windows safe between ten and eleven o'clock. The plate was kept in the sideboard drawers, it was all our's. The servant-maid came into our bed-room about seven o'clock the next morning-from what she said, I learnt that the house had been broken open. I came down immediately, and missed all the plate from the front parlour; the silver waiter weighed thirty-seven ounces; the articles stated in the indictment were gone, all of which belonged to us, except the gown, the handkerchiefs, and the ham; the knuckle of veal was mine, some wine had been drank, and the decanter left; the upper sash of the back parlour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170041"/>window was down, the shutter open, and marks of footsteps on the table, which was close to the window; the persons had got through that window; there were some ribbons found in the bag, which were mine - I knew them again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The house is in Jeffries-terrace, Kentish-town, a mile and a half, or two miles from Grosvenor-square-the Venetian blind was up when I went to bed.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Lewis, the owner of the house. Every thing was safe when I went to bed soon after eleven o'clock; the kitchen-door is in the front of the house-that was safe; there was a bundle of old ribbons on the dresser; the knuckle of veal was in the front kitchen. When I came down, I found some matches and tinder on the table and footmarks where they entered. I had not been using matches or tinder the night before-the matches were broke in two, and burnt at both ends. I was the first person who was up. I found two holes had been bored with a gimlet in the pannel of the lower kitchen-door, which goes into the garden. The door which leads into the area was unfastened, but not open. When I went to bed I am sure they were all shut. I saw the ribbons at the office - They are the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Let us understand a little better about the doors - A. The door on the stairs opens immediately into the garden; it was open, and a decanter put to keep it so-that was shut at night; it did not appear to be forced, The door in the back kitchen also leads into the garden-that is the one that had the holes bored in it; both these doors were bolted the night before. The officers saw every thing in the same state that I found them.</p>

            . I am conductor of the Bow-street patrol. On the 14th of September, I was sent for to the prosecutor's house at eight o'clock in the morning. I found the things thrown about, and two of the doors open. There were some matches and tinder, and footmarks on the table-the matches had been used. The back-door, which leads into the garden, was kept open by a decanter put against it. There were two holes bored in the kitchen-door with a gimlet-both these doors lead into the garden-the top sash of the back window was open, so that a person could get in at it from the top of the out-house; the green blind was let down.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on my beat at the end of Gower-street, and saw the prisoners coming towards me at a quarter past four o'clock in the morning-it was day-light. Hale had a bag; I asked what they had in the bag? Hale said, "mushrooms"-Smith was close to him; he sat down the bag, and ran away; I pursued, and told my brother watchman to take care of the bag, which he did. I followed him; the other watchman prevented his going down Tottenham-court-road. We pursued, and apprehended them in Charlotte-street, Bedford-square, and took them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. They both ran the same way, and were both stopped together. I saw them coming down Gower-street, and going up to Bedford-square; they were stopped at the corner of Charlotte-street. They did not go out of the square.</p>

I assisted in the pursuit until they were taken; they both ran away.

            . I was constable of the night. I asked the prisoners where they got the property when it was brought in. Hale said, they were mushrooms-Smith was close to him. I examined it, and said, "they are hard mushrooms," and asked Hale where he got them? he said they had gone out mushrooming, found the bag in a ditch in Maiden-lane, and were returning home with it. Smith was close by him, and heard what he said. I said it was very unlikely they should return with the bag, without getting mushrooms, and not looking for them. I believe they made no reply-Smith did not speak. When Halo spoke, he said "they," (speaking of both)-Smith did not contradict him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There is a place at Pancras, called Maiden-lane, near the back of Jeffries-place, where the robbery was committed. I compared the gimlet which we found in the bag with the holes in the door - They corresponded exactly. Nothing was found on the prisoners.</p>
               <p>HALE'S Defence. When I came to the watch-house, I said I was going a mushrooming, and found them - I had not got any mushrooms. I found the bag in a ditch, partly covered over. I was walking by myself, about a quarter past four o'clock in the morning, in Maiden-lane, and was bringing the bag home; I got into Gower-street, the watchman stopped me, and asked what was in it? I opened it, and told him he should see. I ran away, but do not know why - I had no occasion to run. Smith ran too, but I do not know why - He was before me.</p>

I locked the door, and took the key with me. I fastened the windows and doors. I returned again before nine o'clock-it was quite dark; I found the door ajar-it pushed back as I put the key in; I immediately pulled it to and locked it. I called Lee, my next-door neighbour. I unlocked the door, and entered with the watchman, Lee, and another man. We found the counterpane, and several other things were thrown down stairs; we found the drawers had been opened on the first-floor, and some of the things thrown down stairs, and others moved about. We found the prisoners in the upper room. I secured them, and asked them what brought them there? Scott said, distress - We gave them in charge.</p>

I live with Mr. Shepherd; I was set to watch the prisoner, and hid myself behind a gap; I saw him come through the gap, about eight o'clock, with a bundle of wheat; he said to his son, look and see if there are any straws left on the hedges. I let him go on for about half a mile, I then stopped him, and asked what he had got - He said it was leasings; I told him he must come back to Mr. Shepherd with it; he said I had better let him carry it back to the field before he went to Mr. Shepherd's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. There were no leasings; we never leave such wheat behind. The leasing time had not arrived.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 16th of August, about a quarter before eleven o'clock at night, the prosecutrix was brought to the watch-house by a little boy; she was crying very much, and had neither hat nor shawl on, she appeared as if she had been in the dirt-her back was very muddy; she said she had been knocked down and robbed of her pocket-book, which contained five 1l. notes and five duplicates, and her hat and shawl; she described Myers to me very particularly-the boy who was with her, said her name was Myers. I went, with Field, to a public-house in Angel-alley, and found both the prisoners there together - I took Myers to the watch-house, the prosecutrix said it was her that took her pocket-book. She went before the Lord Mayor the next day, and described the other woman, and on Friday night I took Bamfield; she saw her on the Wednesday at the lock-up room, among five or six more, and picked her out as the woman who threw her down and took her hat and shawl, away. I found nothing on either of them.</p>

               <p>NARCISSA TAYLOR. I live in Crown-street, Finsbury-square. On the 22d of July, I called a coach in Bishopsgate-street to take me to Leadenhall-street, to the Battersea stage; while I was in the coach I took my purse out of my pocket to pay, the coachman drew up to the side of the stage, I stepped out of one into the other; I had not been in the stage three minutes before I missed my purse-Hoby went after the coach, but could not find it; he went to look for him again, and I went on to Battersea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. I am certain I did not drop it - I suppose it fell out of my lap. The prisoner was brought to me on the Tuesday after.</p>
               <p>PETER HOBY. I am a carver. I stood by the side of the stage, and assisted Miss Taylor out of the coach-the prisoner drove the coach; I saw him get on the step, put his body in, and look all over it. No. 367 was chalked on the coach. Miss Taylor said she missed her purse; I went after the coach, but could not find him at any of the stands; he was taken into custody on the Tuesday; if it had dropped between the coaches I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I drove to the stand in Mark-lane, and got a job immediately.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WESTLEY. I am a constable. On the 19th of July I was at my door in Park-street, Islington, and saw the prisoner go into the field behind the workhouse, with a bundle; I followed him and asked him what he had got there, he said they were his dirty clothes, which were going to be washed; I insisted on searching it - He put it down and ran away - I secured him and found four geese, which appeared to have been strangled, they were quite hot, the feathers and pillow-case were wrapped up in the chaise-cover. I found a boat-hook, a chisel, and a large knife upon him-the marks on the door fitted the boat-hook; he said he got them at Hackney.</p>

After I recovered myself I got up, and walked about twenty yards, I saw the watchman, who asked me if I had lost any thing; I told him I had been robbed of my hat and handkerchief - He told me to follow him. I went as far as Ratcliff-highway with him, when he told me he had found the man with my hat - I was just behind him; when I came up he shewed me the prisoner and hat; I told him if it was mine, it was a China hat, and had the name of "J.

I took the prisoner to the watch-house. The prosecutor was a little fresh, but not intoxicated. The prisoner put the hat in the kennel and wetted it, to show me how he had found it.</p>

On Sunday morning the 24th of August, about nine o'clock, I went home with some linen and left the prisoner in my parlour; I returned at ten o'clock, found the street - door open and my parlour-door locked; I got the key and unlocked the door and found every thing as I had left it. I had only one drawer that locked, I had lost the key of it for two days - I kept my money there - I broke it open; the prisoner knew that I had lost the key - I had left it on a chair, and she said she had seen it and taken it up and put it down some where else; I missed six 1l. bank notes out of one drawer, and five 1l. bank notes out of another drawer, which was not locked; I had only received the 5l. the night before; I also missed 3l. in silver, five handkerchiefs and a spencer; I saw the prisoner, and most of my property, at Hatton-garden, the next day. I cannot read, but know one of the notes by a tear in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. My husband is a gentleman's servant in the country.

            . I am driver of the Taunton Stage. I lodge with Mrs. Coleman, as I was coming to town, I took the prisoner up at the end of Chiswick-lane - I never saw her before-when we arrived at the Castle and Falcon she asked me what she had to pay, I told her 1s., she said she was poor, I gave her the 1s., back - She called for a glass of gin and water of which I drank, I went up stairs and drank with some friends - I came down in about twenty minutes and found her still in the tap-room - I had some tea with her - I recollected having to meet a party at Sadler's Wells, and told her of it - She expressed a wish to go, but said she had no money, but she had got friends and would pay me again if I would pay for her - I took her to my lodgings where she left her bundle, and then to Sadler's Wells - I did not meet the party I expected, and took her back to my lodgings. After the robbery, I went in pursuit of her on the Manchester road, as she had said she expected some money from Manchester; I was in the Leeds coach, and when we got to Barnet the prisoner stopped the coach that I was in, to take her to St. Alban's; she came out of the Woolpack Inn where we stopped - I seized her and sent for a constable, before he came she fell on her knees, and said she hoped I would not prosecute her; I told her I certainly should, for her ingratitude to Mrs. Coleman - I heard her throw something in the fire-place, and found five 1l. notes there rolled up together-when the constable came, the landlord found three 3s. pieces wrapped up in a 1l., note, in the fire-place; she had a basket with her tied up in a silk handkerchief-the first thing I found in it were three silk handkerchiefs of mine, and Mrs. Coleman's spencer. I can swear to one of the notes, as I had it a long time, and paid it to Mrs. Coleman about a fortnight before. I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I returned from Sadler's Wells, I asked Mrs. Coleman to let her stay for that night only - We all supped together; I did not undertake to meet her at Finchley - I did not search her basket, it was the constable. She did not leave her bundle in my room.</p>

               <p>AMELIA NEST. I live in Tottenham-court-road. I was told to watch the prisoners-Simms left Chambers and went into the house-Chambers waited for him a few doors off, Simma brought the carpets out and gave them to her; I followed them down Piercy-street and Rathbone-place, to Oxford-street into Charles-street, they came into Oxford-street again, and went down into St. Giles's. I told Jordan, and he went and took them into custody it-wa about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>ELSEY BURK. I was with Nest. Simms went into the house and brought the carpets out in about four minutes, and gave them to Chambers. We followed them into St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>JAMES JORDAN. I am a constable. On the 27th of August, I took the prisoners into custody, in a court in St. Giles's; they were opening the carpets. Simms ran out but I stopped him.</p>

            . I live with Mrs. Oliver. On the 8th of August, the prisoner came to our house and asked if we wanted to buy any wood; I asked him if Mrs. Oliver dealt with him, he said, "yes;" he said Mrs. Oliver said I must pay him, as he had seen her - I told him I had no money - He followed me into the room where the shawl was - He went away - I am almost blind, I did not see him - I knew it was the prisoner by his voice - He came to the door again, I told him I would not let him in, he said he wanted to leave the wood without the money. When Mrs. Oliver came home, she missed the things.</p>

I went to the fire and brought several of the things out of the three pair of stairs, and took them to Mr. North's, just by; I saw the prisoner come from Mr. Plumpton's door(I did not see him within the door), with a bundle under his arm, I watched him past Mr. North's door - He went into the crowd - I went after him and laid hold of him and took it from him; I asked him where he was going with the things, he either said he was going to take care of them, or going to take them home; I brought him back, with the officer's assistance, and took him to Mr. North's. The bundle contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BRANSCOMB. I am an officer. I was at the fire between eight and nine o'clock, keeping the crowd back; I saw the last witness and the prisoner with a bundle under his arm, he endeavoured to get among the crowd; I laid hold of him - He said he was not going to keep them, but was going to take them to some place, I do not exactly recollect; there was an open space for the things to go through the market, where every thing that was saved was taken; the prisoner was passing among the thickest of the crowd, quite away from the place mentioned, to convey the property away. I took him to the Compter, with great difficulty, he made a great resistance. I took him about fifteen yards from the fire - He said he lived on Saffron-hill, but would not say where there.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2d of September, a little before six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Castle-court, at Constardine's area window; he had a fishing rod in his hand - He was standing up-the top window sash was down; I saw him hook up the spoons in the saucers; I laid hold of him just as he pulled them them through the iron bars, we struggled together - I pursued after him and took him before he was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The spoons were tied in a cloth in the cups; I did not see him put the rod into the area. I took him in Cheapside, two hundred yards from the place.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to the Brown Bear, in Smithfield, early that morning about a benefit society, as I went through the court I saw the rod projecting out, curiosity led me to draw it up. I was stopped by the officer and a mob in Cheapside, and then secured.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Wild-street. I was in the market about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prosecutrix there. The prisoner and another boy stood by her-the prisoner was on one side, soon after he came in the middle. The prosecutrix stooped to take up her basket; I saw a hand drawn from her pocket - I did not know which of them it was; it was one of the boys; they walked on about four yards. I asked her if she had lost her money? she felt, and asked me who it was? I told her I saw a hand come out of her pocket-two of the boys ran away. As soon as the prisoner was taken she took her money from him. He said,"Mrs. Marney, let go; I have taken no money from any person."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw the prisoner until the time he was taken. She did not miss the money till I asked her. She said she had lost the pear-box, with the money in it.</p>

The prisoner ran against me; I seized him, and asked what money he had about him? he said he had no money about him whatever. I found two half-crowns in his left hand. one half-crown, and 1s. in his pocket; he attempted to swallow something; I found 3s. 6d. in his mouth - He denied having any money in his mouth.

On the 14th of February, about half-past five o'clock, I left my apartments to go to dinner, leaving my writing-desk locked, which contained my notes, in the room - I do not know whether I locked the door. I returned at eight o'clock, and missed the desk. I applied to Gambier for the numbers of the notes. Next morning my desk was brought to me at a public-house near Oxford turnpike on the London road; it was broken open, and the contents gone. I gave information at the Bank, and in August I received information that one of the 20l. notes had come in. There were 75l. in my desk in all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I made my loss known immediately. I received information from Crapper about three weeks ago, and not before. He was employed about the college at the time.</p>

            . I am a mason, and work for Mr. Knowles, of Oxford. On the 14th of February, I was employed at Merton College, cleaning a drain; it was necessary that I should work later than usual to finish it. About five o'clock in the afternoon I saw the prisoner come out of the right-hand staircase of the College with the desk under his arm - I had known him several years, he is a cabinet-maker; that door leads to Mr. Preston's room. He put the desk on his shoulder, and passed the quadrangle of the square very quick. After that, I saw him standing by the lodge without the desk. I asked him if she was at work in the College? he said, No, but he wanted to fetch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170050"/>some goods from a gentleman's room, and did not want him to see him. I asked if he was moving for any person? he said, No. I asked him what he was doing with the desk, when he passed the quadrangle? he said, he had seen no desk; "did I want to have him transported?" I asked what he said, pretending not to hear; he said, "Never mind," and went away into the left-hand staircase. I went to the lodge, but could find no person. As I returned, he abused me for going to see for any person. He heard me call the porter. I left him, saying, "If that is your temper, keep it." I went out of the College. As I returned, I met him by the hall-steps with the desk on his shoulder. I asked him if he was going to repair it? he seemed agitated, and dropped it nearly to the ground - He recovered it, and put it between two buttresses at the end of the chapel near the staircase, he left it there, and went towards the gate; he returned and pulled it about. I asked him what he was going to do with it? he left it, and said, "D-n the man, why don't he come?" I went away, stood behind a pillar, and saw him go out of the gate; in five minutes he returned and took it away. I did not know of the robbery till the prisoner was detained. I afterwards saw an account of his examination in the newspapers, and told what I knew.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was at work at the College the next day, and have been in Oxford ever since. I never heard of the robbery. I heard a desk had been lost from Corpus Christi College on the Sunday after, and supposed it must be the same. I did not know the prisoner had stolen it. I never said a word to any person about what I had seen; I had a little suspicion that he was after no good. I knew it to be the 14th of February, because I had bought some lead that day, and referred to the plumber's book.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, have you not said, at a public-house at Oxford, that although you had mistaken the day, you would come here and swear to it, as you should be well paid for your trouble - A. Never, that I know of.</p>

            , ESQ. I live in Bedford-square. I accompanied the prosecutor's father to the prisoner's house, and took the 20l. note, No. 13,229, with us, and asked him if he had not paid it for goods coming from Oxford? He said, he had paid a 20l. note, which he received of Claring, a coachmaster, at Oxford. He afterwards said it was at Woodstock. I asked him to find him out. He said he was a gardener-and next that he was a coachman. He afterwards said the note was lent him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He went to Bow-street with us - He was not in custody; the magistrate was not sitting. We told him to appear again.</p>

About a minute after, I saw a man on the opposite side of the way, lay hold of another-at the same time, immediately before me, another man was laid hold of, they were the prisoners. I saw the one on the other side of the way throw something from him-it was the prisoner, Hanshill. He was broughht over to me, and I accused him of taking my handkerchief; I missed it it was produced. The prisoners are two of the men I had seen following me - I looked them in the face.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I saw Mr. Dickinson, and another gentleman, going up the Strand. I watched the prisoners and another man for ten minutes before they followed Mr. Dickinson. I saw Hanshill go before the other two, nearer to Mr. Dickinson; they looked round two or three times, and attempted his pocket. I got on the other side of the way, and saw Hanshill take the handkerchief out; the other two were close behind him, to prevent his being seen; he turned round, spoke to them, and made off over the way. I seized him; the handkerchief was in his hand, he threw it away-Thompson came and picked it up. The other man got away-Forbes seized Stanfield.</p>

            . I live in Charles-street, Westminster. On the 9th of September, in the evening, about nine o'clock, I was in the <placeName id="t18170917-170-crimeloc860">Hay-market</placeName>

I saw that she was about two paces from us, she got behind me-the prisoner made a motion as if she had thrown the watch away, and on my stooping to look for it, she ran off, I followed her, calling out stop thief; I turned again to look for it, not finding it, I returned to the place, and had her taken into custody. I have never found it; she said she never saw me-it was worth seven guineas. Next morning I saw Jones at the office.</p>
               <p>JAMES CLARKE. I am a watchman. I stopped the prisoner, Hunter, as she ran through St. James's-market, hearing the cry of stop thief, Mr. Dupont came up and charged her with the robbery; she said she did not think he had a watch about him; the other prisoner came up, and tried to rescue her.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SUMMERLING. I am clerk to a warehouse-man, in Ironmonger-lane. On the 12th of July, about twenty minutes after five o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Swithin's-lane, Forresterspoke to Ennis, he shook his head, they both turned round and went to a picture shop, Forrester went to a gentleman's pocket-the gentleman went away. I could not see whether she took any thing, or not. Mr. Walsh came up, I saw her put her hand into his pocket, take his handkerchief out, and put it under her cloak, she then gave something to Ennis, and they both turned away. I asked Mr. Walsh if he missed any thing, he said he had lost his handkerchief; I told him Forrester had it, he asked her for it, she said she had not got it; I said then Ennis must have it, and ran after him - He ran away-Mr. Walsh collared him. I saw the handkerchief in Walsh's hand when he had hold of Ennis.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL SIMMONS. On the 12th of August I was in Threadneedle-street, and saw Forrester secured; the officer brought the other prisoner up and gave Forrester in my charge.</p>

On the 11th of July she came for a calf-skin, while she was looking at some, I saw her put something under her clothes; after rolling it up she sent me into the back shop for some sheep skins, while I was there I saw her put something under her clothes again, I called her into the counting-house, and charged her with the robbery - She acknowledged having took one, and produced it from her pocket - I sent for an officer; before he came I saw her throw a calf-skin from under her clothes.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BROWN. I am the landlord of the house. I was looking out of my window, and saw the prosecutor asleep on the table, the prisoner pretended to be asleep also; I saw him trying to get something out of the prosecutor's pocket - I saw him draw something out, and put it into his right hand waistcoat-pocket; the prisoner went towards the back-door to go out - I ran down and collared him, and told him he had committed the robbery, he denied it; after remonstrating with him he gave me the watch; he said he did not mean to keep it. I awoke the prosecutor - he gave him in charge. They did not appear to know each other.</p>

On the 16th of July I was in Oxford-street, three men accosted me, the prisoner spoke first; he said, he had just come out of Gloucestershire, and had received 12,000l. He said he was going to stop in town a few days, and wished to lodge his money in some safe hands. I recommended him to Messrs. Mastermans and Co. the bankers - I did not know any of them before. They said they were all strangers to each other, and did not know the way to Lombard-street. I said I was going through the city, and would shew it to them. I went about half a mile with them. The prisoner said, "Let us go into a public-house, and see if we have got the money, or we shall look foolish when we get to the banker's." I at first refused to go in, they said they should not be long. I went into the Spread-eagle, in Broad St. Giles's. The prisoner ordered a pint of beer, I paid for it. He went into the back-room, I followed him, the other two followed me. They stopped at the end of the table - I was on the other side. I thought they were going to count the money. They began quarrelling among themselves. They proposed to put down 5l. each - I did not put down my 5l. The prisoner said, "Come, put down 5l." - I asked him why? and said I had not got 5l. I began to think I was in bad company, and said I had only got 3l. - they told me to put that down - I put it down on the table. The prisoner gave me a piece of chalk, and said, "Now chalk;" I said I would not, as I knew nothing about chalking. He said, "Chalk any thing." I chalked the figure 3 on the table. He turned round and spoke to the others, and then turned back and picked up my three 1l. notes - They were very close together; he gave them to the other man, who said he came from Gloucester. One of them picked up the other notes (as I supposed them to be), and went out - I followed them. A man asked me if I had lost any thing? I told him the prisoner had taken 3l. from me - He ran after him and stopped him. I am sure the prisoner is the man who took the notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I have been thirtyone years in my place. I was not to have any thing for my trouble. They said nothing about hiding the figure under the hat. I put the money down through fear - I did not lay a wager.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH, I am a beadle of St. Giles's. On the 16th of July, I was just by the Spread-eagle, and saw them go in - I waited on the outside. In about a quarter of an hour a little man, in black, came out in a very great haste; after him came the prisoner, and next to him the prosecutor, who seemed agitated. I asked him if he had lost any thing? he said he had been robbed of 3l. I asked him which man it was? He said it was the prisoner; I laid hold of him-the other made his escape. The prisoner said "Nonsense! don't take me-I'll take care the man's money shall be made good, and you shall have a handsome present for yourself." I took him into custody, and found a pocket-book on him, with 1l. 10s. in it. He called me aside, and said, "For God's sake don't take me before a magistrate. I'll give you 20l., and the man's money shall be made good to him. I will produce a friend in ten minutes who will settle it." I found four flash notes in the prisoner's box, a bill for 395l., and some imitations of 2l. notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prosecutor said he had been robbed of the money.</p>

               <p>THOMAS FITZGERALD. I am an officer. On Sunday morning, the 31st of August, about five o'clock, I was opposite my door, in Long-alley, Moorfields, and saw the prisoner with a bag on his shoulder; I watched him - He crossed, and put the bag down at an area-gate just by; a boy was with him - He came out of the alley. I asked him if he had left them? he said, Yes. The boy went up the alley; I came up to him, and asked him who he wanted? he said he wanted a person of the name of Jenkins. I told him there was no such person there; he got away-the prisoner was close to me, I laid hold of him, and told him he must go with me. He begged me not to take him, and resisted. I gave him to another man while I fetched the bag, which contained seven carriage-glasses. I found an open knife in his pocket.</p>

When I returned, I saw him going on with the basket of damsons on his shoulder. I followed him down several turnings; he ran as fast as he could with them. I stopped him, and asked him where he got them from? he said a man gave them to him to take care of. I asked where he was going with them? he said he did not know. As soon as I laid hold of him, he said, "Shew me a little mercy." I took him to the watch-house.</p>

On the 3d of August I met the prisoner in Holborn, about eleven o'clock at night. We walked down Holborn together, she took me to the Coach and Horses, in Red Lion-street, where we had some rum and water. I took my notes out to pay for it; I changed a 1l. note, and had a 5l. and two 1l. notes remaining in my left-hand breeches-pocket, when I came out. We agreed to meet there the next evening. She was fearful of her parents being angry, and we took a coach to go to her house. As we were going down the <placeName id="t18170917-198-crimeloc1019">New Road</placeName>

I told her there was a 5l. note - She said she had dropped that on the straw at the bottom of the coach. I told her I would give her in charge till she found it. I called to the coachman, and told him to drive to the next watch-box, and gave her in charge. She said it was in the coach-it was not found. She said she threw it out of the coach-window. I went to look for it, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170058"/>could not find it. When I returned she told the people I had given it to her. I never took any liberties with her,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I went before the magistrate the next day, he refused to have any thing to do with it; I went to the Bank and described the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not told that there never was such a note issued - A. No; it was No. 15,298, I made the entry of it the next day. The coachman is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not the prisoner call out first to the coachman to assist her - A. She did not. I have the number of the coach. I received the note of Mr. Perkins, of Smithfield. I got the number of the note from him, and told him I had been robbed. The beadle and his wife searched the prisoner. I was never in a court of justice before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not concerned in the prosecution of a man named Woodward - A. I was not examined to my knowledge - I gave information against him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I live at No. 7, Barrosa-terrace, which is the next house. On the 19th of September, the prisoner, Knock, called on me for the key which was left with me, and a bill in the window referred persons to me for it; the other prisoner was with him. I believe him to be the man; when they had got the key I went into my yard, and my attention was drawn to the house by a noise like wrenching, I got over the paling to the house, looked throught the kitchen window, and saw Knock and the other prisoner apparently twisting the leaden pipe - They were stooping, I ran to the front door and into the kitchen, and charged them with stealing the pipe; I collared the other man, one of them took his hand out of his pocket, put it through a broken window, and threw something into the garden; the other man rushed by me into the street, Knock ran after me and threw me down stairs, they both got out and took separate directions; I followed Knock through a field, calling, "Stop thief!" I secured him and brought him back; I never lost sight of him. I found the leaden pipe twisted off, and we fixed it to the other part and it corresponded; it was fresh wrenched off-the brass cock was found immediately, under the window in the garden.</p>

            . I have only seen the prisoner once that was at a public-house near Burlington-house in Piccadilly, I do not know the sign, I was having a pint of beer, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170063"/>the prisomer come in and a man behind him; the man brought the things, and asked him 30s. for them. He said he had not got so much. The man went out, and the prisoner went out when he had drank his beer. Very shortly after, the man came in, and said he would take the money that he offered, which was 22s.. The prisoner paid the money, and the goods were delivered to him. There were glass dishes such as that, and a large bowl or globe like a lamp. I believe those produced are the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What are you - A. A waterman. I work at Billingsgate in general. I am apprentice to Mr. Sellers, who is a waterman and lighterman. I do not know what the prisoner is - I am not acquainted with him - I never saw him before to my knowledge. I do not know the man who sold them - They were bought and sold in the public tap-room. I do not know what day it was - I think it is better than a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you recollect the month - A. I believe it was August, or the latter end of July - I think it was the latter end of July. I did not drink with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who served you - A. The landlord. I do not know his name; I was never in the house before - They both drank together. I only staid while I drank my beer - I looked at the newspaper. I was not there above a quarter of an hour; the things were taken out and put on the table-the landlady was there. There were a few more people in the room. She could see them as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner - A. We talked together coming towards Coventry-street; we went as far as there, and then parted.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner find you out - A. His wife came to me. I told the prisoner where I worked.</p>

I saw a cart come to the door about eight o'clock in the morning; a person put a stove in it, and a bundle which contained a blanket and other things - I saw them handed out to the man who drove the cart. I followed the cart towards Stepney-green, the man driving fast. I was fearful of losing sight of it. I overtook it at Trafalgar-square, and told the prisoner I was an officer, and that he had stolen property in the cart. He whipped the horses very hard, and also struck me with the whip while I held the horse; he jumped out of the cart, and made his escape. I took the property to a public-house. I went back to the house, a woman opened the door, and as soon as she saw me, she attempted to shut it, I got in, and found the prisoner up one pair of stairs. Powis asked him where the stove was which he brought there on the Saturday? he said he knew nothing of it. I asked if his name was Gale? he said it was. I asked him where the horse and cart where? he then said his name was not Gale, but his real name was Tilling - I took him into custody, and detained the woman; the horse and cart, he said were not his. The prisoner is not the man who drove the cart.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH POWIS. I went to the prisoner's house; he said his name was Gale. I told him I thought his name was Tilling - He said it was Gale; the cart had the name of Gale upon it; afterwards he said his name was not Gale but Tilling. He said he could tell something about the robbery.</p>

I asked him where it was? he took me in to the prisoner, who shewed it to me. I asked the prisoner what he wanted for it? he said, 20s. I asked him if it was his own? he said he made it himself, and lived in Dean-street, Holborn. I questioned him further about it; he then said he lived in Wellington-place, Drury-lane; he appeared in a hurry to get rid of it. Suspecting him, I sent for Barnley; when he came he said he lived some where else. He said it was his own, and distress was the cause of his selling it at that price - He agreed to sell it to Barnley for 15s.</p>

I told him, if he would tell me how he got it I would pay him for it. He said he lived in Dean-street - I took him into custody. When he got to the office, he said he did not live there.

I was not drunk; my wife and Weaver were with me-there were twenty or thirty persons in the room. They took my beer away from me. I laid my head down - I got up.

I was immediately seized, and the handkerchief taken off my neck. I said nothing to provoke them. Carrol untied my handkerchief.

We went to two or three houses, and had a pint or two of beer. I believe the poorhouse was at Whitechapel. We had a pot or two of beer before we got there, we also went home and had a pot of beer. I do not remember whether we had any spirits, or not. We stopped at the first public-house two hours; my husband was not sober - I do not think Weaver was drunk.</p>

I sent for half a pint of rum and a pot of porter, which I paid for with silver. I went out with Arthur to a public-house in Chandos-street, and asked the landlord to change a 5l. note; a man just by said it was a 10l. note - I found out my mistake; I returned to the house without getting it changed. I went to bed, and awoke between twelve and one o'clock at night-Arthur was there. I heard some person say, "Go along!" I do not know who it was. I got up, and found my pantaloons had been taken away. I had locked the door before I went to bed, and put the key into my waistcoat pocket, which I put under my head. I found my pantaloons in the room-my 10l. note was gone - I alarmed the watchman. When I opened the door, I found the prisoner, Hopkins, on the landing-place.</p>

I apprehended Mansfield at four o'clock in the morning in Angel-alley, and told her what she was charged with - She denied it; the prosecutor said she was the woman; she said there was somebody else concerned in it, and she was not the person, and that he had been with other women. I found nothing on her. I knew she lived in Green's house in Bowl-court, I went to the house, and knocked at the door, Green answered me, and said that she would not let me in; I asked her if Mansfield was there, she said, No; she said she could not speak to me, and at last she let me in. This was a little after one o'clock. I asked her about it, she said she had only two 1l. notes, which she had received of Mansfield, and she had left them at the public-house.

On the 21st of September, at dusk, I saw the prisoner, Cavendish, standing about my window, he came in after a little while, and asked if I bought old silver, producing a silver ladle; I asked him how he came by it, and what the cipher had been erased for? he said it belonged to another boy, for whom he had it to sell, and who was waiting just by - I told him to fetch the boy in; he brought the prisoner, Wiltshire, in - I asked him why he erased the cipher, he said he rubbed it to see if it was silver. I sent for a constable, and gave them in charge. I found that it belonged to Mr. Brandon.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner's house with a search-warrant, and found part of a kettle strap among a parcel of old metal, in a bag, tied up, ready to be sent off; I found the mark on it, and told the prisoner there was a piece answering the description, and laid it on the counter. I told him I had come to look for stolen goods. While I was stooping to look over the remainder of the metal, I saw the prisoner put the piece in his pocket; he produced it from his pocket - I believe I asked him to produce it. They said he had put it in his pocket, I told him to pull it out.</p>

            . I was in the employ of Messrs. Tylor. On Thursday, the 17th of July, I stole two new copper tea-kettle straps, from my masters' shop; I took them home, and sent them to the prisoner by my child, who is between six and seven years of age - I got four-pence for the two - They were whole when I sent them, and quite new, not polished - They were perfect; the prisoner knew where I was working at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I stole them both together, their value is according to their weight; they would be worth 1s., to any body that had the same use for them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go with the child, therefore you did not know that she sold them? - A. No; I did not quarrel with the prisoner, I left the prisoner about seven months ago - I never said I would be revenged on him.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say you would have your revenge with him for turning you out of his house? - A. Never such a word came from my mouth; I never saw the prisoner from the time I left him till I saw him at the office; I was taken into custody the next day, I was committed here and have been at largeo since. I had no promise made me to give evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever have any conversation with him, either before or after you were taken up? - A. No.</p>

               <p>ABRAHAM HARCOURT. I am a brass-founder and a judge of copper, (looking at the two straps) they are sold by weight and are worth 13d halfpenny per pound; as old copper they are worth 9d., at the full extent; if I was to purchase them I should think 9d., the full value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you venture to buy them as old copper? - A. NO. I have known instances of such things being sold as old copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I live in Sutton-street, Clerkenwell, I am not a master.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth in the manufactured state? - A. Thirteen pence halfpenny a pound. I never saw the prisoner before-my master sent me to value them.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner a little while; I am a confectioner, and live in Middlesex-street, Aldgate. On the 28th of May, the day after the robbery, or shortly after, I spoke to the prisoner about the robbery, in consequence of what Langley told me, I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing of the notes; this was at my house, he was in the habit of coming there, his son was at home at the time - I could not find him - I asked the prisoner what Langley was taken up for, he said he could not tell me; I went to the gaol and asked Langley, he(Langley), told me that he had stolen the notes "himself" and given them to the boy. The prisoner said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards ask the prisoner about it? - A. He never told me he had the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he tell you? - A. He said he knew nothing about the pocket-book-at another time he said he had a 10l. note, which he offered me for 9l.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170069"/>Q. Did he say what it was, or where he got it - A. I told him if it was stolen I would have nothing to do with it. I was examined before respecting the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, or did he not tell you where he got the 10l. note - A. He had it in his hand, I told him I thought it was the note that was stolen from the coach - He made no reply, but took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he never acknowledged to you that he had the pocket-book - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever tell you any thing about the pocketbook, or did he always persist that he knew nothing about it - A. He always persisted in knowing nothing about it. I am no relation to the prisoner.</p>

On the 17th of July, I was set to watch on the upper warehouse, and saw the two prisoners, on the roof between twelve and one, there was a carpenter on the roof at the time, when he left, I saw the prisoners walk to and fro several times, I saw them together in the gutter, employed in laying the gutter, they were plumbers; I saw Rowe pull up his breeches, I remained in my place and saw them come from the roof, Durant came first and the other followed him, I thought Rowe looked bulky; I followed them down from the upper warehouse to the wharf, when I came there, I found Mr. Oliver on the wharf, and the gates locked; the prisoners went towards the gate and found them locked, they returned to the entrance of the first-floor above; Durant went to the ladder and called to Rowe, and said "there is a road this way we have no occasion to wait;" as Rowe was going up the ladder, Mr. Oliver took him - He resisted - I assisted - We searched and found forty-three pounds of lead concealed under his waiscoat, supported by a leather nailed to the lead; when I saw him pull up his breeches Durant was close to him - He must have seen what he was about.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. The lead was not fixed to the gutter.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HUGHES. I am a beilded. I was erecting the premises; the lead was stolen while I was attending here on the Jury.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Marylebone. On the 28th of August, when I came home I found the coat had been cut down, I hung it up and in about a quarter of an hour I saw it fall down again, I went over the way and watched, and saw several young men come up-it hung inside the shop, the prisoner came up held his apron up and let it fall in - He ran off. I secured him. I never lost sight of him.</p>

I asked her if she had brought the silk handkerchiefs? she said she would bring them in half an hour - She took the things with her.

On the 16th of September, about twelve o'clock, I was standing at the door, and saw the prisoner looking at some ribbons on the Counter, and while my young man's back was turned, I saw him put a piece of ribbon into his pocket. I sent for a constable, and desired him to stop him as he came out. He was taken to the watch-house, and nine pieces of ribbon were found on him.</p>

I met the prisoner in Devonshire-mews, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening; I was with him till half past eleven, when I went into the public-house at the corner of the Mews. I had two 1l. notes when I met him - I changed one - We supped together; I spent 9s. 6d. - I was sober. I found it was too late to go home, the prisoner said I should sleep with him. I went with him to the Mews in Upper Montague-street, which belongs to the prisoner's father - He looked up, and said he could not get in - We agreed to lay in the stable. I fell asleep; I awoke at two o'clock, and found the prisoner's hand in my pocket-the half-guinea was wrapped in the 1l. note in the pocket. I laid hold of his hand; he made his escape with the money out of the window - I ran after him, but could not find him. About six weeks afterwards I met him - He said, if I would not mention it, he would get me the money by eight o'clock; I let him go; he did not bring it to me, and was taken up about eight weeks afterwards.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 21st of July, I saw the two prisoners on Saffron-hill, about nine o'clock, with the articles, offering them for sale; each had some. Barnley joined me - We apprehended them. James Welch, one of the prisoners, ran away. We secured him - We took the property from him before he ran away. When we got to the watch-house, John Welch said the other gave him the property, and he was going to sell it for him. He told me I could find them at his lodgings. I went there, and found two waiters, a tea-kettle, and two frying-pans-

We went and called Mr. Hale, and they ran away as fast as they could; another person was with them - I do not know who it was, he came over the garden wall. I described Sawyer, and he was taken the same night. I am sure he is the same man.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. Mr. Younie desired me to watch his premises. On the 14th of July, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, I placed myself in a house opposite-after I had been there sometime I saw the prisoner, Johnston, go by; in about five minutes after Sullivan went into the house by a little gateway, and opened the front shop door; he took down the door shutter, and kept looking up and down the street, he nodded his head, and Johnston immediately came up with an empty bag under his arm, and went into the shop, Sullivan came and talked to him; I saw him go to the back-shop and deliver something to Johnston. Johnston came out, I followed him, and asked him what he had got in his bag - I found a set of fire-irons in it - He begged for mercy - He threw the nails out of his pocket. While I was examining the bag I told him not to throw any more away. I found another parcel of nails when I took Sullivan - He begged for mercy, and resisted very much.</p>

The prisoner took us to the Ship, at the top of St. John-street, Brick-lane, and gave us a pot of beer; he then asked me for the bill of the hay, which I gave him, he said it was all correct, but he must go for his friend and would return in five minutes; I followed him to Haremarsh - I lost him there - I do not know whether he went to the same house or not; as I returned back I found Crick had stopped the prisoner in a street by St. John-street, in a different direction from where I saw him going, and in a different direction from the house he was to go to - He said he must go to the White Hart for his friend - I went with him, he asked if a man had been there enquiring for him, they said "yes, but he did not stop;" he pulled out a pocket-book containing bills - I saw no money. I told him I saw there was no money for us, and we wanted the money, that our master would be angry with us for waiting so long; it was then half-past six o'clock; we asked him to go with us to our master if he would not pay us, he seemed willing to go, but wanted to go to the Blue Ball in Old Cock-lane, to see if he could find his friend - We went there and had a pint of beer; we had left the carts at the Ship - He wanted us to go to the next house to see if his friend was there; we went, and was told he was gone to Hampstead, and they did not know when he would return; he then said if we would take a draft he would get us one - We told him no, for if he had a draft he could get cash, he said it was too late-it was then eight o'clock. We went back to our carts and took him with us - He went quietly.</p>

               <p>JOHN GILLMAN. I am a Thames Police-officer. On the 8th of August, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was on the water; the Dover Castle ship was laying near Blackwall in the City canal. I saw a boat rowed towards the ship, the prisoners, Roberts and French, were in it, they rowed alongside; a bundle was thrown out of the ship into the boat, and then another; I then went towards the ship, the boat was rowing towards me, when they saw me they pulled towards the opposite shore; Roberts knew me, I called to him by his name, they rowed on the opposite side; I called to Bly, who was on the opposite side, to stop them, which he did and sent them over to me; I found the bundles in the boat were cables - I asked Ro<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170080"/>berts where they got them, he said from a man; French said Roberts had told him to help him row the boat. I think that was the case. I went to the ship and found the other part of the cable, it appeared to have been recently cut. I saw the prisoner, Williams, on board, he was given into my custody, we told him we took him on suspicion of robbing the ship. Bly went to look for Exham, who was a ship-keeper.</p>
               <p>DANIEL BLY. I am an officer. I stopped the prisoners, Roberts and French, who were rowing the boat; I afterwards went on board the ship and saw Williams there; I afterwards found Exham concealed in the coal-hole, without his shoes; I found another bundle on the gun-deck, tied up ready to be moved, and the cable which had been just cut; I asked Exham what he did in the coal-hole, with his shoes off; he said he did not know who was looking for him, and he was afraid.</p>

            . I am a sailor. I was on board the Dover Castle. On the 7th of August, the day before the prisoners were taken, Roberts and Exham were on board the ship, Exham fetched a pot of beer and left Roberts on board, when I came on the gun-deck, I found the cable cut and concealed under some leather, next morning about nine o'clock, Roberts came on board with some bags, I asked him what he was going to do with them, he said he was going to put them out of port directly; I gave information to Gillman; Exham was the ship-keeper; the cable was whole a few days before that. Williams did not belong to the ship.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HAMILTON. I am a Thames Police officer. On the 17th of September I was on the river, near Blackfriars Bridge, about a quarter before five o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoners pulling up the river in a skiff, with the tide, going through the bridge, on the Middlesex side. The bowsprit was fastened to their boat - I pulled towards them, and they let it go; they knew me. I asked them why they let it go? Godwin said he did not let it go, but the stuff that held it broke. I asked them were they got it? Finnis said, they got it from Mr. Bruet's, of Blackwall, and were going ashore to the dock (Pointing to Whitefriars Dock). I took them to the police-ship. While they were in the ship, a knife was taken from Godwin-the blade had tar on it, as if it had been cutting rope. When at the office, Godwin said, it was no use to tell a lie, that they picked it up in the London Dock, and were going to take it to the Water Bailiff; it was forty-four feet long. I examined the rope-ends at Mr. Bond's which it had been fastened to-it appeared to have been cut. It was a tar rope, and corresponded with that in the boat.</p>

            , who is a mast-maker, and lives at Limehouse. On the evening of the 16th of September we had the bowsprit to alter; it was fastened to a raft in the water at the main float with a rope. I saw it safe at seven o'clock; the tide was then running down. If it had broken loose, it would have gone down the river-the tide turned about twelve o'clock. Our premises are a mile lower down the river than the London Docks. If it had broken loose, it could not have floated outside, the craft would prevent its getting clear off there; the spars were let loose when the rope was cut, and they remained safe; they were further outside than the bowsprit. I missed it at daylight the next morning-the rope was cut; I saw it at the office; it is our's, and is worth 6l. 10s.</p>

            . I am Mr. Hart's bailiff. Child told me he had lost the pollard. I saw one of the sacks at Kingston Bridewell, when the prisoner was in custody, and knew it to be Mr. Hart's. The prisoner kept a cornchandler's shop at Hampton-wick.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HARDING. I am a labourer. At the end of January, (about the 27th or 28th), the prisoner told me he wanted some barley-meal for his pigs, and he thought there was some to be got down at old Fowler's (Mr. Hart's bailiff), and asked me to go down with him the next morning - I agreed to go at two o'clock; I got up at two o'clock and went to his house; I threw some stuff up at his win<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170081"/>dow to awake him. We went to Mr. Hart's farm-it was three o'clock, by Kingston clock. He said we must see about going in. I went through the yard, and over a gate into another yard; he opened the door, which was on the latch; we went in, and found two sacks, we thought it was barley-meal - We took it, and made the best of our way to his house; when we got near it, we thought we heard people about, took it back, and left it at my house at Kingston-bridge. I struck a light, and found it was pollard - He went home, to lay down for an hour or two, and about six o'clock he brought one of his own sacks to put it in, and said he would fetch it at breakfast-time - He took the other sack with him. At dinner-time he fetched the pollard, and gave me 3s. for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. When was you taken up - A. The beginning of May, about some pigs; I then told every thing. I gave evidence against another man at Clerkenwell the other day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not turn evidence at Sussex - A. No. I never was in trouble about any deals.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever threaten to prosecute people if they did not give you money - A. No, I was in trouble about some cheeses. I expect to get out of custody for my evidence here.</p>

I asked him several times if he knew him? he said he did; he said he lived in some yard(which I do not remember). He took a watch and some money out of his pocket, two keys and a knife. I told him he had better take him home as soon as he could - I am positive the prisoner is the man. I helped him to the end of my beat. He said he would get him a lodging - He got him one, paid for it, and put him to bed. When he came down, I told the landlady that the prisoner had the watch and money, and that he said he was his friend. Next night, I heard the prosecutor had not got his property. He came to me about half-past ten o'clock - I went in search of the prisoner. He described him to another watchman; they took him. I am certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

On the 11th of September, between one and two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner had some coffee at my shop - He shewed me a silver hunting-watch, capped and jewelled, which he said he took from his fellow-servant, whom he found asleep in the street. The next night, between ten and eleven o'clock, I heard of the robbery, and described the prisoner; about eleven o'clock he came in - I had him secured.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About half-past two o'clock, O'Hara and the prisoner came to me; the prisoner asked me to have some coffee, which I did; he pulled out a hunting-watch, and said he had taken it from his fellow-servant, with his money and two keys, and said one of the keys was the key of a chest. The next night Ayres came to me, and asked me if I knew the prisoner? I told him I should know him again; he told me to take him up. In about a quarter of an hour I was called in and found the prisoner there. I asked him if he had returned the watch to the man; he said he had given it to an acquaintance of his; I asked him if he called upon him in the morning, he said he did.</p>

               <p>JAMES CASHWAY. On the 16th of September, I and my wife were going home about ten o'clock at night, to Swan-street, Bethnall-green, we were at the corner of <placeName id="t18170917-297-crimeloc1520">Bacon-street</placeName>

I left him at the public-house while I went to the watch-house, and when I returned I found he had made his escape. I told Turner to look after him, and on the 20th he took him. I had seen the prisoner before the robbery, and knew his person; I am sure he is the man. I have not received my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I was quite sober. The prisoner was taken again four days after. I never prosecuted any person before.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE CASHWAY. I am the wife of the last witness; I was with him at the corner of Bacon-street, when the prisoner and two others rushed against us; two of them ran down Swan-street; my husband said he was robbed, crossed over after the prisoner, and took him; he resisted, and tried to get away. I held him tight, he tore my clothes to pieces, and said "let me go." We said we would not. We got him to the Half Moon public-house; a man came in, called him by a different name, and said"it was not George; I will be bail for him for 100l. or 150l." While my husband was at the watch-house two gentlemen came in, and said if I would give charge they would take him to the watch-house; on taking him out, the man, and some others, rushed against them, and rescued him. I am sure the prisoner is the man, I did not lose sight of him until he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There was a light in the public-house window. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Some men came along and pushed me against him, when they took me.</p>

I was returning to my ship, and met the prisoner, Middleton, in the Commercial-road, she asked me for something to drink - She took me to a private house; I sent out for some porter, but before she returned I fell asleep-Burn was in the room. My watch was safe before I met them. The watchman awoke me next morning about three o'clock, when I missed my watch, and 3l. 10s. I saw the prisoner in custody at the office, and a dollar, which I knew by a mark.</p>

On the 4th of August, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in Cuthbert's public-house, the prisoners came in with a bottle, Middleton, threw a gold coin down, the landlady refused it; she then offered her a Spanish dollar, but they could not agree about its value, and she left it until the morning. I had seen the prisoner, Burn, about half-past eleven o'clock, she told me the girl had robbed a man of his watch, and ran away. I found him asleep with his pockets turned inside out. He said he had been robbed, and gave Burn in charge.</p>

She was taken up the next day.</p>

I met one of the prisoners in Drury-lane, and asked her the way to the city; she was leaving me, when the other prisoner came up, and persuaded me to go home with her into Charles-street. I went to bed there; when I got up the two prisoners were there. I asked them where my things were? I missed the articles stated in the indictment. They said I had no more than what was in the chair when they met me, and that my things were unpinned, as if I had been with some person, which was not the case. As I went out, the young woman in the next room asked me if I had lost any thing? I told her I had. She went with me to Bow-street, and got an officer, who took them into custody. My apron and petticoat were found on one of the prisoners, and the stays on the other, they were wearing them.</p>

The prisoner came in, and offered the spoon for sale-the man refused to buy it. I asked him how long he had had it? he said two years, and his father had it before him. I took him to a public-house, told him I did not believe him, and asked him again how long he had had it? he said, three years, and he bought it of a sailor in the street for 9s. I took him into custody. After advertising it, and not finding an owner, he was discharged. I afterwards found it belonged to Mr. Deacon, and took him again on the 12th. I am sure he is the man; I knew him before.</p>
