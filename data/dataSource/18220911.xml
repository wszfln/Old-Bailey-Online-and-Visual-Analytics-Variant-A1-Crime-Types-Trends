I was pulled down by one of the women, and held down till my money was taken - I felt it go out of my pocket; I was kept down till the person who took it got out of my sight. When the money was gone a man caught hold of me, and pretended to assist me - this was nearly nine o'clock at night; it was dark, and the lamps were lit. The prisoner is the woman who was present a minute or two before the money was taken, but I did not see her at the time it was taken - I could not turn round I was so penned down by another girl who was with the prisoner when I first saw her. There were two women present when my money was taken. As soon as I could turn round the prisoner was gone, and the other one got away - I saw the other run away alone; I did not see the prisoner while they were taking the money or afterwards. I did not see who took it, but I saw the prisoner with the woman who held me before; they were talking together. I did not see her again till above a week afterwards. I had been drinking, and was not sober - I might have drank three or four pints of beer, and a glass or two of gin or so - I walked without assistance, and was particular in fastening my pocket. The man got away. I was pulled down by the two women - I had seen the prisoner not two minutes before. I saw no other women but the prisoner and another. I lost all my money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You saw nobody take hold of you - A. One of the women and somebody took hold of me behind, but I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or not. I did not see the man till the instant the money was gone. I believe the neigbourhood is the resort of women of the town. I am satisfied that the prisoner was in company with the woman a few minutes before. I saw her again a fortnight or three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not brought up four times before you ventured to swear to her - A. Three times I believe.</p>

The prisoner left it in our stables, and I used it as ours until Lewis claimed it. I refused to give it up till I knew the law. We are coachmasters.</p>

About twelve o'clock in the morning, I had just left the room, and the window open - an iron railing covered the area, which enabled a person to get in. I saw the prisoner in the room tying the curtains up - he had moved them out of the basket on the floor, and was tying them up in a silk pocket handkerchief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110005"/>of his own. I asked what he wanted? I did not wait for a reply, but ran out of the room, being frightened. I ran down the garden to call the gardener, and saw the prisoner running across the fields, near the house. I called Stop thief! but I did not see him taken. In five minutes Stone, the officer, brought him back - I am sure he is the man. He left the curtains in the room; he had only tied two corners of the handkerchief. They are worth 50 s. The window had been left open.</p>

On the 12th of August, the prisoner and four more boys came to the shop - the prisoner and three of them were inside; one of them asked for a penny loaf and paid me for it; they all went out except the boy who had the loaf - I missed five weights from the end of the counter immediately they went out; the boy asked me for the bottom loaf - I said they were all alike, and gave him the top one. I went round the counter; the boy who bought the bread had just got out - I saw the other boys running off. I called to him to stop his companions, for they had got my weights; he said he knew nothing of it, and went after them - I did not follow. The prisoner and another, who was discharged, were brought back. I asked the prisoner if he knew anything about the weights; he said he did not take them, but he knew where they were, and if the witness would go back with him, he would shew him where they were. Part of the loaf was found in his pocket.</p>

I took them back to Mrs. Gibbs's shop; she asked the prisoner where the weights were; he said, he did not know, he did not steal them, that the other stole them, and if I would go back with him he would shew me where they were thrown; but the constable came and took him - he found some bread on him, which appeared to be part of a penny loaf.</p>

Upon turning to the left I saw the prisoner walking off with it on his knot, about forty yards off. I pursued and asked what he was going to do with it? he said, what was that to me, and that they were not mine. I took him to the watch-house. He said, a man gave him 1 d., lifted them on his head, and told him to take them to a cart by the watch-house - he insisted that they were not mine after I gave charge of him; I am sure they were mine. I have seen him frequently in the market with a knot. He did not say he was employed to carry them till he got to the watch-house. It is usual to employ porters to carry to the carts - he did not offer to shew me the cart; but struck me and tried to escape.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Coffee-house. On the 12th of July, about eleven o'clock at night, I saw the castors on the side-board. I found the prisoner in the parlour about half-past eleven o'clock, and asked what he wanted; he made some confused answer, which I could not understand. Mr. Osborne came over and secured him - he searched him in my presence; but found nothing on him.</p>

            . I keep a public-house opposite Slaughter's Coffee-house. On the 12th of July, I followed Austin, who had informed me that a man had gone in at the prosecutor's window - I saw the prisoner looking out from the parlour door down the passage. I went in and secured him - I searched, but found nothing particular on him. I asked how he came there; he said he understood there was a robbery going on, and came to inform them - this was after I had secured him. I asked why he came in at the window if he came to give information; he made no reply.</p>

He was in the cellar cleaning boots. He came up stairs in a few minutes with his coat off. While he went up stairs, I went down into the cellar. Nobody but him was employed there. I found his coat hanging up, and his pockets full of loose tea; there were twelve or fourteen ounces, which corresponded with the tea in my canister, which stood in the warehouse - we never sell less than 1 lb., and never sold him any. I let him go that morning without saying anything; but I told my brother; and next morning my brother concealed himself in the warehouse, and he was apprehended. I told him of the tea I had found in his pocket the morning before; he said he had nothing of the kind. On the 15th we found three quarters of pound in papers in the corner of his hat. We send it into the country to be sold in small quantities. He pleaded distress.

About seven o'clock the prisoner came to work, and about eight he was going to breakfast - he went round the counter, and took off the lid of the canister; out of which he took a quantity of tea, and put it in his pocket - he then came round to the other end of the counter, where the teas which are packed up are kept - he took off his hat, and put three packages into the hat; put the handkerchief over them, and put it on his head; he was going out of the door - my brother said he wanted to speak to him. I then came forward, and said,</p>
               <p>"You are taken at last," and fetched Drinkwater, who found the tea in his hat, and some loose in his pocket.</p>

There was some cheese about a yard and a half from her. She paid for the butter, and sat down in the shop, and dropped a ready reckoner out of her hand - instead of taking that up, she took up half a cheese, weighing 13 lbs.; she went to the door, and I stopped her just outside, and took it from under her shawl. She said she knew nothing about it, threatened to strike me, and I let her go.</p>

On the 29th of July, about ten o'clock at night, I was in my shop, and heard a crack at the window; it was quite dark. My shop lamps are gas, they were lit, and the two shopman were in the shop. I put on my hat, went out at the private door, into the street, and saw the prisoner at the window - I am sure he is the man. I walked past him, and perceived him fumbling at the corner of the window. Two men were at the corner of the street all the time, about three or four yards from the window. I passed the prisoner; crossed to the other side of the way; he left the window and looked in at the shop-door. I continued on the opposite side, and saw him walk round the window, return again, then walk up Parliament-street, and return to the window several times for the space of three quarters of an hour. I kept walking about, frequently passing him. I was on the opposite side of the way, and perceived him put his hand in, and take something out of the window, which I thought were handkerchiefs. I knocked him down with my fist, and these handkerchiefs fell on my neighbour's steps, out of his hand. I took him and the handkerchiefs into the shop, sent for a constable, and gave him in charge. A pane of glass was broken, and the glass out, near where the handkerchiefs had lain. I know the glass was entire an hour before. I missed eleven black handkerchiefs, all in a piece from near the broken glass, and seven coloured ladies' handkerchiefs. I understand from several people that he has born a good character till within three months.</p>

Greenwood coughed, and Ramsay immediately made a rush, and snatched at my seal, ring, and key, which were attached to my watch and chain; he separated them from the chain, and in trying to get them away, he struck me a blow on the side; this was before he got them; he pulled twice to get them. Ramsay ran down the court. I hollowed, Stop thief! and Greenwood came up and said,</p>

I will swear they are the same persons - I could see them plainly by a strong light, and am positive of them. When I went into the George, I looked round, and saw the prisoners and another man sitting on a settle in the bar. The officer told me to go into the tap-room, to see if they were there, but I still kept my eye on the prisoners in the bar. I found the bar door bolted, and told the landlord to open it. Ramsay threw down his pipe, and was going out - he was stopped by the officers. I told him to put his hat on, and said I was certain of him - he said I accused him wrongfully. Greenwood did not attempt to escape. I am quite certain of them, on my oath - they were taken about an hour or an hour and a quarter after the robbery. We found nobody at the other public-houses.</p>

I described them correctly before I saw them in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate you thought you knew Ramsay's back, but would not swear to him - A. I said I would swear to his person altogether. When I went into the bar a second time, Ramsay was putting down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110010"/>his pipe and walking out - I said,</p>
               <p>"Stop that man." I said nothing else till he said,</p>

               <p>"Stop that man" - or I must have heard it. Greenwood kept his seat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who went into the room first - A. A patrol and I, then Ives, Goddard, and Wood. I had my staff - Ramsay knew me perfectly well. We took all the three men, as we always do on finding them at such a house as this where thieves resort - Ives only gave the two prisoners in charge. Ramsay got up to go away before a word was said by any body.</p>

            . I am a constable. I accompanied Ives to the George - we went into the tap-room, and were turning round to go into the bar, when Ives and Gibbs saw the prisoners and another man seated in the bar. Ramsay got up to go out. Ives said,</p>
               <p>"Go and stop that man." I being near the door, went out and stopped him; he was brought in. He said to the prosecutor,</p>
               <p>"You accuse me wrongfully; I know nothing about it." Ives said,</p>
               <p>"Put his hat on," which we did. He then said,</p>
               <p>"He is the man who robbed me." Nobody had said a word before but</p>
               <p>"Stop that man."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. More might have been said without your hearing it - A. I am positive nothing more was said - I was close at Ives's elbow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He only said,</p>
               <p>"You accuse me wrongfully" - A. That is all, my Lord; he was going out of the door when I stopped him - he had not began to run - he said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want? you accuse me wrongfully." We dragged him in, and he said a second time to the prosecutor,</p>
               <p>"You accuse me wrongfully, Sir."</p>
               <p>RAMSAY'S Defence. I know nothing of it; nor did I ever say,</p>
               <p>"You accuse me wrongfully." The officer said,</p>
               <p>"Here they are all three of them; we must take them all." Ives said I was something like the back of the man, but he had a light waistcoat on.</p>

I was walking along the path with my great coat under my arm, and my canvas purse in my breeches pocket - it had thirty-five sovereigns and four half-crowns in it. I had been drinking, but knew what I was about very well - I was a little in liquor. Two women came up to me - one laid hold of my arms, and pushed me into Nelson's-court. I resisted, and desired them to let me go; they said I should not. There were people passing. I was frightened, for I could not get out of their arms. They swore I should go to their lodging; I refused - one of them seized my great coat, and took it from me, and the other put her hand into my pocket, and took out my purse, and ran away - both ran up the court. I thought I saw them go into a house in the court; but a man said they were gone one way, and another said they were gone another way. They were making a fool of me, and I gave no heed to them. One of the women was tall, and the other short, and had a full black eye. I can swear positively that the two prisoners are the two women. I did not see them again till next morning, and was then confident of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not express a doubt about it at Worship-street - A. I said I firmly believed they were the women.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before the Justice, and said,</p>
               <p>"I think they were the persons; I was rather in liquor, and therefore cannot swear to them" - A. I do not recollect saying any such a word. I gave information at the watch-house between eight and nine o'clock, and described them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were middling drunk - A. I was partly drunk - I had only drank beer. I did not express a doubt about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you could not positively speak to them, because you were intoxicated - A. I said something about that. I swear to them, to the best of my knowledge, and belief. They were off in a twinkling. I was afraid of being murdered. I showed the constable the spot where it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not take the officer to several places before you fixed on the spot - A. When I got to the places, I said that was not the place till I came to Nelson-court; I then said that was it; there are several courts about. I was not drunk; there were many people passing; I could not call them, because I was dragged up the court; I do not think I ever said I could not swear to them.</p>

            . I am an officer of Whitechapel. On the 15th of August the prosecutor came to me to the watch-house, and said he had been robbed by two women; that one was tall and the other short; that he could not swear to them - he did not describe them further. I went down the road with him, to see if he could point out the place where he was robbed; he looked up two courts, and at last pointed out Nelson's-court, and said that was the place, not the others. I advised him to go home to bed; he was a great deal in liquor. About an hour after he went home, I had information, and went to Cummins' house, and searched it - she lives in Nelson's-court, and I believe, alone. I searched the back yard; and found this great coat, half in and half out of the privy, as it was partly broken down; it was not concealed. I have had it ever since. She said she did not know how it came there; she supposed it was thrown over the wall, which might have happened. I took her to the watch-house. About nine o'clock the next morning, I questioned her again about the coat; she said Hannah had thrown it on her arm. She described Hannah as a Jewess, and pock-marked. I went to Plunkett - he said he knew Hannah - we went to Luke-street, and took Stanton. They would not open the door, and I got in at the window; it is a corner house. I saw the window of the other room open, and called to Plunkett; he followed and took Stanton; her husband was shutting the window down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You think he was very much in liquor - A. Yes; he said he could only swear to his coat, and not to the prisoners. When he saw Nelson's-court, he knew it by the post in the middle, which he had clung to. I think the coat might have been thrown over, but it could not then have hung as it did, which was quite smooth. Cummins said in Stanton's presence that she had thrown it in.</p>

            . I went with the last witness, in the morning of the 16th, and searched Stanton's house; I knew her before. Nobody would let us in. My partner got in, and desired me to give a look out; when I turned the corner, I could see no one but a man coming towards me. I returned to a chandler's shop, and enquired if she was there; they said No, but I found her up stairs on the first floor. I said,</p>
               <p>"I want you, Stanton." She said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Plunkett, have you a warrant against me?" She said she had a row with a girl, and she thought I had a warrant about it. I said I wanted her for a robbery in Whitechapel-road. She said she knew nothing of any robbery. I found 12 s. 6 d. in her bosom - I found a steel purse in a turn-up bedstead, containing 16 s. 6 d. which she said was private money of her own.</p>

            ; we live in Shacklewell-street, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. On the 29th of August, about five o'clock, the prisoner came home with me. I had some silk up stairs, tied in a handkerchief, and put in an old bag. While he was there I said,</p>
               <p>"I will go up stairs and look after my property." I had known him a long time. He did not go up with me, nor did I bring the silk down, or say any thing about it; but he knew we had silk, as we get our living by it. About half-past eight I said I would go to my husband's club, to see if he was coming home. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"You go outside, mistress, and put the shutters too, and I will fasten them." I left him inside the house, to fasten the shutters; he came out, and I locked the door, and went to my husband's club - he went away. I was fetched home by my neighbours about a quarter before nine, and found the window shutter was broken open, and the window shoved up, which was shut when I went out. I missed the silk, which was left with me to wind. I have to pay for it all; there were eight knots, weighing nine ounces and a half, and are charged to me by my employer 28 s. 6 d. I have never seen it since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Who took you off the tap-room table drunk, at half-past nine o'clock, and led you home drunk - A. I was not in liquor; he did not lead me home, but ran down the street as fast as he could.

            . I live next door to Mr. Langford; I saw the prisoner come home with Mr. Langford between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and Mrs. Langford came home in about ten minutes; they afterwards all went out together, and about eight o'clock in the evening the prisoner came home with Mrs. Langford. He came to me for a light - I gave him a candle and candlestick. He said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Langford, go out and shut the shutters, and I'll fasten them;" which she did, and he fastened them, to the best of my knowledge. She then went in, and they both came out together. I cannot say she was properly sober; she had drank a little. I saw them fasten the door and go up the street together; and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after, he came down the street alone; he tried the door and found it fast; he then opened the window shutters, threw up the sash, and got into the room; he remained there three or five minutes. I and Dawson watched him, and saw him get out, leaving the shutters and windows open, and run away. After that he returned again with Mrs. Langford, and she said,</p>

               <p>"My God, the shutters and windows are open;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know they are; for I came back to the place, thinking it was not safe, and I thought I heard somebody on the premises, and could not get in at the door; so I got in at the window, and finding nobody there, I came away again." He went away - I saw no more of him till the Monday, when the officer brought him to Langford's. I am sure he is the man - I had seen him three times in the course of the day. I asked why he did not fasten the shutters and window? he said, because he was frightened, and thought they might think he had robbed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where did I go to after getting out of the window - A. To the Black Dog. He leant over the bar door and said to the landlady,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Stokes, I wish you would go up to Langford, and tell him to come down, for his house is open; and if anything is a miss, I am afraid he may think it is me." This was after Mrs. Langford had come home.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on Monday, the 2d of September, with another man, at the corner of Flower Pot-alley, Bethnal-green. I found nothing on him. He said,</p>
               <p>"I understand you have information against me." I said, Yes. He said he knew nothing of the charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I was informed that night that Langford said I had robbed him, and I was willing to go with you - A. Yes; he well knew I should not let him go; for I had been after him ever since the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (Written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I declare before the face of Almighty God, that I am innocent of the charge. I was at the Green Gate, public house, on the 30th of August; the prosecutor and his wife came and sat in the same box, and observed that they had known me from a child, and I had worked for them when young; I drank with them, and went with them to the Black Dog, and sat drinking till Langford said he was tired and sleepy; they asked me to see them home, which I did. Mrs. Langford said she was going out, and told me to call Langford about eight o'clock, to go to his club; I went away and returned at that time, when I found the shutters open; and went to the Black Dog and told him his place was not safe. He seemed to take no notice. I went down, and found Mrs. Langford asleep on the taproom table. I took her home, got a light, and asked her if all was safe. I heard no more till Monday night, when I saw Gibbs, and was agreeable to go any where. I went to the watch-house without being collared.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

I returned the latter end of June or July - I had left Powell, my house-keeper, in care of the room, to sleep there or in the house, which she liked. I had a bureau in the room, in which I left my gold watch and chain, and another gold chain separated from the watch, a gold and pearl brooch, a musical snuff-box, a silver snuff-box, a silver tea-pot, and considerable other property. When I came to town, I missed the articles stated in the indictment - I had seen them safe five or six days before I left town. I was absent a fortnight. The bureau was locked. In consequence of information, I apprehended the prisoner in Broad-street, on the 7th or 8th of July. I saw him searched. The constable shewed me two duplicates, which I returned him.</p>

I told him there were witnesses to prove he had taken it from the spot; he then said he had taken it, and would shew us the place it was in; he took us to a house in Field-lane, which he said belonged to one Sheppard. The officer found the pipe there, broken in three pieces.

Between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 27th of July, I was called up and informed that the house was broken open. On examining the counting-house, I found the desk broken open, and also the iron closet opened, and a drawer within the iron closet, which contained the notes and sovereigns stated in the indictment, in a bag, and bills and papers. I cannot exactly say how many sovereigns there were, but I presume about forty or fifty; there were two 10 l. bank-notes, and one 5 l.; they were gone also; a snuffbox, which had a portrait of the Duke of Wellington, was taken out of the chest. The prisoner had repeatedly seen me put money in the iron chest. No other place was forced open. I searched the house all over, with the watchman, but found nobody; I called the prisoner up, and he assisted in the search; in the course of which he went into the kitchen, where there is a copper on the left hand side, and on the right there is a flue, to convey steam into the chimney; the prisoner got up on the copper, to search this flue; I said,</p>
               <p>"What is the use of your getting up there? nobody can be hid there;" he got down, and made no farther observation. Between ten and eleven o'clock next morning, 
               <persName id="t18220911-29-person271">Harrison</persName>
             the officer examined the premises; he told the prisoner he should search him, and said it must be some person in the house who had done it. The maid servant and the shopman slept in the house, besides the prisoner; they were all searched, but nothing found. Four days after, from other causes, the prisoner was taken to Guildhall, and discharged; he was still in my service, and after he was examined, I gave orders that he should not be admitted into any part of the house but the shop; he did not know of these orders. The maid servant was discharged after the prisoner's examination, not about this robbery, but about something the prisoner said of her conduct; the prisoner went before the girl; I discharged him after his examination on the 3d of August; she stopped in my service till the prisoner was taken a second time. About two days after his discharge he called for his clothes, which were kept in a garret where he slept; I ordered them to be brought down to him, which was done; he endeavoured to go down the kitchen stairs, but the servant hindered him; he did go down the back cellar stairs for some brushes. I saw some chimney sweepers ring at the bell about seven o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 13th of August; in consequence of this I directed that none should sweep the chimneys but Mr. Brown or a person in his employ. On the Thursday Mr. Brown's boy came, and the servant knocked at my bed-room door, and gave Mrs. Laurie, in my presence, a bag containing forty-seven sovereigns, and one was found afterwards; I am sure the bag is the same which was in my chest, and the amount is the same, as near as I can guess. I expected the two boys to call again on Friday, to sweep the chimney, and got Harrison to be ready in case they came, which they did about seven o'clock, and were let in. Harrison came across, and apprehended them, and in about a quarter of an hour after they came I saw the prisoner in Harrison's custody; he had gone out in consequence of what the sweeps said, and brought the prisoner in in about two minutes; he was taken before Mr. Alderman Brown, and committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. How many days after the alarm did the prisoner leave your service - A. It happened on the 27th of July, and he left on the 3d of August; he had full access to the house for the first four days.</p>
               <p>Q. And had ample time and opportunity to remove any thing during the seven days - A. Certainly; the counting house is in the back part of the premises; he must come down from the garret into the shop to go there. When the alarm was given, I found the street door open, and the counting-house door also; the side of the desk was wrenched off, as well as the lock being picked or forced; it must have taken some time to do it; the chest was open, and the lock of the drawer in it picked. I called the prisoner down from his bed-room. He made some charges against the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110015"/>servant girl, and that girl brought the sovereigns up. The bank-notes and snuff-box are not found.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did the servant sleep - A. On the 3d floor; the shopman slept in the next room to the prisoner; they were all alarmed at the same time, dressed, and came down. I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock that night; I could easily hear a person come down stairs if he had his shoes on.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. I went to Mr. Laurie's house first about a quarter or half-past nine o'clock, and was shewn the state of things; there was no force on the door from without; it must have been opened from within. I have no doubt about it. There was a chain and bar to the door, neither of which were forced. I searched the premises; no place had been opened or attempted to be opened, except where the property was. We called the prisoner up stairs, and questioned him. I told him I thought somebody had broken out, and not in; I searched him, and all the servants, but found nothing. On Friday, the 16th of August, I went to the prosecutor's house about five o'clock in the morning; I was walking up and down opposite the house, watching for two sweeps; and just before seven o'clock two chimney sweeps came. I followed them into the house. The servant let them in. I questioned them for full ten minutes; the servant girl was there all the time, and in consequence of an observation she made, I ran out instantly up to the left, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Crane-court under the arch of the court, against the wall, singing - I took him, and said,</p>
               <p>"This is found out, Mr. Charles;" he said nothing. I took him over to Mr. Laurie's, into the presence of the two sweeps, and the servant. The biggest sweep said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man who hired me to sweep the chimnies, and to take the bag of gold out, and I was to have two sovereigns" - the prisoner said nothing; the sweep said to Mr. Laurie,</p>
               <p>"I did not mean to take the gold out of the house, Sir, but to give it you." He then said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"What a pretty mess you have got me into?" the prisoner said nothing - the other sweep was frightened. I took them all three to the Compter. The prisoner was committed, and the sweeps discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who was present while you were questioning the sweeps - A. Mr. Laver, the shopman, the girl, and Mills, who was with me, and I think Mr. Laurie was coming down stairs. The door must have been opened inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Anybody connected with persons outside could let them in - A. Certainly. The sweep said he was to go down to the chimney below, and in a certain flue he would find a bag of money.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went out in consequence of what the maid-servant said - A. Yes. I had seen her looking out of the window for an hour before.</p>

            . I am a chimney-sweeper to Mr. Brown, who sweeps the prosecutor's chimney. On Thursday, the 15th of August, about seven o'clock in the morning, I went to sweep the chimney, and in the steam flue of the kitchen, I found a bag containing something; I gave it to the servant girl. I looked into the flue with a light, and found a sovereign, which I gave to the servant. I thought there was money in the bag, because I heard it jingle. She took the bag up stairs, and told me to go up the chimney.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the girl tell you to look in that flue - A. Nobody told me - I was feeling for the copper flue, which goes into the chimney, for if we do not attend to that the soot goes into it. When I gave her the bag, she told me to go on; and when I came down, Mr. Laurie told me to look further, and I found the sovereign.</p>

               <persName id="t18220911-29-person277">August. After</persName>
             the robbery, I remember two chimney sweeps coming to the door - I did not open it; the errand boy told them when to come again. I did not hear him - they were not let in. Two days after the last witness came, and swept the chimney. I was in the kitchen when he found the bag in the flue - he went there of his own accord. He delivered me a bag from the flue - I opened it, and saw it contained sovereigns, and immediately took it up stairs, and gave it to my mistress in the presence of my master. After the chimney was swept, I saw the boy take a single sovereign from the flue. On the following morning Harrison was set to watch the house. I was up at six o'clock, an hour before the two sweeps came. I placed myself at the front room, second floor window, with the sash up. The two sweeps came. I saw the prisoner a quarter of an hour before that time, at the back of a mail coach, standing up holding the straps, going towards St. Pauls's; I saw him no where else. When Harrison spoke to the sweeps I told him what I had seen; (They were the two boys who had been there three days before). He went out to look for the prisoner, and returned with him in two or three minutes. The biggest sweep said,</p>
               <p>"You are a pretty fellow for bringing me into this scrape," and that the prisoner was the lad who sent him to sweep the chimneys, and to tell the lie, by saying that he came from Mr. Brown's when he did not. The prisoner made no answer. I do not remember anything more being said. The money was produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you servant of all-work - A. Yes. I had twelve guineas a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you very angry with the boy for the accusations he made against you - A. No, because some of it was true, and I forgive him the rest. I saw the sweeps come twice,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110016"/>their faces were black. I do not know that I had seen them at other times. I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock on the night of the robbery.</p>

            . I am a chimney-sweeper, and live in One Tun-court, Strand. I am climbing journeyman to Mrs. Watson. I was never in Mr. Brown's employ. I know the prisoner; he first spoke to me one Monday, in the Strand; he met me there, and said he had left his place in Fleet-street, and told me to go and see about the kitchen chimnies; I was to ring the bell or knock, and I should see the servant or the young lad. He told me to tell the lad if I saw him, that the chimney had not been done for three months. He said there was a bag of money in the copper flue, and I was to bring it away, and he would give me two sovereigns - that it would not chink; it was tied up safe. I had never swept Mr. Laurie's chimnies. I was to say I came from Brown's of Water-lane. I went to Mr. Laurie's on Monday morning, and the lad told me to come next morning, which I did, and was let in, and told to come on Friday morning at six o'clock. I saw the prisoner on the Monday evening in the Strand, about half-past six o'clock, and on Tuesday morning I saw him about seven o'clock, and told him what I was to do, and he said then it would be all right. I went on Friday morning, and Harrison came and took me into custody. I had Woolley, a boy, with me - I do not think he knew what it was about; he was present on Monday when the prisoner spoke, but did not know what passed between us. Harrison spoke to me in the shop, then went out, and brought in the prisoner - I said,</p>
               <p>"You have brought me in a nice scrape." I had told him in the Strand that if I got the bag I would give it to the gentleman or lady - he said I ought to be ashamed of myself, and I mentioned it in the shop that morning. I was taken before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you still work for Mrs. Watson - A. Yes. I saw the lad on Monday and Tuesday mornings. I am quite sure I saw nobody but him. I saw the shopman and servant girl on Friday, and not before.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not go, and tell Mr. Laurie of this - A. I know I am guilty of that; I kept it to myself till Friday; I told the prisoner on Monday, that I should give it to the lady or gentleman. When he first spoke to me, he said he was very wild that he could not go into the kitchen to get the money out of the flue. I told nobody of it. I have served ten years with Watson, and am thirty years old. I told the constable what the prisoner told me; I had nothing to do with him before, but have often seen him go through Hungerford market. I knew nothing of it till he told me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You never spoke to him till Monday - A. No; I never saw the servant before Friday, whether she saw me by looking through the window, I cannot say: I did not see her at the window (looking at her).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect any thing for returning the money to the gentleman - A. Unless he chose to give me any thing. I told Harrison, who sent me about the chimney before he brought the prisoner in.</p>

            . On Saturday the 30th of July, I was at the Coopers' Arms, public-house. I saw Murty and Gantly there. Murty and I were taking a pot of beer - he observed that Gantly was there. Gantly came in, and Clines came in three or four minutes after. They both sat in a seat opposite to where Murty and I were. Murty continued sitting there for near five minutes, and when the pot of porter was nearly finished, he said something to me - we finished the beer, and he got up, and was going from the house - Gantly was still sitting, but as soon as Murty rose, and walked towards the passage, as if to go out (I was with him) he (Gantly) followed, and went into the bar, which is the way out. Murty stopped to take part of some beer in the tap-room - Gantly was then standing with his back to the bar; Murty would have to pass him to go out. As he passed him, Gantly immediately put up his right fist, and inflicted a wound on the left side of Murty's head; he struck him with the soft part of his hand. I saw Clines a moment after this, but not at the time the blow was struck. Murty stumbled over against the thing the gin cask stood against. Gantly laid hold of him by the right arm - Clines immediately came out of the taproom into the passage, and dragged me by the back of my neck from parting them - I was endeavouring to part them when he seized me. The blood came from the deceased's head in consequence of the first blow, and therefore I endeavoured to part them. The stillion supported him from falling. I saw several other blows inflicted. Murty kept on his legs, for he was held up by Gantly, and by the assistance of Clines. Gantly held him by the right shoulder, and Clines was behind the deceased with his two hands against his back, driving him up against Gantly, to prevent him from falling, while Gantly inflicted the wounds. Murty was struggling to disengage himself as well as he could, with his left hand; his other hand was held by Gantly - he had him by the right arm. Gantly's fist was not closed in the proper form; he had some instrument concealed in his hand - I could see about three quarters of an inch of it; it appeared to me a blunt instrument, about half an inch thick, and strait; either iron or steel - it was of a hard substance. I did not observe it after the second blow; each blow produced blood, as it was inflicted. Not a word had passed between them before the first blow. I am quite sure the deceased did not strike Gantly first. About five blows were inflicted before I went to the door and called Watch. I did not leave till it was all over, nor was I out of sight except in calling the watchman, which was only a moment - the watchman nor I could render any assistance, being unequal to them. When I returned from calling the watch, both Clines and Coin were about the deceased. I did not see Coin lay hands on him at all. I saw him drive the people back saying,</p>
               <p>"Let them, have fair play." There was a crowd about, saying it was a shame to see the man murdered. Murty was all this time bleeding from all parts of his head - his hands were then loosened; he was in a weak state, from loss of blood, and unable to offer any resistance. He was leaning against the end of the bar. When the watchman found he could do nothing he sprang his rattle, and other watchmen came from all quarters - it was just finished when they came in; it had continued from the time the watchman went for assistance until the others came - it lasted six or seven minutes altogether I think, but cannot say particularly. I saw four or five blows then. I came in with Mahoney the first watchman, and stood at the entrance of the door, intending to secure Gantly if he came out. My mind was more upon getting assistance than noticing them. After the first four or five blows, I did not see Clines do anything; he only kept close to Murty. I could not secure Gantly, but I told the watch to keep a look out outside. I am positive Gantly did not go out at the door I stood at. One door leads into West-street, and the other leads into Sharp's-alley. When it was over there was a search for Gantly - Clines and Coin were still in the tap-room, and were taken. Before that, I went into the tap-room, and said to Clines that it was a shame to see a man murdered like the deceased was; Coin was within hearing. Clines and a strange man told me to mind my own business, and sit down. Nobody gave charge of them, for we were in search of Gantly - the deceased and I came in and gave charge of them eight or nine minutes after. I had seen Gantly and the deceased together about a fortnight before, one Sunday night; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110018"/>was in the same public-house, and saw Gantly challenge Murty to fight him; they tossed for the ground, and Gantly won the toss.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they going to fight about - A. The deceased had been beat by Gantly on the Saturday night, and in about twenty minutes after I saw them in the passage scuffling, and the watchman parted them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. You were a friend of the deceased's - A. I had known him for several years. I went into the house after nine o'clock - the deceased afterwards came in and joined me. Gantly and Clines were opposite on the other side of the room; they could not hear what passed between us. Murty was leaving the house, and met a relation who handed him some beer - I was right behind walking after him. Gantly was in front of him with his back to the bar. Clines had not left his seat, and did not come up till Gantly struck Murty - he came behind Murty after the first or second blow. Gantly kept striking. I only saw something in his hand once, which was the second blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Clines come up and say,</p>
               <p>"Let all be fair, man to man" - A. No; he said fair play, and dragged me back as I was going to part them, seeing the blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Coin come in with Rowland, the watchman - A. I saw him in the passage nearly at the finish of the fight - he was not in the tap-room. The prisoners had an opportunity to leave the house, but did not attempt.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When Clines was behind Murty, was it visible what the effects of the blows were - A. It was - he was covered with blood, and not resisting; he tried to strike, but the blow did not fall. Mahoney was the first watchman who came in.</p>

            . I am between fourteen and fifteen years old. Murty was my uncle; he sometimes went to the Coopers' Arms, and I sometimes go there. When you go in at the street door, there is a long passage which leads into the tap-room; the bar is on the left hand, before you get to the tap-room. On Saturday night, the 20th of July, a little before ten o'clock, my father sent me there for my uncle; it was all quiet when I went; I found him in the tap-room, in company with the last witness - they were sitting drinking. It is an open room, not parted with boxes. I saw both the prisoners and Gantly in the room when I went in; they seemed all three of one party, not in company with my uncle. I did not know of Gantly and my uncle having any words. I told him to go home, for my father wanted him; I spoke privately to him; he answered me; I waited for him in the tap-room, and in about a quarter of an hour he got up to go. I did not hear the prisoners or Gantly interfere with him. When he got up to come away, Heeney went with him; my uncle went first, and I was with him. Gantly followed my uncle out, and some person stopped to let him have some drink, when Gantly got before him and waited. The prisoners remained in the tap-room; Gantly stood by the bar, in the passage; my uncle bid the man who gave him the beer good night, and when he got up to Gantly, Gantly said,</p>
               <p>"You did not bid me good night, you b - r," and then struck him a blow over the forehead; the blood came from his forehead directly.

            , who had been in company with Clines, and who had followed my uncle out, hollowed out that Gantly was fighting; this brought the two prisoners from the tap-room to the place; several blows had been struck before this. I could see that Gantly had something in his hand like iron; his hand was shut, so that it must have been a small thing. All the blows were struck in the same manner, and on the head; each blow appeared to produce more blood. My uncle did not fall; I screamed out Murder, and called to Mr. Lake, who was inside the bar; he did not come, but said, he did not care for my uncle, what he got, or if he got as much more. My uncle tried to get away, but Clines came and held him, and Coin came and prevented his falling. I think he received three or four blows before the prisoners came up. Clines and Gantly were both beating my uncle - Clines gave him a thump on the mouth, and as he went away kicked him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Let the b - r go, he has had enough." My uncle was knocked down at that time. While this was going on, Heeney called for assistance, and

             went for the watchman; the prisoners went into the tap-room again; Gantly went backwards into the yard; there was a door there by which he could get out. My uncle was taken to the hospital about eleven o'clock. He gave no offence to Gantly or the prisoners, that I saw; he was much hurt by the blows; I cannot say whether the prisoners saw what Gantly had in his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you ever examined about this since your uncle's death - A. Not by any person but the Coroner; I have not spoken to any body about it since. I am sure both the prisoners were in the tap-room when I first went in; I have often seen them having a pot of beer together. I saw the way every blow was struck; I could see the iron at the bottom part of his hand; four or five blows were struck before the prisoners came up, and his blood was flowing before they came. Heeney stood at the tap-room door all the time; my uncle and Gantly were between the tap-room and street doors; I think Heeney might have heard what Lake said; he was near enough to see Clines strike my uncle in the mouth and kick him. The prisoners were sitting quietly till Dogherty went in and said they were fighting; Heeney must have seen the prisoners sitting at the table. There were many other persons in the room.</p>

               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Were you a good deal alarmed - A. Yes; my attention was principally directed to my uncle; I did not observe Heeney go to the door; a watchman came in while they were beating him.</p>

I was at the Coopers' Arms about ten o'clock, and saw the deceased there; Gantly and both the prisoners were also there; I stood at the bar, and saw Murty come out of the tap-room; he went towards the bar; Gantly came by him from the tap-room, and somebody offered Murty a pot to drink out of; he returned the pot, and bid the man good night; Gantly turned on his foot, and said,</p>
               <p>"You b - r, you have not bid me good night," and struck him over the forehead, not with his knuckles, but with the soft part of his hand; the first blow fetched blood; he struck him several times. A woman named

            , who cohabits with Clines, cried out that Gantly was quarreling; Clines then came out of the tap-room; Gantly continued to strike, and Clines held Murty's hands, as far as I could see. I did not see Murty strike; Clines stood by his side, quite close to him; Murty tried to stumble<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110019"/>several times; but he was kept up by Clines; Gantly continued to beat him, and Dogherty said,</p>
               <p>"Give it him - go it." I saw Coin in the middle of the row, at the entrance of the bar; I did not observe him do any thing; there were many people there; I saw Corker there; she was near Murty; she screamed out to the landlord to put her uncle inside the bar; he said he would not - that it served him right - that he wished he had more of it, for he had not had as much as he deserved; Coin was in the room when Corker called out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Have you no other name than Cahill - A. No; the man I live with is named Gavin; some people call me by that name. One Collins of Blackwall had taken me there to treat me with a pint of beer; I only went to the entrance of the bar; I was there before Gantly came out of the tap-room. Heeney came out of the tap-room, as far as the bar; I cannot say whether he came out with Murty. The tap-room door was open. Two blows were given before Dogherty sung out; then Clines came out first. I saw Coin in the midst of the row; there were so many in the room, I could not rightly tell who was there; but on looking about I saw Coin there, standing behind his back as it were; Clines struck him the last blow in the mouth with his fist. I have been at this bar seven years ago, for pawning from a ready-furnished lodging, and was confined twelve months. Murphy's head was all in a gore of blood.</p>

            . I am a shopkeeper, and live opposite the Coopers' Arms, in West-street. On Saturday night, the 20th of July, a little past ten o'clock, I heard a noise there, and went into the bar, which is near the street door; a great number of people were there; I saw Murty with his head bleeding, among a number of people, and one in particular, beating him; he held him, I believe, with the left hand, and struck him with the other. All the blows were with the flat part of his hand. I did not see the deceased return the blows; he was standing when I saw him; he was held by the men who were striking, and apparently by the mob behind him; he bled very much in the head and face, so much so that I could not discern his features. The prisoners were there among the crowd; I think there were twenty or thirty people there; a watchman came in; I did not notice one man more active than the rest; they appeared to hold the man up; the prisoners were in the mob, apparently assisting the rest; I was not there above five minutes. I cannot say that the man who struck had any thing in his hand, but I thought he had, by the manner of his striking. I have no doubt of the two prisoners being there when the first watchman came in. I did not see any body try to prevent what was going on; I was greatly alarmed; I saw Lake in the bar; he must have seen what was going on better than I; he was near to them. After the man was rescued from the men who were beating him, I thought all was safe, and went home; he did not appear to be particularly weak; he walked very fast to the watch-house, but the blood ran from him almost like rain. I recollect Gantly's person; he was the man who struck the blows. A shutter fell in among the crowd by the scuffle; that was two minutes after I went in.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night of the 20th of July Mrs. Welch came out, calling Watch and Murder; my box is near the door. I went into the Coopers' Arms alone; I endeavoured to get to the man who was receiving the blows, but I was pushed back by many of them and overpowered. I stopped till I saw the man knocked down and then ran out and sprung my rattle; I went as far as Smithfield; I came back with assistance, and saw the man standing by himself by the bar; his head was covered with blood; he was the same man whom I had seen struck; I cannot say whether either of the prisoners were there or not. The deceased gave charge of the prisoners half an hour or twenty minutes afterwards; they were sitting in the tap-room.</p>

            . I am watchman of St. Sepulchre's. I heard a rattle spring, and went to the Coopers' Arms, about half-past ten o'clock; the door of the house was shut; I saw Coin standing at the door; about two minutes after the door was opened, in consequence of my orders, Coin and I went in together; there was a crowd of people in the passage; we went a little further; Coin's heels struck against a shutter, and it fell by accident. Some of them used very had language, and Coin said,</p>
               <p>"Don't ill treat the watchman; let him go on, as he is on his duty." They made way for me; I joined the other watchmen, and we searched the house. Murty was leaning against the bar counter; we could not find the man we wanted. I saw the back door was fast and the clothes horse put against it; there is a back window through which a man might escape, and that window was open. Murty was bleeding very much; he appeared very faint when he got to the watch-house, and was sent to the hospital.</p>

            . I live in West-street, about three doors from the Coopers' Arms. On the 20th of July my attention was called there by the cries of Murder. I ran in, and in my hurry got between two men who seemed to be fighting; but on looking further, I found one was holding up the other with his right hand, and his left was uplifted, and now and then he hit him on the top of the head in this manner, with the fleshy part of his fist, and there was a gush of blood every time he struck. I saw this for about five minutes; I did not see the person return any blows; he could not; he attempted to fall to the ground, to avoid the blows, but the superior strength of the man who struck him prevented him. There were a good many people about; it was a confused concern altogether; I cannot speak to the prisoners.</p>

            . I lodged at the Coopers' Arms at this time. The noise brought me from the tap-room to the front of the bar; I had been in the tap-room for an hour or an hour and a half. I had not observed Gantly; I saw him go out, and saw Clines pass me going down the room. When I got to the bar, I saw Murty and Gantly fighting. There might be a dozen persons about them. Blood was flowing from Murty's head and Gantly's nose. I saw Coin come in just before the row ended; he put his hands out in the room and said,</p>
               <p>"Make room," or</p>
               <p>"Fair play," or something.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the first thing he did was to say,</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110020"/>Q. In what manner did Gantly strike Murty - A. One man had hold of the collar by the right hand and the other by the left.

               <p>Q. Did you count the blows Murty gave to Gantly - A. No; he gave them so fast, I could not count them; both gave blows so fast I could not count them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the blows given by Gantly produce blood from Murty - A. Of course they must. I could not see any thing in his hand; it struck me that he must have something in his hand; I am a carpenter, and out of work at present.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Coin came in at the end of the row, and said,</p>

               <p>"Make way;" that was the first time I saw him.</p>

            . I am house surgeon of Bartholemew hospital. On the 20th of July, I examined the deceased when he was brought in. I found the upper part of his body covered with blood, and several wounds on the upper part of his head - there were ten in number, and most of them an inch in length, and two about an inch and a half, and some about one sixth of an inch deep, and about half of an inch deep going down to the bone. I found a wound near the forehead, about an inch and a half in length, on the leftside, and going to the bone; there was hair from the head within the wound, driven into the bone of the scull; these wounds could not be inflicted by the fist, but by a blunt instrument - there were distinct incisions, and not contusions. I attended him for some days. It was about twelve days before symptoms of injury within the head appeared, which were the natural causes of the blows. There was an interval in which I did not attend him. I believe the chief, though not the sole cause of his death, was the violence he received; that his death was accelerated by the wounds - it was not the proximate cause certainly; I should more properly call it the occasional cause. I believe death might probably be produced by the injury, but as I did not open the body, I am unable to say, but it decidedly must have accelerated his death.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How many days before he died did you cease to see him - A. There was an interval of twelve days between his convalescence and relapse, when I did not see him. His liver was injured, which frequently happens by a blow on the head; and that is my opinion.</p>

            . I am assistant surgeon at St. Bartholemew Hospital. I saw the deceased on Sunday the 21st, the day following his admission. I did not particularly examine the wounds in his head, as they were bound up, and it would injure them. He did not appear labouring under any severe symptoms arising from the injury in the head at that time. I mean that he was quite sensible; about a fortnight after he altered - he always had an unhealthy appearance; no alarming symptoms appeared till the Saturday preceding his death - he had then a bilious attack, which was the consequence of the blow on the head when the patient was in a particular state. He complained of considerable pain in his head, and particularly of one wound on the left side of his head, all the rest were healed. He died on the 9th, having been trepanned on the 8th. I was present during part of the time the body was opened, and attribute his death directly to the injury he received,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110021"/>being previously in a bad state of health. The fracture did not extend through the scull, only the outer plate of the bone was fractured, and matter formed between the two plates, which accounted for the pain in his head. The death was produced by the injury no doubt, but in my judgment the wounds would not have ended in death if given to a perfectly healthy subject.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you see the subject opened - A. My attention was turned to the liver, which appeared to be diseased, and that of long standing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the injury of the liver likely to cause sudden death, or protracted - A. Protracted; he might have lived twelve months or more, but I think it was incurable.</p>

            , I am a pig jobber, and live at Shadwell. On Tuesday or Wednesday I was sent for to look at some pigs - I found Mansfield with them. There was a sow and four pigs. They were by the wall in New Gravel Lane. Smith came over, asked if I would buy them, and asked 30 s. each. Mansfield stood by. I said I thought it was too much; he then said 25 s.; I offered them 15 s.; they said I should have them, if I gave them the money; I said I thought they were stolen; he said he did not steal them, but found them on the side of the road straying, and drove them on. I informed the constable, and they were taken.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, on the 27th of August, I went to the Dock-hills, and found the four pigs and one sow; Mansfield was with them; they did not know me. I asked him if they were his; he said No, he was minding them for a man, and said,</p>

               <p>"Here he comes". Smith was coming up, and asked me 30 s. each; I said I should like to know where he lived, if I bought one of him; he said at Ratcliffe Cross, and was well known there. I called the constable, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do you think the pigs worth 30 s.?" He said it was a fair price. I turned away to consult about taking them; upon looking round again, I found the men and pigs were gone. We found them six hours after in Stepney Fields, and took them to the office, with the pigs; Sawyer claimed them.</p>

            . I am watchman of Wych-street. Watkins called Watch, at the top of the street, near Drury-lane. I came up - he said he had lost his watch, and was enquiring of the prisoner where the other woman was, who was with her. He did not appear to suspect the prisoner then. She said she would take him to the house where she was, which was the Artichoke, White Hart-yard. I asked her to describe her, and from her manner I suspected her, and said,</p>
               <p>"I must search you." I found the watch in her breast - Watkins described it before he saw it. When I first felt it in her bosom, she said it was only the bones of her stays.</p>

             - he called on me first, in consequence of a letter, which I addressed to him - I was not at home. He called next day; he said he came in consequence of an advertisement about a situation, which I had replied to - he gave me his card (producing it)</p>
               <p>"Mr. Mitford, No. 9, Manchester-buildings." He said he had not interest himself, but it was through a friend that he could procure a situation - he was merely the agent. I had several interviews with him on the subject - he requested some sort of security as a pledge of my sincerity in the transaction, provided I should obtain the situation. This did not pass at the first interview. He required that I should deposit a sum of money in the Bank, and take a post bill, payable to my order; this was the first proposition he made - he said he thought it would be the easiest mode, and attended with no expence, and would be most satisfactory to myself; as the post bill would be payable to my order, and could not get into circulation without my endorsement, and in the event of my not procuring the situation, he would return the Bank post bill to me. In consequence of this, I paid 50 l. into the bank, and took the Bank post bill in question. (Looking at a paper) All except the figures here are my writing; it is the ticket I gave to procure the bill. read. (Mrs. E. Rogerson, payable to J. L. Rogerson or order 50 l). On the evening of the day I procured the bill, he called on me. I said I objected to give the Bank post bill out of my possession, because in the event of my not getting the situation, I should have some difficulty in getting it back. He said I could have no difficulty in getting it back, because being unendorsed it could be of no use to him. I gave it to him unendorsed, and gave him no authority to endorse it. He left me, saying he would see me in a few days. This was on the first of May. I did not see him after till he was apprehended. Not seeing him according to appointment, I went to Manchester-buildings on the Monday, but could not find him. On the following day, the 7th of May, I stopped the bill. He never called after receiving the bill. I received a variety of letters on the subject (looking at some) these are them - (looking at the bill) this is the bill I gave him. I never procured any other bank post bill in my life. My name is on the back of it - it was neither written by me or my authority. My real signature is at the bottom; as having received the amount at the Bank afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Was not the name of Bloomfield mentioned by the prisoner - A. In the course of casual conversation, at one interview that name was mentioned. He did not say it was through Bloomfield's interest that it was to be obtained. He only said Bloomfield was sporting his figure about the town, and he understood he was a relative of Sir Benjamin's; but never said he was to procure the situation, or that he wanted it to deposit with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not place the bill in his hands as part of the consideration you was to pay him if he procured the situation - A. It was given to shew that money was forthcoming, and provided I got the situation I was to indorse it, and if not it was to be returned. I should have asked him to return it to me to be indorsed if I got the situation. I understand they frequently pass by mistake without being indorsed. I can swear to the bill by the number,

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did you give the prisoner the same Bank post bill you received at the Bank that day - A. I did, I never had any other made payable to myself.</p>

My Lord and Gentlemen, I beg to state, I am totally innocent of writing either the letters, the card, or any of the writing laid to my charge; I was merely an agent in the business; and the bank post bill was not in my possession half an hour before I handed it over to my employer, who kept it four or five days - it was returned to me by a man whose wife washed for me, with the indorsement on it. I asked him who indorsed it - he said Mr. Rogerson, and that he saw him. I asked if he enquired for me - he said No; and supposing it to be genuine, I paid it away.</p>

On the 21st of August, at ten o'clock in the morning, I saw her at her lodging; she had two rooms on the second floor. I saw her in the front room, which was the sitting room - she said she was very poorly, and appeared so; she attributed it to the fatigue of the hot weather, and she had had a quarrel with her landlord. I stopped all day - I washed down stairs in the kitchen. Her daughter Emma brought me a message that her mother was poorly, and wished me to stop, and do as much as I could, and that her mother could not come to help me. About two o'clock, I went up stairs with a pail of water - I sat down half a minute, and heard her call out as if she was ill. She called to her daughter to fetch up Morrison, who lived below - I was then in the front room and she was in the bed room. I thought I heard her scream as if she was sick, and I went into the room where she was - I just opened the door and put my head in for a moment. I thought I heard the cry of an infant, and flew back in a moment - I heard it only once, and being so short a time I might be mistaken, as I never was at the birth of an infant. When I looked into the room she was standing by the side of the bed with one hand on the bed, and the other on the wall. I withdrew; her daughter at this time was gone down for Morrison, who lived below - the prisoner said to me,</p>
               <p>"Go go," as if for assistance, I ran down stairs in haste to get assistance, and by the time I got to the street door, her daughter came and said I need not call anybody - I met Morrison coming up stairs as I went down. I did not fetch assistance. In about an hour and a half her daughter fetched me up stairs, saying her mother wanted to speak to me; I went up to the bed room, she was lying on the bed with her clothes on - nobody else was in the room; I asked how she did - she said she hoped it was safe over; I asked if it was her labour, she said, Yes. I asked her if she did not want a nurse, as I would fetch one if she would let me, and she consented - I could not get the one I intended, but brought the first I met with, who was

            . I am the daughter of the female prisoner. My father has been dead ten years; my mother has not been married since. I am sixteen years old. I did not know she was in the family way. I have brought the baby linen; I believe it was in the house at the time. I remember Bird going for assistance. Morrison, before he went into the room, told me to tell her she need not fetch any one. I had fetched him by my mother's orders; I did not see him in the room; I was not there till after the doctor came. Morrison went in; I do not think he stopped more than five minutes. I did not know that there was any baby linen in the house; I do not remember my mother having a child during my father's life. When Morrison came out, he said my mother had had a child; he is a boot and shoemaker; I never knew him practise as a midwife.</p>

            . I have known Mrs. Jones nearly five years. She told me about four months ago that she was in the family way, and engaged me to nurse her; she did not say when she expected to want me, nor desire me to make any preparation. I went to see her about twice after; she still appeared pregnant; the last time I saw her was about a month before she was put to bed. Nothing particular occurred. I told her, when she wanted me, if she sent I would come. I did not make any baby linen. She sent for me on the evening the child was born. I was then living at the Crown and Anchor.</p>
               <p>- PASSMORE. I am an undertaker. Morrison came to me on Thursday morning, the 22d of August; I was from home; he came again in the evening, and found me at home; he said he wanted a box for a still-born child, of which I understood him to say his wife was delivered the day previous; he said he should have been highly gratified if the child had lived. He gave me the length on a string. The box was made and taken home.</p>

               <p>"Don't kill the woman." I was in front of him; I gave him a little push, to separate them. He directly cried out for the fork, and ran in and fetched it; he was gone about a minute. I stood in the yard, not thinking he was going to stick me with it. He came out, and stuck me right in the face, and knocked me back some distance with it; he pushed it right into my face. One of the prongs ran in just under my eye, and went up into my brain, and the other prong went by the side of my head; it knocked me backwards against some palings. I followed him into his mother's house after the fork was taken from him. I struck at him, but did not hit him; I became insensible, and cannot say what passed. The stab gave me great pain; it went right into my brain. I was confined to my bed three weeks and three days, and was in great pain. I can see very little with the eye now; I cannot work now, for my head is bad.</p>

Adams said something with an oath, which I did not understand, ran into his mother's house, and brought the pitchfork out and stabbed him immediately in the face. I heard it sound as if it penetrated into the head; it pushed him backwards against some paling. Edwards held his hands up, as if to save himself from farther harm, as the prisoner had drawn the fork out of him. Adams's brother came up, and tried to get the fork out of his hand, and in the scuffle the brother cried out that he was stabbed. I then made my way into the house, pushed his brother aside, and took the fork from him; I took it into Hockett's, and left it in care of his daughter. I saw

            . I live at a place called Botany Bay. The prosecutor is my son; I saw him on the Tuesday morning after the Saturday on which this was done. I stopped with him eight days and nights; he was very ill indeed, and a little senseless, and complained very much of his head. He was not sensible for a minute together, for seven or eight days; he did not know me for some time when I went to him; he afterwards came to his senses better, and began to recover.</p>

On the 9th of July, about twenty minutes past ten o'clock in the morning, I went into the Robin Hood, public-house, in St. Giles's, and had half a pint of beer - I had nothing else all day. While I was there five of this party were drinking. One of them told me to sit down and take my beer. The prisoners were two of them; one of them who is not here shoved against me, and I gave way; they had seen me take out my purse to pay for the beer about two minutes before, I returned it to my right hand breeches pocket. When they shoved me, Flynn put his arm round the one who was pushing, and drew out my purse; they all five them went off, and a woman followed them out; there was a sovereign, eighteen shillings, and three-halfpence in my purse, which I have not recovered. I went to get up, and Herring said,</p>
               <p>"If I followed them, he would rip my ***** out;" and seeing a knife in his hand I was afraid, and did not follow immediately. I saw a beadle of St. Giles's come in, and told him; and I then followed them - and saw them turn the corner and share my money. After that one of the party came up; it was neither of the prisoners; he said something - they then got away. I saw Flynn in the afternoon in St. Giles's; he was secured. Herring was taken some time afterwards. I had seen Flynn several times before, and am sure of them both.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You knew Flynn before - A. Yes, by sight. I did not know where to find him. I was as sober as I am now; I had drank nothing but a tea spoon full of beer; I only wetted my lips. I was with no girls - there was a woman at the public-house window with eggs, who said, come in; I spoke to her, but did not go in; two women followed me into the house, but were not with me. I did not speak to them, nor they to me, except to thank me for paying for a quartern of gin, which they asked me to give them. I was not a minute with them; they drank it, and away they went. Flynn followed me in and stood behind me. I had my money in my hand after the girls went out. I did not drink a drop of gin.</p>

I missed it on the 4th of August, and found it in pawn next day; the prisoner lodged in the garret - he had no business in my room.

A lady and gentleman came from the Crescent arm in arm; they advanced about a yard on the road, and a horse and gig at full gallop came directly upon them, and struck the lady on the side of her head, knocked her bonnet off, and they both fell with great violence; and the wheel went over the gentleman's body. I turned round and saw the chaise going on without any body in it - the gentleman got out or fell out. The lady and gentleman were brought into my lodge; he appeared very much hurt. A surgeon was sent for and he was put on my bed, and was sent to the Middlesex Hospital. The affair was so sudden that I could not see who drove the gig - I could not tell whether he was driving, or whether the horses ran away with him.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. On the 12th of August I was coming up the New Road, and saw a man in a gig; I do not know the man rightly, but he was very much intoxicated. The reason I think so was that every whip he gave the horse he fell from one side to the other. I saw him strike several times. He sat on one side and then on the other, and fell from one side of the chaise to the other. The horse was gallopping in a way it ought not to have gallopped. I was not close to the chaise at the moment the accident happened; it had passed when I came up; I saw the person lying on the ground, and paid more attention to that. I did not see the person in the gig get out or fall out. I carried the man to the hospital on a shutter. I held Mr. Steel's horse while he went into the lodge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time was it - A. About a quarter past five in the afternoon. The chaise passed me near the turnpike, by the end of Portland-road; I followed it, on seeing it gallop; he galloped at a very quick pace, and he had the reins in one hand and the whip in the other, and reeled from one side to the other; but the reins were loose - he was tipsy.</p>

            . I am a silver smith; I was riding on the day in question, and saw the deceased after the accident happened, but not before I saw the chaise come through the turnpike by Warren-street, which is four or five hundred yards from the spot. The horse was gallopping. I saw him gallop from the gate to where the accident happened; the prisoner was the driver; I did not know him before, but I saw him thrown out of the gig when the wheel went over the man's body; the horse ran up the New Road; he was leaning back in the chaise, holding the reins very tight; he had them in his left hand and the whip in his right. The chaise went zig-zag, and the whip touched the horse, but he was not striking it; the horse was going at a great rate - it appeared running away. There was only a snaffle bit in the horse's mouth, which I think was improper. He did not appear to be urging the horse on; his endeavours appeared more to keep himself in; he appeared to be in liquor; the lash of the whip fell backwards and forwards, but he was not striking. He was so tipsy after the accident, that two men held him by the arms to keep him up. He went into a public-house. I asked his name and address - he said his name was Needham, and that he lived in the Borough. He appeared very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The chaise did not go in a straight direction - A. No; he leant his head quite over the back of the chaise; he was bailed and has surrendered. He did not appear injured by the fall, he had some brandy and water at the public-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. No one can feel more sorrow from this unfortunate circumstance than I do; but no blame can justly be attributed to me; the witnesses who state I was intoxicated are wholly mistaken; I had been engaged in town till late in the afternoon, and went to see my daughter, who was visiting her father-in-law at Pentonville. I passed on, and at the end of Tottenham-Court-road the belly band broke; I endeavoured to pull up, but the horse became unmanageable, and the band flapping about increased his fright; I used every exertion to pull in, but could not succeed, and the unsteady motion of the gig shook me about, which might make the witnesses think I was beating the horse; but I was pulling the reins with both hands. I called out to the unfortunate man to get out of the road, and was almost immediately after thrown out of the gig, and no doubt the effects of the fall might make the witnesses think me intoxicated; I did every thing in my power to prevent the accident.</p>

            . I live at Pentonville. The prisoner's daughter was visiting at my house. He called on this day, about ten minutes before six o'clock to see her, and left just after the clock struck six; he was then perfectly sober. He drank nothing at my house. He lives at Notting Hill.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. My father was on the Coroner's Inquest. I heard the verdict from him, and then made known what I knew. I was in the New-road when the accident happened. I stood and saw the horse coming along at a furious rate, about thirty yards in front of me; I stood with my back to the rails to see it pass, and just as it came by, he called out Hoy three or four times. The deceased and his wife were at that time crossing the road, and the prisoner trying every effort to stop the horse. He sat on the seat with both reins in his hand, and I think the whip lay over the dashing iron. He had both his hands on his breast, pulling as tight as he could. I did not observe the belly band. The chaise ran on with great rapidity, and he was thrown out about three yards from where the accident happened - he appeared much hurt by the fall, as if stunned. His forehead was grazed, and the back of his hands hurt. I ran to the deceased, and some people took him from my hands - I went to assist the prisoner; he appeared perfectly sober, but quite stunned - his mind seemed to wander very much, and he staggered a little when we picked him up.</p>

I saw the gentleman in the gig, sitting with the reins in both hands, pulling as hard as he could, and the horse with his mouth wide open - the belly band was flapping about, which I think frightened the horse more.

I saw the gig fifty yards before the accident happened - the prisoner was pulling the horse back all he could, but it was quite unmanagable - its mouth was quite open, and the belly band hung at its legs, which frightened it.

His clothes were kept in the wardrobe on a shelf, in the closet - I had not seen them for some weeks. The other servants have nothing to do with them. The street door is sometimes open. Between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, I was going towards the dressing room, where I had been three hours before - I opened the door and saw somebody going from the dressing room into the water closet; I opened the door, and found the prisoner there - I seized his arm, and asked what brought him there; he said he had lemons to sell - I said it was a curious place to come to sell lemons. I found my master's clothes lying on the dressing room by the closet door, that they were kept in. They consisted of the articles stated in the indictment - they were loose just as they were taken off the shelf. He said he did not know how they came there, and begged to be let go, saying it was the first time he had done such a thing. They were not lying there when I was in the room before, and the closet door was shut, but I found it open.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Two or three things which he says are false. I was hawking lemons - I went to this house, and asked if they wanted any, nobody answered - I thought I saw some one go in at this door, so I went in to ask, and this man opened the door, and said I wanted to rob the house.</p>

               <p>"D - n you, I shall know you." I am positive the prisoner is that man; I saw him running off with my watch, and the seal hanging down; he drew it out of my pocket; I had seen him in the public-house that night, and they were in the street just before I turned up the lane, walking at a distance from each other; I recollected the men again; I knew the dress of the others, but could not swear to them; I was sober; I had only been to two public-houses that evening; and was in a mill for two hours; I might have drank four pints of ale in all, and no spirits at all; I was quite sober, and knew what I was doing very well; I saw the prisoner's features well in the house, and noticed him as I went up the street; he was taken, I believe, on the 3d, but I had then gone into the country.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You came from home to go to the fair - A. No, on purpose to see my relations. I was perfectly sober when I was robbed; it was getting daylight; I saw them coming when they were a hundred yards off; the last man was dressed in a dark corded jacket, which looked dirty - a pair of fustian trowsers, about the same colour - and I took great notice of his complexion; he had no coat or apron on; he had a hat. I stood talking with the woman. The state of my dress prevented my following them. I should have been afraid to run after them, if I could. I saw Campbell, the constable, soon after, and told him I knew one of them, and described his dress. The constable brought the prisoner to me on the 6th of July; he was then dressed in the same jacket and trowsers as when he robbed me, but had a white smock frock over them. I never said I did not know either of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you fixed on the last man, because you thought him like a man you saw in the fair - A. I went up the street after I was robbed, and met a man in the street, dressed nearly the same as one of the three, and collared him; but as soon as I came to look at him, I told him I did not think he was the man. His trowsers were fulstian, but a little lighter than the prisoner's, and he was taller. I was in a fright when I stopped him. I never charged any other man. I understand the prisoner lives at Twickerham.</p>
               <p>Q. You met Spruce by accident - A. Yes; in the room, I gave her a glass of ale. I have talked with her about this two or three times. When I took the man in the town, I did not say I thought he was the last man, but thought him one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask her to go back and help you, because you did not know the men - A. No; I said to her,</p>
               <p>"You must know these men; and as I do not, tell me who they are." I did not know where they lived. I know the prisoner by his face and dress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you apprehended the other man, did you take him for the prisoner, or for one of the other men - A. For one of the others. I thought the girl might know where they came from, which was the reason I asked her to assist me, but I knew the prisoner's person.</p>

            . I live at Hounslow; I was at the Castle at Isleworth, dancing with Jones; I went out a little before him, he joined me in the street. I went up Walpole-lane with him, and had not been there five minutes, before three men came up the lane from Isleworth, running one after the other; two held Mr. Jones, while Levy robbed him. I did not see them before, one run against him with his head and two seized and held him, while the other robbed him; the prisoner is the man who robbed him. I had seen him before that day; I had a little acquaintance with him, but not much; I knew his face quite well. I had seen him that day in the fair, and also at the Castle in the evening, and had spoken to him, but was not in his company. When I walked up the street with Jones, the prisoner and two others stood outside the public-house; I did not speak to him then. Jones was as sober as possible. I am positive he is the man. After robbing him, all three took to their heels, and ran towards Twickenham; the prosecutor did not follow them, but went to a public-house to get assistance. I saw him lay hold of another man in the street, and let him go again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you - A. Twenty-one; I have no parents. I went to the fair alone; Jones was a stranger to me till I met him. I saw the prisoner at the Castle, but was not in his company that day; he had two more men with him, whom I should not know; one wore a white smock frock; they were both Twickenham men; the prisoner lives on Twickenham Common. I was standing in the lane with Jones; two men ran against him, and Jones said,</p>
               <p>"Do you mean robbing me?" Levy said,</p>
               <p>"I do," and pulled his watch out, and handed it to one of the others instantly, and then turned his pockets out. I knew Levy instantly - he wore a fustian jacket and trowsers, and a hat, but no apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell Jones you knew one of them, and where he lived - A. I did not know it would be required till I was taken before the Justice. Jones went to the Castle to look for them; when he asked if I knew them, I said, I did not think I did, he said he really thought I knew them; I said, I did not, and afterwards that I knew one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give your reason for not going back with him, that you were ashamed - A. That was not the reason. I told him one was a Twickenham man - and told him the name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he did not know any of the men, and you must go with him to point them out - A. Yes, he went to look for them. I went before the Justice on Monday - the robbery was on a Tuesday. The constable says the prisoner gave himself up. I did not see him about; he called when I was out, and left word that he was innocent.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When Jones first asked if you knew them, you said you did not - A. Yes; I did not know that he wished to go on with it - but when he said he would. I told him directly, on the same night, and said he lived on Twickenham Common; this was before Jones applied to the constable.</p>

            . I am constable of Twickenham. On the 3d of July, I was applied to by the Isleworth constable about this. I apprehended the prisoner on Twickenham Common on the evening of the 4th of July; his person was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110036"/>described and his name mentioned to me; I had no difficulty in finding him. I had searched his house on the 3d, and next day about nine found him near his home; I told him he was my prisoner, and he surrendered; I understand he had been to surrender at my house on the day before. I had not seen Jones myself; he was sent for and came. Spruce was examined on the 4th, I think.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe Spruce was brought up before the Monday - A. She was with the constable looking after him. East the headborough is not here; I believe he went to him also to surrender; he lived with his mother on the common. I think Spruce was not examined till Monday. The prisoner was dressed then in a smock frock. We all went before the Magistrate on the 6th.</p>

I was at the fair with him on this night, and went to the Castle with him about half past twelve, and remained in his company. We went from there home to Twickenham in the morning - we remained at the Castle till about four o'clock. Thompson was in our company till four o'clock. There were a great many people at the public-house - it was the first day of the fair. He was not out of my sight five minutes of the time. We joined his company at half past twelve o'clock - I met him as I was going home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You met him - A. Yes; and hearing music at the Castle, we went in. I was going home with Thompson; we intended to go home, but hearing the music, the girl and I agreed to go in, and he said he would go with us. There was a dance at the further end of the room; neither of us danced, but sat there drinking.</p>

We were examined twice, and the officers said there was no evidence against us; but at the third examination the people swore they saw us drop the things.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you come to speak about the 23d of July - A. I think it was the 23d; it was the day before they were taken. I know that Joseph was very ill, and came in about six o'clock - he slept in a chair till eight o'clock, and then his mother persuaded him to go to bed, which he did, and I saw no more of him till Sunday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, when I heard somebody knock at my door, as I thought; I opened it, and it was Joseph coming down stairs. I asked how his head was; he said it was very bad. I saw no more till the officers came, and took him - but I do not think Joseph was out of the house.</p>

Her husband was in the room at the time. The room was nearly stripped; the man was discharged by the Alderman. The sheets were taken off the bed that day.</p>

I missed several things previous to her leaving; she laid the suspicion on the laundress, when I mentioned them to her, and the laundress gave up the washing in consequence of it; and after she was gone, I missed most of these things. I missed the jewellery about three days after the prisoner left - I missed two pair of gold bracelets and a necklace out of a drawer - I had lent them to my daughter to wear about Christmas, which was the last time I saw them. In consequence of missing them, I accompanied Handley and Cooper to search her box; she was then in service at the Foreign Office in Downing-street, with Mr. and Mrs. Mountain - I saw her there - she came to me at the area steps. The officers accused her of it, and we followed her immediately up into her room, and desired her to open her boxes, which she did. The officers took her boxes to the office, and they were sealed; I saw the property found there. I said nothing to induce her to confess.</p>

            . I accompanied Mrs. Staff to the prisoner; she ran up stairs as fast as she could, as soon as we said Mrs. Staff had missed property. We followed her up. I saw her box opened, and produce it. I found in the kitchen drawer a book and some articles of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110042"/>wearing apparel. I asked if the things in the drawer belonged to her, and she said they did - Mrs. Staff claimed them. I asked her whether the bracelets and necklace I found in her box belonged to her; she said they were given her by a young man who was dead, and she was in mourning for him - and a piece of poplin and a piece of silk she said were bought in Bond-street; but Mrs. Staff had given me two patterns with which they corresponded. She said the wearing apparel was her own, but Mrs. Staff claimed it. She was taken before the Magistrate and examined twice - I cannot be positive whether what she said was taken down or not.</p>
               <p>MRS. STAFF. The bracelets match exactly with an earring I have brought with me - I swear they are mine; here is a necklace and a pair of bracelets, worth 3 l. at least, they were taken out of one drawer; the wearing apparel was in twelve different places, and taken at different times. There is no one article worth above 40 s. but the necklace and earrings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. Q. Have you lived at Chelsea all the time she was with you - A. Yes; my husband is not there a month at a time; he has not been in the house since. The last time I saw the bracelets they were in my daughter's possession - she had them on about Christmas; I believe they were taken from her drawer; she is nineteen years old, and has nothing to do with the domestic concerns. I keep but one servant - I paid the prisoner her wages on the 20th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not sent her to borrow some money in order to pay her - A. Yes; I never told her I would give her some things instead of money. I gave her a good character, because I thought she deserved it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear her say how she came by the jewellery - A. Yes; she said a young man named Fisher, who was dead, gave it to her. The necklace and bracelets might have been put away separate - a single one is not worth 40 s.</p>

He told me to take it - I told him it was in my mother's box. He gave me a key to unlock the box, but I found the key in it. I went away from him to open it, and left him at the top of a court, two or three yards off - he knew I was going to open it, and get the money. He agreed to wait for me till I brought it to him; he was not to wait to give me notice if anybody was coming - he said he would stop there to receive the money. He was not near enough to hear me if I called to him. I did not come out for half an hour, he was then gone - I found him at his house, which is about thirty yards from my mother's.</p>

I had taken money for my work, at half-past one o'clock. I saw the three prisoners and another in the shed; the other man's name is Gardner. I was in the shed above an hour, or an hour and a half. They all remained there, and asked me to buy a pair of shoes of them. I said I wanted none; and asked where they got them. Gardner said, Saunders of Brentford made them, and that he had made his father's shoes for years; that his name was Gardner. I then knew his father. They said they were nearly starving, and had been in the shed all night, and had no money, and must sell their shoes. The storm being over, I was going away. Young Gardner jumped down with the shoes, and wanted me to buy them. I said I did not want them; he asked 3 s. 6 d. for them. I refused; he at last said I should have them for 18 d., and I bought them; this was the prisoner Gardner. We were all talking together; I had an opportunity of observing their persons. I went into the fair, met a friend, and went to have a pint of beer with him, at a booth; and while we were drinking, up came these four lads, and said,</p>
               <p>"Holla, old boy! give us a drop of beer." They emptied the pot; and one of them said, they would be a pint towards another pot. I ordered a pot; the landlord brought it. I had no change, but six sovereigns. I pulled my purse out; it was narrow, and I could not get my fingers in. I shook it, and out fell the sovereigns. I paid for five pints of beer, and they paid for one. I then twisted my purse up, and put it in my watch-pocket, with the sovereigns, and put 19 s. and three-farthings into my breeches pocket; there were shillings and half-crowns amongst it. They went away; I sat there some time. I went out of the booth to ease myself, and before I could get my clothes down, I saw all four running towards me; the prisoner Gardner struck at me, and I struck at him, and the other three immediately pulled me down on my back; some fell on my legs and arms, and they shoved a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110043"/>handkerchief into my mouth. I thought I should be strangled; I could not move hand or foot, or call out. They cut out my watch-pocket, where the sovereigns were, and took the silver out of my left-hand pocket, and the pair of shoes I had bought of them. It was done in five minutes. It was about ten o'clock in the evening, and was neither dark nor light. I could see them plainly, and am quite sure the prisoners are three of them. One of them said to the other,</p>
               <p>"Have you got it?" he answered,</p>
               <p>"D - n his eyes, yes, I have." I am certain they are the men. After they took my money, they jumped up, and away they ran; and as soon as I could catch my breath, I followed them; they ran into the fair. I searched every booth, but could not find them. I thought I would go to the hay-shed. I went and concealed myself behind the shed, and about three o'clock the three prisoners came back with three girls of the town. I laid there till daylight, then got a constable, who took them and put them in the cage - they were not searched till about eleven o'clock, when they were before the Magistrate at Edgware, and Gardner said his brother took all the money away; the Magistrate said he would send them to the house of correction for a month; his brother was not in custody. Gardner was not threatened in any way; what he said was taken down. One of them cut his fingers in cutting my pocket, and left blood on my coat. Their hands were not examined.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in their company for an hour and a half by day light - A. Yes; and they were in the booth about half an hour; it was about eight o'clock, and quite daylight; they robbed me before ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are you pretty well known at Edgware - A. I work at Harrow; I have a large family - they are on the parish in consequence of my being robbed - I had not a halfpenny from the parish for twelve months before. The Magistrate knew me because he knew my master. I had received 6 l. 5 s. from Mr. Gould, for cutting twelve and a half acres of beans. I had not above three pints of beer all day, and was as sober as I am now. I told Captain 
               <persName id="t18220911-79-person790">Anderson</persName>
             the Magistrate that I could swear to them, and told him the whole story, but he did not commit them on this charge; they were not searched.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not tell the Magistrate you could not swear to the two taller lads - A. I said I could swear to all four, but as to the little one I could swear to him better than the rest. I told him which was the one who struck at me, but I could not say which of them thrust the handkerchief into my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not say you were uncertain about these two men - A. To the best of my knowledge I did not. I will not swear that I did not say so. I said they are the men who robbed me, and I will swear to them. I can swear to them, and the clothes they had on and all, and the Magistrate told me to go to Clerkenwell, and indict them - he committed them for a month, and I went and had them detained.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not take out a warrant before another Magistrate - A. Yes; at Brentford, on the Monday, as they were to come on Friday. I went to Gardener's father to enquire about his brother as they called him - but found he was not a brother; this was nearly a month before the warrant was taken out. I did not ask the father for 2 l. to make it up, but he offered me money several times. He wanted to get me into a hobble.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you state the same story to the Magistrate at Edgware as you have now - A. No, I did not, because he would not give me leave to speak; he told me to hold my tongue. I mentioned the robbery to him. I never expressed a doubt of Gardner, for he is the man who came up and struck me. The other two and another were present.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Who mentioned it first - A. I did not hear the beginning. They had been talking about it before, and came over to the public-house to settle it. Gardner came over with the money in his hand, and I persuaded him not to settle it, as it was compounding felony. The prosecutor said he would take 1 l. then, and 1 l. in a month's time. This was at Brentford. Harper lives at Sunbury, seven miles off.</p>

On the 15th of July I had just gone out, and on my return saw the prisoner coming out of the shop door; I asked what he wanted, he answered nothing; I turned my head and saw a dress lie in the shop, which I had left on the parlour table behind the shop; I stopped him and asked what he had got, and from under his jacket he pulled the time piece, and laid it on the shop board, saying he did not mean to take it away; I called for assistance; my son came and secured him; the timepiece was kept on the mantlepiece in the parlour; I saw it there about ten minutes before; I had left nobody in the parlour. I have had it for twelve years; it is worth 3 l., and is a very good one. I left my child at the door when I went out, but he went away.</p>

I saw these things safe, about an hour before they were stolen - they were locked in a box, in the two pair back room. The prisoners were entire strangers. On Saturday, the 20th of July, between two and four o'clock, a neighbour came, and told me something - I went up stairs, and double locked the bed room door. I saw the two prisoners going backwards and forwards in Shoe-lane; I lost sight of Hobdell, and kept my eye on Roberts, who stood by St. Bride's workhouse gate. I watched him for half an hour; he went quickly by the house into Fleet-street, and went back again - I kept watching him. I saw Hobdell come out of the private door of the house, and run with him, and give him the bundle - I pursued them both into Fleet-street; they both ran towards Fleet-market, but on opposite sides of the street. I took Roberts just by Bride-lane, with the bundle - I brought him back, and sent for a constable. The bundle contained the articles stated in the indictment, all of which I know to be mine. I went to my lodging, examined my box, and found the whole room ransacked; the lock had been opened by a key. On the Tuesday following I saw Hobdell, and am quite sure of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You live in a room in Buncombe's house - A. Yes; he lives in the house. I know his name is John, because I sent to him to know, and he gave me a receipt for rent in that name. I saw the prisoners in my tap together, about a week before the robbery. I watched them for an hour and a half before the robbery, and can swear to both of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HOBDELL. Q. Was I dressed the same when you took me as before - A. No; he had a long brown coat on at the time of the robbery.</p>

            . I live opposite the tap in Shoe-lane, and am a shoemaker. I have known Roberts eight years, and Hobdell two. On the 20th of July, about half-past one o'clock, I saw Hobdell pass my shop window; I went to the door to watch, and saw Roberts coming; on seeing me he crossed the way; they joined at the bottom of the lane, by Fleet-street, and had some conversation - Hobdell left Roberts, and went into the private door, of No. 113, where the prosecutor lodged - he came out in half a minute without anything, and joined Roberts seven or eight doors off. I saw them talking together - I went and told Chappell; he went up to fasten his door, and in about an hour and a half, I saw Hobdell going towards Fleet-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110047"/>with a bundle, and beckoning to Roberts, who was watching at the corner of a passage; he followed him very fast, and when they got a few doors down Fleet-street, Hobdell handed the bundle to him. I pursued Roberts, and stopped him at the corner of Bride-lane, and Chappell came up. I saw the bundle opened; it contained clothes. On the Tuesday following, I saw Hobdell in custody, and am positive of his person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ROBERTS. Q. Are you certain you saw me following Hobdell - A. I am. He took the bundle on this side of Fleet-street, and ran across.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew Hobdell before - A. Yes. I did not know where he lived at the time. I believe Buncombe's name is Benjamin. I went to fetch his name, and saw him write it - the first letter was B.</p>

            . I am fifteen years old. In July 1821, I was errand-boy to Mr. Willis; the prisoner was journeyman. In that month, I saw him go into Mr. Chaffers's shop, in Watling-street, and stopped till he came out. I asked what he had been doing; he said nothing at first, but told me he would give me 2 s. if I would not say what he went for; and said he took a pair of shoes out of Mr. Willis's shop, and had pawned them. I took the 2 s., and did not tell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did you stay with your master after this - A. About seven months. I was discharged when I went away. My mother said my master had found a pair of shoes at our house; the prisoner had stolen them. My mother gave me 10 s., and I went to my uncle in Ireland, and returned two or three months ago.</p>

He was to sleep in the two pair back-room, with two other persons. Conway slept in the next bed to him, and went to bed after the prisoner; the prisoner went to bed a little after ten o'clock, and about a quarter past one o'clock, I heard somebody stumbling or falling down stairs. I ran down stairs, and close to the front door passage, I found the prisoner in the act of putting on his shoes. I asked what he did there; he said he was going by the coach at a quarter to five o'clock, and was afraid of being too late. I said, I thought all was not right, and was a great mind to give him in charge. He said, I might depend on his being no thief. I said, he should take off his coat, and he took it off. I asked if he had any money; he said, None. I said he should go back into the room, and see if any thing had happened to either of the parties. I told him to take off his bat; he did so, and I heard something rattle. He said it was only some money he had - I said,</p>

               <p>"You said you had no money." I then let him go into the bed-room; I took his hat and coat into my bed-room, returned, and awoke the parties in the room. The first man said in his presence, that his silver was all gone except 6 d. Conway then sat up, and took his trowsers from behind the pillow, and said he had lost one sovereign, four half-crowns, and 3 s.; he had no money left. I searched the bed where the prisoner had slept alone; he had been in the room a minute or two, while I went into my own room. I found between the bolster and mattrass an old canvas purse, which he claimed. I said,</p>
               <p>"Here is money; you said you had none." I found in it a sovereign, four half-crowns, 5 s., and five sixpences. Conway claimed them; he said I might depend on it, it was his. Behind the mattress, I also found a bunch of keys, which we had lost about five weeks before; he had lodged there twice before. The other man said the rest of the money was about the sum he had lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The other man did not know what he had lost - A. Not exactly. The prisoner had no watch. I found a bill in the purse, which was his. He took his shoes up to the room at night.</p>

I examined my trowsers, found the money all gone, but the trowsers replaced as I had put them; it could not have dropped out by accident. His purse contained the money I lost. I had not been in bed many minutes before I thought I heard my bed-curtains pulled aside; I turned round, and saw the prisoner's arm extended to my bed; he was looking stedfastly at me; he was in bed.

I am certain the prisoner is one of the men; he was a stranger before; he spoke to me, for I complained of their pressing on me, and he said, if I could not come there in a good temper, I had better go home. I let go my friend's arm and ran out of the market, being alarmed. I put my hand in my pocket and found it cut; my gown and petticoat were cut right down. I saw the prisoner again on the Monday, in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields - I was then alone - I was convinced he was the person; I gave no alarm. I saw him again at half-past nine o'clock that morning, at Mr. Loveday the pawnbroker's, offering some duplicates, which were part of the contents of the pocket-book. I charged him with being the person who stole my pocket-book; he denied it, but said he had found it; he held it out - I snatched it from him, and gave it to Mr. Loveday. A constable was sent for, who secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. The market was much thronged and crowded - A. Not particularly so; I found nothing unpleasant till this bustle; there might be ten or twelve round me; I was passing a butcher's shop; there was no oyster stall near. The prisoner was scuffling with the men and bustling to stop the progress of the people - he in particular pushed me about.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he scuffling with the other men - A. Boxing each other with their arms. There was nothing but duplicates and memorandums in the pocket-book. When I saw him in Queen-street, he was not pointed out to me. I had been to the pawnbroker's in Covent-garden and Long-acre, as some of the duplicates belonged to these shops, and found somebody had been there. He said he found the pocket-book.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Calthorpe-place, Gray's Inn-road. I know Mrs. Morgan. On Monday morning, a little before ten o'clock, the prisoner came into one of the boxes of my shop, and presented two duplicates, which he said he wanted out; Mrs. Morgan had been in the shop two minutes before, to stop them; they were for a child's coat, earrings, and a piece of silver. Mrs. Morgan was still in the shop. I went round the passage and beckoned her out; I took her to the box door, and asked her if she knew the prisoner; she said in his bearing she knew him perfectly well; that he was the man who robbed her. I told him the prosecutrix had lost a pocket-book, and he had better give it her, as I dare say she did not wish to hurt him. He produced a pocket-book, and said he picked it up; she claimed that and the two duplicates. There were some papers in it, and another duplicate of my shop; he went to the passage-door, pretending to call a person who was with him - none came. Two officers took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He came under no concealment - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>MRS. MORGAN. The duplicates are for things I pawned myself, in the name of Smith.</p>
               <p>CHERUBIM LACY. I live in Francis-street, Gray's Inn-road. I went to market with Mrs. Morgan. I noticed a scuffle and people pressing on her; and Mrs. Morgan soon after missed her pocket-book; they pressed on me at the same time. She shewed me her pocket, which was cut and slit down. I remember the features of one man, but have not seen him since. I do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it in the middle of the market - A. About the middle; there were a great many round; we were close to a butcher's. I saw no oyster stall.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was going by Loveday's, and heard prosecutrix say to the prisoner, that he was the man who hustled her on Saturday evening; he said he was an honest man - that he found the pocketbook, and if she would pay him for finding it, he would deliver it up; she insisted that he was the man, and I took him. I found three silver tea, and four plated spoons, and two dessert spoons, two pair of earrings, one brooch, one ring, and one knife, and four duplicates on him. Mrs. Morgan claimed them all.</p>
               <p>MRS. MORGAN.

I saw him come in - he told his wife he had found a prize - that he had picked up a pocket-book; he opened it on the table, and found nothing in it but tickets; he cannot read or write, and did not know what to make of them; this was about half-past twelve o'clock; he said he found it by his stall in coming home.</p>

On the same day when her wages were paid, she brought her boxes into the passage; I requested her to open them, and she refused; I said, if she was an honest woman she need not be afraid; she did not open them - the officer took her again before Mr. Hood, the same Magistrate, and opened them in his presence, and found this property - she said they were mine, that she had put them there to preserve them, and that she intended to return them.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 10th of August I was ordered to put the prisoner out of Mr. Dodd's house; I asked her to bring her boxes down stairs, and go as quick as she could - she was a long time - when she came down, Mr. Dodd wished to have them searched; she said she did not strike her master intentionally. She refused to open her boxes. I took her before the Magistrate; she said she could not find the key; I took her back to the house - she found the key; we returned to the office - she opened the boxes - these things were found. She said she must have put them there by mistake, in her fright.</p>

            . I am a potato-merchant. The prisoner came to lodge with me in January. He left me about a month ago. I pressed him hard for money; he said it was not in his power to pay, but that if I chose, he would give me a piece of goods as security. I said I had rather he would leave me some of his furniture; he gave me a pawnbroker's duplicate, and went and transferred the goods, that day, into my name, and left that duplicate with the pawnbroker, and took another in my name; it was satin; he said he had taken it in part for a bad debt. I wanted him to go to the pawnbroker's with me, but he gave me a piece of paper instead.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 5th of September, I accompanied Miles to Mitchell-street, Whitechapel, and found the prisoner there. We asked if he had any duplicates about him; he immediately produced this duplicate out of his pocket. I told him what I came about, but neither threatened or promised him; he said,</p>
               <p>"This is part of Mr. Stanbridge's property." The duplicate was for twenty-one yards of satin, pledged for 2 l. 6 s. 6 d. He said his landlord, Harrold, had taken the ticket of the other part instead of rent. I took him to the office, went to the pawnbroker's with the ticket, and they brought the satin to the office. I found his wife and family in the greatest distress. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been a housekeeper in a very respectable way of business for a number of years; but my circumstances became embarrassed. The shortness of time prevents my obtaining gentlemen of the first respectability to my character; the prosecutor, however, can speak to my character for years. I have four children, and my wife expects to be confined every moment with a fifth. I was never charged with any offence, but distress has brought me into this situation, and I trust my great distress will in some measure tend to mitigate my sentence - and implore your mercy towards a penitent man.</p>
               <p>Eight witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

I went to bed about twelve o'clock that night, leaving the prisoner alone in the dining room, where the desk was. She was standing by the sideboard where the bed candlesticks stood. I had a daughter ill at the time - she had gone to bed about an hour after; I had been up stairs about half an hour - I went from my room into my daughter's to get something from her drawers. I saw the prisoner about two steps from the top of the stairs, coming up; her bed room joined mine, and is up four pair of stairs; she caught by the banisters of the stairs, and made a noise as if very much agitated - she had a candle; I asked what was the matter - she said she was tired; I told her not to make such a noise. I went into my bed room, and thought I heard somebody at my door; I opened it and found she was at my daughter's door just adjoining; she said she had put out her candle, and that my daughter was giving her out a light; she went to her own room. About two o'clock in the afternoon of the next day, which was Sunday, I saw Captain Drew's writing desk; (the prisoner had gone out a few minutes before one o'clock.) The desk was in its usual place, with the lock next the window; I lifted it up and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110051"/>put a table cloth under it to press, and it opened. I took it into the front parlour, and locked it up in a cupboard, of which I kept the key. Captain Drew had gone out on Saturday night, and returned on Sunday morning - he was not at home many minutes - and then went out to dinner; this was before I found the desk open. I did not see him till next morning at breakfast; as I had gone to bed before he came home. I produced his desk to him exactly in the same state as I took it from the dining room table. In consequence of what passed, a Bow-street officer was sent for - he searched the servants, and all parts of the house. Miss Butler was in her bed room, and had not been down that morning; when he had searched all but her room, I went to tell her, and found her door was locked; I knocked at it, and got in in about ten minutes; I stood just within the door, and requested her to dress herself - and when she had done so, I called the officer up, and saw him search her drawer. I saw two 5 l. notes found in the rosette of the bed, at the top of the bed post - the officer took them; there was a clasp of a pocket-book found in her drawer, which I had seen in a pocket-book of hers before; she had brought it down a few days before and shewed it me. When it was found it was separate from the book, it looked like silver. I did not hear her say where she got any of the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you searched the bed before the officers - A. No, I went into the room first, and when the officer took hold of the rosette, the notes rattled; he took his hand away, and I took and pressed it down, and said,</p>
               <p>"What is this rattling?" he pulled down the rosette, and said</p>
               <p>"Notes" - he was going to examine the other rosette at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not Miss Butler complained of losing her pocket-book on Saturday night - A. Yes, and that the key of the place she kept her night clothes in, was in it. I was searched myself after the servants.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. From two o'clock, when you found the desk, was it under lock and key in your possession - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a master mariner. In August last, I boarded and lodged at Mr. Cotterell's. The prisoner boarded there at the same time. I received sixteen 5 l. Bank notes from Messrs. Grotes. I have no memorandum of my own, of the particulars. I had seven of them in my possesion on Saturday the 10th of August; I went out on that evening, and immediately before I went out, I said in the prisoner's presence that it was too much money to take out in my pocket, and I would put it in my desk - I took three sovereigns out of the notes, and put the seven notes in my desk in the dining room in her presence. A gentleman who dined with me, and was going out with me (I believe Mr. Cotterell's daughter), and a Mr. Briscoe were present. I locked my desk, and am positive I left it locked, and took the key with me - it was a common lock, and new about a week before. I came home the following day, about one o'clock, and did not look at my desk at all. I stopped at home about twenty minutes, changed my dress, and went out again - I slept out that night, and came home about eight o'clock next morning, and about nine I saw Mrs. Cotterell, who produced my desk to me from the cupboard in the other room, which was locked, and found the desk open. On laying it open, I missed my penknife; I searched further, and missed the notes from under the place where I kept the pen knife. I desired Mrs. Cotterell to call the servants up, which she did - I told her to keep them all in the parlour till I returned. I went to Bow-street, and brought an officer - all the servants and Mrs. Cotterell were searched; nothing was found on them. The desk had evident marks of being broken open. I remained below while the officer went up to Miss Butler's room. He asked Mrs. Cotterell to go up and sit in her room till he came up. Some money and Bank notes were found - they then called me into the room. She disclaimed all knowledge of the two 5 l. Bank notes found in the bed; but said the sovereigns were her own. I have heard of another 5 l. note being found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you came home on Sunday, did you see Mrs. Cotterell - A. No, I did not see her all Sunday.</p>

            . On the 10th of August, I was servant to Mrs. Cotterell. Miss Butler was the last person up except myself - I met her on the first floor stairs, as she was going to bed; my mistress had gone to bed about half an hour. After Miss Butler went to bed she rung the bell twice very violently, and asked if I had seen her pocketbook, for she had put it on the bed, and afterwards she said she put it under the bed. She told me to look carefully for it, as she said I must have seen it if it had been moved out of the room. I am the only servant who goes up stairs - she said the keys of her drawers were in her pocketbook. I had never seen the pocket-book. She said she could not get at her night clothes for want of her keys. On the following day, as I was coming out of my mistress's room, I saw her. She said I must look for her pocketbook, for she had not a farthing of money, but what was there; this was between twelve and one o'clock. She said she had found the keys of her drawers on the carpet; but she had no money, and I must find her pocket-book. She went out before dinner, and returned between nine and ten o'clock at night. She had not been out between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you not find her a key - A. I got her three keys on Saturday night, and one of them opened her drawer. I recollect a bonnet being brought home for my young mistress on Saturday night. I did not hear Mrs. Butler offer to lend her any money. I looked in every part of the room for her pocketbook.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Monday, the 12th of August, I went to the house, to search. I produce the desk - force had been used to it at some time or other. I cannot say whether it was opened by force or not. I searched the servants as well as Mrs. Cotterell, also the boxes and rooms, but found nothing. I sent Mrs. Cotterell up to the prisoner's room, and when she gave me notice I went in and told Miss Butler that Mr. Drew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110052"/>had been robbed; that I had searched the servants and lodgers, and also Mrs. Cotterel and the rooms, and requested leave to search hers - she consented. The first place I examined was the top drawer of a chest of drawers, and in that I found four parcels of money wrapped in paper, and sealed up - the prisoner opened the first paper, which contained twenty sovereigns. I have the papers of some of them, but cannot distinguish them. Part of the money was given to the prisoner. Another paper contained 20 s. in silver, and another 10 s. in silver, all in shillings; there was another with ten sixpences; there were two loose sovereigns, 4 s. in silver, and 4 d. in copper, in the same drawer - it was a single chest of drawers. She was present at the search. I saw a clasp in the drawer where the money was, which Mrs. Cotterell has since delivered me. (The clasp was here produced, which Mrs. Cotterell identified as the same she spoke of). I proceeded in my search; no person told me where to look. I did not find any thing more at that moment, but left the room, for Mrs. Cottrell to search the prisoner. After she had done this, I was called in again, and recollecting there were parts of the room I had not searched, I commenced again. I searched the bed furniture - nobody assisted me. At the foot of the bed, in the drapery, there were three rosettes - I put my hand on the one on the right hand, and felt something rattle; I felt the next, to see if they were stuffed with paper, when Mrs. Cotterell directly said,</p>
               <p>"What is that rattling in the rosettes?" and put her hand to it, taking hold of the outside. I examined it, and took out two 5 l. Bank notes, which I marked at the time and produce; they were doubled up separately, not in any envelope. I asked the prisoner if she knew how they came there; she said she knew nothing of them, they were not hers. She said the money was her own, and she had had it by her some time, three weeks or a month; she did not say from whom she had it. The paper containing the sovereigns was a printed report, dated only a few days previous. Another 5 l. note came into my possession on the 27th of August, and I went with a Mr. Price, a surgeon of Kensington, to Tothill Fields, where the prisoner was, about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She was in bed when you first went to the house - A. I understood so. She did not know I was searching the people below. I found Mrs. Cotterell in the room; I saw somebody search the bed clothes before Mrs. Cotterell went to it, but not the furniture; I stood looking at them while they moved the bed clothes. The prisoner told the Magistrate that the money was sealed up as a provision to take her to France.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Grote and and Co. On the 26th of July I paid Mr. Drew 180 l., in eight notes of 10 l., sixteen of 5 l., and 20 l. in gold - the 5 l. notes were numbered from 17035 to 17050 inclusive, and all dated the 19th of June, 1822; they lay in regular order when paid to him - the lowest number being the top note - (looks at No. 17044, 17047, and 17048, 5 l. notes) - these are three of them; date and all correspond. I have the book in which they are entered by myself.</p>
               <p>MR. DREW. I received sixteen 5 l. notes from the banker's; I kept them in the order I took them; I paid away the eight first the day I received them, for seamen's wages; I took them regularly from the top; I paid away another on the day of the robbery; I took the outside one to pay that, but which outside I cannot say - it must have been been either No. 17043 or 17050 - I put the remaining seven in my desk, and did not miss them at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where had you kept them - A. They were always in my possession. I think they were in my desk till the day of the robbery, and I put them into my pocket on that day, expecting to leave town. I am sure I paid away the eight top ones, beginning with the lowest number. I paid them at the Seamen's Register-office, on the Commercial-road. I never gave two 5 l. notes to one individual. I went there straight from the banker's.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Kensington. On Sunday, the 11th of August, I sold a bottle of lavender water to the prisoner. I have no doubt of her. It was, as near as I can recollect, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; it cost 2 s. 6 d. She tendered a 5 l. note - (looking at No. 17044) - this is it. I wrote on it, No. 8, St. James's-place, St. James's-street; that was the address she gave me. She said Mrs. Gray was the person she took the note from, but that she herself lived in St. James's-place; that Mrs. Gray kept a school at Brook Green. The lavender water was in a very remarkable bottle - (looks at one) - this is it. I went with Ellis to Tothill-fields afterwards, and saw the prisoner in bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You do not mean to be positive to the prisoner's person - A. It is very painful to say so, but I am positive. My shop is open on Sundays.

             told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110053"/>she was going. She did not board with me. She owed me six guineas, and did not pay.</p>
               <p>The prisoner read an exceeding long defence, much of which was in so weak a tone of voice as to be quite inaudible. From what could be collected, it went to deny any knowledge whatever of the robbery - that the money found in her possession she had received from a person, but whose name, from a delicacy to the family, nothing should induce her to disclose, although promises of the prosecution being given up were made to her, if she would disclose the source from which she received it. That when the officer was searching her drawers, Mrs. Cotterell stood within a few inches of the rosette, apparently looking for her pocket book, and then directed the officers' attention to the rosette; and that she left her bed-room door open on Sunday, which was no indication of her guilt, if the property was in her possession.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where is your stand - A. I have an apartment. Mrs. Butler sent me to Boodle's for an answer to a letter; she then lodged at a china shop in Piccadilly. I lodged in Bury-street at that time. I will not swear it was not six weeks before she was taken up; she was three weeks at a bootmaker's, and it was about a week before that. I often went on messages for her. The letter I carried to her seemed to have both notes and money in it. I cannot swear what was in it, for I gave it her in the drawing room, and she took it into the bed room, and broke it open, but by the feel I thought so. I always went on her errands.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you feel the letter, to see if there was money in it - A. It was hard, and felt as if there was notes and money in it; it felt hard and soft, and was sealed several times round.</p>

I double locked the door - there is a bar which falls down beside the lock. I returned at half-past eight o'clock the same evening; it was daylight then. I found the door on the single lock, and the bar lying down on the floor - all the glass cases were open, and all the watches gone, and the cases emptied of all their contents, except trifling things. None of the gilt or steel things were taken; but all the gold. I missed about two hundred watches. I cannot say how many of the seals were taken, as my wife managed the jewellery - there were more than ten seals, and a great number of gold pins, and several silver things; also a great many gold earrings, silver thimbles, spoons, and pencil cases. All the articles taken were either gold or silver, and coral ear rings and necklaces. I missed six soverigns, a 10 l. note, and 3 l. in silver; the sovereigns were left in my till - I had marked them on Saturday night, so as to know them again, and am sure they were in my possession on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Was your wife out with you - A. Yes; I have found some pins, but none of the watches or seals - Reading was taken somewhere by Marlborough-street, on Monday afternoon, and on Tuesday, I went to the House of Correction with an order from the Magistrate to search him. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have a 10 l. note of mine, turn out all the papers you have;" he had a paper in his hand, but would not give it up, but was obliged - he had a watch in his fob, I did not claim that - it was shewn to me before the Magistrate - his name was on the dial - I said, it was possible that name might be put on since the Sunday, and tried to see if it was burnt in, as many of those I lost belonged to other people, and I did not know them - I found it was burnt in; I advertised my loss, but did not state the sovereigns in the advertisement, as the officer said I was to be quiet about the note, and stop it at the bank - I did not think it necessary to advertise the sovereigns - I generally mark all my sovereigns, but the two in question I could pick out from ten thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sent many sovereigns into the world with the same mark - A. Not with the same mark, they were marked in a particular way - I took them in the dusk of the evening, and had not an opportunity of looking at them by daylight till Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was searched at the House of Correction, were not the six sovereigns taken from him produced - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110054"/>Only five were produced - they were not returned to him to my knowledge - they were produced before the Magistrate on the Thursday. My wife had gone to Deptford on Saturday night, and I went to her on Sunday, and left the house securely fastened. I have no servant, as the house is too small to keep one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do not you keep any servant - A. Yes; in the day time, my wife managed the jewellery business entirely. I marked the sovereigns as I have marked others, nearly ever since sovereigns have been in circulation; but lately I have marked them different, as I have been told there must be no gold taken off; I mark them on the edge with a pen-knife, and bruise it down again so that none is taken off.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. Was Reading asked to give up the paper in the gaol - A. Yes; he refused, and Mr. Isaacs, his solicitor, told him not to give it up. Hassel has it; five sovereigns were taken from him at the House of Correction, six had been found on him, but he had changed one before he got there. Prince's-street is a great thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mark your sovereigns for - A. To try if they are gold.</p>

            . At the time of this robbery I lived at No. 2, Richmond-street, nearly opposite the prosecutor's house. I have known Reading from a lad, he was a play-fellow of mine - I knew him well, and cannot be mistaken in him. On Sunday the 28th of July I saw him at the corner of Upper Rupert-street, in company with four or five other men, at a few minutes after one o'clock; they were not more than fifty yards from Westwood's house - I was going home at the time, and went home, and from my window saw him in company with one of the four men - I saw them loitering about there from one o'clock till half-past four o'clock, first on one side, and then on the other, they were not all four together all the time - the last time I saw Reading he was by himself, leaning on a post. When I saw him with one of them, the other two were on the opposite side. Reading had on a brown coat and blue trowsers. I am sure of his person.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Ann's, Soho, in the liberty of Westminster. About twelve o'clock on Monday the 29th of July, I took Reading in custody - he had a watch, and a seal apparently gold attached to it; I am positive that he had a seal. I took him to St. Ann's watch-house, and sent for Westwood and the constable, who examined him in my presence, and found on him six sovereigns and 2 s. and a silver watch - the seal was gone then. I said nothing to him about it. I am positive he had a seal, for he played with it all the way he went - it was on his ring when he entered the watch-house; and while I was speaking to one of the Watch Committee, he must have made away with it - I could not find it. We returned the sovereigns back to him; the prosecutor was not there then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The Magistrate was sitting when you took him; why not take him to the office - A. I waited for Westwood, to know whether he was the man. The watch-house is in Dean-street, a good way from Marlborough-street. Westwood came to the office in the evening, but was not at the watch-house. Bidgood was with me when I took him. We searched the watch-house, but found no seal. I did not hear the prosecutor claim the watch found on him. He said the dialplate might be altered in a few hours. The sovereigns were returned to him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the sovereigns produced to Westwood in your presence - A. Yes, at Marlborough-street he pointed out a mark on them; they were not returned to the prisoner after that.</p>

            . I am clerk at the House of Correction; the prosecutor brought down an order for Reading to be searched - and he was searched in my presence; five sovereigns and a watch were found on him. Westwood said the sovereigns were his - he said they had a private mark on them; he did not explain it; he was rather agitated. I was before the Magistrate on the Thursday following, and had kept the sovereigns all the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not the Magistrate ask what the mark was - and did he not ask to see them before he showed it - A. Yes; he claimed the whole five at the House of Correction, but was much agitated at the time, as he thought to find a 10 l. note as well. Before the prisoner was searched, he said he expected to find a 10 l. note, and some sovereigns; I do not recollect that he said how many. He pointed out two of the sovereigns at Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he say at the prison that there was a mark on them - A. He said he marked all his sovereigns - but what his wife took, she did not mark; he had them in his hand when he pointed out the mark to the Magistrate. I produce them; I marked them all myself on the King's neck.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Have you any paper which you took from Reading - A. Yes; he put his hand in his pocket and took it out. I asked for it - he would not give it me for some time. I said,</p>
               <p>"Will you give it to your solicitor." Mr. Isaacs took it, and would not give it up; but Mr. Atkins came, and then Isaacs gave it me; it is written with pencil; I copied it, but produce the original.</p>

            , (looking at two of the sovereigns.) Under the dragon in the milling is a small notch, more like a bruise. I can swear these are the sovereigns I marked on Saturday night, and saw safe on Sunday morning. I had marked other sovereigns, but know I had these on Saturday night after dark - and not being able to look at them well then, I looked at them on Sunday morning; they are marked in a particular place. I did not mark the others in any particular place.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, as a conscientious man, undertake to swear they are the sovereigns you had on Saturday night - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You marked them before you lost them - A. Yes, I did not put another mark on them at the office - but Hassell did. I dare say I have passed hundreds, but not marked in this way, because it is only lately that I bruised them down again; if you mix them with a thousand I will pick them out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. For the last six months you have marked sovereigns in this way - A. Yes; I do not always mark them on a particular side; these are marked under the dragon, and under the head. I will not say I have not marked others in the same place.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Your general habit of marking is by raising the gold with a penknife, and putting it down again - A. Yes; I looked at them on Sunday morning, and recollect the very place I marked them, and find the marks there; my reason for cutting them was to ascertain whether they were good gold - not in order to know them again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you cut the others - A. I think my wife took the others; she weighs them instead of cutting them.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Now, my Lord, we will produce our evidence against the receiver.</p>

            . In August last I saw seven pins in the shop window of Mr. Green, of Oxford-street, jeweller, and knew them to be my manufacture - and what I sold to Mrs. Westwood, at two or three different times, some nine or ten months ago - and others three or five months ago - and two black ones among them. I had sold her fourteen months ago; I informed her of it, and have since seen four of them; they were on four separate cards.</p>

Yes; but in this case I took no account of the purchase, as I owed him money, and gave him a bill for 10 l., which is due on the 4th of October. I do not know what date it was drawn at; he brought the pins to me in my shop - there were eight or nine of them. I gave him 2 s. each. I have dealt with him some years; he deals in furniture and jewellery - and buys goods at sales; and lives in Duke's-place, Hounsditch, but has no shop. I am a jeweller and clothes salesman; my bill book is at home.</p>

            . I sold some pins to Mr. Green six or seven weeks ago. I had them from the prisoner Solomon about twenty-four hours before. I bought between two and three dozen of him. I cannot tell what I gave for them, it is so long past. I recollect giving him a sovereign and some silver. I cannot say how much silver, or whether it was 20 s. or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did you do with them - A. I went to sell them immediately. Green says he bought some of me. I know I sold him pins, but cannot say they were the same I bought of Solomon. It is impossible to swear to pins.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you mix what you bought of him with others - A. Not with other pins; I had no others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell Green the pins you had from Solomon - A. Yes. I sold the rest to different pawnbrokers; some to Parker of Holborn - nearly two dozen. I do not recollect what Green gave me, for he owed me something, and I took a bill of him. I have paid it away, I cannot exactly recollect who to. I have not got my book, and cannot tell the date or amount without it.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, did you happen to be taken up as a receiver of these stolen goods - A. Yes; and at the second examination I stated that Solomon was the man I bought them of. I could not recollect at the first time. The Justice did not tell me I must produce my books.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you remember seeing me there - A. Yes. The Justice asked if I had any books which contained an entry on this subject; I told him I did not keep an account of what I sold or bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not ask you for your books, and you said the only book you kept was in Hebrew - A. I do not recollect it. I said I kept a bill-book; some entries are in Hebrew, and some in English.</p>

I went out on the 21st of August, between eight and nine in the morning, returned at seven at night, and found the box broken open, and the things gone. Nobody was in the room; the door was always open. Next morning I found the five gowns at three different pawnbrokers, but I have not found the pocket. The prisoner slept in part of the room, which was divided off; he did not come home that night, and was not found for about a week afterwards; he was taken on the Wednesday following; but had never returned.</p>

I thought he was helping Allen; I went after him; Allen asked how many lambs I had carried, and I said seven, and told him another man took one; I saw him the same day about one o'clock in a public-house; I knew his person before about the market. Allen fetched an officer, who took him. The lamb has not been found.</p>

               <p>MR. SAMUEL M'CLEARY. I live in Adam-street West, Portman-square.

I told a friend who was by my side, and upon our looking round we saw the prisoner hanging by the coach on the step; he could reach my pocket. I charged him with it, got down and seized him; he denied it, but at last drew out one handkerchief from his bosom, and said it was his own; he was taken to the watch-house, and after considerable search, the watch-house keeper found the other tucked in his stocking.</p>

I said it was strange; he said his master did not always tell him when he sent him out with a bundle what it was; that his name was Nicholas, and he lived at Islington - and was going to his father with the bundle. James had gone on, and came back and asked what was the matter. I said I had stopped the boy to know what he had got; he said, he did not know. James said,</p>
               <p>"Nor does he know". I said,</p>

I went a little way with him - he said he was a smuggler, and that the bundle contained silks. I said, I must be satisfied what he had got - he refused; I said, I must be satisfied, or I should take him to the office. I told Woolham and another who were with me, to take the prisoner with the bundle to the watch-house; he refused to give it up, fell on the ground, and began kicking.

I put my hand to my fob, and found the watch was safe; the moment he had committed the robbery, he called Stop thief himself. I immediately followed, calling Stop thief also.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did he run against you - A. He pushed me not violently, he merely ran against me to shove me off my guard; he shoved me on one side, for half a yard, or three quarters and broke the watch chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that shove prevent you from protecting your property - A. It did, my Lord, it was a push. As soon as the chain broke he ran down the yard, and I followed; he was out of my sight for a moment or two, while he turned the corner; he was then secured. I am positive of him. It was about dusk. While I was pursuing him, some persons came round, pretending to inquire what had happened, and endeavoured to stop me. I drove through them, and immediately after somebody struck me a violent blow over the arm; it was very sore next day. I still pursued; he was in custody of Page, when I overtook him; nobody was running between me and him; there were plenty following us. My seals were found on the spot where he was taken; he said nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. It was dark - A. Yes; I had a good view of his face; he had a hat, a black coat, waistcoat, and black handkerchief, but I saw his face by the light from a public-house window; he ran about a hundred yards before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not lost your watch, or been attacked, you would not have noticed the push - A. No; I should have felt my fob immediately; he rushed up against me - I was alarmed.</p>

On Monday, the 26th of August, about five o'clock in the evening, I was at work in the shop below - and in consequence of what was said, I went up into my room, and found the door broken open. I had locked it half an hour before. I missed the property stated in the indictment, which is worth about 3 l., or more; the suit of clothes were nearly new, and cost 6 l. 4 s. I had them about fifteen months, but only wore them on Sunday. I value them altogether, at 3 l. I am sure I could not buy them for that. I went to Bow-street on the 27th, and saw the prisoner with one of the shirts on his back, which I am positive is mine.</p>

On the Saturday following I went to Queen-street, Seven Dials, and saw Bromley at work on a seat; I asked the landlord (Henley) if he was his son, he said, Yes; I came away, soon after Bromley came down, and I stopped him; I told him I believed his name was Gibbons; he denied it, and said it was Henley, and that I had just been to his father's apartment; I took him to the watch-house; he then confused he was the person who was called Bromley, and that the book was given him by Mrs. Walker to carry up stairs.</p>

            . I am a constable, and live in Honey-lane, Market. On the 9th of August, at nine o'clock in the morning, I took the prisoner in Wood's shop; I saw him go in and produce money, he had taken it up, and was coming out. I searched him and found one bad shilling, one bad sixpence, two good shillings, one good sixpence, and thirteen pence three farthings in copper on him. As I was taking him to the Compter I saw his hand in his jacket pocket, he drew it out, and I saw a piece of paper in it. When I got to the Compter, I took his hand out of his pocket; he then struck me in the mouth; I knocked him down, and took six sixpences, and two shillings from him him, all bad; I found some yellow soap and fat on him.</p>
               <p>MR. POWELL. The sixpences found in his hand are all bad, and of the same die, and appear not to have been in circulation; the two shillings are also bad, and from the same die, one of them has been rubbed with fat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had changed a sovereign, that he stumbled in the street, and his money fell from his pockets, he picked up two shillings, and a Jew picked up the rest and gave him.</p>

            , Please to send by bearer, one dozen of men's white cotton, 2 s. 6 d., and one dozen of women's ditto, about 3 s. J. Titcombe, Knightsbridge." He said he brought the order from Mr. Titcombe, which I believed. I looked out the goods, and gave him a dozen caps, as he said Mr. Titcombe had omitted them. I had never seen him before; he went away with the goods. I saw him again on the 21st, and am sure of his person; he was about twenty minutes with me.</p>

            . I am a haberdasher and hosier, and live at Knightsbridge. I have been a customer of Mr. Last's about fifteen years. The prisoner once lived with a friend in the City - he was never my servant; he knew the houses I dealt with. The order is not my handwriting, nor any of my servants. I sent a young man on the 3d of August without an order, but not for such articles; these goods never came into my possession.</p>

I said we could not purchase it without enquiry, and he left it for me to make enquiry. I advanced him 16 l. on the first day; he came again afterwards - I gave him in all 35 l. 10 s., which I thought the value of it, and took a receipt for it, which he signed in the name of Davis.

            , the prisoner's brother; he was tried here for bigamy. The prisoner was present at the marriage; he gave his brother away at my father's house, in marriage to my sister, at Cashel. They were married by a Catholic priest; my sister is a Catholic.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long is it since you came to this country - A. I came last May. I believe I am about nineteen years old; my birth-day is some time in 
               <persName id="t18220911-135-person1301">August. My</persName>
             parents tell me that is about my age.</p>
               <p>Q. The marriage took place in 1815 - you were then about twelve years old - A. Twelve, or upwards. The marriage was in June, in the afternoon, after dinner, about dusk - we generally dine about five. I do not think the priest dined there - he lived in the same street. I generally go to bed about ten o'clock. There was no feast, only our own family were present. There was a party next night, my sister Eliza and Mrs. Conden were present - she is rather older than

             I cannot mention every body who was present; my father was there - he is dead; my two sisters; my brother-in-law O'Carney - he is dead; and there was Mrs. Stapleton, a cousin of mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Why could you not as well have told us at first that your cousin Stapleton was present - A. I did not recollect it. I have not given the subject much consideration, except that I want to get home; it is with the greatest reluctance that I appear here.</p>
               <p>Q. What claim have you and your sister put in for your expences on this and the last trial - is it not upwards of 300 l. - A. I believe it is, travelling expences, the voyage, loss of time, and all; I have been detained here since May; I mind my mother's business at home; she is in the wine and spirit trade, and deals in hides; we also retail spirits. The most respectable houses in Ireland sell retail. We were not in the public line at the time of the marriage. There was wine and punch drank. I went to bed, and the marriage was much more than an hour before that.

Mrs. Stapleton was not asked to come over here; I believe her age was about twenty at the time; she lives at Tipperary. I did not dine at the table - I might run in and out at dinner time. I do not think the priest dined there.</p>

My mother constantly keeps one man servant, and sometimes has five or ten employed in the gardens. I was in and out of the room at the time of the marriage; and what has happened since it took place I cannot say.</p>

Tobias and the prisoner, my father and O'Carney, sat up till four o'clock - they did not drink enough to make them drunk - I believe they were all sober on going to bed; they had wine and whiskey. I never saw Tobias at mass before the wedding, but have many times since. I believe our loss, through our coming here, will be more than 300 l.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you examined on the last trial - A. Yes; and alter that was subpoenaed to come here; I am very anxious to get my expences, to get away; I have made frequent application to go, nothing but the subpoena has kept me here. I am certain the prisoner is the person who gave his brother away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long did Burke live with your sister,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110068"/>after the marriage, in Cashel - A. They stopped at our house nine or ten days; Dr. Wright and O'Carney are dead.</p>

I found a part of a leg of lamb, a piece of cheese, and a bottle marked the same as Mr. Allen's bottles, and it smelt of white wine. I found some keys also, two of which are skeleton keys, and a dark lantern. I and Vann were in search of the prisoner until the Sunday following, when we found him concealed behind the bed room door of the house, and in the cupboard of that room I found a bottle of port wine, marked the same as the others, and another bottle below, marked the same with a little wine in it, and another piece of cheese. He said he thought he should go this time; but he did not care if he could escape the dancers - that he could account for how he got the bottles, but he did not to either of us.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner and the deceased in the yard of the Cricket house last Tuesday three weeks. The prisoner came into the yard - the deceased was standing there; the prisoner went up and said,</p>
               <p>"What is this you have been saying about me?" The deceased said,</p>
               <p>"What I have said I don't deny - you have robbed me of a sovereign." The prisoner replied,</p>
               <p>"Oh! you rascal!" and struck him right in the face. I endeavoured to get between them; the deceased said," It is no matter, Peter - I don't want to quarrel with you, but you have robbed me of a sovereign. He struck him again - the deceased said,</p>
               <p>"You did rob me, and I think myself as good a man as you." They both struck; we pacified them, and he was putting his clothes on again. The deceased said he did rob him, and they fought again; the yard was slippery with the rain, and the deceased fell. He got up and struck at the prisoner, who fell against the wall; the prisoner caught him by the breast, and threw him against the seat; he again said,</p>
               <p>"It is no matter - you robbed me of a sovereign." We prevented them from fighting further. He lived a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The deceased was in a violent passion - A. Very. I cannot say whether he fell from a blow or not.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Ratcliffe-cross. I was ordered by the Coroner to open the body of the deceased. I examined the head, chest, and belly; the liver was unusually enlarged, it extended down to the right hip - and over to the left side, and ran up into the chest very high; the chest had bloody serum mixed with matter; the head and brain were perfectly natural. I think he could not die by the accident; his death might be accelerated by it - a blow on the head could not affect the liver. I think he would have died without the fight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had not seen him before death - A. No; all the symptoms might have existed without any violence whatever; they were most probably produced by previous disease. I think it might be accelerated by the exertion of fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. But suppose he drank the greatest part of a bottle of wine, might that have accelerated his death - A. Certainly. The liver was full of blood - his death would have taken place very soon, without any battle.</p>

He went out of the kitchen, and a few minutes after he passed my father, and went out at the street door. I locked the kitchen door, and took the key to my mother.

The gentleman had a little girl with him, and lifted her up to see His Majesty pass on his carriage, driving out. Wells then took hold of the skirt of the gentleman's coat, and held it while Morgan

I tapped the gentleman on the shoulder, shewed him the handkerchief, and said I was going to take them to Queen-square; he turned round. I called on the people to take Wells; they refused. There were about fifteen regular pickpockets about. A man laid hold of Wells, and Ball came up and secured him. They were all secured without getting out of my sight.

About half past three o'clock in the morning, Warren got over the gates, which were barred, Newman then got over; they had then nothing in their hands. I saw them return; Warren then had a little bag, and Newman a four bushel sack nearly full; Warren opened the gate directly - they got out - we went after them and took them. Newman then had a four bushel sack full; he had put down his bag to open the gate; we took them to the watch-house. Neither of them had any business there; the sack contained chaff, bran, and beans.</p>

On the 19th of August, between four and five o'clock in the morning, this property was stolen, which was safe the night before. I only had two pair of pigeons. Between four and five o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by a knocking at my door - I went down and found the prisoner in custody. The pigeons were returned to me alive; two of the cocks were pulled out of beer casks, and the beer running about; the other was from the water butt, the pipe was cut.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Mile-end. On the 19th of August, about a quarter before five o'clock, I was going down the green on duty, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I found the prisoner and Wilkinson both on the ground, struggling together; he charged the prisoner with cutting some pipe away, and pointed to Sloper's house. I took the prisoner under an archway, and there the lead pipe lay; I found three brass cocks on him, and a small bundle containing something alive, a few yards from him. I gave it to Wilkinson.</p>

            . I am a neighbour of the prosecutor. I got up at twenty minutes past four o'clock to go to labour; I heard a noise, and went into the privy, and as I came out I saw a handkerchief put on the wall, and two pieces of lead pipe; the prisoner then made his appearance on the wall - I asked him what he did with the pipe, he said it was his - he immediately ran to the gate, unbolted it, forced the lock open, and went out - and began to swear, and said he was out. I seized him, and down we fell. Smith came and secured him - he said,</p>
               <p>"Now I will give in." I saw the cocks found on him. Smith gave me a bundle which contained two pigeons.</p>

            . I am a clergyman. I was chaplain to the Prince Regent, and live at Chelsea. In May last I saw an advertisement in the Times newspaper, in consequence of which, I went to No. 3, Whitefriars. Goddard was in the stable there. I told him I came to see the horses which had been advertised in the Times; he said,</p>
               <p>"These are the horses;" he was cleaning them. I asked whose they were - he said they belonged to Captain Barber, of the Inniskillen dragoons; that he was his groom, and had been so two years, from the time he left Mr. Roberts, the Bank Director; he had had the care of the horses two years, during which time Captain Barber had had them - that they were sound and young horses, under age, and he was very sorry his master was going to part with them - and was only sorry he was not going with them; that his master was going abroad, which was the only reason he parted with them; that they had been regularly hunting in Warwickshire, with Lord Milton's bounds; and sometimes had been in harness; that they were half-brothers, and were both bred by Mr. Swan, of Warwickshire;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110073"/>he said he had been in the habit of having the care of them, and sometimes of waiting on Captain Barber as his servant, and was very sorry to leave the horses, and would be glad to go with them. I said I should want a a person to take care of them, and would consider of it. While we were in conversation, the defendant Barber came in; I said,</p>
               <p>"Is this Captain Barber?" he (Barber) said,</p>
               <p>"I am, and these are my horses." Goddard was present. Barber said he had had the horses two years - that they were very good and young horses, under age - the one six, and the other seven years old, and no more; that he had hunted them regularly with Lord Milton's hounds, in Warwickshire, all the last season, and had driven them. I had known Lord Milton, and we talked of him and his affairs. He said he was a man of that county himself, and that his father and family lived at Harl-lodge, Stratford; that he bought the horses of Swan, who bred them; and that they were half-brothers. He asked a hundred and ten guineas for them, and said that Goddard had been his groom for two years. I afterwards asked him Goddard's character - he said he was an excellent groom, and understood horses very well - and he would warrant the horses. I saw Goddard again next day, by appointment, to examine them, as I had not seen them out of the stable. I found him in the stable alone. My son was with me, and a rough rider. Goddard spoke in the same way about the horses - that they had never been lame, and that nothing had ever been the matter with them. I asked him what his wages had been with Captain Barber - he mentioned about thirteen guineas, and 20 l. a-year for clothes, and 12 s. or 14 s. for board wages, and more when he travelled. I said his terms were higher than I usually gave, but I should prefer a man who had been acquainted with the horses, and mentioned what I would give. Captain Barber came into the stable, and spoke in the same favourable terms of the horses - and that they were just the figure of horses I wanted. In the course of the day, I shewed him a sort of warranty which I thought it would be proper for him to send me by post, and he said he would sign that - (looking at it) - this is it. I saw him sign</p>

            , Harl-lodge, Stratford-on-Avon;" and I added to it what he said would be his address in town, until he should go to France,</p>
               <p>"No. 5, North-street, Lambeth;" he described the defendant Goddard as an excellent servant. I said I gave 25 l., and should not object to 20 l. a year for clothes - he said he gave more. He agreed to take five guineas off the horses, and give me the horse-cloths, &amp;c. into the bargain. I was to give him a hundred and five guineas. I saw the horses out that day, but it poured with rain, and he was afraid they would catch cold, and was anxious they should not be out long. I said I thought there appeared a little lump on the fore leg of one horse, and that he went a little stiff with it. He said on his word of honour as a gentleman and an officer, there was nothing the matter with them, or he should have told me. He said his servant frequently waited on him in company, and had regularly had the care of the horses. I said,</p>
               <p>"Upon this warrant I will have the horses" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Then if you please to make a deposit, if it be only 5 l. so that nobody whatever shall see the horses." A pen and ink was sent for. I wrote a draught on Messrs. Coutts and Co., for 5 l., and delivered it to him - I drew it payable to Barber, and most likely to Captain Barber. I went again next day and saw Goddard, and agreed with him to be my servant, and to accompany the horses. I was to give him twenty-five guineas a year, twenty pounds for clothes, and twelve or fourteen shillings a week board wages; unless I boarded him myself. Captain Barber came in again, and I spoke to him on the subject of his servant becoming mine - he agreed to it, and that he should accompany the horses. I asked for a pen and ink to write a draught for the remainder of the money; he said,</p>
               <p>"If you will go into my hotel, we will settle it there;" he took me to the Sussex hotel, and asked me to take some refreshment, which I declined. I wrote the cheque for 100 l. on Messrs. Coutts and Co. I had no sooner written it, than he took it up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Well, as you have given my servant half an hour to get the horses ready - I will go and hasten him, that he may not be later - I will return almost immediately." He took the cheque with him. I stopped half an hour; he did not return - I was tired with wating - I had some conversation with the waiter, and then went out into the stable to see for the parties - the stable was shut up, nobody could be seen. I could see neither of the defendants - the horses were found in the street with a man named Jones on them, whom I think I had seen in the stable as helper - they were opposite another hotel in the street. I mounted the horse that had a saddle on it, and Jones rode with me to Messrs. Coutts's banking-house. Barclay had left me half hour; one of the clerks said they had not paid the 100 l. cheque, but they had the 5 l. I went to a stable near my own house, and left Jones with one of the horses, while I rode to Mr. Bloxham, a veterinary surgeon of the Horse Guards, to shew him the horse I suspected. He saw it, and in consequence of what he said, I sent a letter to Barber, addressed at No. 5, North-street, Lambeth; which letter was afterwards returned by the post to me; I never received any answer from Barber; I went back to the stable, and found Jones was gone. I had him apprehended. Goddard never came into my service; I have not seen Barber since, till to-day; I parted with my cheques, depending on his honour, and on the representation of both the defendants; I advertised them, offering a reward, and went with Mason to the Red Lion yard, Tottenham Court-road, and saw Goddard leap out of a window, and run away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You paid the draught at the second interview - A. Yes; I took my son and the rough rider. I am a little skilled in horses, but I did not particularly examine them, it was so wet a day; I do not think the rider was as experienced as I then thought; I only had them once up and down the street, and expressed a wish to have a longer trial, but I relied on his word of honour as an officer. He said he would return to me in the coffee-room immediately - I gave him the cheque about one o'clock. I kept the horses about a month, and then sent them to Tattersall's. The saddles, &amp;c. were worth about 5 l.</p>

            . I am veterinary officer to the 1st regiment of Life Guards. On the 8th of May, Mr. Lee shewed me one horse, and next day I saw both - the first was lame in the fore leg, and the second lame in both fore legs - they were decidedly not recent maladies. Had they been sound, they would have been worth a hundred and forty guineas; but they were lame, and six or seven years old. I do not think any thing had been done to their mouths. There was a considerable obstruction of the limbs - the pair are not worth above forty or forty-five guineas. They frequently hunt lame horses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They were lame, as if they had been a good deal worked - A. Yes; they were unfit for the streets - they were grand horses, if you cut off their knees.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it a permanent lameness - A. Yes; they were not sound, nor fit, according to the warranty - they were quite unsound.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of instructions from the prosecutor, I made several searches in May last for Captain Barber, but could hear nothing of him. I had a second warrant handed over to me, by which I found him living in the rules of the Bench.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIOT. I keep the Red Lion, Tottenham-court road. I keep the stable yard. Goddard lived with me for sixteen months - he left me in May last. He acted as groom or servant to a gentleman whom I did not know. I have seen the gentleman come into my yard on his horse; the prisoner Barber is the person. They were with me a week and three days, with their horses, and then they went away. Goddard paid the bill. The last time I saw Barber was a fortnight or three weeks before Goddard left; they had two horses at my stable - they were never changed - not the last horses; but I believe they brought horses to me three different times - they never stopped above a week. A gentleman came to look at the horses twice. Goddard was sometimes at home, and sometimes not - he was in and out of town. Sometimes he was absent four or five days, or a week, but never longer together. He would stop at home three weeks or a month - he had no horses there. I do not know how he was employed - he was always dressed as a respectable man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. His wife lived sixteen months with you - A. Yes. Barber never lodged with me, but has put horses up at livery with me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Goddard tell you he was a gentleman's servant - A. I never asked him. I considered him as a groom, as he brought horses - he brought horses before he came to lodge with me. I considered Barber as his master - he called himself Captain Barber. Goddard always ordered the bills, and I made them out to Goddard.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you at home when Mason and Mr. Lee came - A. I will not say I was at home. Goddard left me because his wife wished to live in a public street. I did not see him after the officers came. I did not see him jump out of a window.</p>

When I came out, she followed and asked me to go with her; I said I had no money. I went into a little passage - she held me by my coat, and said I had better stop; she pulled my watch from my pocket, then said,</p>
               <p>"The watchman is coming, I must go." I felt it was gone, and pursued her. I fell down - the watchman took her. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You spoke English to her - A. I only understood a little. I did not give it her to hold.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was going down Sharp's-alley, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner talking together. I desired them to go on, and as I returned, she was running towards Chick-lane. I said,</p>
               <p>"What are you running for?" she said,</p>
               <p>"Hush!" the prosecutor came running after her, and said she had taken his watch. I stopped her, and took it out of her pocket; she at last said she would not deliver it before she had her half-crown - he was rather in liquor.</p>

             and Purdom had been in and out, and seen me counting the money, and said, what a swag of money it was! They were coming in and out of the taproom every minute, and could see the money. As I was running down the gateway after the men, Purdom laid hold of my right wrist with his two hands, saying,</p>
               <p>"Crawley, what is the matter with you?" I made no answer, but tried to pull myself from him; if he had not stopped me, I should have caught hold of them.</p>

Mine is a regular and good house, it was a bad one when I first went to it, but since I have been there I have got rid of the people who resorted there, till within the last month; Purdom has resorted there eight or nine weeks; he laid hold of my hands as I was pursuing them; I had settled with my brewer on the 4th of July, and paid him every thing, which was 100 l.; I was the first person who went into the room. I always kept the key of the box - nobody else had access to it, or knew what was in it; my servants knew money was kept there. Anybody in the back yard could see into the room, as the yard rises - part of the room is over the gateway, and the window is nearly over the gateway. I do not think the box could be seen outside - but they could see me going towards it; they saw me send the copper (which I was counting) to the brewer. I told the officers by name who to take - and went with them.</p>

             came up to me with a pipe in his mouth, as I stood by my landlord's door, and asked me what was the matter; he walked away and I went in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He came up with a pipe in his month as if he had come out of a public-house - A. Yes. I was at my landlord's door, which is about five doors from my own, and nearer to Crawley's. I cannot tell which way he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see anybody running before Crawley - A. No. There was a mob gathered round his door. It was rather dark, and there were a good many people about. He came back in about five minutes, having hold of Purdom; I do not think it was more than five minutes, but cannot speak to a few minutes, and will not say it was not ten minutes. I did not know Purdom before; but am sure he is the man, for I looked him full in the face, and when I saw Crawley having hold of him, I said,</p>
               <p>"Why that is the man I saw looking through your window when I came out with my beer." I have frequently seen him pass up and down, and had seen him at Crawley's house sometimes; he was not in the house at that time, for as Crawley came back, he said to him,</p>
               <p>"Did not you take hold of my two hands, and rescue that man from me;" Purdom said,</p>
               <p>"Do not think I have done such a thing, for I have been drinking in your house all night." I had seen him outside looking in at the window.</p>

I cannot say whether he walked or ran out; I did not look after him. They all went out together. I stopped in the house with Mrs. Crawley till twelve o'clock that night, in the same room. I saw Mr. Crawley when he went out with the officers, he returned about that time. I saw him on his return, but did not tell him

I searched all over Bromley for them; I found three pieces afloat by Lowe's wharf, about two miles off - I found the other by the side of a saw-pit, cut in three pieces. The prisoner was at work at it. One of the three pieces was cut into rafters - I asked who ordered him to cut it - he said he was ordered, but he did not know who by. I sent for a constable, and got one, and found him still there; but he had cut off the pieces where the hook went on, while we were gone; which was a mark by which I knew them; he said he was told to cut it off, but he did not know who by; we left him, and went down to the water side, about fifty yards off. On returning to the saw-pit, we missed the piece he had cut off; he said he did not know where it was. I gave him in charge. I can swear to the timber by a mark, and by a rope which I had put on myself, and the piece he was cutting, was marked 25 ft.; which is the depth it was to be driven into the ground. Lowe, the owner of the saw-pit, came and asked when I missed the timber? I said that morning; Lowe then said it had been there three or four days; but I had seen it safe the day before; the tide would float them up there in three or four hours.</p>

On the 4th of September, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I and Read were going through Shepherd's Bush Common, and the prisoner passed us coming towards London. We both jumped out of the cart; Reid took the bundle from the prisoner, and asked him what was in it; he said he did not know. I put my hands into his outside pockets, and found a chicken in each; they appeared recently killed, and were quite warm; their necks were twisted. We took him to the King's Arms, Hampton-bottom, and found four chickens in each coat pocket, including the two found before, and in his hat were two more. We found nine in the bundle, and a speckled hen. We asked how he came by them; he said he should refer that to a future day. On the Monday week we learnt that Mr. Robins had lost poultry; the servant claimed the hen, and described the chickens accurately.</p>

I was not out of his sight all the time; they were coming back, and Sandiford called Brown, who went to her. I saw her put something into Brown's hand, who took to her heels and ran off. Davenport took Sandiford by the arm, and said he would take her to the watch-house, for she had robbed him; that he had 45 s. when he came out, and had lost thirty - he found only eleven left. They were together, when we first met them.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 13th of August, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Shadwell with two tea-boards and a bundle, and asked where he was going with them; he said to take them on board his ship - that they belonged to his wife. I took him to the watch-house, and found two petticoats, a gown, and an apron in the bundle - I asked where he got them; he said he did not know the street, but if I went with him he would show me. I took him to two streets, and in Blue-gate-fields he tried three or four doors, and said,</p>
               <p>"The door was a little open, I cannot find the house." As we returned I saw a door ajar, and said</p>
               <p>"Is that it," he said it was - he went along the passage into Scully's room, where she was asleep. I asked if she had lost anything, she looked and missed her tea-boards - I told her to dress and come to the watch-house, and as we were waiting I asked how he could rob this poor girl of her things; he said,</p>
               <p>"I don't deny taking them, but some girls have robbed me of a good deal of property before."</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not employed in cleaning the opium; I only helped the man to lift the cases out of the scale. As I came out of the warehouse I took a piece of oakum to go to the privy, put it in my hat, and that is the reason the seeds may be there. The watchman never touched me, nor did I hear him call me.</p>
               <p>- HICKS. I am a locker at the Custom-house. I stood in front of the warehouse and saw the prisoner walk in - his hat was on; the watchman went in, the prisoner was wiping his face with his handkerchief; his hat was then off; I saw nothing go out of his hat; if it had, I think I should have seen it; the watchman was nearer to him than me.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTON. Q. Have you been employed any time on the quay - A. Some years. The first I saw of it was his coming into the warehouse; I did not see him take his hat off; I only saw it off; I was called away to another warehouse; I did not hear the watchman charging him with any thing; he was looking among the casks.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in Gray's Inn-lane. About four o'clock in the afternoon of the robbery, the prisoner brought in a trunk and a bundle, tied in a red handkerchief. He lodged in the neighbourhood. He sat down drinking, then took the red bundle into my kitchen, and I saw him take a flannel petticoat and some other things out, and ask my servant to pledge them for him, which I forbid; he went out with them, leaving the trunk and the rest of the bundle - he returned in about half an hour, and staid till near nine o'clock at night. I insisted on his taking them away, as they were in my way; and spoke to him about his taking some out to pawn. He said they belonged to his sister, who was either leaving her place or going to one. He called again next morning, with the box. I said,</p>
               <p>"Smith, you have broken that box open since you were here;" he said, No, he had not, for he was taken to the watch-house with it the night before, and he did not know what they had done with it there. I noticed that the cord was off.</p>

On the 29th of July, soon after nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my room with a small trunk and bundle, and said he had come to make a return to my husband for giving him victuals when he was out of work; he was very drunk, and when my husband came home, he asked leave to stop all night. He lay on the floor with the box and bundle under his head, and in the morning he asked me to pawn some things for him. I pawned a piece of lace at Nicholls's, a veil at Cree's. I brought him the duplicates; he said I might do as I liked with them - they were of no use to him; and I sold them to Davis. I saw him burn the duplicate of a white gown. This was Monday the 29th; he left on Tuesday afternoon, with the box and bundle tied on his shoulder, and came again in the evening; but my husband would not let him in.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 15th of August, I apprehended the prisoner, and asked where the ladies' box was - he said he got tipsy with some women<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110085"/>in Drury-lane, and went from there to the White Conduit-fields, and while he was there asleep, somebody came and stole the box from him. I told him he had been to Pitway's, he said he had, and to a house in Tash-street. Davis delivered me a gown, a petticoat, a pair of shoes, and a towel.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was obliged to stop for a moment, and lost sight of the ladies. I met three women, one of whom I knew; I told them of it, and they said I had better take the things back to where I brought them from. We went to have something to drink - one woman went out. I missed the bundle, and went to look for her; I enquired at several places for her, and was asked to drink, got intoxicated, fell down, and burst the box open. I went to West's, and pawned the things to buy liquor for her. I went out at night, and in the morning I found myself in the fields, stripped of every thing.</p>

They then had free access to the parlour. The articles stated in the indictment were stolen. I lost a half-crown, two shillings, and twelve pence from the kitchen drawer.

            . I am watchman of Vauxhall-road. On the 27th of August, just I had called five o'clock in the morning, I saw four men, of whom Hedges was one; they came in a direction from Grosvenor-place; they were half a-mile from Hyde-park turnpike. I watched them into Gardener-place, Vauxhall. Hedges was carrying a bag over his shoulder; I did not stop them; as they went along, the whole four kept putting their hands into their pockets, and handing things to each other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they on Vauxhall-road, or the other side of the water - A. No; it leads from Grosvenor-place. I could not see what they handed about.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 27th of August, about eight o'clock in the morning, Pace and I went to Perkins'-rents, near Great Peter-street, Westminster, to a house at the corner of Pump-court, which has but three rooms; we went up stairs and found some people, but found nothing there; as we came out at the street door we met Willoughby apparently coming in; we asked him who lived in the parlour, pointing to it, and asked who kept the house; he pointed to the left for us to go for the landlord. Pace went over the way; I remained at the door and asked if he lived in the parlour; he said,</p>
               <p>"I do occasionally, or a girl I cohabit with; I have got the key." He opened the door, I went in with him; I found no bundles there, but on looking under the pillow, I found two shirts, one linen and the other calico; I turned them over slightly, and said,</p>
               <p>"Whose are these, I suppose they are some of your wife's chemise,?" he made no answer; but on looking round further, he asked for my search warrant; I said he should be satisfied about that; and as Pace was coming in at the door, I asked him again about the shirts - he said they were two of his own old shirts,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110086"/>and he believed I should find them nearly worn out. I pulled out my handcuffs, he then resisted, and we had a great struggle to secure him; we took him to the watch-house, and on the first of September, Handley and I apprehended Hedges. One shirt is marked T. H., and the other H. D. S. in blue thread.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. He did not resist till you produced your handcuffs - A. No; I found some bird-catching apparatus in the room; I know he is a bird-catcher.</p>

I had left my shawl in the kitchen; and about three was alarmed by strange screaming - we found the house was broken open - my shawl was gone - every thing was turned out of the kitchen drawers into a carpet, ready to be packed up, and the clothes line was taken from the drawer, and unwound, ready to tie them up. My mistress's cupboard was broken open, and a piece of bacon taken. The spice box was broken open, and my master's pistols taken from the kitchen shelf. I lost some money from the kitchen drawers.

            , for 10 s.; he denied all knowledge of the duplicate or robbery. About the 10th of September, I had occasion to take him to the Bell, public-house, near Queen-square, and he there said he had seen the pistols that afternoon, at the One Tun, public-house - that Hedges produced them - and that they were pawned at Moritt's, on Monday afternoon.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Moritt, pawnbroker, York-street. Early in the afternoon of the 26th of August, these pistols were pawned, and to the best of my recollection Hedges is the person; he said he gave 30 s. for them. When I saw him at Queen-square, he appeared younger than the person, but now he appears the same man.</p>

I kept them in my box in the back room on the first floor - it was not locked. The prisoner was a journeyman, and worked in the house. I told him I had the money; I saw it all safe on Thursday morning about nine o'clock, and missed it about half-past six o'clock next morning, when I got up. He was brought into the shop that night, and said he had taken them, and gave me eleven sovereigns back, saying he had bought the clothes he had on with the others. I think he must have gone up and taken them one at a time.</p>

On the 20th of August, in the afternoon, I found one of the bulk-heads of the ship had been attempted, and one was completely broken, sufficient for an arm to get through; a man could then take tea out of a chest; one chest was broken. I knew the bulk-head was safe that day; the next morning an officer brought some tea on board, which I compared with the chest; it appeared the same; he also produced some splinters of the chest.</p>

             re-examined. It was two o'clock when I saw him, and he was taken at three. I pointed him out on the roof of No. 30, where he was at work slating; the lead was not found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There were other persons employed on the premises - A. Yes. I did not charge him with it; he had a short jacket and red handkerchief on. I never saw him before. I was about sixty yards off - my window was shut at first, but I pulled it down. I did not see him pull the lead up - but saw him knocking it up on the roof of No. 30, on the party-wall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to work at No. 30, and left at twelve o'clock, I returned at one, and at a quarter to three I saw Cresswell and the constable come on the roof - they said they wanted a short person; they went down again, and were gone about twenty minutes; and when the rain was over, I went on the roof. Cresswell and the officer came and asked me to come down - I went down - they said,</p>
               <p>"If you will go into the room with the carpenters, we will pick out the man we want." I went round to Cresswell's house with the officers, and the officers said to Cresswell's brother,</p>
               <p>"Is this the man or not, for he is the man who was at work on the roof."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Creswell's brother,</p>

I have seen a person, since this transaction, so much like him, that I will not exactly swear positively that he is the man. A person came to me in a direction from Burdett's with a copper, which I bought of him - he said he was a little embarrassed in business, and had sold all his things to a broker, and the copper was the last thing he had to sell. I gave him a stove, worth 8 s., and 8 s. in money for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have seen a person so like him, that a person never seeing him before might be mistaken - A. He really is; for I ran after him myself, and pointed him out to Mrs. Burdett, and she ran also, but said she thought him a shorter man, and not like him. I did not feel comfortable after the prisoner was committed, I thought the other man so like him.

Burdett and Lowther said he was the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You got a description of a person who worked in Metcalfe's garden - A. Yes. Metcalfe said a person answering the description Lowther gave, had worked in his garden. I found him coming out from work at seven o'clock, and said I wanted him to go to Bell-street, he said he would not go unless I shewed him my warrant.

I saw him next morning, and he equivocated - he went out of the way, and threw every obstacle in the way of our apprehending the man; but when he described him, I immediately said, that from the description he and Burdett gave, I had the fullest conviction that it was the prisoner. I have not fitted the copper to the place - it was wrenched out with a bracket.

He then asked for stockings; I showed him one lot, which he did not approve of, and as I turned my back to get more, I saw the bundle of shirts move; I turned round, and he ran out with them. I jumped over the counter, and pursued; he stumbled at the corner of Rupert-street, and dropped them - I picked up some of them, and called Stop thief! he turned round, said he had nothing, and snatched up one of them - I pulled it from his hand, left him, and went home. He was brought back in a few minutes. I am certain of him.</p>

Between four and five o'clock the watchman alarmed us, and said the back garden gate had been forced. I found it so - the thieves had then got down the area, and cut a pannel out of the kitchen door, at the side of the house, and entered. The wine cellar door was forced, and a bottle of brandy, and half of another bottle drank, and some cold duck and lamb eaten. There must have been more than one man. There is a door on the kitchen stairs, which kept them from the upper part of the house. The pannel of that door was partly cut out. I missed the property stated in the indictment, which has never been found. I saw the prisoner in custody in about a fortnight.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hayman. We were to wash on this morning. I went to bed after eleven o'clock, and am quite sure the house was fastened then. I left nobody below. The watchman alarmed us a little before five o'clock; it was daylight then. I heard no noise in the street. I missed four tea and one dessert spoon from the kitchen closet, which was not locked. I also missed three breakfast and a dinner cloth from the kitchen, three table napkins, and a basket containing blue china. The cellar door was forced open, which was locked overnight. The shutter of the kitchen door was completely shattered, and the fastenings undone. The stair-case door was cut, but not cut out. The provisions were taken from the pantry - some eaten, and the rest left in the kitchen. They eat half a duck, part of a leg of lamb, and drank some liquor; they must have been some time in the house.</p>

I was going to work about half-past five o'clock on the morning of the robbery, and saw the prisoner bring a basket with blue china in it across a boat-builder's-yard, about 300 yards from Hayman's house. He put the basket down by the gate, while I passed him; another young man was with him, and both appeared intoxicated. I passed by and stood at a distance. The other man came up to me and asked who I was looking at? I said, Not at him; he was a young man - he went back to the prisoner. They stood wrangling about a flower which the prisoner had in his mouth. I am quite certain of him. I passed them again - they said nothing then. I told a person who had been a constable of my suspicions; he went to the prisoner, who then put the basket on the top of the rails. I do not know what passed between them; but after that, the prisoner and his companion followed me, and threatened how they would illuse me, and asked if I thought they were thieves. I said I did not know, and they left me. I saw the prisoner in custody about seven weeks after, and am positive he is the same man.</p>

            . I am a shipwright; I have been a constable. About half-past five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner with another man - Watts told me they had a basket, and he suspected them. I went up to them, and asked if the basket was theirs; one of them asked what was that to me. I looked at it, and saw Mr. Hayman's name on it, on a label, and in it was some blue ware; they said they were employed to take the blue ware somewhere; and I did not trouble them further; they were both in liquor; they followed us a little distance, and threatened to beat Watts, and used ill language to him. I was fetched to the watch-house last Monday week, and saw the prisoner, and am certain of him; he was a stranger.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 17th of September, about five o'clock in the morning, I took the prisoner on this charge; he had nothing about him. I told him the charge; he denied it. I put him into a room among fourteen men; I took Watts in, and desired him to look round, and he singled the prisoner out. I had said nothing to him. Adams saw him, and said he was like the man, but could not be positive to him; it was not quite light at that time; but when he saw him in the office, he spoke positive to him.</p>

               <p>MR. HAYMAN. The basket was full of crockery, and had my name on a paper sewed on it - it had brought some preserves from Devonshire.</p>

            . I am a dealer in marine-stores, and live in Old-street. On the 29th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner came and said he had some lead to sell - I said I did not buy it; he said it was not much, and that he found it buried among some rubbish - he had a rubbish cart. I bought it; it weighed 45 lbs. I sent my boy to a plumber's to sell it, and the officers stopped him with it. I told them whom I bought it of. I knew him before by seeing him about with his rubbish cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was in a great hurry to get rid of it - A. It was in my possession a quarter of an hour. I gave him 5 s. for it.</p>

               <p>"What have you got there?" he said it was all right, and I need not say any thing but keep them myself; I took him to Davis at the Roebuck, Tottenham Court-road; he was going towards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110095"/>St. Giles's; Martin and his wife live in Crown-street, St. Giles's. He said a man like a carpenter gave him the tools to carry to Bloombury-square. On Monday I and Davis went to Martin's; Davis said,</p>
               <p>"I am come, Mrs. Martin, for the tools which have been brought here;" she took them from under the counter, and gave them up, immediately, saying,</p>
               <p>"I hope they are not stolen," and that she bought them on Sunday night, between nine and ten o'clock, of two strange young men for 9 s., that they said they were in distress, and were going into the country; it is an old iron shop.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Mrs. Martin made no delay in handing them out - A. Not the least, her husband was not present; Davis told her to come to Bow-street next day, and she came without a warrant, to recog- the persons she had them of, but could not.</p>

               <p>"I am come for the carpenters' tools which the young man sold here;" she said,</p>
               <p>"I hope they are not stolen." I said they were - she said,</p>

               <p>"Give them to me." She went behind the counter and brought them to me in a basket. There were two hammers, five chisels, a pair of compasses, two planes, a plow, three saws, two squares, five gouges, a rule, pair of pincers, two gimblets, four awls, and two files. She said she bought them of two young men between nine and ten o'clock the night before, for 9 s., and thought she should know them if saw them. I took the tools, and told her to attend next morning at Bow-street; she did, and said the persons were about the size of the prisoners, but certainly were not them. Her husband was sent for, and they were admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were not acquainted with her - A. No; I had received information. The description she gave me led me to think it might be the prisoners. She has surrendered here to-day.</p>

            . On Saturday morning, the 27th of July, I was returning from Leadenhall market, and I saw the prisoner hunting the pig along, with four or five boys. I heard him say to them,</p>
               <p>"Hunt it along - that is right, hunt it along." I did not know it was the prosecutor's at that time. I saw the same pig again that day, and knew it. Mundy claimed it. I went with him, and found it tied to the public-house rails; we left the boy in care of it, and went to look for the prisoner, and found him in ten minutes, with the pig. I went up to him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have got a nice pig - will you sell it?" he said, Yes. I said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want?" Mundy came up at this time, and he said it was not exactly his, but that the man wanted to sell it very bad, and if we would go into the public-house, he would come to us in an hour; but I secured him.</p>

I knocked at the door, and asked him for my boots; he made no answer. I waited him out; he said he had not seen them. I at last gave him in charge.</p>

            . On the 28th of August, I was at work about a mile from my father's house; I heard a noise in the lane, looked up, and saw three young men running after another towards my father's house, and when I went home to dinner, the linen was missing. I went in search, and met my brother at Hounslow, with Williams in custody, with a shirt and pair of stockings. We asked where the rest of the linen was - he said he would take us where we should find Smith. We went towards the Bell at Hounslow, and there we saw him. Williams said,</p>
               <p>"Don't you speak - let me call him;" he did so, and he came - he asked him where the rest of the things were. Smith went and took them from under a haystack.</p>

I went up to the counter, took out my watch, and returned it to my pocket again; he immediately rose up, and snatched it from my pocket; I laid hold of him; a scuffle ensued between us; and several people came round us; he threw it over the settle, and then broke from me. I followed close behind him - the people knocked my hat off, and he got into the street, and ran across the Haymarket into Coventry-street, a man stopped him; and I secured him without losing sight of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Were you sober - A. I had drank two pints of beer, and might have had one glass of gin, but no more; I was collected, and had been with no women at the house, nor did I treat two women to my knowledge; I did not see the landlord; a woman sat next to the prisoner, and he was next to me; I did not tell the Magistrate that he handed the watch to another man; I heard Bellamy, who is not here, say that he threw his arm up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this house with a girl of the town, and drank some beer. This gentleman stood up by the bar, and several women were round him; there was not room for me to get up. I said I should go home.

            . I keep this public-house. I remember the prisoner coming, and saw the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110100"/>come in. I was there all the time; the prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing his watch. I was very near, and saw nothing to make me think he could have done it. I was thunderstruck to think how he could take it. I saw no struggle between them; it might pass without my seeing it, while I was giving change and taking money; but if there had been a struggle, I must have seen it - if the watch was taken, it must have been done in an instant. Strachan was in company with two women of the town, who pretended to say they saw the prisoner take the watch; but after the prisoner went out, I shut the door, and would not let them in, but they afterwards returned. Strachan was half and half, and the women were drinking with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner run away - A. A person said he saw the prisoner take the watch, and went for a constable; and while he was gone, the prisoner certainly did make a rush and go out, but he had been in the house five or ten minutes before that - he was taken and brought to my door - I would not admit them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who brought him to your door - A. The prosecutor. I saw no attempt to collar him. When the man said he saw him take it, he gave the man a thrust aside, and went out. There was a man with the prisoner, and another with the prosecutor.</p>

            , JUN. I went to the prosecutrix, and spoke to her about Goodridge. She said when she came into the office, that that boy had been with others taking oysters - but she never saw him before - that he took the stool but not the oysters, and she could swear he ran away with the stool; but never saw him till he came up after the oysters were taken, which was half an hour before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said at first that she said he was with those who took the oysters - A. She called him one of their companions. She said some of the oysters were taken an hour and a half before; but I think she said some were taken not long before, and that she first saw Goodridge about half-past eight o'clock. She said she only saw him when he ran away with the stool, and that the oysters were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110101"/>taken just before, and he was not one of those who took the oysters, not that he was not there when they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to ask these questions of her - A. I live next door to the boy's master, and he asked me to go to see how the case stood with his apprentice, and when the prosecutrix came in, I asked her what the lad had been doing.</p>

               <p>- PROCTOR. I was at the office with Boyce; the prosecutrix was talking to him in my presence; he went there at my request, as the boy is my apprentice; he left work at half past eight o'clock that night. She was talking to Boyce, but particularly addressed herself to me. I requested to know if she ever saw my boy before - she said she never saw him among them till that night - that he did not take the oysters, but she knew the boy who did - but that my boy took the stool and chair, and that the oysters were taken at eight o'clock, and the stool a little before ten.</p>

            . I was in company with Goodridge on the night in question; we were going to my master's at Bethnal-green; as we went along there was a piece of work; we stopped to see it; a young lad took a chair, and put it towards us. Goodridge took and threw it in the road. The watchman came up; they all ran, and he ran too; he had taken no oysters, nor knocked them about; they were knocked about before he left work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know they were knocked about before he left work - A. I understand it was done at eight o'clock; he did not run away with the chair.</p>
               <p>- BUCKBOURN. Redford called on me at eight o'clock, and went with me to Shoreditch - and did not leave me till a quarter to ten o'clock, and was then half a mile from the prosecutrix's house; I am as confident of it, as that I stand here; and when he left me, he said he was going home to supper. I left him in Bethnal-green Road.</p>

I saw him pass it to another man rather taller than himself. I attempted to rush on him, but a man lifted up his arm and threatened to knock me down. I ran to the left to avoid the blow - they ran up Nicholas-row, and Nicholas-street, and there I lost sight of them. I went as far as the Gibraltar, public house. Gibbs the officer and several persons came up; Gibbs and I went down Church-street, to the end of Nicholas-row again. I described the persons to him, and went with him and Goddard to the prisoner's father's house, at the corner of Nicholas-row; they knocked at the door, which was opened, and the prisoner stood there with his mother. Goddard said,</p>
               <p>"Joe, step out;" he did so, and Goddard said,</p>
               <p>"Do you know this young man?" I said,</p>
               <p>"He has seen me before to-night, within a quarter of an hour; that is the young man who robbed me." I verily believe him to be the man who pulled the watch from me; I am fully persuaded of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you not at first say he was like the man - A. Not to my recollection: I did not tell him he had seen me before, for the purpose of getting an answer from him; I did not expect any answer. The impression on my mind is fully that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen one Greenwood - A. Yes, at Worship-street; he is something like the prisoner; it may be possible to mistake one for another with their hats on.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If you had seen Greenwood without seeing the prisoner, should you have charged Greenwood with the robbery - A. I think not; I think there is sufficient difference between the two to enable me to know him; it happened within a yard and a half of a gas lamp.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would the description you gave answer to Greenwood as well as the prisoner - A. I think not: the dress was different - he had a blue coat, yellow buttons, and a black silk waistcoat - it was scarcely dark. I think Greenwod is nearly of the same height, and both have red hair.</p>
               <p>MRS. BROWN. I was with my husband, following him, and saw the prisoner run up to him. I did not see his person, only his dress - it was a blue coat and yellow buttons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Greenwood - A. Yes: his hair is rather red, but lighter than the prisoners. I did not see the prisoner's hair at all for he had his hat on. He was brought to our house as soon as he was taken, and placed in a room with five or six others; a man said,</p>
               <p>"Which of these is the man who robbed Mr. Brown?" I immediately said,</p>
               <p>"That is like the man?"</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Brown complained to me, and described the person; he said he had a blue coat, yellow buttons, a black waistcoat, and I think a black handkerchief. I went with him to the prisoner's house; his mother, he, and his brother came out; he came to the threshold of the door; I crossed over the road to Mr. Brown, and asked if he had any doubt of the man, and he said, No; I held the candle up to Mr. Brown to see him, and he said,</p>
               <p>"I have no doubt at all of that man." I afterwards took him to Mr. Brown's house; there were several in the room; Mrs. and Miss Brown pointed him out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did the prisoner say - A. He asked what I wanted; I did not satisfy him; he said he was innocent, but that he had been at the Shoulder of Mutton and Cat, public-house, which is about twenty minutes walk from where the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near is the Porto-Bello, public-house, from where the robbery was done - A. If you go round, it is about seventy-three yards.</p>

            . I work for a weaver. Redman was keeping me company; in July I was standing at the door of the Porto Bello with him talking to Allen; we heard the alarm five or ten minutes after ten o'clock. I had been in his company from seven o'clock that night, and never left him. We were at the door when the cry was raised; Hatch came up directly after the thieves ran by; we had been talking about going to Eel ferry. Hatch came up and said,</p>
               <p>"Why did not you stop them?" The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I did not know it was thieves; I thought it was only fun." The prisoner was with us half an hour after that. Hatch went away to Woodcock the patrol. The prisoner was dressed in a blue coat and yellow buttons, black waistcoat, and pepper and salt trowsers, and a black handkerchief.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where had you and him been - A. To the Cat and Mutton. We went there about twenty minutes past seven o'clock, and remained there till twenty minutes after nine o'clock exactly - it is about half a mile from the Porto Bello. I was talking with Allen and the prisoner at the time of the alarm - nobody else was with us. Beckford and Debas stood at the corner as the thieves ran by - they then came up. Only we three were to go to Eel ferry - the gentleman stopped at the corner, and said to the men who stood there,</p>

               <p>"I have lost my watch." This was just before Hatch came up. I went away with the prisoner, about a quarter of an hour after Hatch went; we left at half past ten. The prisoner went to his mother's which is about sixty yards off. I stood at the door when Gibbs the officer came up. I did not know him; he asked who I was waiting for. I said,</p>
               <p>"Not for you." He said,</p>
               <p>"Cannot you give an answer?" I said I was waiting for a young man who was just gone in to see how his mother's leg was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear any charge made against him about a watch - A. Yes, and told Gibbs. I had been in his company all night, at the Cat and Mutton and Porto Bello. Gibbs told me to stay there, for he wanted to take him for a few minutes, and he sent to me after, to say he was gone to Mr. Brown's. I went there, and saw the officers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110103"/>bring him out; he said he was going to the watch-house, as he was accused of Mr. Brown's robbery. I said several times in the hearing of the officers, that he had been with me, and it was impossible.</p>

I had five sovereigns in my pantaloons pocket, with fifteen or sixteen shillings in silver; I called Stop thief! I only saw one person; I was knocked down, I do not know who by. I became senseless by the blow, and cannot say whether my pocket-book was taken or not before I was knocked down, but my pockets had not been rifled of my money. When I recovered my senses, I found myself in the hands of the watchmen, and that my money was all gone - it had been loose in my pocket. I had no opportunity of observing the person of the man - the blow was very severe, and I was bruised about the loins, which, I think, must have been from a kick after I was knocked down. I found the prisoner was secured. I saw my pocket-book next morning at the watch-house, with the two Bank-notes and papers in it. I have never heard of the money. When Pincombe came up, I was on the spot where I was knocked down.</p>

            . I am a watchman of White's-yard. About one o'clock in the morning, I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner running down from the end of White's-yard, in a direction from where the cry came; he was alone - there was nobody before him, or near him, when I first caught sight of him. I tried to stop him, but he ran so fast, and with such force, that he broke from my hold. I pursued him. (The spot where I saw him runing was about fifty yards from where I found Curtis.) He was stopped without my losing sight of him, within three or four yards of me. I found Curtis between the corner of White's-yard, and the City of Carlisle, public-house. After taking the prisoner to the watch-house, I came down again on my beat, and found the pocket-book about three o'clock, opposite the Compasses, public-house, within about four yards of where he was stopped; nobody was passing near that spot when the prisoner was running. I gave it to Plunkett, the beadle; and found two notes in it, and papers. I shut it up without examining it.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Coultney, a wheelwright, in Church-lane, Whitechapel. I had been out with a friend on this night, and coming down the street, I saw Pincombe, and soon after I heard the cry. I was standing right opposite the Compasses, in White's-yard, at the time - I turned round, and the prisoner fell into my arms. Pincombe, who was following, came up and secured him. Nobody but the prisoner was near; I saw Curtis three or four minutes after; he was about sixty or seventy yards from where the prisoner was stopped, and appeared hurt a great deal, and said he had been robbed; he had a bruise on the head - it did not bleed. I did not see the pocket book found.</p>

He was asked if he had a sovereign; he said if he had he would forfeit his existence. A sovereign, two half-crowns, a few shillings, and about eighteen-pence in copper were found on him.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking with my shopmates. The prosecutor was going on before me with a man on his arm, and when I passed he called Stop thief! a man ran by me; I stood there, and the officer came and took me. I said the man was gone on. I said at the watch-house that I had a sovereign, and a little silver. Another man was brought in and let go. On the Monday following the prosecutor came into the public-house by the office - he did not know me them. Kerney took him aside; he then said I was the man.</p>
               <p>JEREMLAM RIPPINGTON. I am sure he denied having a sovereign. I never doubted of his being the man; Kerney never told me to say he was. Nobody ran away but him.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Margaret-street, Hackney-fields. I was in Tubernacle-walk, and just before I got to Castle-street, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran to the corner, and saw the prisoner Strange running as hard as he could. I stopped him - he threw the chain and seals into the gutter. Robinson came up immediately.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was standing at the corner of Chiswell-street, Finsbury-square, and met the two prisoners about nine o'clock, in company with three more; they went into the square, and stopped near the rails, and were in conversation together. I watched them at the corner of the City-road, up and down the pavement to and fro; they looked at several people who were passing, and presently Robinson came by; there was a strong gas light; several of them looked at him, and noticed his seals. I kept behind them, going towards Castle-street, and then Strange stepped a little forward, the rest being behind; Harris was only a few yards behind him; Strange got under the gas light at the corner of Castle-street. Mr. Robinson came up, the word Click was given by one of them. Strange instantly snatched at the chain, and went down Castle-street; I followed, and so did his companions for a few yards; there was a cry about twenty yards down the street of,</p>
               <p>"D - n his eyes, knock him down;" I drew my staff out, and one of them was going to hit Mr. Robinson on the neck behind, but I knocked the person down; I do not know who he was. I came up with Strange at the moment Green stopped him - the rest immediately turned away. I knew Harris before by sight, and can swear positively to him. He was taken directly after in Providence-row; I saw him in custody an hour and a half after I took Strange to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HARRIS. Q. Did you not bring a boy to the watch-house, and hold a light to him, and ask if I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110105"/>the man - A. A boy said one man was taken and put in Shoreditch watch-house; I went and found Harris there, and immediately said he was one - I never expressed a doubt about him. I thought at first that he might be the man I knocked down, but on looking at him I saw he was not.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at the watch-house. Harris was brought in by Ingram, who said a robbery had been committed in the City-road, and believed him to be one of the party. I afterwards saw Bridges at the watch-house door, and said he was one of the party. I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got the swag?" he shewed me the chain and seals; he spoke positively to him.</p>

               <p>"You had better go and fetch Scott." Wise said.</p>
               <p>"I will soon go and fetch the man who owns the cart." Wise went away, and did not return. I then told Houseman, I had every reason to believe the cart was stolen, and that he must go to the office with me, which he did. There were nail-marks where the tin containing the name had been removed from - one nail was taken out, and the rest remained on. Near the whole of the side where it had been was painted over, but not the other side. As we were going to the office, he said,</p>
               <p>"What a fool I am!" I said,</p>
               <p>"What for?" he answered,</p>
               <p>"The man whom you have let go is the man who employed me to paint the cart." I advertised the cart - Barrow claimed it. Houseman said he lived in New Harper-street, Haggerstown. I went and found Wise there - we knocked twice. Fortune was with me, and when we got to the house, I sent him up stairs, and Wise came from the backyard. I told him I wanted him; he asked what for. I asked where the man was whom the cart belonged to, and whom he was to fetch; he said he had been to John-street, but that the man he saw there had not sent a cart to be painted. I said Houseman said he had employed him; he said it was not true. I took him in charge; he then said he had shewn Houseman where to go to paint it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The Flying-horse is a public-house - A. Yes; it was in Flyinghorse-yard; there are wheelers, stone-masons, and stables there, but their things do not stand in the open yard. He said Wise had better go and fetch Scott; this was about half past twelve o'clock in the day. The cart was red, and they were painting it lead colour. I went to every John-street in Islington, and could find no such person as Scott.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Wise ever say in what part of Islington he saw Scott - A. He said he had been to John-street - it is impossible that he could have gone to Islington, for we took him in an hour, and he must have gone six miles in that time. I found a sack with chaff in it in the house.</p>

            . I went with Forster to Haggerstown, and found Wise there - he came from the back of the house. I was up stairs, and Forster called me down. We handcuffed him. We could find no Scott at Islington.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went in consequence of information from Forster - A. I was sent for, and found Houseman with a paint brush in his hand, and went to Haggerston to look for Wise. I was up stairs when he came from the back yard - I was not up stairs two minutes. There was a woman at the door, who threatened me to mind what I was doing. I had been searching the rooms. I saw a quantity of wearing apparel in a chest, which was open, and thinking it could not belong to such persons, I thought proper to take it. I swear that I took no money.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did not the woman say you had no business to take the man's clothes or money - A. She said I had no right to take the clothes. I said, under the circumstances I had, and would account about them before the Magistrate, and I returned them before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Eliza Elstead say you had no right to take the man's money - A. No; I threatened to take her into custody for obstructing me in my duty. I asked Wise if the clothes belonged to him; he said a jacket did, and pressed me very much to give it him; I refused, thinking it might lead to something. I delivered up every thing to Houseman's wife before the Magistrate on the day they were re-examined; I have seen the prosecutor twice; I have not managed the prosecution; I never offered to let him go for 5 l.; I had no conversation with the woman, except to tell her not to obstruct me.</p>

             re-examined. When I found the cart, it was painted in a different colour; my name was on a tin plate nailed on when it was stolen. I missed it at half-past five o'clock when I got up.</p>
               <p>HOUSEMANS' Defence. I told him as plain as I could speak that it belonged to Scott of Islington; he forgot the name and asked me. I told him twice, and at the office he made a mistake, and told the Magistrate the name was Webb; I was going to correct him, but he would not let me speak.</p>
               <p>WISE'S Defence. I know nothing about it. A man came and said, if I was going that way to work he had a cart to send; he asked me the way to the street, and I shewed him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any officers coming to Houseman's house - A. Two gentlemen came and asked for 
               <persName id="t18220911-236-person2217">

            ; they had it on a bit of paper; they were officers - they knocked at Houseman's door; I said to them,</p>
               <p>"The poor woman has just left the house with a child in her arms."</p>
               <p>Q. Well, did any body come to the door - A. No; a little boy not four years of age was in there; he was not capable of opening the door; they flung up the window, and one gentleman got in. I went to look after my children; I came out and saw the door open - they were both in the house; they could not have been in the house above a minute - one gentleman went up stairs, I followed him up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, you are in the wrong house," as they had asked for Hayes, who had moved; I said,</p>
               <p>"Begging your pardon, they have been here some months;" the gentleman who stood at the door called to the other,</p>
               <p>"Come down, you are wrong;" he said so twice running - I went up into the room, and saw he had thrown up the poor woman's bed; he was turning from the bed as I went up stairs; he then went to her chest, which was a long one, and the first thing he took out was some linen, which appeared to be sheets - and he took out the man's coat, and the child's clothes, and every thing the poor woman had; he emptied the chest, except the man's hat and two pieces of paper - he tied them in his handkerchief, came down, and took some more things off the table; he took a leno cap with two pieces of lace on it, and put that in his waistcoat pocket. I said,</p>
               <p>"What a pity Sir, to distress a poor woman when she is not at home, and have you any authority;" he said,</p>
               <p>"What is that to you, if you ayn't off out of the house, I will take you with me;" I said, I was willing to go any where with any gentleman, who would use me well. I was not saucy to him, though he says I was. They were in the house about a quarter of an hour - they made me go out before them a few minutes; I stood at my own door, and saw them tie a new gown piece of the woman's up - Fortune is the gentleman. I find no fault with the other. While I was in the house, the young man came in out of the yard; the gentleman was coming down stairs with the things just at that time; there are only three rooms - he had had plenty of time to search all over the house. When Wise came in, the gentleman said,</p>
               <p>"Well Mr. Dick, you are the man I am looking for," and immediately handcuffed him; they went away leaving the door wide open, and the things at the mercy of every body. I saw no money taken; they asked me if there was any stables about; I said,</p>
               <p>"No;" they said,</p>
               <p>"They used to have one over the way;" I said they had given it up some time, and that the man who had it now, had it with the lease of the house. I sent them to him at the chandler's shop; I went home and have not seen them since. Houseman is a hard working man, and bore an honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are intimate with the family - A. No; I did not visit them. I have been in to speak to them - I saw no money taken. I never heard that Houseman was a painter, or saw paint in the house. I only know Wise by seeing him about there; his brother used to live in that street, but has been gone some time before this happened. I have not seen the prisoners in company. I do not know what business Wise had there. I never knew him work as a painter.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTON. Q. Did you go to the Magistrate to complain of the officers' conduct - A. No. Mrs. Houseman went about her money - I did not go with her. Houseman used to drive a horse and cart for a man.</p>

            . I live at No. 13, John-street, Chicksand-street, Brick-lane, within a hundred yards of where the cart was found. Houseman is a total stranger to me; I never saw him till he was at the office. I saw the cart in Flying Horse-yard, about twelve o'clock in the morning, no painting was done to it then - nobody was near it. I saw a man in the yard, who said his name was Scott - he asked if I knew of any painter, who would paint him a cart; I said, No - this was at twelve o'clock, as I was going to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any paint in the place - A. No. I was to paint it myself, only I had work; I am a carpenter. I said such a job as that any body could do. I left him. Next day I met a relation of the prisoner's, who was enquiring for Scott.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What colour was the cart - A. It looked like a one horse cart, and was of a reddish cast. I cannot say whether it had a name on it; I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this man to say his name was Scott; did you ask him where he lived - A. I asked him where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you asked this strange man where he lived - A. Not where he lived. I asked his name.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you ask his name - A. I did not ask his name.</p>
               <p>Q. You have just said you did - A. I asked his name, but not where he lived; I asked his name, because I would have sent him down a man if I knew of any body.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have sent him where - A. To Flying-horse-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first asked you to come here - A. He is outside - I forget his name; he passed me in Flying-horse-yard, as I went to dinner one day; he was enquiring for Scott. I told him there was such a man in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you really thought that such a man lived in the neighbourhood - A. I really did - I heard nobody mention John-street, Islington. I returned through the yard again, about half-past twelve o'clock, from dinner. The cart was there then; nothing was doing to it then. I only passed on; there was nobody near it, nor any paint.</p>

On the 31st of July, between three and four o'clock, the prisoners came into my shop, and asked to see some prints. I showed them several off the shelf; none of them suited. At last they bought a yard and a half of print. They then asked for a gown piece off another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110109"/>piece, and bought six yards and a half, and wanted them put by, and to pay 1 s. 6 d. on it, which was agreed to. I had seen Morgan before; Cox offered to pay, and took out her purse, but had no money. While I was putting the prints on the shelf, I noticed Cox every moment stoop down to tie her shoes, and when I had done serving them, Morgan asked for a paper with an account of it. I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes; but wait a few minutes; I think I have lost a piece of print." I looked, and missed a small piece. I jumped over the counter, and asked if they had seen it, and said I should send for an officer. I saw Morgan drop a piece, measuring 16 1/2 yards; it was not the piece I missed. I gave it to the officer. They were a quarter of an hour in the shop before they fixed on any thing.</p>

On Sunday morning about eleven I saw the prisoner pass the house, (he had the care of an empty house opposite), and saw my boots on his feet. I followed him, and charged him with having them on; he denied it. About half past three the same afternoon he passed again; I called him in, and desired him to pull them off, which he did, and I knew them immediately; but the tops were cut off. He said he bought them at an old clothes' shop, near Crawford-street.</p>

            . The prisoner was in our service, and lived in the house. On the 12th of September I charged him with stealing some skeins of silk; he denied it. I said nobody could take them but him, and if he were innocent I should be sorry to charge him with it, and he had better let me see his trunks. He said he would. I went up with my foreman; upon looking at the trunks, the first thing I found in one of them was some silk, not in skeins. I found two yards of silk and other things. He said they were mine, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you say to him at first? - A. I charged him with it, and when we went up, he sat down on the bed and begged for mercy. I said</p>
               <p>"Come, open your trunk." He has been a confidential porter in my house for five years, and had the care of every thing. I gave the silk to the officer.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutors, I know the silk to be theirs; I have seen it in their cutting room - it was cut off a piece. I have not looked to see if the remainder is there now, but I know this to be part of the same. I was in the cutting room when he was taken. I brought his box down from his room, it contained this silk. I saw it in the cutting room a week or ten days before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know this from any other silk? - A. I am confident of it - I have no particular mark on it - there is a difference in the sides of it. We have a good many workmen.</p>

While there, I had occasion to take out my purse, and I then saw that I had 15 s. in it: I put it in my pocket and came out, it was very dark; the prisoner came up and said it was very dark, I said, yes. I had not noticed him in the public house. He asked me where I was going? and I said to town, and could go without his assistance. It was too dark for me to distinguish him: he walked close at my elbows until I got to quite a dark place; and there he jolted against me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Dont fall down here, for it is very dark." His hand was in my pocket at that time; he took my money out, and was feeling to see if I had a watch. I hollowed out,</p>
               <p>"I am robbed." Renton called out</p>
               <p>"Hold him." I held him, and never let him go; he scrambled about, and fell down twice, and threw my money about, but I kept holding him. A watchman came up and went with us to the watch-house. It was the prisoner, I am sure of him; I never let go of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time did you leave home in the morning? - A. About eleven in the morning, I went to the late Alderman Rothwell's and Mr. Bowden's, there where I had lived; I dined with Mr. Bowden's servants, and we had a pot or two of beer together at a public house. I had 20 s. when I set out. I found 1 s. in my pocket next morning. I spent 4 s. with one friend or another. I called at the Windmill, the Falcon, the Castle, and then at the Rising Sun, and drank at all of them. I was sober, and knew well what I was about. I did not ask the prisoner to go with me, I told him to go about his business, but he followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you toss for beer with him at the public house? - A. I dont recollect tossing with any one, it might have happened; I did not see him in the house. He appeared sober to me. Two half-crowns were found on him in my presence. I had two in my bag, and a crown piece. I heard money drop from him as he was scrambling; I did not stoop to look for it, for I should have lost him.</p>

            . I was going up Paradise Row, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor together: I followed them, and by a very dark place the prosecutor said he was robbed; I said,</p>
               <p>"Then hold him fast," which he did. I got the watchman. The prisoner said to another man,</p>
               <p>"If you will get me away from him, I will give you part of the money and something to drink." The watchman came up and took him to the constable's house. He showed me where the key and purse were, he had thrown them in a garden next door but one to the constable's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What business do you follow? - A. I am a shoemaker. The prosecutor might not hear what he said to the other man in the scuffle. I saw two half-crowns and fourpence halfpenny found on him. We did not look for the rest of the money. Jemmett was rather in liquor, but sensible. I think the prisoner was rather less in liquor than him.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to me; I refused to take the charge, as they were both very drunk: I also took him to the watch-house, found two half-crowns on him; the prosecutor said he dare say I should find the key and purse on the spot, for it must be about; he did not say it was over in a garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not they both quite as drunk as they could be? - A. The prosecutor was very drunk, and the prisoner was in liquor certainly. The prosecutor reeled about as I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor threatened me about, his purse, and whether I had it or not I cannot say. He swore he would knock my brains out if I did not go with him, and almost dragged me out of the public house, when the landlord refused to draw us any liquor; he fell in the road, and if I had not called to a coach to stop, he would have been run over. I lifted him up, and sat him against the wall, he said he would give any body what they required to see him to Tyburn, and what happened afterwards I dont know; he had brought a man and woman into the public house, and they all drank together. He tossed with me for beer and lost, and made a disturbance in the house.</p>

I said I was going his way, and would deliver them at his house; he then turned round and went with me, and I delivered them to him at his shop.

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors. The prisoner borrowed these spoons on the 31st of July; they were never returned; they were only lent to him; we never sold him any. I saw him five or six months after - he had absconded. I saw him in a shop in Pall Mall. He endeavoured to avoid me. He went to the back part of the shop; but when I went in, he came forwards. I asked him what he had done with the spoons and forks. He said,</p>
               <p>"On my word, I do not know; I suppose you know I am done up;" that he was very sorry for what he had done, but he was so much distressed, and had several bills falling due at the time, and a drowning man would catch at any twig - that they were in pawn, and if the prosecutor would redeem them, he would give his bills for six, nine, or twelve months for them. I asked what his bills were worth. He said he hoped his friends would come forward; that he had several things in pawn, but he did not know when ours were pawned - (looks at some duplicates) - these are the duplicates; the name of Church was on them. I asked where he was to be found; he said,</p>

               <p>"On my word, I don't know, he is a scamping sort of a fellow, and used to do these jobs for me;" he at last said, some of them were at Mr. Archbut's, Blackfriars-road; they are worth 15 l. or 20 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say they were lent? - A. Yes, he was to send them to a customer of his who had not a sufficient quantity. We had found them in pawn and redeemed them. I had heard him ask for them a week previous for the same purpose - he was then refused.</p>
               <p>- ARCHIBALD. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Bridge-street, Lambeth. Twelve forks and twelve spoons were pawned with me on the 31st of July, 1821, in the name of Church. I did not take them in.</p>

Mayne was employed to put down the pipes; he was taken into custody, and in consequence of what he said we went to Field-lane, to the prisoner's house; he keeps an old iron shop. He came in soon after we got there; Mayne was with us, and said the prisoner was the man he sold the pipe to, and that he gave him sixpence halfpenny. The prisoner did not deny it - it cost the company 5 s. We found it in the shop - it was broken three pieces, and the long piece was in the back shop - it formerly formed one whole pipe.</p>

I gave her 5 l., and said she would give me the difference tomorrow; it is a public-house. On the 7th of July, I came home about six o'clock in the evening, quite sober. I went up stairs and got eight sovereigns out of my chest, and put them into my pocket. When I came down stairs, the prisoner stood at her bar-door, and asked me to treat her. I gave no answer, but went into the tap room, where there were several persons - an old man asked me to treat him. I said I had no small change, but took out a sovereign, told him to go to the bar and get change, keep 1 s. for himself, and give me the rest; but instead of going to the bar, he went out of the house. I went to follow him, and the prisoner pulled me into the bar, and shut the bar door. I turned round, and shoved it right open again. I did not call out to the people in the tap-room. As I turned to open the bar door, she put her hand into my pocket, and took out seven sovereigns which remained. I laid hold of her arm before she had quite got her arm from my person; she had got her hand out of my pocket. I seized it, and asked her to give me them back, but she said,</p>
               <p>"I sha'nt." I asked her again; she told me to go to hell and get them. I did not call out, but went up stairs to consider what I should do. I expected she would return them next morning. I remained up stairs till next morning, without telling any one. I am a stranger here - I have not been in England for three years. There were soldiers and girls of the town in the house. I came down about eight o'clock in the morning; I saw her soon after. I came down, and asked her for my money; she said,</p>
               <p>"Go to hell, you old fool - what I have got, you gave to spend." I said I should go and find a friend to see into it; she said,</p>
               <p>"Go to hell." I went to a shipmate of mine; he went with me to the office, and told the Magistrate. This was on Thursday - the robbery was on Monday. My friend could not go with me before. I slept at her house on Tuesday, but at my friend's on Wednesday. I went there on Tuesday, about eleven o'clock, and asked her for it; she gave the same answer. She was taken up on Friday - she detained my box and bedding. I have come from prison now, as her husband has arrested me for a false debt, to prevent my appearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How much have they been wicked enough to arrest you for -

            19 l. odd; they owe me money now; he arrested me three weeks ago; I did not tell them I was going to sea; I had received twenty-one sovereigns at the office in the Commercial-road; I paid eleven away - I never bought a watch of the prisoner. I had been in company with no loose woman that night; I was at Bates's ten days before I received the money; I kept my room all night, and brought no girls there. Every body in the room saw that I was robbed. I understand some of them said that I had left the country, and so she got bailed. I know Spruder of White Cross-street prison; I never had any conversation with him about this; I never desired him to write me a letter - I cannot read. Jones was with me when I received my money; I went with him and paid my debts. On Saturday morning, when I received my money, her husband took me to see a dance. I took out four sovereigns that day, and spent about 2 l. in clothes.</p>

            . I live in St. Catherine's, and am the wife of an excise officer. I have known the prisoner two years. On the eighth of July, till about half past four in the afternoon, I was with her at Wapping; she begged of me to go home to her house; I went and left her in Ratcliffe-highway; she said she was going to see a friend - I stopped there, and saw her come home about nine o'clock. I did not see Baker that night - I made tea for her children, and was in the bar till nine; if he had been in the house I must have seen him. The prisoner was not at home on the Monday night in question. I have been examined before one of the Judges about this, and gave this account to the Magistrate also; she went to the office of her own accord.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go with her - A. Yes; On the Friday I heard the prosecutor give part of his account, and I said she was not at home at the time. Jones was with him. but he is her enemy, for he persuaded him to do this rash act. I had some washing of his at my house, and when he came, he said he Baker should do such a rash deed, and send her out of the country. Baker had boarded with the prisoner when he was in England before, and owed them a considerable sum of money. I have heard Bates say it was 19 l., and I heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Oh mother, I will pay you in due time."</p>

On the morning of the 7th of July, I was in the burying ground, and saw a cart in the brick field directly opposite; I saw some persons loading lead into it. I went towards it, and three or four persons ran away. I stopped the cart with Greenaway in it, and detained him; the prisoners are two of those who ran away.</p>

            . I live at Chelsea; my father keeps a horse and cart. Hill came about half past eight o'clock, and asked for it to take some linen to Pimlico. My brother called me up; I put the horse in the cart, and drove as far as the Queen's Head - there two more men came up to the cart, and told me to go to the brick field. I turned round, and Tutton brought a bit of lead and put it in the cart. I said that was not linen, and I could not take it; and at that moment the witness came up, and they ran away. Tutton joined us in the brick field. Hill was not with him there; he stopped at the public-house.</p>

            . On the 10th of July, at ten minutes past eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of the Hampshire Hog-yard, St. Giles's, with something under his apron. I stopped him, and asked what he had there; he said a piece of lead, and was going to make a trifle of it; and said he found it by the cow-house, which is a long way from the path. I took him to the watch-house, went to the cow-house, and in the footpath was another piece of lead. We found the prosecutrix had been robbed two nights before; we took the lead to her house in the Hampshire Hog-yard, and the piece found on him exactly corresponded with a piece found by Mealey on the scaffold, and the other piece corresponded with a piece of the gutter which was not moved.</p>

I heard of a carpenter's situation, and met a man with this tool in his hand, and asked if he knew of any work; he said, No; he wanted to sell a plane for 7 s. I agreed to give him 6 s. 6 d. for it, which was all I had, and went and pawned it, thinking to redeem it when I could spare the money. I met a man who wanted one, and went to make the ticket over to him. I should never have had the effrontery to go back to the shop, if I stole it.</p>

I shewed them some; we did not agree; they were about ten minutes in the shop, and then went away. I missed a wedding ring which lay on the counter, by the glass case; I immediately went after them, overtook them about a hundred yards off, and asked, If they had not taken something which did not belong to them; they said, No; I might search them. I took them back, searched, and found nothing on them; they were going out of the shop, when I thought Higgins did not speak plain; and said,</p>
               <p>"Let me look in your mouth." and just at that moment I saw Hunt drop the ring by his side; they stood close together, but it fell from Hunt.</p>

               <p>"Where are you going?" He said, he was going up the City Road after a little job; I came down the ladder, went across, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why you have got a saw here?"</p>
               <p>"Yes;" said he,</p>
               <p>"it is one I have borrowed." I took it from under his arm, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why, it is mine, you good-for-nothing rascal, you have been and stolen it, let me see what else you have got." I felt round his coat, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I have got a smoothing plane," and pulled it out of his pocket; I said,</p>
               <p>"Now, ay'nt you a pretty fellow?" he made no answer. I secured him, he said,</p>

I took them; he said one of the men was working at a gentleman's house; I went with them under my arm to the prosecutor's; he called me; I stopped, and then he asked what I had got; I said, the plane and saw I had borrowed; he collared me, and swore he would do for me.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 1st of August the prisoner Phillips came to my shop, in Compton-street, and offered to pawn this silver watch. I told him it was stolen; he said that could not be, for he had had it a month; then he said he had had it three weeks, and he would go and fetch the exact time that he had had it. He and my apprentice went to fetch the prosecutor, but he was not at home. Phillips was let go, but came again in the morning. I told him I should take the watch to the office, which I did; the Magistrate told me to tell him to come there on Wednesday, which he did, and was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It is of very trifling value - A. I would not give above 10 s. for it. I have known Phillips since June - he could have gone off if he liked.</p>
               <p>MRS. GARNER. Gibbs had come up to see me about four o'clock that afternoon. I had been asleep in the room; she saw the watch, and said that it was old

On the 14th of September, at half-past ten o'clock, I was in the surgery adjoining the parlour - the street door was open; I heard somebody in the passage, went to see who it was, and saw the prisoner running away with something under his apron. I missed my flute off the parlour table, and followed him, and saw him run up Cromer-street, with it under his apron; a gentleman met him, who attempted to stop him; and at that time he threw it from under his apron; the gentleman picked it up, and gave it to me.

On the 6th of July I missed my husband's watch; she was at work for me on the Monday morning, and was speaking about the watch; she heard me say it was lost on Saturday, and nobody but her was in at the time, and he thought nobody but her could take it; she said she knew nothing of it. I sent for an officer, who came, but found nothing on her; he went with me to her lodgings, where we found a great quantity of plait in a bag hung on the top of the bed, it was worth 20 l.; knew the bag to be mine.</p>

Before Mrs. Weed came in, I cleared the till out, and put five shillings in it - she was in the shop at the time, and made a purchase of the prisoner - he had not seen me clear the till. I saw him put some money in the till; I immediately went and took it out, and put it in brown paper - there were five half-crowns, and two shillings marked, among it, I think, and the five-shillings not marked.

I said nothing to him, but examined it; in two minutes I saw him put the money in. I reckoned the contents of the till at 20 s. 6 d. I saw the two shillings were marked.

            . I am acquainted with Mr. Bell. In April last he had nearly eight hundred prints of Buona-parte, in a cupboard in the front room, up two pair of stairs, in his office in <placeName id="t18220911-277-crimeloc1458">Drury-lane</placeName>

On the 9th of July, he sent for me again - I counted them, and missed two hundred and sixty-three. I saw four or five of them afterwards, in possession of Coombs, and knew them; they were proof impressions. I never saw the prisoner at the house. The heading of the cupboard in which they had been placed was forced off, which enabled persons to open it without unlocking it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You only know them by their being proofs - A. Yes; the print had never been regularly published; nobody but Bell had proofs. I know one in particular, by its being coloured in a particular way - no coloured ones were published.</p>

               <p>"I believe you are going to housekeeping, here is something for you to furnish your house," presenting me with four prints of Buona-parte, and one of Hunt. He said if I should see Mr. Lee at any time, not to tell him of it, as he might be jealous. I gave them to Mr. Hulm, the broker - the prisoner called ten or twelve days after, and I told him I had given them away, as framing was very expensive. He said he had bought above two hundred, and he would give me some more, and he brought a large roll to leave at my house - I asked him to pay me what he owed me; he said I might take them - I refused. He left them, and a few days after I shewed them to Mr. Pass. The prisoner came, and fetched them away three or four days after that.</p>

I said it did not matter, provided it was safely delivered to Mr. Beaumont, the Sheriff's officer. Nicholls had thrown the cheque down, and the prisoner said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110120"/>could go in half the time that I could. The money was to discharge a bond of judgment against me. I agreed he should take the draft; we went in a coach to the Sheriff's office, in Wych-street; just before we got there, he said he wanted a draught of beer. We got out of the coach; I said he might have some, but must not sit down to drink; he said he would go and pay the money at the Sheriff's office, which was next door - and I remained in the house, thinking he was gone for that purpose, but he ran away with it. I never saw him again till about four weeks back.</p>

She brought the chain, one seal, and one key, and asked what I could lend on them; she wanted 30 s. and said they belonged to Mr. Evans, No. 95, Homer-street. The officer brought her to my shop in half an hour after. I produced them; she had a child with her; she only pawned the chain, not the seal and key.</p>

            . At the time of the robbery I was servant to Captain Duncan M'Leod; Mrs. Spitta was on a visit there; Bridgman was apprehended at his master's, who is a blacksmith; he had been to the house to repair two bells. Mrs. Spitta had left the watch in her bedroom; the prisoner had to work in the drawing-room and parlour only; he had come a little before five o'clock in the afternoon, and was there until past six. About seven o'clock Mrs. Spitta complained of losing her watch. I went to his master's house, (he is an apprentice,) and soon after he came in. The officer searched him in my presence, and found four gold seals, which Mrs. Spitta claimed. The officer insisted on knowing where the watch was; he said,</p>
               <p>"If you look in that drawer (in the work-shop) you will find it," which he did; he agreed at last to take us to where Evans lived. We went; her husband worked for the same master as the prisoner. We found there, on the shelf over the fire-place, the duplicate of the chain, the prosecutrix claimed it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Hayman to the prisoner's master; I found four seals in his pocket, and 15 s. in silver. Mrs. Spitta claimed them. He took me to Evans's house in Crawford-street; it was about a quarter to eight when we got to her lodging - she was denied to us. We went up and found her concealed on the leads at the top of the house. I brought her down. Hayman found the duplicate on the mantle piece - I did not search her. After taking her to the office, we returned to her lodging, and found the other seal and key. I asked her where the rest of the money was that she got for the chain; she said the boy only gave her 4 s. for her trouble.</p>
               <p>MR. SPITTA. I know the watch, chain, seals, and key are the property of my wife, they are worth above 5 l.</p>

            . I am a private watchman of Battlebridge. On Sunday the 28th of August, a little after five o'clock, the prisoners passed my box. I saw them turn up Joseph-street, and having suspicious, I called Colton, who took them half an hour after in Gray's Inn-lane, together with a third man. Marshall had something in a parcel under his arm; we stopped them both in a passage, and found the veal in the parcel - he said they found it - the prosecutor claimed it.</p>

On the 15th of August, about half past three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner and another came into the shop, to buy a pair of shoes. I shewed them several; they bought none. The prisoner took up several pairs, and waited while his companion was agreeing for two pairs. I missed a pair, worth 7 s., from under the cutting board, and saw a parcel of laces hanging out of his pocket; he said he bought them down the highway. I took one shoe out of his pocket, and he took the other out, and threw it into the window. I sent for a constable, who took him; the other man went as far as the watch-house, and then went away.</p>

I was just by the girl who had Seller's child, about half past twelve o'clock; she had a coral necklace on; a little girl about five years old was nursing her. The prisoner and another boy were playing about; the prisoner went up behind her, undid the snap of the necklace, and took it off, and then went up Whitechapel with the other boy; they came back together. I saw him put it in his pocket. I told the little girl of it, and about ten minutes after Mr. Sellers came and took him. I knew the prisoner before; he lived in Thomas-street where it was done. I know the other boy - he is older than the prisoner.</p>

            . On the 15th of September, I saw the prisoner, between one and two o'clock, and went into a house with her. I gave her money, and went to bed - I rolled up my trowsers, and put them under my pillow. I got up about eight o'clock - I missed her long before that. My trowsers were in a different place from where I put them. The paper which contained the sovereigns, I found on the floor. I went to Bow-street, and returned with the officer. We found her with five or six more at breakfast, and she was taken. I had been drinking, but was sensible.</p>

I had not seen them for some time, as I gave her the keys of my drawer. I went with an officer, and found some of them at a pawnbroker's.

            . I am shopman to a tobacconist at Bow, almost opposite Cheese. On the 10th of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner take something off a rail at Cheese's window, and go away with it; I told Cheese directly. I dont know what it was. I went after him, but he got away.</p>

He said, he was waiting for a friend. I found every house there fastened up, and as I returned he was gone. He returned in half an hour, I saw him lurking about on the other side of the way. At half past three o'clock I took him coming out of the alley, and found the lead in a doorway there - it is half a mile from Harwood's house. I can swear he is the man - I know his features, and he was dressed the same both times; he ran away when I went towards him; I ran and caught him. He said,</p>

She came one evening, and asked if she might sleep with me; we went out together about eight o'clock, she had the key, and left me in the street to return. I went home about one o'clock, I could not find her, but the door was open, every thing in confusion, and the things gone. She came back about 11 o'clock in the morning; I said, I was robbed, and could suspect nobody but her, she denied it. I said, I was sorry to charge her if it was not so, and if she would say where she had slept, I would go and enquire, and say no more about it. She sent me to a house in Soho-square. I gave her in charge that day.</p>

            . I live in Blue Anchor-yard, at the corner of New-court. On the 18th of September, about eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and another in the Court, and said they had better be off. I could not see the watchman. I waited till eleven o'clock; the watchman did not come; so I went to the prisoner and told him to be off - and at three quarters past eleven o'clock I was at my window; I went to the street door, and heard somebody jump; I went up the court, and the prisoner was coming out of the court with a bundle of clothes under his arm. I laid hold of him; the other man came up, and being afraid, I let him go, but followed him into East Smithfield, and then he was taken; he threw the bundle at me; I picked it up, and found the trowsers on the ground. He told the Magistrate that Hall had enticed him into it, and that he had been with him.</p>

            . I live in Holles-street, Clare-market. On the 17th of July, Midland came to me; I had known him eighteen years; he asked if I bought feathers, and said a friend of his had some to sell. I asked if they were new or old? he said,</p>
               <p>"New." I asked what they wanted a pound - he said he did not know, but he dare say we should not disagree about the price, but a person would bring a sample. Banner afterwards came, and said he came from Midland, and brought the sample, and asked 16 d. a pound, and said it was a fair sample; thinking them worth more, I suspected them - he said he would bring them to me. I said, I could go and see them; he said he would bring them about eight o'clock; and almost immediately, Williams, a porter, brought them in a large bag. Banner came immediately; I examined them, they felt damp and warm. I said I could not buy them, unless I was more satisfied about their quality; and they said they would come and empty them out, when my shop was better cleared; they wanted a sovereign in advance. I gave them 5 s.: I weighed them, they were 47 lbs.; they were to return in half an hour; Midland and Banner came; I put them off in order to enquire about them. They asked for more money; and I advanced 5 s. more, they were to come next day at twelve o'clock; and next day I saw Murrell opposite the shop - I think it was after the others came. Midland and Brown came in, and I put them off till eight o'clock, at which time they came; and I saw Murrell on the opposite side. I had an officer ready to take them. I asked Midland repeatedly, if the feathers were Banner's property - he said they were, and that he knew him very well</p>

            . I am porter at the George, Clare-market. Midland came and asked if I would go to No. 2. Clement's-lane, and bring a bed to Mrs. Webster's; he gave me a bag with a quantity of feathers in it, on the stair case; and told me to stop at Webster's till he came.

            . I am foreman at the prosecutors' warehouse in Wild-court; all the prisoners were in their service. Murrell and Banner were employed on the feathers, and Midland was a carpenter in constant employ. Banner always locked up the warehouse at night, and came to me for the key of the feather room. I found the bag and feathers at Webster's. I know it, as I had once, lessened it, and afterward enlarged it again, and the feathers are similar to ours. Midland lived at No. 2, Clement's lane. I went to Webster's on this night, and saw Murrell opposite the house at the time the others were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Midland had no access to the inner warehouse - A. No, except the others let him in.</p>
               <p>MR. GARNER. The lowest wholesale price of the feathers would be 3 s. a-pound.</p>
               <p>MIDLAND'S Defence. Banner informed me he had feathers to sell. I took them to a friend, who I thought would buy them - he sent me to Mrs. Webster. I am entirely innocent of knowing them to be stolen.</p>
               <p>BANNER'S Defence. I have been in the trade for years; the feathers are my own. I wanted to pay a bill, and was obliged to sell them.</p>
               <p>MURRELL'S Defence. I was in Clare-market that night, and met the prisoners; they asked me to drink with them.</p>

Green came there occasionally, as a private servant, for which he was paid extra. I had the first and second floors in the house where the feathers were kept - the plate was in the front room, second floor. I had locked up the rooms, and was in the country for five months; I left in August and returned in February. They informed me my door had been found open; I had left the room in care of a servant who is not here.</p>

            . I am a melter and flatter, and live in Little Wild-street. About Christmas last, Murrell brought me some silver table and tea spoons; they were either cut or broken when he brought them; he asked me to melt them - they were fit for nothing else. He took them way - he did not flat them at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before - A. Many years. I always thought him an honest man.</p>

About Christmas last, Murrell brought me some silver which had been flattened, he said it belonged to a friend of his who had an order for some silver work, and who had this loft, which he did not want; I gave him 4 s. 9 d. an oz. it came to 2 l. 7 s. 3 d., being 9 oz. 19 dwts.</p>

            . I am a timber-merchant. I was present at the examination of the prisoners. I went particularly to attend to this case, at the prosecutor's request; I recollect the prisoners saying something, the clerk did not take it down; what they said was voluntarily. Immediately as Green was put to the bar, without being spoken to, he said,</p>
               <p>"I have robbed my master. I won't tell a lie about it;" the Magistrate said,</p>
               <p>"Man, don't convict yourself;" but he replied again, that he had robbed his master. Murrell said he was working in the feather-room, up two pair of stairs shortly before Christmas, and that Banner came to him and said,</p>
               <p>"I have got some plate here, and his answer was,</p>
               <p>"Bill, put it aside for the present;" and that about a week after he found the plate at Green's house; he addressed himself to Banner and said,</p>
               <p>"Was it not so;" Banner said,</p>
               <p>"Tell your story." Murrell said, He took it from Green's to Brown's in Wild-street, and then to Potters.</p>
               <p>MURREL'S Defence. I am a plasterer by trade, and have worked at it forty years. I had a few spoons of my own, besides old silver. I was short of money, and went to Brown's and asked him to melt it.</p>

I saw the prisoner come there from a stable-yard about a quarter past seven o'clock with two quart pots in his hand; I sent a man to Mr. Moore, and followed the prisoner down the street; he avoided Mr. Moore's house, and passed another public-house. I followed him into the fourth street; went up to him and asked whose pots they were, he said he did not know; (Moore's name and sign were on them) he said he was going to take them to the person they belonged to; I asked where, he pointed out a broker's shop. I secured him.</p>

I lent him the furniture; I charged him unfurnished rent, he paid 3 s. per week, and owes me for five weeks. When he left the house last Monday, he said he would lock the room up. I told him to do as he thought proper; he went up stairs; I saw him bring my bed down, and put it in a truck; I said it was mine, but he would take it away; I do not think he knew what he was about, he was very obstinate, we had a dispute about it, I had bought it of my father.</p>
