I am postmaster at Nether Stowey, near Bridge-water—money-orders are issued and paid at my office—I am supplied with a number of forms by the General Post-office, in books, each form is num<lb/>bered, the order and advice are on one sheet—our practice is to enter the name of the payee and the remitter in a journal, then enter the amount and the office upon which they are drawn on the order, and give that to the person; the advice is made out with the names of the remitter and the payee and sent to the postmaster upon whose office the order is drawn—on 12th May a short dark man drove up to my office in a gig; his right eye ap<lb/>peared to me larger than the other; be alighted and walked into the office, carrying in his hand a black bag—he addressed me by name, saying he wished to be shown into a private room—he then said he was an inspector of the General Post-office, sent by the Postmaster-General, and that Mr. Cresswell was to have come with him but was prevented—Mr. Cresswell is the surveyor of the Western district I believe—he opened his bag and pulled out some papers and began to read them; he said that several letters that were posted at the offices at Nether Stowey, Carrington, and Holford had never been received; that a letter addressed to Sir George Crowe, Belgrave-square, had not been received, that a letter posted at Nether Stowey contain<lb/>ing coin, the posting of which could be attested, had never come to hand—he also said that Sir Peregrine Acland had made complaints respecting his letters—I said that Sir Peregrine Acland's letters did not pass through my office; he said that some of them did, which is the case—he said that the Postmaster-General had issued peremptory orders for a searching inquiry to be made with respect to those letters—he said "1 have received a letter from some persons in London respecting a letter containing bank-notes, I have seen the reply to that letter, the letter was from a person who called him<lb/>self Hamilton, and the address was, "Post-office, Camden-town, "I answered that letter and signed it, requesting him to make the loss known to the secretary"—I told him I could not give him any information respecting those letters, but most certainly every letter that was posted was despatched the same evening in the bag to Bridgewater—he then asked me what my average issue of money-orders daily or weekly was, and asked to see my</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artist, at Percy Street, Bedford Square—on 12th May, I was walking with Miss McClachlan in some fields near the Finchley Road—the two prisoners suddenly accosted us, and accused us of trespassing—I told them that we were not—Brown then went on with Miss McClachlan, and I followed across the corner of the field with Street: after getting some distance he said, "I am a poor man, and a little money will be acceptable to me, if you will give me a trifle I will say no more about it, but let you both return on the road"—I gave him about six shillings—Brown was some little distance off, with the lady; he took her over a stile, which separated us, but in a couple of minutes Street ran after her and went across the stile—she then returned to the corner of the stile with Brown—in a minute or two, Street returned to me with Brown, and told me to keep off the grass—when I got on the footpath Street was behind me and seized me suddenly by the throat, threw me down with violence, and Brown rifled my pockets of everything I possessed—he took my watch, chain, pin, purse, hat, and umbrella, a half-sovereign and some silver—they ran away, and by the time I had sufficiently recovered to see after them, they were out of sight—on the Monday following, I was with two policemen in the Regent's Park—saw the two prisoners together and gave them into custody.</p>

               <p>saw two boys in the fields five or six minutes before the prisoners came up, and a lady and gentleman passed just before the robbery, but they were out of sight then—it was getting dark at the time the robbery took place—I was with the prisoners twenty minutes—it was almost dark when the lady and gentleman passed—we were full half a mile from the high road in one direction and two or three large fields in the other—I gave the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before the lady and gentleman passed—I did not know that I was trespassing, I thought they made use of that as a threat—I thought it would not be the slightest use to tell the lady and gentleman, because when they had gone I should still be in the prisoners' power, and they would be more than a match for me—Miss McClachlan was with Brown when the lady and gentleman passed, she was out of my sight at that time, and I do not think she could have seen them—I did not cry for assistance, it was impossible, as I was suffocated—I went to the Britannia Tavern and sought for assistance—it was then about a quarter-past 9—I went to a policeman, and then went to different taverns to look for the prisoners—it might then have been between 11 and 12 o'clock—we walked a long distance towards Hampstead for a policeman—I described the prisoners at the station—I said that Brown was about 5 feet 9 inches, that they both wore caps and walking coats; their clothes were neither dark nor light, but a grayish colour, rather darkish than light—I had an appointment with the inspector to search for the prisoners—I was not with him when I saw them in the Regent's-park—I was only examined once at the police-court—I was brought up there twice—the lady was not present at the first remand—I knew the road she lived in, but did not know where she resided—I believe she went to the police-court on her own accord.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at York-place, St. John's Wood—on Friday evening, 12th May, I was with Mr. Har Wood—I saw the prisoners—I am sure they are the men—Street came tip first and said, "You are trespassing"—Mr. Harwood I think said, "No we are not"—the prisoners said that they were put there to prevent trespassing—Street took us both round the fields, and when he came to the stile he said that I might go—I refused to go, and kept with Mr. Harwood—we went back, and when Street found that I would not leave, he called Mr. Harwood back and left me with Brown—I went on with Brown, and then said that I wished to speak to my friend—Brown said that I could not—I said that I should, and I turned back and followed Street—Brown told me that they had turned to the right, and I turned to the right, but did not see them; I then turned, and saw the three standing together, but I did not see what happened—Street crossed to me and told me to be off, saying that I was to think my<lb/>self lucky to get off without being locked up—I told him he had changed his tone, and pretended that he was Irish, but it was too late to do that as I could swear to them both, and that I should go into the road and find the first man I could and bring him—they then threatened to tie my hands and feet, and said, "You want keeping quiet"—I ran off, and found that Street had not followed me—I turned back again, but when I got to the stile I could not see any of them—I tried to jump across a ditch, but slipped into it, and then saw the two men running away alone, they had left Mr. Harwood—one of them said, "If we see her, we must keep her quiet, or else we must tap her and keep her quiet"—I was then in the ditch, they crossed the stile, and directly they had crossed I got into the field again, and found Mr. Harwood there—he had just risen from the ground, and had no hat or watch—I had seen his watch before that—I saw</p>

"I went, and after waiting some time I said that I would not wait, they had better send them, and the goods were sent Gleed is in custody, and if he had been charged with me he would probably have been honest enough to have stated so; we were brought up together at Guildhall with a man named Thompson, who I should like to call.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of 14, Billiter-street, City—I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> in consequence of which I called at Mr. Waring's office in the Poultry—I saw him, and two days afterwards I saw the-defendants—Sutherland came first to my office; he said that he came from Mr. Waring's office in consequence of a call from me as to the loan of some money, in reply to an advertisement; that the lady who wished to borrow the money was at Mr. Waring's office, and if I would remain in for half an hour he would bring her round—I asked the nature of the security to save trouble, he said that he believed it was some ground rents or some leases; that the lady was a person of property, and it was very im<lb/>portant that she should have the money at once; that although he ought not to say it, she would pay any rate of interest, but, unless she had it then and there, she would forfeit a deposit made for the purchase of other pro<lb/>perty—I said that I would remain in to see her—after that he called again with the prisoner Kay and a somewhat elderly man—Kay said that she had the deeds of the property in her reticule—the elderly man said that she was worth a considerable sum, that she would shortly receive 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was out on mortgage, which they would probably get me to re-invest—they stipulated that the deeds should be given up at once if the money was not advanced immediately, and Kay stipulated that no charge should be made if the money was not advanced—the elder man made the terms as to the advance of the money—they required the amount for four months; either 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest was to be charged for the loan of 1501.—I said that without the aid of my solicitor Mr. Baylis, I could not let them have the money; and asked them to meet me at his office at four o'clock; they assented, and I saw them all three outside Mr. Baylis's office at three o'clock—the two prisoners kept the appoint<lb/>ment, and not the third person—Kay then produced some deeds—I believe these are them—a deed for ground rent was produced first, and then she said that we could have the leases upon which the ground rent was secured</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186506120028"/>
               <p>—Mr. Bayl is asked her whether she had bought the ground and the houses; she said that she had—one of the deeds relative to the lease was not pro<lb/>duced; Mr. Baylis observed that it would be no security without the other deed—Kay said that it was pledged for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with some one, and that if I liked to release it and let the amount of my advance stand at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I was at liberty to do so; to which I assented—Mr. Baylis examined her as to whether the houses were empty or tenanted—she said at first that they were let at 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year each, and afterwards that they were empty in conse<lb/>quence of some dispute about the taxes—the names of the houses were mentioned—Mr. Baylis read over hurriedly some parts of the deeds—Kay said that she used to live down at Weaversfield; I do not know whether she said in one of the houses—I saw the two prisoners again by appointment on Saturday at twelve o'clock at Mr. Baylis's office—I said that we were unable to make the advance that day, and wished for a further appointment—they both insisted on the return of the deeds as time was of importance—Mr. Baylis said that we had gone into the matter and could not return the deeds for the moment—I left before them—next day, Sunday, I went to Sussex—I saw Sutherland at Mr. Baylis's office on the Monday morning—he was there waiting for the deeds—I do not recollect whether that was before or after I went to the Mansion House.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 30, Poultry—on 24th February I saw Mr. Scobell about a loan—the defendants came to the office while he was there, about three o'clock—I asked Kay if she was the person who re<lb/>quired a loan of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., she said, "Yes"—I asked her the nature of her security—she said a ground rent of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I asked her for written deeds, and she handed the two deeds already produced—I looked through the assignment and found that it purported to contain a freehold, there being a lease of 29th November, 1861, recited in it—I then asked for a counter<lb/>part of the lease, which I looked through and then asked for the lease, telling her that as the ground rents had been purchased, the lease and the counterpart should go together—she said that the lease was with a friend, and on my pressing her as to whether any advance had been made on it she said, "Yes, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I then suggested to the prosecutor that he should in<lb/>crease his intended advance of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that the lease might be taken up—I asked her who Mr. Allin, the attestor to both deeds, was; she said he was a retired solicitor, and he prepared the deeds—I told them I would see Mr. Allin—Sutherland then asked me for a receipt for the deeds, which I</p>

               <p>gave him, he read it and handed it to Kay—I looked at the plan on the deed—I asked Kay the names of the tenants—she said that the houses were unoccupied, the tenants having left the previous quarter in consequence of some dispute about the taxes—she said the rents were 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—they then left, and the same day I wrote to Allin—they came again next day at twelve o'clock—I told them that I had seen Mr. Allin, and that I required some information relative to the title, which Mr. Allin had promised to procure, and that he would explain all to them if they could see him that morning, and they would know where to find him—Kay said, "This is very incon<lb/>venient; we want the money this morning, and as there appears a great deal of trouble about the matter we had better have the deeds back again"—Mr. Scobell was not present then—I said, "I cannot give up the deeds without the instructions of my client"—they left the room and remained outside the door from three to five minutes—I could not hear them talking outside my room—when they returned, Sutherland said I have arranged with this lady that I should wait for the deeds, and she authorizes you to give them to me—Kay assented to that and left, Sutherland remained—I asked him Miss Kay's address, he said, "Hanwell"—I asked him her Christian name, he said that I appeared very particular about the matter, and said, "My name is Edwin, my address is Boston-road, Hanwell, and I am a builder"—I left my office, leaving him there—I returned about three o'clock with Webb, a detective—I had agreed to see my client before twelve o'clock in the day, and Sutherland waited for the deeds—I then found both the pri<lb/>soners in my clerk's office—I again told them that I could not give up the deeds without my client's instructions—they were both very violent, and Sutherland said, "We must have our deeds"—I refused to give them up—a tall man. then made his appearance, Kay addressed him and said, "We can<lb/>not get our deeds"—he said, "Oh, I will lend you the money on the deposit of the deeds"—I still refused to give them up, and he then said, "Well, Miss Kay, I will lend you the money on your I. O. U." and they all left to<lb/>gether—an appointment was made for them to call on the Monday for the deeds—I went to the Mansion House on Monday afternoon with Mr. Scobell, obtained a warrant and placed it in the hands of Sergeant Webb—I saw nothing of the prisoners after I had been to the Mansion House—I do not know whether Kay kept the appointment on Monday, as I was not there—I was otherwise engaged—a person called three or four days after the warrant was issued and before they were given into custody for the deeds, but I demanded 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them.</p>

I am a potman, and live at Blandford Mews, Mary-le-bone—on Whit Monday I saw the prisoner and the deceased together—they were both in liquor—I heard them call one another liars, and the deceased said that he would box McCoy—McCoy said, "Very well, if you can box, I will box you, "and asked him to give him time to go up stairs and change his boots, and then he would come back and fight him—the deceased took off his things to prepare for fighting, sat down on a door step, and waited till the prisoner returned—they then shook hands, and Webb said, "We will fight fair"—they fought four rounds, and after that I took Webb away, and helped to take him into No. 1.

               <p>Wednesday morning, a few minutes after 6 o'clock—she was quite dead—I saw marks of violence on her face and head, and two marks of blood on the right side of her neck, as if from the stains of bloody fingers—there was great lividity—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination next day, and found a round abrasion on the right-temple, about the size of a sixpenny piece, and on the right cheek, over the bone, an elongated abrasion—there was a wound, about an inch long, behind the right ear, from which blood had flowed—on the left jaw there was an abrasion, about an inch deep, and half an inch broad—there were several bruises on the forehead, and a small scratch on the left eyebrow, on removing the scalp, the vessels were much con<lb/>gested, and there was effusion of blood on the brain, which was the immediate cause of death—that might be caused by a fall or a blow, or even compression of the vessels of the neck, preventing the return of the blood—that would be much more likely from pressure—the other organs were quite healthy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I have got myself into trouble and must get out of it"—I produced this paper and label—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> Sir, please to show this to the inspector, before offered to sale—James Loseby, Leicester—Robert Davis"</p>

               <p>represented to be burned in the first list than was represented in the second—I referred particularly to the <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin,</hi> for in the first list 1,760 bales were represented to be destroyed, and in the second list only 50—I also referred to a similar discrepancy in the lists about the <hi rend="italic">Natu<lb/>ralist</hi>—I suggested that we should compare the lists with the books—he said he was quite willing that that should be done—I asked for a list of the goods not destroyed, and he promised that that should be ready when I called again—after that interview I asked Mr. Radmall to examine the books—subsequently, on the 13th December, Mr. Alfred Barry called at my office, and I asked him who had taken the list of the goods saved—my clerk had previously obtained such a list—Mr. Barry said it was made out by Arnett, and checked by Thome—on the 15th December I received a claim from Rose, Graham, and Wilson, the seed brokers—that was a claim regard<lb/>ing the Avoca—I reported upon it to the insurance-offices, and it has been paid—I produce a claim marked L, from Perry and Vargan—that has not been paid—on the 5th or 6th January I saw a person named Fage, who gave me certain information—on the 11th January Mr. Whiting, Fage, and I went to Meriton's-wharf, and saw Alfred Barry in his counting-house—it was stated to Mr. Barry, either by Mr. Whiting or myself, that informa<lb/>tion had been given us by Fage, a workman lately in their employ, that tallies had been taken off jute by the ship <hi rend="italic">Onward,</hi> that other tallies had been substituted, that more jute was saved of the <hi rend="italic">Onward's</hi> cargo than had been represented, and that we wished to have the foreman present, in order that he might be charged with having done so—Mr. Barry had the foreman Arnett called, and he came in immediately—I questioned Arnett—up to this time Fage was not present—I said, "Arnett, you are charged with taking tallies off the jute by the <hi rend="italic">Onward,</hi> and putting on fresh tallies, did you do so?"—he said, "Yes, I did"—he said that in delivering goods they sometimes took those which were nearest to their hand, without reference to the ship's mark—this was in explanation, and at that time my clerk and Fage entered the counting-house—Fage then again spoke about the <hi rend="italic">Onward</hi>—Fage stated that he had received instructions to take tallies off bales by the <hi rend="italic">Onward,</hi> that bales by that ship had been stowed in the new warehouse, being what he termed" overs, "that 200 of her bales of jute, said to have been saved, had been delivered after the fire, and that the remainder of her jute had been stowed in the new warehouse, that 200 bales would be found on the ground floor labelled <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin,</hi> and that 350 bales more would be found upstairs—he also said the tallies were taken off and collected to be destroyed—Mr. Whiting said to Mr. Barry, "How is this?"—Mr. Barry appealed to Arnett and asked, "Is this true?"—Arnett replied, "It is true"—Mr. Barry said, "Then we have no check; "to which Fage replied, "Yes, you have a check; that was the check you received for selling some wheat; call things by their right names; Arnett is not to blame"—Fage then said that in the N warehouse there were some other bales by other ships, which would be "overs, "meaning overs for the firm—he also said that after the June fire 100 bags of rice were moved from one warehouse to another which were not included in the list of goods saved; he said that they were moved by a man named Buckett—he also said that 164 bales of jute by the <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Cabot,</hi> and some by the <hi rend="italic">William Cole,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Almeida,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Raleigh,</hi> were put into a barge called the <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi> after the June fire; that they were knocking about in the dock two months, and that they were afterwards burnt in the November fire—he challenged Arnett to deny it—Arnett did deny it, but afterwards admitted it was true, when Fage said if be had the books he could prove it—I asked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186506120049"/>
               <p>why the destruction of the jute by the <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Cabot</hi> was not charged for; to which no reply was made—it had been set down as burnt in the June fire—Mr. Whiting said to Mr. Barry, "Why, you admit all this man says; it is not a very creditable proceeding; you must think the insurance-offices have a great deal of money"—it was then suggested that we should walk across the road and see the jute by the <hi rend="italic">Onward</hi> in the warehouse—Fage said he had helped to load vans which carried wheat, for which the Messrs. Barry received payment—we all went across to the ground floor of N warehouse, and there Fage pointed out a stack of jute which contained 210 bales by the <hi rend="italic">Onward,</hi> and said that if the stack were broken down the centre bales would be found without tallies, and that the front bales would be found with tallies of the <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin</hi> upon them. I asked Arnett if this were true, and he said it was—it was then proposed that we should take an account of the goods on the premises, and that Mr. Stanninought, one of Messrs. Barry's clerks, should be present—this was agreed upon, and we proceeded with the stock-taking the same day—I did not myself assist at it, but I afterwards received a report from Mr. Radmall—I saw Mr. John Barry at Meriton's-wharf, in his counting-house on the 13th January—he expressed regret that there should be such inaccuracies in their statements—I asked him how he accounted for the change of tallies on goods received by the <hi rend="italic">Onward,</hi> and he said, "I have not heard of that"—I said, "Did not your brother tell you of it?"—he said, "No"—I proposed to go across to the warehouse and point out the goods—we went downstairs for that pur<lb/>pose, and met Arnett at the door—I said, "Arnett, is it true that the tallies were changed by the <hi rend="italic">Onward</hi>?"—he said, "Yes"—we did not then go to the warehouse—I suggested to Mr. John Barry that the seed by the <hi rend="italic">Avoca</hi> should be measured, and he said it should be done next morning—I directed my clerk to attend to the measuring—I mentioned that I had to report to a meeting of the fire-offices the following morning the result of the stock<lb/>taking—Mr. Barry inquired at what time—I said if he were in the city at the time it might be well for him to call—he said in all probability be should call, and the next morning he came to the office.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLERIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You gave evidence at the Mansion-house about this, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; the companies I was acting for were the North British and Mercantile, the Liverpool and London, the Manchester, and the Queen—I was at the premises the day following the fire—a large range of buildings was burnt down—the place was in such confusion as is ordinary after a fire—there is no confusion in the premises that are burnt down; there is an end of them—fires do occasion confusion in the premises where they occur, but not in the premises where the lire is not—they are very large premises—I can't answer whether they were very full—I have not been over every floor—the floors I have seen were full; I can't say whether they were inconveniently full; I am pot a wharfinger—when I first saw Mr. Barry, he said there would not be the smallest objec<lb/>tion to my going through all the books, and seeing them—I did go and see all the books; any book we asked for was shown us, and every facility was given me—I had only known the Messrs. Barry before, in connexion with the June fire—I have heard recently, since the November fire, that besides being large wharfingers they had an establishment where they prepared sheep-wash—I did not know that they were also large seed assayers—I have heard that they are seed assayers; I don't know the extent of their business, I have no means of knowing—the totals of the goods represented to be saved, added to the goods represented to be burnt, make up the goods that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186506120052"/>
               <p>by their books they ought to have on their premises, as far as we were able to check it—they do make it up to the best of my belief—we have looked as far as the cargoes that are destroyed, and it is the fact that the contents of the two lists added together represent the actual stock on their premises by the books—the totals of the two lists agree with the books; that is taking Messrs. Barry's statement in each case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Barry, when you saw him on the first occasion, say that the great object of furnishing the burnt list to the offices was that the offices might take them and come and check them for themselves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—to the best of my belief nothing of the kind was said—I have no recollection of anything of the sort—I believe he did not say so—I can't go further than that—I asked for the saved list; he at once offered to let me have it—it is the duty of the insurance offices to satisfy themselves as to the claims, before they pay them—it is not the custom to take the burnt list and check the goods by it, and it would not, in a case like this, enable them to do it; where the tallies have been changed you could not make a correct list—I did not know that the tallies had been changed when I went—we had no instructions to go; it is not usual to go—if we were to go and see the exact quantity of goods they had, we should have to take stock of all their other premises which were not burnt—there is no doubt that taking the burnt list and comparing it with the goods remaining on the premises would enable us to check claims and ascertain their correctness or incorrectness—I did not do it because it is not customary to do it—it is customary to take the wharfinger's certificate for things burnt; no questions are asked—we are paid for ascertaining the correctness of claims—we are not paid a per centage; we charge a fee according to the matter of business—our mode of ascertaining the correctness of a claim is not to take a list and pay upon it; we pay on the certificate of the wharfinger; he signs a printed certifi<lb/>cate that the goods are destroyed, and he writes across the warrant "de<lb/>stroyed by fire, "and on that we arrange with the merchant the price of the goods, and the amount is paid—we are paid to see that the merchant returns the proper quantity of goods at risk, because his goods are covered by floating policies, which cover goods elsewhere—the wharfinger's certificate represents on the face of it the quantity burnt, and on that we pay the merchant—we see that the price is right—that is what we are paid for—we do not pay without the wharfinger's certificate; one office did, but not an office for which I was concerned; it was a new office—when Mr. Alfred Barry called on me on 13th December, I asked him how the list of the goods not destroyed had been made out—he told me that Arnett had made out the list from the stock in the warehouses, and that Thorne had checked it—it was on Wednesday, 11th January, I went there with Fage—I do not recollect Mr. Alfred Barry saying to me at that time that he could not account for the mistake that had been made by Arnett and Thorne—he asked Arnett the question that Mr. Whiting put to him—he did not say to me, "I cannot account in the least for this mistake that Arnett has made"—he did not follow it up by asking me what I thought had better be done in the matter; I will swear that—I did not suggest that he had better put the matter in the hands of some independent accountant; nothing of the kind—on the 11th, Mr. Whiting, Mr. Radmall, Fage, Arnett, and I were present—I suggested that we should at once take the stock, and that was arranged to be done—that was not in consequence of Mr. Barry saying, "I cannot conceive how this has all happened; what had best be done?"—he never said so—I suggested taking the stock, because I thought</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186506120053"/>
               <p>it was requisite to do so, if there were these errors—I can't say what was the last thing that occurred immediately before I suggested taking stock—I had previously arranged with Mr. Whiting that if these charges were admitted we should at once take stock Mr. Barry was at once willing that I should do so—my clerks commenced taking stock on Wednesday, and it was finished on friday night, expect measuring a parcel of seed by the <hi rend="italic">Avoca</hi> I do not remember on that or any other occasion Mr. Barry saying they could see no objection to our going through the books, and ascertain<lb/>ing that everything was correct, for he thought the offices, where so large amounts were so large amounts were concerned, ought to have some check of their own; nothing of the kind; I have no recollection of it; most certainly nothing of the kind was said on the Wednesday, nor on the Friday; I have no recollection of it—I did not say to him, while taking stock, that he seemed to have no idea to what extent the inaccuracies in his lists had gone—I did not see him during the taking the stock—I saw Mr. John Barry on the Friday evening, that was all—I should say I did not say that to him—he knew it to the same extent as we did; his clerk was there—I have no recollection of saying so, I did not know the extent myself—he said he was very much surprised, that that was the first time he had heard of the movement of the tallies; that was on the Friday evening—when I met Arnett at the door I asked him the question about the tallies, and he admitted it—that was at the door just by the street, and we turned back to the counting-house at once—I have no recollection of Mr. Barry saying, "Well, Arnett, what did you do that for?"—I will not swear it; I did not hear it—Arnett did not say in answer, "I am very sorry, sir, that I did it, but when I broke down the stack I found I was so many bales in excess that I fancied I must have made some mistake in a former delivery of the same mark"—nothing of the sort was said in my hearing—I did not hear Mr. Barry at the same time, with an air of vexation, say "I should like to know how many other shipments you have been serving in the same way"—I never heard anything of the sort; I swear that; we returned immediately—Mr. Barry told me that was the first he had heard of it, and on Arnett saying it was true, my purpose was answered, and I returned at once—Mr. Barry did not remain behind; he went back with me to his counting-house—next day, or Monday, Mr. Godden, from Messrs. Tilleard's, called upon me; he showed me a letter that he was about to write to us, and he proposed to fill in the names of Messrs. Honey and Humphrys, I said they were very respectable persons, and I had done business with them satisfactorily—(The letter in question was as follows: "34, Old Jewry, London, E. C. Jan 16th, 1865. Messrs. Brown and Roberts, Throgmorton-street. Gentlemen—Messrs. Barry Brothers find with great surprise that serious inaccuracies have in fact occurred in their returns of goods, as destroyed at the fire on their premises on the 25th of November last. These returns were made out from the lists of stock prepared and checked by their servants in the usual way, and Messrs. Barry were at first incredulous that there could be any extensive errors, notwithstanding the great confusion and pressure which exist after fire; but they are now satisfied that it is so, and they have suspended the foreman, who is principally responsible to them, from any further interference with the goods; and they have, for their own satisfac<lb/>tion, also determined to call in Messrs. Honey, Humphrys, and Honey, of Ironmonger-lane, to take entire charge of their stock, and to investigate the discrepancies which have occurred, with a view to their readjustment, and to preclude the questions in the settlement of the remaining claims.

I knew it before—I asked him that because Mr. John Barry was with me, and he said he had never heard of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was until lately in the employ of Messrs. Barry at Meriton's-wharf. I was with them about a year and nine months. Both the Messrs. Baity were very frequently at the wharf—they would merely just go through the place sometimes—they did not go much into the work<lb/>ing of the business—they merely used to walk through—Thorne was superin<lb/>tendent of the wharf, and Arnett was labour superintendent, and Sedgwick was a foreman, he attended principally to jute—my duty was to take the weights of the bales landed, and also to tally them—I took the weights of the jute lauded from the <hi rend="italic">Onward,</hi> and entered the weights in the landing-book—the marks were S. C. C. 4—tallies were placed upon the bales with that mark upon them—the tallies consisted of pieces of calico stiffly stitched, fastened by a piece of wire through an eyelet hole to the bale—each bale weighed between 2 cwt and. 3 cwt.—the greater part of those bales were stowed in the yard—there were 1,000 bales received by the <hi rend="italic">Onward,</hi> and they remained in the place where they were deposited until after the tire—I delivered 200 of them by order of Sedgwick after the fire—that stack was not in any way in<lb/>jured by the fire, it was too far away, a labourer named Burgess was present when Sedgwick gave me the order—Burgess asked Sedgwick if he wanted any particular weights, he said, "No"—he went into the office, came back, and said "Take those 200 and that will finish the ship, the rest are for us"—after I had delivered the 200 bales, about 300 remained, marked <hi rend="italic">Onward</hi>—a few days afterwards I heard Arnett say to Sedgwick, "Mr. John is in a very bad way about the stack by the Onward being over, and if it was found out, what a row, or bother, there would be I"—the man Callaghan is still in the employment of the Messrs. Barry—sedgwick gave Callaghan and myself orders to take off the tarpaulin from the <hi rend="italic">Onward</hi> stuck, and to take off the tallies, and he brought a bag and told us to put the tallies carefully into it, and then he added, "When they are all collected we will burn them"—accordingly Callaghan and I tore off 350 of the tallies and put them into the bag, which, I believe, was taken away by Sedgwick—about fifteen hands were then employed in removing the bales into the N warehouse—it took them all day—I do not know whether they are still in the employment—while we were taking off the tallies Sedgwick name there two or three times—I saw Mr. Alfred Barry and Arnett together, and later in the day I saw Mr. John Barry, within two or three yards off whore we were at work—we-were then up-ending the bales, a part of the stack having fallen down—when the bales were removed to the N warehouse they were without any tallies, but a man of the name of Backett, in the employ of the Messrs. Hurry, was put to work to put fresh tallies on them containing the words <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin</hi>—I left the service on the Saturday after Christmas—I went to the top of the N warehouse the Friday after Christmas, and there I saw the remainder of the bales by the <hi rend="italic">Onward,</hi> about 140 in number—they had no tallies on them, they had been removed up there two or three days after I had torn off the tallies—I had gone up for some papers I had left there, and on coming down Sedgwick was going away, and Burgess said to me, "What have you been upstairs for?"—I said, "Why?"—he said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186506120056"/>
               <p>"Sedgwick told roe to ask"—Sedgwick was not then within hearing, he was on the wharf—we were turning from the new warehouse on to the wharf, and I asked Sedgwick what he meant by telling Burgess to speak to me about going up-stairs—he said "I merely said, 'What is Fage going up-stairs for?'"—before 8th December I had assisted in stowing on the top floor fifteen bales of jute from a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Botanist,</hi> marked S and CC3 in a diamond, and about thirty by the <hi rend="italic">Mary Stenhouse</hi>—I know it was some days after the 25th November when the fire occurred, and before the 8th December; it was after the stock-taking, also about twenty by the Jane porter, about thirty by the <hi rend="italic">Art Union,</hi> about fifty by the <hi rend="italic">Clyde,</hi> I think marked S and CC x 4—I had orders from Sedgwick to stow the tallies of those bales in, so that they should go against the wall—we did so—it was a fortnight after Christmas that I went to Messrs. Brown and Roberts—I don't know the date exactly—I made a communication to them, and on 11th January I went with Mr. Roberts to Meriton's-wharf, and saw Mr. Alfred Barry in his room, and Mr. Whiting and Mr. Radmall and Arnett—Mr. Whiting said, "You have something to tell us about some goods being kept back from the fire offices that have been reported to be burnt, which are not"—I said, "Yes, sir, I have;" and I asked for a piece of paper, which, I believe, Mr. Radmall banded to me, and I read out the items from it—I told them that they had about 100 bags of rice in No. 11, and that they had only given an account of 7 to the fire offices as being on hand; that in the fire before, they had charged 440 bales of jute of the <hi rend="italic">Almeida</hi> parcel as being burnt when there was only 413 burnt—I told them that I had delivered three loads of grain on 19th August, for which they got the money, and I said that was the check—I may say by way of explanation that Mr. Alfred Barry said, "Why, Arnett, we have got no check, "and I said, "You should call things by there right names, don't put the blame on Mr. Arnett; three loads I delivered on 9th August, for which you have got the money, that is the check"—I meant that he might have got a check for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or whatever it might have come to—I said they had kept a lot of bales of jute back from the June fire, and put them into a barge called the <hi rend="italic">Cat,</hi> and they were burnt in the November fire—that was about 300 bales; and I mentioned the ships names, the <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Cabot</hi> 164 bales, the <hi rend="italic">William Cole</hi> 75, the <hi rend="italic">Almeida</hi> 10, and the quantity by the <hi rend="italic">Rollo</hi> I forgot, but it was 300 bales altogether—I said the <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi> had been knocking about the dock for two or three months, and the goods were then landed in Grove's-buildings or the new buildings known as Nos. 40 to 5 0, and destroyed by the November fire—on my saying that, Mr. Whiting said, "Why, Mr. Barry, this is not a very respectable transaction, you must think the fire offices have a great deal of money to spare"—I don't think that he made any answer—Arnett at first said it was not true, or something to that effect—I said "I will give you, Mr. Arnett, a fair chance: if you deny this, I challenge you to bring up the foreman's day books, and I will prove it"—Arnett then said it was true—Mr. Roberts said, "If these 164 bales by the <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Cabot</hi> are burnt as you admit, why not charge us with them?"—I did not hear any answer was made to that—I told Arnett that I had heard him say that Mr. John was in a bad way about the stack by the <hi rend="italic">Onward</hi> being over, and if it was found out what a row there would be—upon which Arnett said, "I don't recollect using those words exactly, but I may have said something to that effect"—after this conversation Mr. Radmall, Mr. Gatehouse, Mr. Stanninought, and Mr. Field and I began taking the stock directly—Mr. Stanninought, Mr. Barry's clerk, was present nearly the whole</p>

Barry's premises with Mr. Roberts, and there met Mr. Radmall, Fage, and Arnett, and Mr. Alfred Barry—I asked Fage, in his presence, to make a statement that he had made to me and Mr. Huberts, respecting circumstances relating to the fire—he commenced by stating that he had been engaged with others to remove tallies off certain bales of jute; I think he said somewhere about 250, and after they had done so to destroy the tallies—he went on to state that there had been other goods, saved in the June fire, put into a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Cat,</hi> which was knocking about the wharf for two or three months, and afterwards brought into the warehouse, and were burnt in the November fire—he said we should find those bales from which they removed the tallies that were substituted for the <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin,</hi> in the N warehouse; and behind this stack, the front of which bore the <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin</hi> mark, we should find a great number of bales which bore no mark whatever—some more remarks took place and I then turned to Arnett and said, "You have heard this man's statement, are these facts true?" Arnett immediately said that it was true—I then turned to Mr. Alfred Barry and said, "How can you account for these circumstances, it seems a very extraordinary statement, I shall be glad of an explanation"—he then said to Arnett, "How is it, how does it occur? we seem to have no check"—Arnett made no remark, nor did anybody else—I think Fage gave the number of bales in the new building, but I cannot charge my memory with it.</p>

My brother has told me the cause of your visit, and although I shall be annoyed to learn that there are any inaccuracies in our wharf returns referring to goods burnt, I shall be glad for Mr. Roberts and yourself to check the returns in any way that may suggest itself. I am afraid, however, that as our remaining stock of goods in hand is still nearly 4,000 tons, we cannot arrive with absolute certainty at the correctness of the returns until such goods are actually delivered out of warehouse. We shall, therefore, of course, watch the future delivery of our remaining stock, and should we hereafter discover any discrepancies Mr. Roberts shall be apprised of it. In the meanwhile I think the plan you have suggested, of counting the several stacks of jute, will tend to confirm the correctness of the quantity of bales remaining in warehouse.—Yours truly,—<hi rend="italic">J.

The act for which I summarily dismissed him was the act of a madman, and my belief is that he is the writer of three anonymous letters written to ourselves, our solicitors, and the police, insinuating that the fire was done intentionally by one of our foremen, and evidently written simply in bad feeling and without one little of</p>

               <p>evidence. My own conviction is, after most careful consideration of all the acts, that it originated in an accident"—Mr. John Berry called upon me the day after I received that letter—I may mention that after we came away from the wharf, I thought it my duty to call at several of the fire-offices concerned in the loss, and to write to others to state to them what we had heard at the wharf, and next day we bad a meeting at my office, and at that meeting Mr. John Barry was present—I do not recollect his saying that when he had written that note of 11 Jan. he was not at all aware that there was a particular parcel of jute that turned out to be so very largely in excess as he had since found there was—I don't recollect anything of the sort passing—I said nothing to him about the jute—he came and sat in my room while we were in the board-room consulting about the matter—I did not say I could not help strongly suspecting the honesty of some of his men; I never made any such remark, nor can I recollect his answering, that he believed his servants to be most perfectly honest, and that from what he knew of them he thought it was mere careless<lb/>ness and the result of the immense confusion into which they had been thrown by the fire—I will undertake to say that nothing of the sort passed, as far as my memory goes; I do not remember any such conversation at all—I don't remember that he had any conversation with me before to came to the meeting; I avoided any conversation on the subject—I should say he was there two hours, but not with me more than five minutes; I said nothing to him during that time; I avoided saying anything—he said he had come there for the purpose of meeting the managers; he might have made some remarks, but not those certainly, nor anything to that effect—he sat down, and I gave him the paper to read; I asked him to wait while the insurance, people had their meeting—I think he did say that he was per<lb/>fectly willing to come and meet them, and offer any explanation in his power, and that is all I recollect his saying—when I returned to him, I told him that I was sorry he had been kept there so long, but the committee had not thought it desirable to see him, because the matter was under investigation, and the committee would meet again—I think he wrote to me to the effect that in consequence of the detection of these errors, he and his brother had given orders that there should be no further shipments made at the wharf, in order that all that was on the wharf should be kept by itself and care<lb/>fully examined—I do not know as a fact that no further shipments were made—I think Mr. John Barry took took an active part in endeavouring to get the premises on fire insurances reduced; he wrote pamphlets about it, and took a very active part; that must be two or three years ago; he has busied himself a good deal about it—I know the defendants were arrested; I suppose they were kept in gaol somewhere about five weeks, I don't know the exact time; the Barrys were three weeks, I think—I don't know any<lb/>thing about their books and things being seized—I don't know that their drawers were broken open and all their books of every kind taken; I never heard it before this—I was served with a writ in an action to recover them—I did hear of their books being taken, but not of locks being broken—I knew that their books were taken away; I don't know about all of them; a great number, every book we wanted; that was in the hands of the soli<lb/>citors—I do not recollect a gentleman coming up to me at the Mansion-house and asking me about the charge against the servants of the Barrys—I might have had some con<lb/>versation with a gentlemen; I have had con<lb/>versations with a great many gentleman—I never heard of a Mr. Delmar; I do not recollect his asking me what the charge was against the servants,</p>

Roberts, Gatehouse, a fireman, and Fage, took stock of the goods in the warehouse—we were three days taking stock—I had the saved list with me—I compared the list of goods received with the list of goods I found—I found 2,325 bales of jute in excess of the number represented in the saved list received from Messrs. Barry—the value of a bale of jute averages 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the excess of seed was 153 qrs. as regarded one shipment, the <hi rend="italic">Avoca</hi>—the average value of a quarter of rapeseed is about 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I also found an excess in rice to the extent of about 80 bags—there was an excess in poppy seed to the extent of about 100 bags—as regarded the shipment of jute ex <hi rend="italic">Mary Sten-house</hi>, 313 bales were said to have been destroyed, and 100 saved—we, how<lb/>ever, found there were 262 bales saved from that shipment, instead 100—of the shipment ex <hi rend="italic">Avoca</hi>, 1,565 qrs. of rapeseed were alleged to have been burnt, and 300 qrs. represented to be saved; and I found 453 qrs.—846 bales ex <hi rend="italic">City of Sydney</hi> were alleged to have been burnt and 140 saved; I found 291 bales in excess of the return made to the offices—of the shipment by the Onward 800 bales were said to have been destroyed and 200 saved, and I found 578—I found them on different floors—210 marked <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin</hi> and 168 City of Bombay, were pointed out to me as a portion of the <hi rend="italic">Onward cargo</hi>—we examined the cargoes by those two vessels, and I found they were accounted for without including the 210 and 168 bales—of the <hi rend="italic">Jane Potter's</hi> cargo, 270 bales were represented to have been destroyed and 220 saved. I found 255 bales on the premises, and 220 had been delivered previous to my visit and after the fire. Of the cargo ex <hi rend="italic">City of Canton</hi> there were 480 bales said to have been burned and 210 saved; I found on the wharf 283, leaving an excess of 73 bales. 900 bales per the <hi rend="italic">City of Cashmere</hi> were said to have been burnt and 100 saved, and I found 209 bales of that shipment on the premises.

Barry) requesting them to set aside any portion of jute which might be identified as mine, and not let it form part of the salvage—I wrote those two letters—(<hi rend="italic">these were dated December</hi>, 1864)—I think Sedgwick was standing by during the conversation I had with Mr. Barry—I saw Alfred Barry several times after that, and asked him if any jute of mine had been recovered from the ruins—I also sent several times—I asked Sedgwick on one occasion to point out to me the warehouse it had been stacked in, and he pointed out a warehouse to me in the midst of the burning ruins, and said there was no chance of any more being recovered—my attention was first called again to the matter by seeing the proceedings against Sedgwick, Arnett, and Thorne, at the Mansion-house—I then had an interview with Mr. Roberts, and afterwards went to the wharf—I saw Mr. John Barry, and drew his attention to the fact of his men being at the Mansion-house, and that there were 2,000 more bales found than were repre<lb/>sented to have been saved—he said Mr. Roberts must have made a great miscalculation, and that in two or three instances he bad made mistakes to the extent of 20 to 25 per cent.—he had also said that stock was being taken, and in a few days he would be able to tell what was on the wharf—on that I left with my principal, who was with me—on the following morn<lb/>ing I saw Mr. Roberts, and in consequence of what he said I immediately went to the wharf—I saw Mr. J. G. Barry again, and asked him if he had finished stock-taking, and he replied no, it would still take some time—I desired to see the 140 bales which were said to have been saved; Mr. Barry objected to my going into the warehouse, as it might interfere with the stock-taking—I told Mr. Barry I did not wish to interfere with the business, bat merely to see the goods; Mr. Barry said he would see what he could do, and went upstairs—after being absent some time he returned, and said we could go up—Mr. Barry went with us, and a porter preceded us, opening the doors as he went—I found the pile of jute as I had seen it before, and I counted it and found 280 bales—I asked Mr. Barry how he accounted for he large a number there, and he said he did not know bow it was, but he was very glad for my sake—I asked Mr. Barry if that was all he had by the <hi rend="italic">City of Sydney</hi>? and he replied he believed it was—I then asked to go in warehouse N—we went, and on proceeding upstairs up a ladder to the top loft we found in one corner 35 bales bearing the name of the <hi rend="italic">City of Sydney</hi>—no one was taking stock there, nor in the other warehouse—I expressed surprise, and Mr. Barry said it was a mistake; but no further explanation was given—the pile of jute did not appear to be in the same condition as when it was shown to me by Sedgwick in December.</p>

               <p>Upwards of two months—I was precluded from asking questions, or allow<lb/>ing them to do so; therefore a great deal of time was occupied which might perhaps have been saved—these erasures first came to my knowledge about the beginning of May—my attention was called to them by my clerk, who had more particularly to do with this ledger—I bad seen the ledger before, but had not noticed the erasures—I believe Still was the clerk who kept the book—I was at the Mansion House when he was examined, but I did not pay much attention to what he said—I am not sure about his being examined as to these erasures—on reflection, I do not think I heard him say anything about it—the examination of the books had reference principally to the cargoes, but generally with reference to Messrs. Barry's accounts—this is the private ledger—it is the first time I have seen it—it begins at 1851.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker—in June last I had at Meriton's Wharf a quantity of jute from a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Cabot</hi>—I saw it—I bought it at the wharf—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the warrants that refer</p>

               <p>to it, it was insured in the London and Lancashire Insurance Office—this is the policy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is dated 24th December, 1863, on 394 bales of jute on commission at Meriton Wharf—it bears date 24th December, but the insurance runs from 19th Dec. 1863, to 19th March, 1864, when it is renewable, and it was renewed—I made the payment in renewing it for mother three months—there was a fire at Meriton's Wharf on, I believe, 7th June, shortly after which I went there to inquire with reference to my jute—only two warehouses were burnt; those marked blue in the plan—it is marked as two warehouses, but I believe it is only one and an exten<lb/>sion of it—I did not see either of the defendants—I saw two clerks, and in consequence of information I received, I made this claim (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) against the office—it is for 390 bales of jute, and there are 394 in the warrant—I understood at the wharf that 390 had been destroyed, and I received four in October as the remnant—I never heard till the following January that any of my jute was on the wharf untouched by the fire—I was not doing business with the Messrs. Barry personally between June last and February, but I may have had deliveries of jute from the wharf—I saw Mr. Alfred Barry on the works between November and February—I did not Bee Mr. John George Barry till the November fire—Mr. Alfred Barry did mention to me before that time that some of the <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Cabot</hi> jute had been saved from the fire; nothing passed about the <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Cabot</hi>—I received this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as a settlement of my claim on the policy—my writing is across it—(<hi rend="italic">This was for</hi> 1,313<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to J.

I am sub-manager at the London and Lancashire office—about the end of September, 1864, after the claim for the jute by the Sebastian Cabot had been paid, Mr. Alfred Barry called upon me—I cannot give you the date—he stated that we had not entered the usual wharfinger's certificate in respect of Messrs. Baxter's claim—that is a</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Plough-alley, Wapping, and am a coal porter—on Saturday night, 6th May, about half-past 11 o'clock, I was on a barge off Dublin Wharf—the prisoner came to work drunk—he was half an hour back of his time—one of his mates put him in the bottom of the barge for fear he should fall overboard—he went to work there, filling coals—he first quarrelled with Timothy Donovan, who then left the barge, and for<lb/>feited his night's work; after that he quarrelled with Jerry Sullivan, and then Dennis Driscoll came down off the ship's deck, and said, "Finn, you will not work, and you will not let anybody else work"—they both met amidships in the barge and had some words, laid hold of one another, and had a tussle or two—some man came up and stopped them, and they shook hands with one another, but five or ten minutes afterwards they went along the coals from the midships of the barge to the stern sheets, and we did not expect they would fight or quarrel any more, but they had a fall or two there, and before we were able to get to them the two went overboard</p>

W. Hurst and Mr. Eales are appointed executors, then they are struck out, and "Samuel Kiddle" put in—that is in the will of Octo<lb/>ber—Mr. Jeffrey's name is left—he has a legacy of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the will of June, 1854—in the will of October, 1854, he was to have in addition twelve shares in the London and Westminster Bank—I do not know what they were worth then—they are now worth from 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—Exhibit "G" is a list of the legatees and their addresses—that is not instructions for the will of 23d May, 1854—Cathrill's name does not appear there for eighty-four shares in the London and Westminster Bank, and eight Great Western Railway shares—the sums and shares are not there mentioned, nor have I any former document in which they are—I do not know anything of the history of that document—I think it very likely that the will of June, 1854, would carry that document into effect—I have not compared it to see—that will is the first one in which the residue is left to Kiddle and his wife—Scrip "E" is a draft of the will of 13th August, 1850, and serving by alteration for draft of the will of 30th October, 1851—the red ink I resume to be the alterations—in neither of those wills is Kiddle an executor—in both of them Jeffrey has 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left, and in the latter of them there is an addition of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him and Joseph Hurst as executors—Mrs. Kiddle takes a larger interest under the first than the second—it was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and then reduced to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not see Mr. Kiddle's name there at all—there is no date on the earliest exhibit—I cannot tell you for what will it was the instructions; it was a very early will; I know by the address on it—Mrs. Saunders changed her residence very frequently—she was then living at East-place, Lambeth—the first will we made was in 1850—those instructions must have been for a will subsequent to that one—Mrs. Saunders was living at St. Paul's-place then—I have produced all the wills in the office—I have referred to the books, and that is the first occasion we had a will-transaction—her husband had only died the year before—he died in 1849—in the scrip Jeffrey's name is struck out in red ink and Mr. and Mrs. Kiddle are put in—I find a residuary bequest, but there is no name, and there is a note in my father's handwriting, "to whom? in pencil—in that will, Jeffrey and Joseph Hurst are executors—it is then altered, and Jeffrey gets nothing,</p>

Saunders" only—I never saw her sign, "Elnr. Saunders," because I never saw her sign anything but wills—it is quite likely she may have done so—there were peculiarities in her letters—I cannot mention them with out the papers before me—the "n" in Eleanor was peculiar, perfectly formed, but in a peculiar way—to the best of my belief the will of 23d March is not her writing—I do not reject the possibility of being mistaken—I am not an expert, and have not studied handwriting.</p>

I was a surgeon practising in Lambeth—I now reside at Clapham-park—I knew Mrs. Saunders, the testatrix, intimately for about seventeen years—I had attended her closely as her medical man—I was also personally intimate with her—she became a widow two years after I first attended her—I knew her husband—he died in 1849—she lived in Lambeth the whole time I knew her—I did not know my co-executor, Kiddle, until my knowledge as executor—that was when Mrs. Saunders lived in China-place—I would not attempt to fix the time, but somewhere about 1854 or 1855—I knew him by name, but did not see him—he was on intimate terms and had married some relation of Mrs. Saunders—she requested me to be her executor—that was about the period I mentioned—she said she wished to associate me with Mr. Kiddle, of Salisbury, on account of the high opinion she entertained of him, if so doing would be agreeable to me, and she would make an appointment for him to come to town and take luncheon with me, so that we might be introduced, and it was her wish I should keep the address, so that we might obtain him whenever we required him—I was aware when she made the will of 14th March, 1859, that she was about making a will—she referred to her will on many occasions, and on one occasion particularly, when she was ill, she gave me custody of the will—I do not remember when that was, but it was about eighteen months before she died—at any rate, it was considerably after 1859—she died on 2nd February, 1863—she was then very ill, and took her will out of the bureau—it was unsealed, and I declined to receive it unless sealed; she then sealed it and handed it to me—I had it for about a month, when she requested it should be returned, and it was returned—it was then sealed—I have since Been it in the bureau where she kept her money—that was up to the time she became incapable—that was a few weeks before she died—I am not able to say whether that was the will—I did not read it until her death—it was sealed when I received and when I returned it—it was in an envelope—I never saw the will itself, but she pointed it out as being her will—after her death I looked in the bureau—I found the will produced there—I com<lb/>municated with Mr. Kiddle before her death, at her request—he and I attended the funeral—the persons named in the will were all there—after all came from the funeral they partook of refreshment, and then without moving the will was produced and read—Cathrill was present—before the will was read, a question was put to the company generally, asking if they knew of the existence of any other will—I believe Kiddle put that question, but I am not certain whether he did, or I did myself—I am perfectly certain one of us did, and that Cathrill was present—they all remained</p>

Saunders," and sometimes "Elnr. Saunders"—Mr. Kennedy had the letters first, and then I understood that Mr. Hooker had them—Mr. Kennedy was solicitor for the prisoner Cathrill—I was present at the trial, but was not called—I am not positive that one of the letters was signed "Elnr.

                  </hi>. I am an engraver and printer, and have paid a great deal of attention to handwriting, in examining it—I have seen the signature to the undisputed will—I have also made myself acquainted with about 150 other signatures—in my opinion the signature to this disputed will is not in the handwriting of Mrs. Saunders—I am clearly of that opinion be<lb/>cause there are at least ten characteristics or conditions which will always be found in a genuine signature of Eleanor Saunders, and not one of them will be found in this disputed document—the signature to the genuine docu<lb/>ment appears to be freely and boldly written—there is not the slightest hesitation about it, except at the beginning of the "E"—there is a little hesitation as often happens from the condition of the ink in the pen, by reason of the ink not flowing at once—the signature to the other one is full of hesitation, and broken up, and the pen has been lifted in places where the testatrix never lifts her pen, and letters are joined where she does not join them—some of the lines have been gone over once or twice in parts, and this magnifying glass makes it more clear—if you look at the top of the "1," there is something of the nature of a break—I made these diagrams for the purpose of illustrating my evidence upon it—the "1" in Eleanor when magnified appears to have had the pen lifted off, and not put down very accurately—it is very difficult to do it—it may be done so as to deceive the eye, but under the magnifier you can see it—this diagram was copied by my own hand—the signature which I believe not to be genuine, I think has been done piecemeal; for instance, the letter "a" considerably changes in directions, terminating at every point—another part of the "a," instead of being a smooth loop, is chopped up—it is done in several pieces, as though copying or drawing from something, and nothing of the kind can be found in Mrs. Saunders's writing—you can trace it distinctly with the glass, and you can see every stoppage of the pen—the letter "a" appears to be made in two halves, which the magnifier discloses—it is not a natural way in open writing—that indicates to my own mind that it has been copying—then another thing is, that between the "a" and the "n" there is a little junction, showing that it has not been written off like Mrs. Saunders's was, and though the "e" is always below the "a," and if it does join it will be joined near the bottom of the "a," I do not find one instance where she has joined the "e;" but if it has been done it must be at the bottom of the "a"—in the forgery, it is joined quite high up—I would also add that there aie certain points existing in the forgery which never can be found in Mrs. Saunders' writing—in the letter "n," where it joins the "o," it is finished so low, that if it did join the "o," it would be at the bottom of the "o;" but in the forger, it is a little way up—one of the most important differences is in the "r"—in the forgery you will find there is an up-stroke line, but in Mrs. Saunders' signature there is not an upstroke to the "r"—that is in the word "Eleanor" more particularly—I am not speaking of the "r" in the word "Saunders"—there is a different characteristic there—then both the "n" in "Eleanor" and "Saunders" finish with an upstroke, while it is very rare indeed that an upstroke can be found in Mrs. Saunders' writing, or it is exceedingly short—in the word "Saunders," in the letter "a," there is a large space between the to and the l, in all Mrs. Saunders' writing it is quite close, and there is no room for any space—in that respect the forgery is more free than in Mrs. Saunders'—in my opinion this will is a very clumsy forgery, and one easily detected—I believe the signature which purports to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186506120085"/>
               <p>be 'Eleanor Saunders' is the same writing as the body of the will, and written with the same pen and the same ink—the difference in the signature I attribute to the attempt to copy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you go so far as to say they were written at the same time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe so—I lay stress upon the up-stroke in the "r" in "Eleanor," so far as I have seen—I have examined 150 genuine signatures of "Eleanors"—I was occupied some hours on several occasions; I cannot tell how many—I think I was first engaged at the latter end of last year by Mr. Hooker, the solicitor for the defendants in the probate suit—he wished me at first to go to Doctors' Commons, and asked my opinion as to the signature to a will—I was entrusted with the documents, and I took away the letters home—I think I must have known then that Mr. Hooker was solicitor for the defendants—I cannot tell how long I was engaged upon the signatures; perhaps sometimes from 10 to 12 at night, as I could spare the time—that did not include the time for making the diagrams—I was in attendance at the Probate Court, and the diagrams were ready—they were prepared for the purpose of clearly explaining my views to the Jury—(<hi rend="italic">a letter was produced, in the body of which "Eleanor" occurred</hi>)—as to the up-stroke in the "r," I was speaking of a "signature"—I do not see one there—there is the word "Eleanor," but there is no up-stroke—there is a blurring over the paper there, and it is an accidental up-stroke—I do mean seriously to tell the Jury that she would write her name differently in the body of a letter to the mode of signing at the bottom—I invariably do it myself—when a person is signing his name he has a particular way of dashing it off—I think that from the constant habit of writing a signature persons would write it alike—Eleanor Saunders's signatures are remarkably alike—there will be some little difference between the name in the body and the signature at the bottom of a letter, but not in the characteristics generally—it affects the size a little, and the shape of the letters—this letter (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) I should say, is a genuine letter of Mrs. Saunders—the "n" in Walnut joins—I say the "n" does not join the "o"—I was engaged in the case of Nuttal's wills—I was on the last trial, but not on the others.</p>

I am a lithographer and fac<lb/>similist—I have heard the evidence of Mr. Chabot, and do not agree with him—my opinion is the signature is a genuine one—I think one ought to be very careful in coming to the conclusion whether a signature is genuine or not—the absence of little turns is not sufficient—I look at the signature generally—I think it is just the character of handwriting of a woman of her age writing with a steel pen on greasy paper, and writing with difficulty—I compared and looked at other signatures to find a signature like this, and I did so—I found the letters, and especially the "n," joined—generally I see they are not attached—there is a deviation in the "n," but I looked at it and found at the same time that it did so.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you examined at the last trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was—I gave an opinion that it was a genuine signature—I was not there when the Jury gave their verdict—the moment my evidence was taken I went—of course they must have differed from my opinion or the docu<lb/>ments would not have been impounded—on looking at the two wills there is a difference—in the genuine one the signature is not written freely and almost entirely without hesitation—the "e" has been written over again, and the "I" has also been patched—I do not call it a free signature by any means—of the two signatures, one is very much more free than the other—in the impeached signature there are double strokes in almost every letter, but I said the reason why, because I think she was writing on greasy, hard paper—I really forget whether I attempted to explain it in the Probate Court, by stating that she was not well—I may have done so—it is probable I did so, but I do not remember that I did—I was never in formed of any illness of the old lady, between the 14th and 23d of March.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you spoke of illness, did you mean a sort of illness that would affect a feeble signature? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The feebleness of an old lady, an old woman of eighty, who changes from day to day—greasy paper would cause a scratchiness—it appears to me as though it had been begun with bad nibs to the pen, or with a want of ink.</p>

Joseph and Philip Lewey, of 7, Devonshire-street, Bishopsgate-street—on that day, about twenty-five minutes past 2, I was in London Wall—I had with me two parcels, containing 1,000 cigars each, and 7 lbs. of tobacco, which I was taking from Mr. Wills, of Long Acre, to my master's—as I went along I met the prisoner, who said, "My boy, what is the time?" I told him twenty-five minutes past 2—he said, "Don't you work in Fore-street?"—I said, "No, I work at Mr. Lewey's, 7, Devonshire-street"—he said, "I have just come from there, I have taken the same as those goods before, and 1 have to come all the way back to bring these things back again that you have got, because I took them before, when you were gone"—he also said, "I am Mr. Henry Wills; give me those things, and tell Mr. Lewey to send the last two invoices he had, because I can't make up my books without them"—he said, "Run quick, how long will you be?"—I said, "About twenty minutes," and I left—I gave him the cigars and the tobacco because he said he was Mr. Henry Wills—I believed that—he went up London Wall and I went down—I saw him again on the Tuesday after at Bow-street station, in the dock—I am quite sure he was the same man.</p>

I live at 3, Canterbury-place, Millwall, and am an engineer—on the night of 16th May, I went to bed at 11 o'clock—to the best of my belief the house was then safely closed—I was awakened and heard a noise; I got out of bed, and then I heard steps run through the passage and out at the back—my bedroom is on the ground floor—I then went into the kitchen and found the window right up at the top, and the door wide open—I went out and got a policeman—he found a cap—I missed a coat, a pair of trousers, and two vests, worth about 5<hi rend="italic">i</hi>.—I had seen them safe on 16th in the drawers in the front parlour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the upholstery department of Messrs. Charles Hut ton's establishment, in Newgate-street—they are Berlin wool merchants—on the 4th of April Thompson brought an order purporting to be signed by Messrs. Atkinson and Co. of Westminster Bridge-road, for some goods—he selected some, and took them away—they were customers of ours—he represented himself as coming from them, and mentioned people whom I knew—it was on the faith of that representation that I let him have the goods—he had a quantity of lace, worth about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 10th of May he called again, and obtained six gross more, with a similar order—on the 18th of May I went to the Woolpack public-house in Monkwell-street—Gleed was standing at the bar—I sent a man named Metcalfe in first, and he introduced me to Gleed—he said "Here is a gentleman, R. M." (meaning ready money) "who can buy that lot of stuff"—Metcalfe and Gleed went into the yard, and after they had had some con<lb/>versation they beckoned me to follow, which I did—Gleed pulled these patterns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of curtain lace out of his hat—I recognised them as being the property of Messrs. Walters—they had their mark upon them—I said, "What quantity of this have you for sale?"—and he said, "There is about 1,300 yards"—I asked him the I rice, and he said 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I asked him if he had any other class of goods like these, as I was open to buy anything of the upholstery description—he said, "Oh, yes, I have several other lots"—I wanted to find out if he had any of our property, and asked him whether he had any "Paris bindings"—he said, "Yes, I have a lot, six gross, and also seven pieces of damask, but we will finish this transaction first"—I then went in front of the bar, and called for something to drink, and while there I told him I was a buyer of this description of stuff, and had a market for it, as I travelled round the country—he said, "I suppose you are all square, as these lots are crooked; there are only two manufacturers of them, and this lot has the initials on, which you can cut off as well as me"—I then showed him my purse, that I had the money, and asked him when he could produce the bulk—he said, "Any time to-morrow, if you can name a place"—I named the Portland Arms, in Long-lane, at a quarter to 1 o'clock the following day—I went there, and the prisoner brought a parcel of lace—I asked him upstairs, and upon opening the parcel I found 812 yards instead of 1,307, so I asked him where the remaining quantity was; he said he could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186506120095"/>
               <p>not produce it then, and then I told him I was employed to detect this matter, and said, "You must consider yourself detained—he gave me this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then asked him if he would render me assistance in finding out the actual thieves concerned, and he said he would—I commu<lb/>nicated with Messrs. Walters, and they came and identified their goods—after<lb/>wards I went with Gleed to the Waterloo road, and then he said, "I will take you to the place where Morgan (meaning Thompson) resides"—we went into a coffee-house, and I got him to write a letter to Morgan, and make an appointment at the York Hotel, Waterloo-road—we then went to Kenning<lb/>ton-lane, at the end of which Gleed pointed out a low beer-house as the residence of Thompson—we returned to the city, and Messrs. Walters gave Gleed into custody-dooming over the bridge I asked him what had become of the lace—"Well," he said, "I have sold 9 grots to Nicholson's in Shore<lb/>ditch, and there is another lot 'fast,' and some other which Thompson knows about"—I afterwards met Thompson in Stamford-street, according to arrangement, and gave him into custody.

Atkinson, of Lambeth, are our customers, and it was on the faith of his representations that I let him have the goods—he took the paper with our name on away with him—I identify these goods as the silk borderings that were ordered on the 15th April—the value is 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I should think there were about 812 yards in this quantity.</p>

I live in the same house as the deceased—I did not see the blow given, but between 5 and 6 in the morning I heard the prisoner come into the back-room—I do not know what for—he said, "Mother, do you allow your place to be made a boarding-house of?"—I saw Mrs. Hosier spit in his face—that was between 8 o'clock and half-past—I do not see him before 10 or 11.</p>
