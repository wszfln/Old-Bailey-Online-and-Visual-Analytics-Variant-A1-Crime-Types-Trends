We were both on foot, then I pulled my watch out, he asked me what o'clock it was, and snatch'd it out of my hand. I was surprised at that, and took hold of his arm, and said he should not have it; he said, give me your money then. I took it out, and gave him a guinea, and some silver, and then he said, give me the buckles out of your shoes, I said, I hope you do not design to strip me; then he did not take them. I went home and advertised the watch. On the Tuesday following it was brought, and I paid the 20 guineas which I advertised for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any arms?</p>
               <p>Shirac. He had a stick in his hand, and swore at me, and threatened me.</p>
               <p>Armstrong Janes. On the 15th of September last, the prosecutor sent an advertisement to me to put in the paper, I put it in, and on the Wednesday after there came two soldiers to me, one of them asked me whether there was a watch advertised to be brought to my home, they shewed me it. I seeing the shagreen case much bruised, said I thought 15 guineas was sufficient; he said, what you please. Then I gave him 15 guineas and away he went. In about 15 minutes after in came the prisoner, dressed in a silver lac'd hat, he swaggered and said, what did I mean by giving but 15<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220004"/> guineas? and said he would have 20. A gentleman was by, and said to me, if it was advertised 20 guineas, I must pay it. So I gave him five guineas, and away he went. On the Friday following there came two letters, one about an hour after the other, threatning to lay some information, I do not know what, if I did not send 10 guineas by the bearer; but I cannot charge the sending them upon the prisoner, the letters were signed R. A.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I met with the prosecutor going along to walk in the fields, I live in Brook-street, I said to him, it was a very fine day, he said yes, so it was. We walked together, he asked me to go and sit down with him by a ditch side, I did; he began to use me very ill, by putting his hand into my breeches. I asked him what he meant by it, he said he hoped no offence, I said you shall go along with me before a justice, he said for God's sake do not take me there, I will give you any thing. So he gave me his watch and money, and said he would advertise it on the morrow, 20 guineas reward. And that if he had had 50 guineas he would have given them to me. I shew'd the watch to some people that were in the fields at the time. After it was advertised I sent my comrade with it, he brought me 15 guineas. Then I went and said it was advertised at 20, and the man gave me five guineas more. There was nobody by when the prosecutor gave me the watch and money, but he and I.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Here is the prisoner's account he gave before the justice, in which he owns he never saw me before he saw me at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brogden. I was by when the prisoner was examined before Mr. Fielding and Mr. Welch. (He produces the examination taken in writing; it is read to this purport.)</p>
               <p>'' That on Monday last he found a gold watch by the side of a ditch, in Marybone fields, that it was advertised in the Wednesday's paper following, 20 guineas reward, and that he sent the said watch by a soldier accordingly, and he brought back 15 guineas, then he went himself and demanded five guineas more, which was delivered to him, and that he never to his knowledge in his life had seen the person then present on this examination, who called himself Dennis Chirac.''</p>

The prisoner came very bare of cloaths, and has since bought a great many cloaths, we suspected her, and opened her box, in which we found a bunch of keys, one of which opened my drawers. She went away on the 24th of September, there was a letter came over night for her to come to her husband on board a ship. I missing my money that time she was gone, went to a neighbour who told me the tide did not serve to carry her down. So he went after her, thinking to find her, and brought her back to my house. She was searched, and 22 s. 6 d. in money found upon her, and a permit for liquor she was to take with her, and she had bought a great many things that morning, a pair of stockings, buckles, shoes, and gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Hosker. She owned she bought them that morning. I charged her with taking the money I missed, she denied it, (the key produced,) this opens the drawer where my money was kept, as well as my own. I have a great deal of reason to believe the prisoner threw the money out of a two pair of stairs window to her brother's wife, who bought the things for her, she and her sister both owned she threw a shilling out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with her before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Hosker. I was, but she would confess nothing and said we could not sware to money. I am sure nobody could have the money, but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Elis. Davis. On the 11th of September last the prisoner's sister-in-law came to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Davis. At Mrs. Hosker's house. The prisoner told her if she would go out of doors she would throw something out into her lap. Then she went up into the two pair of stairs room, and I went to the door, after the sister went out, but I was called in to draw a pint of beer, and as I was on the cellar stairs, I saw something flung out of the the two pair of stairs window, I believe it was as big as my fist, her sister-in-law caught it in her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who flung it?</p>
               <p>Davis. There was nobody up stairs but the prisoner. I saw the sister go away with it immediately, the Sunday following her brother brought her a new quilted petticoat, and a new under one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you acquaint your mistress of this?</p>
               <p>Davis. No, I did not, it went out of my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the lump wrapt up in?</p>
               <p>Davis. It was either in paper, or cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Was that money wrapt up in paper or cloth?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It was taken out of a bag, from some other money; she did not take it all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Biggs. In the morning, the 24th of September, Mrs. Hosker came into my shop, and said, her servant Jenny had robbed her of a considerable sum of money. I told her I would go and examine her room, I did, in one bag she said was 104 l. that we told there, and found 10 s. 6 d. missing of the sum. There were other bags of money; we examined a purse, out of which she said she lost 10 l. since that, she finds she has lost upwards of 30 l. in all. I told her I thought it would be proper to look into the prisoner's box, we went to it, I think it was Jocked, and one of the mistress's keys unlocked it; there was a parcel of old rags, in the middle of them a ring with four keys on it. I desired her to come with me into her own room, and the largest key opened the drawer where this money was, I think better than her own. She told me her maid was gone that morning, in order to go to Gravesend to her husband, then I went to London-wall to a sister-in-law of hers; she told me she was gone over the water. I went and found her coming out of a public-house at Maze-pond, on the other side the water.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220006"/> She was in a new dress, she said, your servant sir, I am just going down to Gravesend to see my husband. I said, but I must speak with you first: she went with me to a public-house, she then denied it, then I brought her to her mistress at the Cross-keys, There was a girl along with her, that was to have gone along with her. The prisoner was searched by some women; there was about 22 s. and a receipt for two gallons orgin. She was comitted to the Compter, and earned before Mr. alderman Gascoyne, then before Mr. alderman Alsoy. She owned nothing of the taking the money, but she has a very bad character. I have been to see for the other girl, who owned to me she had wrote the letter for her, and that it was a forged one, but I cannot find her.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it lie near the shop ?</p>
               <p>Rothendorf. It did. I took it up and carried it into the kitchen and shewed it my master; there were 6 yards and a quarter of blue superfine cloth; I then went up into the shop and looked out of the window to see if any body came to take it; I observed the prisoner go to the place where it had laid, and he stoop'd down for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by stooping?</p>
               <p>Rothendorf. It was dark; this was about 8 o'clock, after he had left work.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property was that bundle?</p>
               <p>Rothendorf. It was my master's property; but the handkerchief, which the goods were in, was the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be the prisoner's?</p>
               <p>Rothendorf. Because he had such a one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him own it to be his?</p>
               <p>Rothendorf. No. There were two trunks full of goods found upon the prisoner, and I was before the justice when they were produced there. The prisoner said in my hearing, the goods were the property of my master.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to believe he embezzled your master's goods before?</p>
               <p>Rothendorf. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the shop from the place where you found the bundle?</p>
               <p>Rothendorf. The shop is up one pair of stairs; the garden is a little distance off.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a place where the servants all go through?</p>
               <p>Rothendorf. The bundle lay in the way we go up to the necessary-house, in the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that common for all your master's servants to go to?</p>
               <p>Rothendorf. It is.</p>

            . I am a taylor, and live in King-street, St. James's-square; the prisoner has been my servant, I believe about three years: I have had great reason to fear he did not do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220008"/> right, having missed many goods; upon the parcel being found in my garden, I took a warrant against the prisoner, and a search-warrant also. He lodged at Mr. Crow's in the Strand; I was not at the searching his lodgings there, but I was at the searching at Mrs. Gourley's in St. Martin's. There were goods found in a room said to belong to the prisoner; there we found two trunks with a very great quantity of goods in them, my property. ( The two trunk full of goods produc'd in court.) These goods are all my property. I have look'd them over, they have been seal'd up ever since. These were all shew'd to the prisoner before justice Lediard; on his first examination he denied them to be mine; but on the 2d and 3d he did own them to be all mine; which are the goods mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he came by the goods?</p>
               <p>Cornthwate. I ask'd him that question; he said he had taken them from me, and that all in the trunks were mine. There was the money, mentioned in the indictment, in one of the trunks.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property did he say that was?</p>
               <p>Cornthwate. He said all in the trunks were my property. There were also goods found at Mr. Crow's, which were produced before the justice, which the prisoner said were mine; part of the goods mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been your servant?</p>
               <p>Cornthwate. He had been with me two years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not a character with him when you took him to be your servant?</p>
               <p>Cornthwate. I had none, for which I am considerably culpable.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you employ several other servants?</p>
               <p>Cornthwate. I employ a great number of people.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those you employ trusted with your goods?</p>
               <p>Cornthwate. Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity was the prisoner in your service?</p>
               <p>Cornthwate. He liv'd solely as my book-keeper.</p>
               <p>Council. Then he was not trusted with the care of your goods?</p>
               <p>Cornthwate. He had access to them, and as I missed goods I suspected every body.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these goods before taken away?</p>
               <p>Cornthwate. They were in chests, and places made on purpose to lay goods into, shut up with folding doors, but no locks.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular marks on these goods that you can know them by?</p>
               <p>Cornthwate. From the manner of their having been cut, they are as well known to me as possible; I have paid for some of them some years.</p>

            . I live in St. Martin's-lane; I have seen the prisoner three or four times; the first time was more than a year ago; he came then to take a lodging in my house, but my rent was too high for him: He came since and desired my husband to let two trunks be in my house, we having an empty room, saying, he thought he might be obliged to leave his other place. We gave him leave, and that same night, which was this day week, he came with two porters, who brought these two trunks that are here; they were carried up into my first-floor, and put in a room; he did not say whose goods they were, but took the key of the room along with him and promised to come again the next day. He came the next day between one and two o'clock, and told my husband and I, that the goods were not really his, but they were a friend's of his that liv'd over the water, and was then in distress,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220009"/> and they had been by the land lord.</p>

            . I went down into Warwickshire, by order of Mr. Hall. I found the mare in Warwickshire, but can't tell the name of the town. She was in custody of one Mr. Peak; he had chang'd her away for another; I swore to the mare as Mr. Hall's property; (I bought her for him in Yorkshire last April.) Mr. Peak had just sold her to another person, and he paid the gentleman the money back again, and delivered the mare to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did Peak change with?</p>
               <p>Adkerson. He chang'd for this mare with the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Adkerson. Peak told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Peak, is he here?</p>
               <p>Adkerson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you of your own knowledge know that this mare was in custody of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Adkerson. No, I do not. I took the prisoner up at the Cock-pit there, by the intelligence of Cox. I asked him if he knew any thing of a black mare, and a dun gelding; he fell a crying, and said, he did very well; he begg'd for a little time, and I gave him two hours. He sent for his father, but he did not come. I ask'd him if there were any Confederates with him, and he said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he stole the black mare, and dun gelding?</p>
               <p>Adkerson. No; but he had a dun gelding there, which one of our neighbour's lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What need of confederates to know a black mare, and a dun gelding. Did he or did he not say he stole them?</p>

            . The boy had told us, when he came first, he worked up his passage from Yorkshire; we thought he was gone down again. We went to Billingsgate to see for him, but did not find him there; then I went and searched the night-cellars; then I wrote an advertisement, and when I was in Fleet-street, going to put it in the Daily Advertiser, a man came and told me the boy was taken and put into the Compter. I went there to see him, and they told me the constable had taken the watch from him; and the next day I saw it produced before Sir Crisp Gascoyne.</p>

The prisoner came into our shop last Monday night, along with another man, at almost nine o'clock; they came with a pretence to buy; I showed them several parcels; they were very difficult; I then began to suspect them; I was not showing them no more. Then he, that is not taken, took up two pair of stocking, and ran away with them; as soon as he was gone out, the prisoner took up three pair, and with his hand knock'd out the candle, and than ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your stockings again ?</p>
               <p>R. Smith. I have, the three pair the prisoner took away (producing them,) they are my property. The prisoner was taken by Mr. Parry, and brought back, and the stockings. We took him before the sitting alderman Guild hall; there he was charg'd with stealing them. He said very little for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>R. Smith. He own'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his words?</p>
               <p>R. Smith. He said he should not have done it if the other had not began first.</p>

            . On Monday night I was passing by the house where the fact was committed; being intimate with Mr. Smith, I went in; I saw the prisoner and another man in the shop; the other man crowded by me with a pair or two of stockings in his hand; then I saw the prisoner with his right hand sweep the stockings, paper and all, off the counter; he struck the candle out, and then went to run away. I clasp'd him in my arms he tripp'd up my heels, and I fell and got some hurt; he fell as well as I, but got up and ran; I recovered myself and pursued him up Little-Britain, with the cry, Stop thief, and near the pump I lost fight of him; I believe, for about a moment. I saw two or three people had hold of the prisoner. I bid them hold him fast, and said, he was a thief, and had robb'd a shop. There was a young man who pick'd up two pair of stockings near the kennel, and delivered them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220013"/> to me, and I brought them and the prisoner back to the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>Court. Look upon the stockings; are these the same?</p>
               <p>Parry. To the best of my knowledge these are the same. There came in a gentleman, as the prisoner was a running by him, he struck him, and drop'd a pair of stockings, which were pick'd up and brought and delivered to the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Parry. I was. The prisoner said to me his accomplice was after him five or six days together after he had done work, to go with him a robbing, and that he never was guilty of such an action before, (and I really think he never was.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him own it?</p>
               <p>Parry. I did; and when he was brought back into the shop, he offered to leave his coat for the damage done.</p>

I went to justice Fielding and got a warrant and went to where I was told he was, but he had made his escape, and at night he was brought to our house by a person that is now in court. I ask'd him if he had not taken any of my books; he own'd he had taken the first volume of Mogul Tales, and had sold it to Mr. Sergeant, a bookseller, for 6 d. last Monday morning. I went to him and found it accordingly; he told me his wife bought it of a boy, but could not tell what boy. I describ'd the private marks upon it, and he delivered it to me.

I went and took him before Sir Samuel Gore; there he own'd he sold three of the shirts and three neckcloths for six shillings, at a little peny house in the Minories; he had a pair of black stockings on his legs, which he own'd to be mine. Sir Samuel could not commit him, because the fact was committed in the city, so we took him before Mr. alderman Gascoyne, and he committed him to Newgate. He confessed the same before the alderman, as he did before Sir Samuel.</p>

            , and Oliphant, the deceased, at work in the shop. I went up there and saw my mistress with a mallet and square in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what she was going to do with them?</p>
               <p>Perry. I believe she was going to strike the deceased. He held her hand and took them away, and said she should have nothing from that bench; then she went to the other bench and catched up a turning-bit, call'd a stock and bit. Then I went down stairs into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220015"/>Court. Look at this instrument. (It was a stock and bit, commonly call'd a breast-wimble, with a goug, about 5 or 6 inches long; about a quarter of an inch diameter.)</p>
               <p>Perry. It was just such an instrument as this that she took up. Just as I got to the bottom of the stairs, I heard a noise as if something had fell; then I returned into the shop and saw my mistress fallen backwards, and the deceased with he hand on his side, and he reel'd and fell down: he was dead then I believe; I thought he was dead when they took him up, for he never feared.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been gone down before you heard the falling ?</p>
               <p>Perry. It could not be a minute from the time I saw her with the stock in her hand, when I return'd and saw her down. My mistress at that time had not the instrument in her hand; she was push'd backwards, and the tool lay on the shavings in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she take the tool up from?</p>
               <p>Perry. She took it from Downing's bench.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body push her backwards?</p>
               <p>Perry. No; I did not: I only judge the deceased did; he had received the wound at that time. I saw the instrument bloody afterwards; that is, the inside of the iron was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done after he fell?</p>
               <p>Perry. Downing went down and ran for a surgeon immediately; the deceased had on a brown waistcoat, and I saw his shirt bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your mistress after this ?</p>
               <p>Perry. She went down stairs. I went down for some water for the deceased, and I told her then I believed Joseph was dead; she said, 'Pshaw, I don't believe it, he only shamm'd. After that she went into her chamber; and when the officer was going to have her in the coach to take her away, I asked her what she would have to put upon her head; she said, she was ruin'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her head naked ?</p>
               <p>Perry. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen her but that once, from the time she went into the room till she went into the coach?</p>
               <p>Perry. First of all she went down stairs, then up stairs, then into her own chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she immediately go up stairs, when you told her you thought Joseph was dead?</p>
               <p>Perry. No, she did not; but I did not see her go up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when the officer came?</p>
               <p>Perry. I went up stairs after the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he find her?</p>
               <p>Perry. In a back chamber where she commonly laid; the officer was breaking open a chamber-door with an ax, where she was not; and my mistress opened the door where she was, and came out to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what she said to him?</p>
               <p>Perry. I do not. That was the time I asked her what she would have to put on her head.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it you saw them in the shop?</p>
               <p>Perry. It was between two and three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the shop ?</p>
               <p>Perry. It was but just gone up for the broom when I saw her with the mallet and square in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any words pass when you saw your mistress with the mallet in her hand ?</p>
               <p>Perry. I heard a few words pass before I went up.</p>
               <p>Q. What words?</p>
               <p>Perry. I don't know what words.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when these words past?</p>
               <p>Perry. They were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they angry words ?</p>
               <p>Perry. Yes, I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who began to speak?</p>
               <p>Perry. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you describe the square you saw?</p>
               <p>Perry. It was a wooden thing with two sides to it.</p>
               <p>C. Look at this instrument. (It was the mallet.)</p>
               <p>Perry. That is a mallet; she had just such a one in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think she was going to do with the mallet and square?</p>
               <p>Perry. I think she was going to strike.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had both these things in her hand, with which was she going to strike, in what manner did she hold them?</p>
               <p>Perry. She held then as I do; (taking the mallet by the handle, and the thinest part of the square in the same hand, holding the mallet with the head upwards, and the bottom end of the square directed forwards.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take hold of her?</p>
               <p>Perry. He did; and said she should have nothing from his bench.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe how she had hold of the stock.</p>
               <p>Perry. She held it in this manner, ( taking hold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220016"/> of the handle part of the instrument, with the bit directed forward towards the deceased.)</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was Oliphant at the time?</p>
               <p>Perry. He was standing before her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect she was going to strike him with that instrument?</p>
               <p>Perry. I did not expect any mischief when I went away.</p>
               <p>Council. I think you say you was not absent above a minute.</p>
               <p>Perry. No, I was not. I heard a noise as if something fell, upon which I immediately returned to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. In what position was the deceas'd, when you return'd?</p>
               <p>Perry. He was standing on his legs, reeling, with his hand on his side.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your mistress then?</p>
               <p>Perry. Downing was taking her up when the deceas'd fell.</p>
               <p>Council. Then consequently she fell before he fell.</p>
               <p>Perry. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this accident, was it that the officer was fetched?</p>
               <p>Perry. I can't tell, indeed. I ran out for my master; but I believe it was less than an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing to hinder your mistress from going out of the house, before the officer came?</p>
               <p>Perry. The street-door was lock'd, as usual, and the key hanging up in its place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention to your mistress of her having struck him with that instrument?</p>
               <p>Perry. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing mention'd to her about it?</p>
               <p>Perry. Not as I know of.</p>

She fell backwards against my leg as I was at work; I turned round and helped her up as fast as I could; and before I had well got her up, the deceased clap'd his hand on his breast, and fell backwards; I went and took hold of him and held him up, and saw-some blood; I said to my partner, for God's-sake, run, for I fear here is mischief.</p>

               <p>Q. You say there were words; who did they rise from?</p>

               <p>

               <p>Q. How long is the bench?</p>
               <p>Saint. It is about 10 foot long. I saw her take up this mallet (here produc'd,) and

             came round the end of the bench to her; they were both at different ends of the bench when she took up the mallet; when he came to her they had a sort of a scuffle betwixt the two benches, and the mallet drop'd down between them.</p>
               <p>Q. In what posture did your mistress seem to hold the mallet ?</p>
               <p>Saint. I can't say in what posture; I kept minding my work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Oliphant lay hold of the mallet?</p>
               <p>Saint. I believe he must think his mistress was going to strike him with it, and he came to rescue it out of her hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next thing you saw, that you can remember with certainty?</p>
               <p>Saint. After the mallet was drop'd, I saw my mistress snatch something from the end of the same bench; it was snatched up as quick as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it?</p>
               <p>Saint. Really I can't tell what it was; it was snatched up as soon as could be; it was done in an instant, and my mistress fell against Downing's legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what was the occasion of her falling?</p>
               <p>Saint. I suppose as soon as he received the wound he gave her a shove, or she would not have tumbled backwards.

               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you understand to be so extremely quick?</p>
               <p>Saint. The snatching up this stock and bit; but I can't say that was the thing. Whatever was snatch'd up, it was no sooner done, but my mistress fell within half a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was your mistress to the deceased at the time something was snatched up?</p>

               <p>Saint. It is about 12 feet.</p>

            . I married the mother of the deceased, one of the journeymen came to our house, and told me, and my wife, he believed Joe was killed. I went immediately for a surgeon, and came to his master's house; as soon as I open'd the street door, I saw Mrs. Smith in the entry much confused. I saw Mr. Tolmin's son bleeding the deceased. I went to Mrs. Smith and said, what cruel thing have you done to my son? she spoke something, what it was I do not know. There were some people in the entry, I charged them not to let any body go out, either backwards or forwards, till I knew which way the murder was committed. She got up stairs and lock'd the door of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Williamson. Because I went up stairs and asked where Mrs. Smith was, and nobody could give an account. I went to the headborough.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go first to see if the door was fastened?</p>
               <p>Williamson. I took hold of several doors, but I did not know which room she was in. When the headbrough came, he got an ax, and began to knock at the door where she was not, my back was against the door where she was at the same time. She opened the door and said here I am. I went into the room and catched hold on her, and said what an evil action have you done, she said I am an unfortunate woman, or a ruined creature, or something of that kind.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, I found the deceased in a sitting posture, supported by the other two workmen, there was Mr. Tolmin. I said, for God's sake what is the matter? he shook his head, and said, I believe he is dead. The deceased's face on the left side was dirty, and a little bloody. I said, he has had a blow here. I found, upon inquiry, he got that by falling upon the pavement in the yard. I found above, the bench end to be square with the door, and about four foot from it, and by the reel he fell out there into the yard, we concluded that blow on his face could not kill him. Mr. Tolmin said, his shirt is bloody, pointing to his left side, I took my instrument out, and ripped down the shirt; and on the left side, about three inches from the region of his heart, there was a small wound, about a quarter of an inch diameter, like a half-moon or curve. I said, we need not look any further, for this wound is close to the region of the heart. I examined the men if they had seen any instrument near where he fell-from, or on the floor; they all said no. I said that it must be done with a small gouge, but they none of them could give any account that they saw such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the maid by at this time?</p>
               <p>Turpin. No, she was not there. I then desired Mr. Williamson to go for an officer. It was very near an hour before one came. In looking up and down the shop. I found upon a bench this instrument, called a stock and bit. I said, Mr. Barnet, I believe, I have found the instrument that has done the mischief. I found the gouge or bit in it, exactly the shape and size of the wound, and to me it appeared bloody on the inside. I first apprehended it was wiped. but upon second confideration I judged the waistcoat had cleaned the out-side of it by pulling it out. I took my knife and scraped the inside, and found it to be dry blood. I shew'd it to Mr. Curtis, with much the same words, but can't say what answer he made; then I wrapt it in a bit of paper, and put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220019"/> it in my pocket, presently came in Downing and Saint. I asked them if either of them had seen that instrument in their mistress's hand, they said, no, they had not; but upon repeating the question, one of them, I think it was Saint, said, our maid told me half an hour ago the mistress had taken up that instrument. I asked them where the maid was, they said, above stairs. I said, pray call her, they did, and she came down. I said, child did you see your mistress with this instrument in her hand? Said she, I saw the mallet and square in her hand? I said, but did you see her with this in her hand? She said, I saw her with a mallet and square in her hand; I said, the man says you told him about half an hour ago, you saw her with this in her hand. I saw the mallet and square, she said again; and I could get no more. I said, you must tell the truth by and by, for you must be examined about it, though I have no right to examine you. She turned her back and went away.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, I was there about two minutes before Mr. Turpin came in, I found the deceased lying on the floor in the workshop; on observing some blood on the left side, I desired Mr. Turpin to examine whence that came, there we found a crooked small wound, he passed his probe into the cavity of the chest, and we determined that wound was certainly the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe the wound.</p>
               <p>Tolmin. It was a curve of about a quarter of an inch, or a little better. I believe I staid there about half an hour, and after I was gone, this tool was found. When I saw it, it was exactly as now, a little bloody; and then I thought no other tool could do it but that. (So said Mr. Turpin, upon being asked his opinion.)</p>

            , that is the prisoner's husband, about two months ago. The deceased and I were making a window frame, at a house at Wapping-dock. The prisoner came in, and was angry with me for helping the deceased, and said, it should not be done. She ordered me to go about my work, which I was about, and Oliphant to go home; he said he would not go home, for if he did he would not make the frame. She bid him go out of that place, he said he would not go out for her, then she took up a hand saw, and held it up to strike him, he got the saw out of her hand, and said he would not stand to be beat with his own tools.</p>

               <p>Q. What is her general character?</p>
               <p>Clarke. A very civil, inoffensive woman, as far as ever I heard or saw, till this unhappy affair she always bore this character.</p>

               <p>Q. Is her character that of a good natured or cruel woman?</p>

               <p>Mr. Barnard. I have known her particularly well about 15 or 16 years.</p>
               <p>Q. Has her behaviour been humane or cruel?</p>
               <p>Barnard. I happen to live within a few doors of her, and have been conversant with her, and know her general character and behaviour. She is a person of as humane a disposition as any woman I know, one that has relieved poor people in our neighbourhood. She has reliev'd some tenants of mine to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her general character?</p>
               <p>Barnard. It is that of a sober, agreeable woman in conversation, on all accounts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibbins. I have known her about 9 years. I boarded in her house about three years, in 47, 48, and 49. I have known her to be charitable in several instances.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion of her humanity?</p>
               <p>Gibbins. I believe her to be a very humane 'I good-natur'd woman, that is her character, never heard any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hickman. I have known the prisoner about 10 years, I boarded in her house about half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the behaviour of the woman?</p>
               <p>Hickman. Her behaviour and conduct was very agreeable and very comfortable to the whole family. I have said often I should have been glad to have lived in the family longer, if it would have suited my circumstances, when I have gone there since, I have always found her conversation very agreeable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walden. I have known her 14 or 15 years, and have been frequently at the house. I have done business for them, and they for me. I have eat and drank in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. From your observations, what is the disposition and temper of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Walden. I thought always of her, in every respect, a good woman, a meek, mild tempered woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her to be a woman of a mild, or cruel disposition ?</p>
               <p>Walden. Far from thinking her a cruel woman, but one that would shudder at the thing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Chapman. I have known her 20 years, and been intimately acquainted with her. I lived within four doors of her.</p>
               <p>Q. From your observation of her, what is her disposition, humane or cruel?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I always found her humane, and charitable to poor people in distress. That is her general character in the neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>Q. What is her disposition, cruel or humane?</p>
               <p>Fowle. I always took her to be a very tender-hearted person, and a very good neighbour, very willing to serve any body in distress. I have been an eye-witness to many acts of charity she has done, and that as privately as she could.</p>

               <p>Eastop. Her general character is a good neighbour, and a charitable woman; I never saw any thing to the contrary, but that of a courteous, good-natured woman. I myself have experienc'd this of her. This is a character she always deserved.</p>
               <p>Mrs Gold. I have known her about 13 years, and have been pretty intimate with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her disposition, cruel or humane?</p>
               <p>Gold. She is a humane charitable woman; I have received of her charity myself. I never heard she was a woman of a cru el disposition.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Boston. I have known her about four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Boston. I live not far from her, and have been very well acquainted with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her general character?</p>
               <p>Boston. She always bore a very good character; she is a very good neighbour, and a person of great humanity. This I have observ'd and known.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Huson. I have known her eight years; I never heard any thing ill of her before this.</p>
               <p>Q. From your own observation of her, what is her general character ?</p>
               <p>Huson. I take her to be a humane woman, that was always my opinion.</p>

I have from time to time been very suspicious of somebody going into them, besides myself; my two vaults are one on the side of the other; and there are others have vaults there, which all go in from one common door. I believe I have now the quantity of 18 hundred gallons of spirituous liquors in them, but I never sell any wholesale, but by drams and in punch in my house. I used not to send any body there when I wanted, but went myself and fetched perhaps a couple of gallons at a time; the exciseman had several times told me I had an extreme good trade, that I must get a great deal if I used so much as he found gone out. I knew I had a tolerable good trade; but being a little suspicious, I took a broom and set it up behind the door when I came out, that it should stand within side, and fall against the door when I lock'd it. When I went the next time, I, at opening the door, put in my hand to feel for the broom and I could not find it; then I went in and found it set a considerable distance from the place; then I was certain somebody had been there besides me; after that I took a stick that I used to gauge my vessel with; it was mark'd with figures; I gaug'd the two casks on tap, and observ'd exactly the depth; by this, the next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220023"/> time I went, I found a deficiency of an inch in one, and an inch and half in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What do your casks usually hold ?</p>
               <p>Crossland. From a hundred to a hundred and 15 gallons. I tried the broom also a second time; and when I went the next time it was gone from the door again. Thus, I have at times, guest I have lost four or five gallons out of both vessels on tap at a time. I have tried to find it out by this method of gauging, and the third and fourth times, on the 11th of this instant, I look'd upon it I had lost 1.5 gallons and upwards, from these four observations. I had also a stock-lock and a padlock, both on the door; the stock-lock did not answer well. I bought a new padlock of a particular sort, and I was told it was a very safe one; after some little time I found the new lock fail in the opening; that is, it would not open without forcing it, but it would lock very well. I was at a loss to contrive how to detect the thief. On the 11th of this instant I went down occasionally for a bottle of brandy; coming to the outward door, (that outward door used to stand open all day, and was usually lock'd in the evening;) there

             came to me, he said, are you going down in the cellar; I said, yes, and it is a wet night, will you go down with me and drink a dram of rum; he went down and I gave him a dram, and coming up with him I went to lock the door; I ask'd him if he had got the key to lock it, I having things in my hand. We had all keys to the outward door, who had vaults within. He said, he had not his key, then I lock'd it. Something struck into my mind that this was one of the very men that robb'd me. Then I went and carry'd my bottle of brandy into York-buildings, and went and got shav'd, and return'd to the outward door. I look'd in under the door, there is a cavity that a dog may go down, and there I saw a light within the vault, with the padlock, and the bar off the outward door.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was this after you had lock'd the door?</p>
               <p>Crossland. It was about 20 minutes, or half an hour after; I, by looking in, saw a man like a miller, but I did not see his face; he had the lighted candle in a wooden candlestick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How look'd like a miller?</p>
               <p>Crossland. He had meal on him?</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the vault was this?</p>
               <p>Crossland. This was in the place that leads to all the cellars. Then I went to Mr. Steward's cellar, in hopes to find somebody; but finding nobody, I went to Mr. Harrison, who is steward to that estace; he lives within 50 yards of this place; I told him I was certain I had been robb'd from time to time, and bid him go and look in, and watch about, and see who brought any thing out, but not detect them; he went, what he saw he'll give an account of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look any farther that night?</p>
               <p>Crossland. No, I did not. After Mr. Harrison came and told me they were gone out, I desired him to go down with me to see what was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to watch at the door?</p>
               <p>Crossland. The persons whom I suspected all knew me, and I did not want they should see me; so desired him to see what they brought up and where they lodg'd them. On the Sunday after I apply'd to captain Jones to let me have two men to put into the cellar, who sent a sergeant-major with two soldiers. I put the two soldiers into my cellar on the Monday morning; we went in at Mr. Steward's door; they were there till Saturday night, at different times; we took them out to refresh them a little in the daytime, and put them in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how much you have lost in all?</p>
               <p>Crossland. I can't; but I believe I have lost ten times the quantity I have mention'd. On the 18th of October the two soldiers brought the evidence Woolf to my house; we ask'd him who were with him, he immediately declar'd who they were; I went to Mr. Fielding and he advis'd me to go immediately after the people he had impeach'd, (he had impeach'd all the prisoners at the bar.) We went and took them all up; they all denied the fact, only David Davis, he own'd he had altered a key, (producing a key, with part of the work filed away, so that it would open divers different locks.) This is the key he own'd before the justice he alter'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say for what purpose he alter'd it?</p>
               <p>Crossland. No, he did not positively say for what purpose, but that he gave it to one of the prisoners; I believe it was to

               <p>Q. Have you writings drawn between you?</p>

I said, I wanted some to give away to porters, he said it would be six shillings per gallon. I said, bring me some, he brought me a 20 gallon cask, for which I paid him 6 l.

I said, I did not want a great deal, he brought me 20 gallons more. I gave him four guineas in part. I gave the money before he brought me the rum, to go and meet the man with it, as he pretended at Deptford, and last Saturday Mr. Crossland came, and told me he had discovered a thing that would be of service to both himself and me. I went with him to his house, there was Woolf taken, who said, my man was concerned with him. I said, I had bought 40 gallons of rum of my man. I had trusted him with my vaults and did not suspect him to be a thief, I went with Mr. Crossland to the justice, when Woolf made his information.</p>

            . Mr. Crossland gave me a hint that he had lost goods about a fortnight ago, he said he suspected this evidence Woolf to be one concerned. On the Saturday following he came to my house, and said, now I b elieve they are at it at this time. I wish you would come and assist me, for if I go about the place they'll suspect my watching them, and so I shall not catch them. I went to the cellar door about eight o'clock that evening, the door was shut but not lock'd up. I saw a light down at the bottom. I pulled the door an inch or two open, and saw a light going backwards and forwards, presently I saw the lower parts of two men, that is two pair of legs, and higher, one of them was in a lightish dress. I stood there some time, presently I saw them shake hands together, then one of them came up, that was the prisoner Doyle, he had a glass bottle in his hand. I took no notice of him, or he of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other?</p>
               <p>Harison. I don't know who it was. I ran home thinking Mr. Crossland was there, to tell him what I had seen, but he was not there. I returned, and then the outward doors were shut up and lock'd, and the evidence Woolf and Doyle were standing near them. I heard Doyle say to Woolf, Have you done it? if you have not, I'll come and lend you a hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Harison. This was in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from that place where they stood ?</p>
               <p>Harison. It is as far off as it is cross the Sessions-house yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, when you returned, observe the bottle in Doyle's hand.</p>
               <p>Harison. No, I did not. I only walked on, not to give them the least suspicion that I was looking after them. I then went to Mr. Crossland, and told him what I had seen, then we went to Mr. Steward's, to ask leave to go his way into the vaults, because they thought to open the great doors would carry a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Woolf after he was taken?</p>
               <p>Harison. I was at the prosecutor's house, and after I had mentioned to him, that I saw him and Doyle there that night, then he said Abraham Davis persuaded him into it, and said, he would procure him a man to make him a key to let him in, and that was a smith named

On Saturday morning the 18th, about 6 o'clock, I was in the vault standing behind a punshion of rum; my partner was also in the vault, but was laid down backwards to go to sleep. I saw a light and heard the vault locks undo; after the locks were undone, the man went back again to the door, I suppose to call the other; he came again in about two minutes, and came into the vault; there I took him; it was

            . I keep a public-house in Hungerford-market; I've known Doyle between two and three years; he was always a very honest man, as far as ever I heard; and was so looked upon in the neighbourhood in general.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harison. Have you heard what this Downs says concerning Doyle?</p>
               <p>Harison. I have. If he means my seeing him bring the bottle out of the vault, he is right. I have known Doyle some time, he has behav'd very well. I was sorry for him. I said to Woolf, at Mr. Crossland's that morning, don't go to charge an innocent man, if he is not concerned; he said, Doyle was the least concerned. If Downs means any private conversation, or persuasion of mine, it is utterly false.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Woolf continue always to charge Doyle?</p>
               <p>Harison. He did; he said, he had been with him several times, and had had several bottles, but always denied he had any of the money; he said, he never had a shilling; and since that, he has said, Doyle had a share of it. I never had any intimacy with Woolf; I knew him at Mr. Hide's, a servant. I heard Mr. Fielding and Mr. Welch, divers times, order him to charge no innocent person, and to be very careful what he did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Woolf. Were Downs and you together at the Barley-mow ?</p>
               <p>Woolf. We were, he asked me if Doyle was innocent, I said no he was not. I said he had none of the money, but he had rum, and that he had gone down in the cellar several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Wooley?</p>
               <p>Woolf. I don't know Wooley, I never spoke to him in my life to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. If he had been there, should you have seen him?</p>
               <p>Tuffnail. I should, there was one asked several questions about the innocency of Doyle, I don't remember that Woolf said any thing, he courted him to get Doyle of, and Woolf said, Doyle was guilty in the small things, but was innocent of the money.</p>

               <p>Robertson. I know I did the key.</p>

               <p>Robertson. The key they charge my master about.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this key, (the false key.)</p>
               <p>Robertson. I can't really say this is the key or not, but to the best of my knowledge, I think it is.</p>
               <p>Q. It is what?</p>
               <p>Robertson. It was alter'd by me.</p>

               <p>Q. Has that key (look well as it) received any alteration since you altered it?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I think it was whole here (putting his finger to a place in the wards filed away to a large opening.) and it was not so bright as it is now.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose orders did you open it?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I opened it by my master's orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what use the key was for?</p>
               <p>Robertson. No, I did not at all. I asked my master if it would do, and when I had opened the wards of it, he said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether this is not a picklock key, and not for opening a lock in the common way?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I never did many keys before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make a key in your life?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I never did make many, that can go through all locks quite.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a key made in this kind but what was made to be a picklock?</p>
               <p>Robertson. Upon my word I do not know. I can't say I have seen many made in that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a lock by you to make it by?</p>

I had seven 36 shilling pieces, and some guineas, and a four and sixpenny piece in my pocket. I fell asleep. About two o'clock in the morning I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your money when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Clarkson. I did not feel in my pocket that night. Next morning when I got up about seven o'clock, I miss'd four 36 shilling pieces, a guinea, and a four and sixpenny piece, I then went to the Green dragon next door, and asked if the prisoner had been there, and had some money about him.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to ask for the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Clarkson. Because I had suspicion of him; he had serv'd me such a trick before. I asked the tapster if had changed any money; he said, the prisoner ask'd him to change a guinea, which one of the book-keeper's did.</p>
               <p>Court. This is what the tapster told you, this is not of your own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Clarkson. The tapster is here.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Q. Done how?</p>
               <p>Clarkson. That he took four 36 s. pieces, a guinea, and a little piece, but he did not know what the little piece was; this was in the tap-house, where he was taken up; and before my Lord Mayor, I was present both times.</p>

            . I keep the tap at the Green-dragon in Bishopsgate-street; I know the prisoner, he has come in often and call'd for a pint of beer, and has paid for it; he came in and called for a shilling's worth of rum and water; he seem'd to be in liquor; he then said, give me change for a guinea; a gentlewoman gave him change, and he paid for the rum and water out of it; then I observ'd, he put down some 36 s. pieces; I saw four, he shoved them towards me; I said, I supposed he wanted me to keep them for him till the morning. In the morning Mr. Clarkson came and inquired if I had seen him, and whether he had any money about him. I told him he had changed a guinea, and had left four 36 s. pieces with me. I have got the money now, and have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come in the morning for the money?</p>
               <p>White. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when the tapster came?</p>
               <p>White. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner after this?</p>
               <p>White. I did not see him till after the tapster came for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner afterwards?</p>
               <p>White. I found him at the Four Swans, he did not run away. I went with him before my Lord Mayor, there I heard him confess he robbed the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220032"/> tapster, as he lay asleep, of these four 36 s. pieces, (producing them ) and some little piece; I don't remember any thing more.</p>

             gave upon that trial.</p>
               <p>Caldicut. She said, Jones and she was together at the Leg-tavern, Fleet-street, on the 5th of October, between the hours of four and five in the evening, in the uppermost room in the yard; she was ask'd whether the windows and door were open or shut; she made answer, the windows were down, and the door shut: I think she said nobody went into the room to them after the wine was carry'd in, and that Jones made her an offer of an hundred pounds stock to put her into a publick-house, provided she would let him lie with her, and that her answer was, she would not do such a thing, neither would she defile Mr. Hunt's bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any of it in writing?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. I did at the time. Then she was ask'd who Mr. Hunt was; she said, he was in the Fleet, and she had a written contract of marriage with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she had liv'd with Hunt?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. She said she had liv'd with him, I think, 14 or 15 months; but that I can't exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she ask'd if she knew Hunt had a wife?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. She was, and seem'd to hum and haw a little, and said, she believ'd she had heard it. She said Jones laid hold of her and pull'd her forwards, and unbutton'd his breeches, and put her hand to his private parts, and that he forc'd her petticoats up before; that she cry'd out as loud as she could, but nobody came to her assistance, that she struggled very much, and got herself disingaged; and afterwards he got her cloaths up backwards in order to lie with her that way; that she cry'd out again, and, I think, she lost the heel of her shoe in the struggle; she described him then as sitting in a chair, and she in his lap, and he threw her cross his lap, and one of her legs was between his, her head upon the ground, and she then found him enter her body; he had one of his hands upon her's, and with the other he put in his private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she swear this was against her will?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. She did, and by force.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give an account that when this act was committed, she struggled, cry'd out, and made a noise, and nobody came to her assistance?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. She did. She was ask'd if she was positive whether he enter'd her; she said, she was sure he did. She was ask'd also, whether she perceiv'd any thing to come from - to which she answer'd, no. Then he said, she said, d - n it, he could do nothing; and she told him, she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220033"/> would raise Fleet-street about his ears, unless he would let her go; and that then he would not let her go till she had swore she would return back to supper, and that her cloaths were torn almost off her back; that she went home, and afterwards Jones came to her house to buy pots that evening about 7 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she say she staid with Jones in this room?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. I think she said, she was there better than an hour; she said one Gwyn was at her house, who wrote a receipt for 12 s. that she received of Jones for the pots, and that Hunt bid her sign the receipt; and after Jones was gone, Hunt beat her most unmercifully for not signing the receipt at first, when he bid her; and that then she told him Jones had us'd her ill, but I did not take that down. She was ask'd if she did not know the Leg-tavern, till Jones appointed to go there; she said, she never knew there was such a house before; she was ask'd whether any body came to her assistance, when she cry'd out; she said, nobody came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she saw any body?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. She said she saw the maid at the bar?</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she complain'd to her?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. No; she said she never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any account of any complaint she made, while in the house?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any account of having black eyes at any time, can you tell?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. I think she told my Lord Mayor, when she was before him, she got them by something in the cellar falling upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Were Hunt and she examined in the hearing of each other here in court?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. No, they were examined apart by desire of their council.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Hunt being examined on that trial?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account of having liv'd at any place near the Leg-tavern, Fleet-street?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. He did mention his paying half a year's rent; and, I think, he said he liv'd there better than a quarter of a year, but not quite half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What place did he mention?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. A place not above 8 or 9 doors from the Leg-tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the question ask'd him, whether or no Mrs. Robertson did not know the Leg-tavern, as they had liv'd so near it?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. He was ask'd that question, and he answer'd, he believ'd she did, because he had forewarn'd her going to the Leg-tavern often, almost 40 times, knowing it to be a house of ill fame.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his being ask'd, whether he beat her?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. I can't tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. During the course of this trial (look upon this paper) tell my Lord and the Jury, whether it was shewn to Hunt or not?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. (He looks at it.) It is a letter wrote to Jones's wife; he was shewn it, and he declar'd it to be his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is another letter, do you remember this? (putting another letter in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Caldicut. Hunt was ask'd also, whether this was his hand writing, and he declar'd it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have these two letters been ever since that trial?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. They have been in the hands of Mr. Jones's council, and my own, ever since.</p>

               <p>Directed to Mrs. Jones at the Barley-mow, Chick-lane, near Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Hunt say, was his motive for writing these letters?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. I can't remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember he said Mrs. Jones came to him?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. I remember he said something of Mrs. Jones's coming upon the receipt of the last letter, and I remember she said she did go up in his room in the Fleet, and there saw Mrs. Robertson sitting with two black eyes, and I believe she said Hunt was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what person was with Mrs. Robertson?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what she swore?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. I don't particularly remember.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so extremely correct to take notes on one side, and not the other?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. That is easily answered, I did it for the benefit of my client, all that would be of service to him, I ought to do, and what would not, I had no business to take notes of. I determined to give myself a good deal of trouble to find out the truth of things.</p>
               <p>Q. If your motive was doing right, whether you don't think there is the same justice to the public to take notice of what is said on one side, as well as the other?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. At that time, my business was to recollect every thing for the benefit of my client.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. Do you now give all the evidence you are capable of, both for and against the defendants?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. I do, if I knew any thing that would be of any service to them, I would speak it.</p>
               <p>Q. from Hunt. Whether you don't remember I said there was a mistake in the date of one of the letters, and that they should both be dated the 6th of October?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. I do not remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you with certainty say, that Hunt said upon the trial, that the first letter had a mistake in the date?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. I rather should be induced to believe they were sent on different days, but I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any proposal made from the prisoners, for Jones to give a sum of money to stop the prosecution of the rape?</p>
               <p>Caldicut. I know nothing of that, there was none made to me.</p>

               <p>Jones. About four or five years ago, he came and brought an old man a lawyer (I think they called his name Harr ison) he told me he understood I had got some money, and he had got a fine house on the other side the water, and an acre of land, and he wanted me to lend him 200l. I told him if it was free land, and if he had a right title to it, I'd let him have the money. I went to see it, but found he did not bear a very good character, I found it not to be free land, but he was to pay 10l. a year for it.</p>
               <p>Council. Perhaps that may be a long detail, not much to the purpose, answer this question, did you ever lend him any money?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, I have lent him money several times, here is a note of hand of his for six guineas, which I lent him (producing it,) sign'd

               <p>Q. Did you ever make application to them to have money or goods for that note ?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, I have several times. I once went up stairs to him, and he would not be seen, when he did appear he threw me down stairs, and struck Mr. Griffith, who went with me. Then I gave

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220035"/>Q. On the 5th of October, was you at the house which Robertson kept in the Fleet-market?</p>
               <p>Jones. I went to the house to get, as they call it, myself home for that note, the goods a selling were Hunt's goods, but he threw himself in the Fleet, and put the goods in her name.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by getting yourself home?</p>
               <p>Jones. I mean to get what goods I could, and pay with the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with her about goods that were to be sold?</p>
               <p>Jones. I had, I ask'd her what there were to be sold, she run up stairs into a two and three pair of stairs room, and said if I had a mind to any of those goods I should have them, but for God's sake, said she, take no notice of that note. I look'd at some chairs, there was a woman there, that she said was her mother. She said if there is any thing that you like, I will go with you to the Kings-arms or the Leg-tavern, Fleet-street, which you like, and we will agree for them there, for if you take notice of the note here, there may come anger. I said, if it is your mother, why must we go to either of those houses, can't you tell me the price of them? I called for half a pint of wine in her house; she said, make it a pint, I'll pay the half. So the waiter brought up a pint of wine, she drank to me, and I only drank one glass. Then she called me back into a little room, and said, which house will you go to, for we must not do business here? I said, I was going to the Goose in Sheer-lane, she said that will be nothing out of your way, so I said, then I'll come to you at the Leg-tavern. She ran away to go there. I was going along the street that way, and she ran along the street, and put her hand on my shoulder, and said, you are a man of your word; did not you promise to come to the Leg-tavern. I said, I am going now. But had I not seen her I should not have gone there. She ran into the Leg-tavern, and into a room, that faces the bar in the yard, and I followed her. She called for a pint of wine, she drank one glass and I another; then she said, I told you that was my mother, but it is not, and I am afraid she will wrong me, and I must be back as soon as possible, but I'll be here again in 10 minutes. She went away, and did not stay above four or five minutes at most in the room. I said, I suppose you'll not come any more, she said nothing but death should keep her. I rung the bell, the waiter came, I asked him to drink a glass of wine, which he did, and I gave him a shilling, and went away, and said if any body comes for me, tell them I am gone. I never was in the Leg-tavern before that time, and I know I could no be there a dozen minutes that time. I believe the wine was in the bar when we went in, or it could not have been brought so soon.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the windows and door of the room open or shut ?</p>
               <p>Jones. The windows were both up to dry the room, and they never were down during the time I was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether, at that time, you offered any violence to her of any sort?</p>
               <p>Jones. I can't say whether I ever kiss'd her lips in my life; but I never in my life offer'd any violence to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been married?</p>
               <p>Jones. I have been married ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, when you was there, whether you either ravish'd her, or attempted to ravish her?</p>
               <p>Jones. Upon my oath, I never attempted to ravish her; I offer'd no more violence to her than I do any body now; I might have laid with her a hundred times, I believe, if I would, since I have known her, by the freedom she has shew'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Hunt a wife?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes; there she sits, (pointing to her) she has three fine children by him, as I am credibly inform'd. (She made obedience to the court, and said, my name is Hunt.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the evidence Robertson gave upon your trial?</p>
               <p>Jones. I did. I never offer'd any such thing as she swore to, neither was her cloaths torn as she said. I remember she was ask'd, upon that trial, if she ever knew the Leg-tavern before; she said, no, she never did; and Hunt said, upon his examination on that trial, that he had forewarn'd her of going there 20 times; and it appear'd, by Hunt's evidence, that they had liv'd together within about 8 or 10 doors of it. I was first indicted for an assault; I was bail'd and gave notice of trial; then they went and found a bill against me for an absolute rape; then I went into the country and came, I believe, the first day of sessions, and surrendered myself to the keeper of Newgate. I ran into the tap-house one morning before people were much about, fearing any body should take me. I ask'd for a pint of purl, the boy said we serve no purl but to prisoners; I said, be so good as to let me sit down; soon after came Mr. Spivey the master of the tap; then I ask'd him to let me have a pint of purl; and said, I am come to be a prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220036"/> here; he laugh'd at me; I said, I'll assure you it time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not in custody of any body there ?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, I was not. I never custody but once, then she serv'd a warrant, and then they wanted to make money of me; that is, Hunt did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hunt come to you ?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, he sent one Coleman, as Coleman told me, to see if I would make it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Spivey. The tap in Newgate belongs to me; I remember Mr. Jones's coming to surrender, it was on a morning betwixt 9 and 10 o'clock, and Mr. Akerman was acquainted with it in about an hour after, and I remember his taking his trial afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Akerman. It is impossible for me exactly to remember Mr. Jones's surrender, but I believe he did surrender.</p>
               <p>Council for the Defendants. We do allow he did voluntarily surrender.</p>

            . I was waiter at the Leg-tavern. On the 5th of October last I remember a woman that gave evidence against Mr. Jones and now stands at the bar; she came to the tavern betwixt 4 and 5 o'clock alone, and went away and soon after return'd with Mr. Jones; they went into a room facing the entry, and I was in a room, joining that room, mending some painted paper hangings. That room in which they were, had been wash'd, and the windows and door were open all the time; the woman did not stay. five minutes; they did not go away just together.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say upon oath, she did not stay in that room ten minutes with Jones.</p>

               <p>Howard. No, I did not; and I am sure if she had I should have heard her, for people can't talk any thing louder than common in that room, but they must be heard in the room where I was. When she went away I went to see where the man was, fearing they should go without paying for the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, in going away, complain of any ill usage?</p>

            . I was constable. Mr. Hunt deliver'd a warrant to me to take up Jones, sometime about September or October last; it was for a felony and rape, committed by him on Sarah Robertson. Hunt would have had him to be brought to a public-house, and said, if he'd submit and give a treat of a bowl of punch, or bottle and bird, he would endeavour to accommodate the affair. I told Jones this; but he said, he'd sooner spend 50 l. rather than submit to a villain.</p>
