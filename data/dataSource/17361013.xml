               <p>Charles Serjeant. On the 22d of September last. I was going home to Uxbridge, at the first Bridge, a little below <placeName id="t17361013-1-crimeloc3">Notting hill</placeName>

I saw People, and cried Hallo, but they presently dismounted me, one took hold of my Leg and threw me off the Horse, and the other caught me on the other side. One of them held a Hanger to my Breast, and said, if you do not hold your Tongue, I will put you to death. They led me to a Gate that opens into a Field just below the Bridge, and robbed me of 4 Guineas and a half, stripped me stark naked as I was born, and took every thing I had in the World, (Breeches and all) except my Wig, and carried me to a Tree; they spoke in French to one another, and said, Il faut que vous obeyez: Then the Prisoner put a Handkerchief cross my Mouth, and tied it on the Nape of my Neck with two hard Knots; with my Bridle they bound me to the Tree, and then left me. In this Condition I was for two Hours, but my Hands being very cold, I slipped them at last through the Bridle; so I got loose, and went to the Sign of I have brought my Hogs to a fine Market. About 7 o'Clock they stripped me, and about 9 I got to this House. The Prisoner put my Breeches on before my Face, and this Coat I have now on my Back is the same he took from me, the rest of the Things are in Court, and were all taken upon him. I swear to the Prisoner's Hair and his Tongue, for I took notice of his thick shock Head of Hair hanging over his Face, and am sure he is the Man.</p>

            . The Prisoner (and another Man) came through Rosemary. Lane with this Whip in his Hand the 23d of last Month. I said to one that was with me, that Fellow has got a good cleaver Whip, ask him if he will sell it: Yes, says the Prisoner, it is to be sold. I asked him what he would have for it; he said half a Guinea: I desired my Neighbour to bid him. D F for it, that is in the way we mark our Goods 4 s. 6 d. I am a Pawnbroker, and sell Cloaths, and so I mark my Goods. The Prisoner would not take 4 s. 6 d. so he bid him a Crown, then 6 s. and at last he allowed it us for 7 s. and a Gallon of Beer. We let them go off, but the Prisoner gave it his Companion, and he brought it back and took 6 s. and 6 d. for it. While he was brushing the Whip, I observed the Name Charles Serjeant at Uxbridge graved in a silver<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173610130003"/> Plate on the Butt End. So, says I, this Whip is stole, or somebody has been robbed, let us go down into Rag Fair and see for the Men; upon that, we went down about 30 Yards towards the Fair, and then turned back, for I was but a Servant and could not neglect my Master's Business; so these two Fellows went after them but could not find them. They were no sooner come back, but I saw the Prisoner (and the other Man) coming along with the young Man's Coat upon his Arm; the Man that lives next Door to me bought the Coat for 8 s. Tom, says I, here are the two Men, take care of them. He went to them, and said, I hear the Man that owns the Whip lives at Uxbridge, upon which the Prisoner wanted to have the Whip again; and when he had returned the Money he endeavoured to make off, but we stopped him, and he told us, if we would go with him he would shew us the Person from whom he had it. He carried us to the Bull Inn in Holborn, and there we did indeed find how he came by it, though I did not go to the Inn with him my self, but these next Witnesses, for I was but a Servant.</p>
               <p>Charles Serjeant. I swear this is the Whip which the Prisoner took from me when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Walmsley. And 'tis the very Whip he sold for 6 s. 6 d. to this Man.</p>
               <p>- Lynell. I was standing at my own Door, and the Prisoner and another Man came by with this Whip: Walmsley asked him if it was to be sold, he said yes, and gave it into my Hand; the Price, he said, was half a Guinea. I observed the Grasp to be stitch'd with Wire, so I bid him 6 s. for it, then 6 s. 6 d. he allow'd it at last for 7 s. and went 5 or 6 Doors off, and told me I should have it for 6 s. 6 d. and a Gallon of Beer; I told him I would give no more, so he sent it me by his Companion, for my own Price, and then they both went off. There was a very cleaver Horse engrav'd on the Whip, and I was shewing it to some of my Neighbours, who observed likewise the Name, Charles Serjeant at Uxbridge upon the Butt-end. About half an Hour after this, the Prisoner came up again, to sell this very Coat which the Gentleman has now upon his Back; when he had sold it, I desired to speak a Word with him: I took him in Doors and said, take your Whip again, I don't think you came honestly by it: Why, says he, I'll carry you to the Man I had it from, 'tis but upon Tower-Hill damn it says the other, what Occasion have; you to trouble your self about it? Give him his Money again, so I took my Money and return'd him the Whip: But another Person saying Mr. Serjeant's Coach came in at the Bull, we took the Prisoner thither, and asked them if Mr. Serjeant's Coach came in there; they told us it would be there in a quarter of an Hour. While we were waiting. I asked the Prisoner, if he had bought nothing but this Whip? Yes, says he, this Wastcoat which I have on, the Coat, which I have sold, and a Hat, which I gave 2 s. for, I asked him what he gave for all the rest of the Things, and he told me 8 s. When the Coach came in, we found Mr. Serjeant had been stripp'd, so we search'd the Prisoner; and the first Things we took out of his Pocket, was a Spoon, on which was wrote, Charles Serjeant, at Uxbridge, and a Knife with two Blades, and a pair of steel Snuffers I put the Prisoner into a Coach, and he was carry'd to Sir

Then I went and asked my Maid, how she could do such a Thing? and she own'd she had taken the Things mention'd in the Indictment, of Mrs. Lewis's, out of the Trunk. She confess'd she had taken a Band-box of Linnen, 3 Suits of Headcloths, and the 3 half Handkerchiefs, 3 pair of double Ruffles, 2 Girdles, and silver Buckles to them, one set with Stones, and a little Case, with a pair of gold Ear Rings. A Padesoy Gown, she own'd she took out of another Trunk; and this Confession she made while she was in the Constable's Custody. One pair of Holland Sheets, she had lent to a Neighbour, and were found on their Bed. Two Wastcoats we found at Mr. Wright's, and a bundle of Linnen, which she had taken out of the Trunks, we found under the Prisoner's Bed.

Some of the Linnen the Prisoner had cut up, some Things she had given away, which were sent me again when she was taken up. I put up in those Trunks 3 suits of laced Headcloaths, 3 pair of double Ruffles, and half Handkerchief, a pair of gold Ear Rings, 2 silver Girdles and Buckles, one of them set with Stones, a Cambrick Tucker, a silk Gown and Coat, a suit of black Padesoy, 2 Holland Sheets, 2 Pillowbiers, a Holland Shirt, and 5 Shifts, 2 Dimity Wastcoats, a Table Cloth, a Silk Apron, and a Muslin Apron, all which I miss'd out of the Trunks; she had cut the Cords, opened the Locks, and one of these Trunks I found cut at one End.</p>

After I had missed them, I was walking down the Town, and I saw this Gown through the Window: I suspected it was part of the Lining of the Camblet Curtains. This Mohair Gown I found in his Wife's Drawers, and this Skirt of a Child's Coat is the same yellow Sattin that lined the Curtains. I found some Pieces not made up; here is a Piece of a Curtain, four Breadths of Camblet a little faded; and I shall now produce a Curtain to answer it. Here is a Breadth and a half of the same Camblet, this is a Head Curtain, and here is the other: Now here is a single Breadth of the same found at his Lodging.

We took these Things out of the Prisoner's Lodging, and went before Colonel Dobbins; when we came back we searched his Sister's House, and found these two quilted Coats; one is all Crimson Mohair, and the other is Crimson Mohair paned with white Sattin, and here is a Camblet yellow Gown faced and robed with Crimson Mohair; she told us her Brother gave them to her, he was present and owned he did so. All these Things which we found on them we compared before Colonel Dobbins, with the Remainder, which Mr. Lund had in his Custody, and we took them to be the same Goods. The Prisoner told us he bought them of a Servant of the Duke's who is now dead.</p>
               <p>Lund. These Breadths of crimson Mohair I took with the Petticoats, and if you compare them with the Curtains I have brought, you will find them to be the very same.

               <p>Lund. I know nothing of that. The rest of the Servants was unacquainted with this Furniture.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Lund has entrusted me all over the Duke's House: I used to look after the Waters, and there never was laid any Thing to my Charge before.</p>
               <p>Lund. He did look after the Waters, and has been all over the House, even in the Water Closets; but I have missed these two Years a silver Tea Canister that weighs 7 oz. and the Reason he was turned out of my Lord's Service, was for a suspicion we had of his hiding himself by my Lord's Library Door, where the Maids put their Mops and Brooms, and cutting out a Pannel of the Wainscot. I had a good Opinion of him 'till then, but he was then turned off.</p>

He told us he had given his Sister what we found upon her, and that he bought them for a Guinea.

            . I thought (as how) he bought them: I asked no Questions on neither side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Those Things I bought, and if you please I will tell you how. I used to go up and down the House to fetch the Ashes away, and clean the Grate Hole in the Kitchen. A young Woman that lived there, asked me three or four times whether I was almost married, because if I was (she said) she had some things that would be of service to me, and she would sell them to me. I said no - sometimes I said I was, sometimes I was not; but however, one Day I was sitting by the Fire-side in the Garden Lodge, and this Creature brought the things to me. John, says she, I have brought the Things I was telling you about. I hope, said I, I shall not come into trouble about them. No, said she, I care not who sees them, or who hears of them, but I would not have them come to my Father's Ear. I bought them, and kept them in my Cupboard a Fortnight, and when I was turned away,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173610130006"/> they gave no Account of the Occasion why I must go; so I took these Things with me, and had this Wastcoat made, and wore them publickly, which I should not have done, if I had had any suspicion of their being stolen. My Sister asked me for a Bit to make her a Petticoat, I bid her take some, but not too much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you saw some of the Things openly in the House? (To Lund)</p>
               <p>Lund. Yes, I saw a Piece hang down towards the Window as I was passing along, and it being the House of Loyd that was convicted for stealing his Grace's Lead, I got leave to search. I asked him in the Presence of Mr. Russel, and the Constable if he had no more of the white Sattin than what we found there, and he declared to us that he bought no more than lined him a Wastcoat; but afterwards in searching we found these five Breadths, which he owned he gave his Sister.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sent a Piece by a Baker to a Woman at Totteridge, who was going to britch a a Boy.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. There is my Master Snow can speak to my Behaviour in his Service.</p>
               <p>Mr. Snow. The Prisoner came recommended to my chief Gardener from the Duke of Chandos: Mr. Hear likewise gave him a good Character. He has work'd in my Gardens three Years, has always behaved very modestly, and appears to be a laborious, honest, useful, diligent Fellow; he has had great Opportunities of being dishonest; I have Ponds of Fish, a great deal of Fruit, and he has had frequent Access to the House; when I have been in Town, he has lain in the Laundry, full of Cloaths, for the security of the House, yet I never lost any thing. I cannot think he stole these Things, because he has worn them publickly in my service; if he had stole them, surely he would have sold them or dy'd them. I think him a very honest Fellow, and useful to the Publick. If your Lordship, and the Jury shall think otherwise, I hope he may be recommended to her Majesty's Favour.</p>
               <p>Marshal. I have seen him wear the Wastcoat publickly to and from the Duke's House.</p>
               <p>Russell. I have seen him wear a handsome red Wastcoat, which I thought he might have bought in Monmouth Street; I believe it is the same that is here I cannot say I ever heard of his dishonesty before this Affair.</p>

            . On Friday Night, July 30 between 9 and 10, I was at the End of Red Lion Street, and I saw the Mob coming down Bell Yard, with Sticks and lighted Links. One of them made a sort of a speech directing the rest to go down Church Lane, to the Gentleman and Porter: My Master serving Mr. Allen who keeps the House with Drink, I ran down to inform him that his Sign was mentioned. There was about 50 or 60 of them then, and they had 2 or 3 Links with them. One read from a Paper the Signs of the Gentleman and Porter, the Bull and Butcher, and the Tavern in Well Street I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173610130008"/> not hear them make any Declaration what was to be done, but I went directly to Allen's to inform him they had great Sticks, like Stakes out of Bakers Bavins. While I was standing at Allen's Door, the Mob came down; I told them the House had been mine for a Fortnight, and that the Man who kept it before was gone. One of them was called Captain Tom the Barber, and was in a striped Banjan. I would have taken notice of him, but he turned away and would not let me see his Face. I desired him to use me favourably, and told him it was my House. They said they knew I was not Irish by my Tongue, and I should not be hurt. I made them set up Candles in the Windows, and pacify'd the Mob seemingly well, but a Woman telling them it was a sham, and that I was only the Brewer's Cooper, the Sticks flew immediately and beat the Candle out of my Hand, as I stood at the Door; but Justice Phillips coming down, and the Captain with his Soldiers, they took some of them, and the rest made off immediately, and were gone as suddenly, as if a Hole had been ready dug in the bottom of the Street, and they had all dropped into it at once.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners all declared they never saw this Evidence before.</p>
               <p>Justice Phillips. On Friday, July 30, about 10 at Night, some Neighbours came knocking at my Door in a great hurry, and told me the Mob were come out of Spittle Fields, and were pulling down some Houses; they desired my Assistance, and I told them my Assistance would be of little service, without support; reading the Proclamation will signify nothing; if you will go to the Tower, and give my service to the Governor, and desire his Assistance, I will venture my Person. They went, and the Governor, or the commanding Officer, sent 30 Men to my Door, and the Captain told me, they had Orders to go with me, and follow my Directions. I desired him that his Men might march quietly, without beat of Drum, and in the dark, and did not doubt, but with such brave Fellows, we should drive them, tho' they were a greater Number. When we came to the End of the Street, the Houses were all illuminated, and we heard a great Noise, as if they were knocking the Houses to pieces. I said to Captain Hudson, now Sir, I submit to you; if you please, command your Men into such a Disposition, as may be most proper for the securing as many of the Mob as we can. There was several hundreds attacking a House; and just over the way, there was a Baker's Shop; I apprehend they broke open this Baker's Celler, and armed themselves out of the Bavins. The Street was very light, and I could see (at a distance) the Mob beating against the Shutters with their Clubs, and could hear the Glass fly: so I said to the Captain, - now let us be upon them at once; I drew my Sword and ran to the House they were attacking, and, that Prisoner Page, I took him with his Club breaking the Windows: I could not tell whether he might not make use of it upon me, therefore I told him, if you don't surrender, I'll run you thro'. The Soldiers at the word of Command had stretched themselves into a Line, and then enclosed as many of them as they could; among the rest, the Prisoners; and the Serjeant seized them. The Prisoner Page I took my self, driving furiously at the Windows; every Pannel of the Shutters was broke but one, and all the Glass. Some were poking in with their Sticks to clear the inside, (I suppose) that they might get in. When the Soldiers had taken some of them Prisoners, the rest ran away, some one way, some another; those we had taken, were carry'd to the Watch-House, and that I might be more sure of the Prisoners, I called them over at the Watch-House, and took down their Names; then we posted 12 Soldiers with their Bayonets on their Muskets round the Watch-House, because we were apprehensive the Mob would rescue the Prisoners. After we had patroled 'till Morning, the Captain and I refresh'd ourselves at my House, and I ordered something for the Men at my Door. I am positive that the Prisoners were among the Mob, and Page I took myself in the Fact, the rest of them might be as near the House, as 'tis from hence to the Leads (before the Court.)</p>

            . On the 30th of July, I was sent for from the Tower, by a Message from Justice Phillips: The Governor ordered between 30 or 40 Men to suppress the Assembly, under the Directions of Mr. Phillips. I went with my Men to his House; he came out with us, and in our way to the place where the Riot was, we called upon another Magistrate. When we came to Lemon Street, we found a vast Number of People assembled together, and I believe there was about 8 or 10 of them were beating with Clubs against the front of the House of one Aikin: I cannot say I heard any particular cries; the Prisoner Page I am positive was one, but I cannot be so sure, with regard to either of the other. As they were beating against the front of the House, Mr. Phillips and I, at the front of our Men, with our Swords drawn, struck at one or two of them, and two or three of those who were attacking the House we seized immediately.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173610130009"/> Mr. Phillips and I were close to one another, and when we had struck among them, our Men instantly follow'd; I cannot be positive to the Faces of any but Page, tho' we made 8 or 9 Prisoners in the Watch House. I went with Mr. Phillips to the Watch House, but I can't take upon Me to say positively the other Prisoners are the Men. After this, we went and clear'd the Street, and left a Corporal and 10 or 12 Men to guard the Watch House till the next Morning.</p>

I was present in Lemon-street, and I heard the Noise of their beating against the Windows, tho' I saw but little of the Mischief 'till the Mob had done; then I saw the Shutters of the Windows were broke to pieces: I was as near as the rest, under the Command, and was going along the middle of the Street.

               <p>Q. Did you hear any Cries and Noise made?</p>
               <p>Barnes. I cannot remember particular Persons nor Words: I was indeed at the taking of Orman Rod; he was cut in the Head, and was then very much disguised with his own Blood.

I, and the last Man examined, brought him to the Watch House, and Mr. Justice Phillips was there when we delivered him in, and he saw him and all the rest of the Men that we took Prisoners, but I cannot swear to their Faces. I remember I took Orman Rod out of the Mob, and that either my Captain or Mr. Phillips cut him over the Head: he was within 4 or 5 Yards of the Door, but I did not see him strike, nor did I see any thing in his Hand; he desired us to let him go, and we told him we could not.

             I was under the Command of Capt. Hudson at that time; we went from the Tower to Mr. Phillips's House, from thence to the End of Lemon Street. I heard no Cry, but there was about 40 or 50 People in the Mob.</p>

Sometime after this, I heard they were coming back to my House; my Wife was very much<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173610130010"/> frighted, and begged me to get out. I told her I would stay, but she insisting upon my leaving the House, I went out, and heard the Mob at Mr. Allens; I went thither, and heard them cry, Down with the Irish - down with the Irish; I saw them breaking Allen's Windows, and raking in the Kennel, I suppose for Stones, but I cannot say I saw them take any up. Then I heard them enquire for my House, a Woman directed them to it, and they fell immediately upon it. I believe there might be above a hundred People; they broke my Windows and Shutters with their great Clubs, but Capt. Hudson and Justice Phillips came in a very little time to my relief, and I was afraid to get in among them, lest some body should shew me to the Mob, as they had done my House.</p>
               <p>Page's Defence, My Sister being at my Fathers that Night, I went to see her home; we met the Mob, and while I stood looking on I was taken hold of.</p>
               <p>Alice Corner. I know nothing of this matter, nor where he was that Night; but I have known him from a Child, and never heard or saw any harm of him.</p>
               <p>- Brown. I saw Page that Night standing in Mill Yard looking on; there was a great Noise, and I said, Bob, what do you do here? he told me he was going home presently; this was a quarter past 11 at Night, and in a quarter of an Hour afterwards, I heard he was taken up. I have known him from a Child, he is a very honest Lad as ever I knew in my Days.</p>

On the 30th of July I was at home; my Wife was gone to bed with my Godchild, and I was undrest and in my Shirt when the Noise came down the Alley. I open'd my Window and look'd out, and heard them knocking at the next House. Hall and Kelly cry'd out, d - n ye that is not the House, and then they came to my House; I had a Candle in my Hand, and saw that Page and Kelley were the first that attack'd my Windows with their Clubs: Kelly's Wife open'd her Door, gave them a Candle, and cry'd d - n them, have their Heart's Blood. I was at the Window with a Candle in my Hand, and saw the Prisoner break my Windows, and the middle Pannel of the Door. When the Door was broke, I thought it high time to get away; so I open'd a back Casement, and got out in my Shirt from the first Story. I said to my Wife, you can't get out, you must be at their Mercy. I had no sooner spoke, but a Board was thrown in, which hit her on the Thigh, I jump'd out of the Window into the Hog Yard, and heard the Mob crying d - n it, which are Irish Houses? A Farrier let me thro' the Yard, and I went down in my Shirt towards Sullivan's: Fearing I should be known, I came back to the Farrier's, and got to my back Window, and my Wife threw me out something to cover me. While Page was beating against the House, I heard him cry out, d - n it, - more Help, more Help; and they did not leave me one whole Pane of Glass in my Windows, tho' I call'd out to Page - pray young Man forbear, - I ask your Pardon - I don't hurt any Body. <rs id="t17361013-5-verdict29" type="verdictDescription">

I left the House to their Mercy, (for my Wife was out at a Woman's Labour) and they stole and broke every Thing I had. I staid in the House, 'till the Shutters and Glass all flew in together.

Six of my Shutters were broke, and 70 odd Panes of Glass, which Damage cost me 3 l. 13 s. to repair. I can't say I saw any of them.</p>

               <p>William Chapman, September 27, about 11 at Night I stood up to make Water in Well-close Square. The Prisoner called out for some body, and I said, Hollo. I struck into the Road, she followed me, and we walked together to Shadwell Church, there she asked me for a Pint of Beer. We went into a House and had a Pint of Beer; then we went to <placeName id="t17361013-14-crimeloc76">Shadwell Mar</placeName>

She made a Noise, and up came 2 Men, and then she scolded and called me Names; I collar'd one, but he got from me, and they both ran away. Then I carried her up Market Hill, and at the White Lyon Tavern Back Door, she said she wanted to tie her Garter, and there I suppose she dropped my Watch, for there it was found the next Morning.</p>

            . September 29, I was going to work about six in the Morning, and at the Back Door of the White Lyon, on a Heap of Ashes I found this Watch. The Prosecutor had the Creature before the Justice, and charged her with taking his Watch; my Master hearing this, and knowing I had found one, he went and told the Justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He had me before the Justice; no, I went voluntary my self, - O ye vile Rogue! I met him in Well-close Square, where are you going, says he? What's that to you, says I, don't be so sulky, says he. I told him if he went on, he'd meet somebody to his Mind: but going along we came to an Alehouse, where there were Curtains to the Windows, so he made me drink part of a Pint there. When we came out, he haul'd me down Sun Tavern Fields, I asked him what he was going to do; and being a'lone Woman he haul'd me cross the Kennel, and got me down on the Steps, and said, d - n ye, if you squal I'll give you a good Knock: After<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173610130013"/> this we went to Shadwell Market, and there he wanted to have me again upon the Stalls; he did pull up my Petticoats quite over my Head, but 2 Men coming up, God bless you, says I to them, for coming, and then he charged me with taking his Watch.</p>

             I was at this Tryal at Guildhall, and remember Chapman's being a Witness there: He swore it was Christmas 1722. I never heard either Christmas Day, or the twenty fifth of December mention'd; but only Christmass 22. I know Mr. Tyson did abscond, and did commit Acts of Bankruptcy: I have heard him order Chapman to deny him to his Creditors, many Times before this Christmass, and several Times before my Face. I have been at his House when People have enquired for him, and he has deny'd him; and I have gone through them all, and found him above Stairs. I know he did not care to trust any body to deny him, but Chapman. As to Myat's Name, which they have sworn to, I don't remember I heard it once mention'd: There was Hopegood and How I think I remember mention'd upon the Tryal. I have known Chapman from a Boy, he was always a very honest just Servant; he liv'd with Captain Cleland, and since that he has been a Tenant under me, and I believe he would no more forswear himself, than I would</p>
               <p>Mr. Cotton. I was at the Tryal, and remember what Chapman swore; it was, about Christmass 1722 he had such Orders from Tyson. I don't remember Myat's Name was ever mention'd. I had a List of Tyson's Creditors, and I think there was no such Name among them.</p>
               <p>Mr. How. I know Mr. Tyson, - I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173610130016"/> reason to know him, he owes me 95 l. upon Bond. About Christmass 22, I was many Times to see after my Money Chapman used to deny him, but I have staid after that, and have seen him go out in Disguise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Linton. I was at Tyson's at Christmass, 1722, for Money, Chapman has deny'd him, and I have afterwards seen him go out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilkinson. Mr. Chapman on the Trial mention'd no particular Day. he only said about Christmass 1722. I believe him to be as honest a Man as lives, and that he would not forswear himself for the Universe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fleming. I went down that very Christmass to Woolvaston Hall with Mr. Tyson; I cannot be sure whether it was Christmas Day or the Day after; but it could not be before Christmass, because I remember all the Shops were shut up. I waited two Hours at the Man in the Moon at White-chappel for him: At last he came, in a mighty Hurry, We whipt into a higher Chariot, and away we went, no Creature with us. I have known Chapman sixteen Years, an honest Man, and don't believe he'd forswear himself.</p>
               <p>Sir Caesar Child: Mr. Tyson that Christmass was to have call'd upon us, at Woodford Bridge, and we were all to have gone into Suffolk together; but he sent us Word we must set out before him, and he would meet us at the King's Head at Colchester, but he did not come, and we went down to Woolvaston, and Tyson came down a Day or two after, and this Gentleman was with him. <rs id="t17361013-27-verdict133" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Thamar Trantum. I only desire to be clear'd of him, I never bedded with him, and have nothing to do with him. His first Wife own'd she was marry'd to him; and took her Oath of it before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Another Witness. I was at Thamar Trantam's Wedding with the Prisoner Smart. She was marry'd to him the twenty ninth of August. I never saw the first Wife 'till Yesterday; and then she was carried away from us by Force.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought the Parson that marry'd them?</p>
               <p>Witness. No But I will go and see if I can get him, his Name is Gainham, a Fleet Parson.</p>
               <p>Dr. Gainham. They have a Certificate of this Marriage, but it is none of mine: Mrs. Ball gave it them, but I marry'd them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the Prisoner and this Woman?</p>
               <p>Gainham I don't remember Faces, 'tis impossible, quite impossible I should remember Faces. I know I married two People by those Names.</p>
               <p>Q. do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Gainham. I don't remember his Face; but here is my Register.</p>
               <p>Q. What Register is that?</p>
               <p>Gainham. 'Tis my Register; a Register of all the People I marry; and as fair a Register as any in England, of all the People that are married by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a Parish Register?</p>
               <p>Gainham. No, 'tis my own private Register.</p>
               <p>Q. What, do you keep a private Register; where do you live?</p>
               <p>Gainham. In St. Bride's Parish.</p>
               <p>Q. And where do you marry People?</p>
               <p>Gainham. In several Houses.</p>
               <p>Q. And not in the Church?</p>
               <p>Gainham. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you Licences when you marry?</p>
               <p>Gainham. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And are you not ashamed to scandalize your Character?</p>
               <p>Gainham. I do not chuse it; but I am old, and infirm, and am not able to get any Preferment.</p>
               <p>Q. And will you commit Crimes because you cannot get Preferment? Does your Conscience teach you that?</p>
               <p>Gainham. I do not chuse it, my Lord - but -</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about John Smart?</p>
               <p>Gainham. (Reading) On the fifteenth of May, one thousand seven hundred and thirty three, I married John Smart, Drummer of the first Regiment of Foot Guards, to Elizabeth Colt, Spinster.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you always marry People by their right Names?</p>
               <p>Gainham. Yes, by their true Names. They always give me their Names; and if they go and take out Licences, they tell their Names themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know you act contrary to the Canons of the Church? Do you know whether the Prisoner is the Man you married?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173610130017"/>Gainham. No, on my Oath, I cannot remember. Mrs. Ball who gave the Certificate, was present at the Marriage, but she would not come.</p>
               <p>Q. The Name being in the Book is no Evidence, if you don't know the Man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Kirby. The Morning after our House was broke, which was Sunday Morning between eight and nine, a Servant came to my Chamber, and told me my Cellar Door was broke open, and the Cellar had been robb'd. I went down, and found the Plank of the Cellar Window had been forced open, under my dwelling House. I went down to see what I had lost; and I miss'd about a hundred and twenty Pounds of cut Tobacco; and there was a Train of Tobacco from the Place whence it was taken to the uppermost Stair. I was inform'd that some Tobacco of the same Cut had been spill'd in Old-bedlam: I follow'd the Train, and found it was Tobacco of the same Cut, with that I had lost. I did not care to make an Alarm; but in the dusk of the Evening I went to the Beadle, and asked how many Turnings or Passages there were out of Old Bedlam? He told me there were but Four. I desired him to get me four Watchmen; and these four Watchmen I planted, one at every Passage: And in about half an Hour after they were set, the Prisoner was taken with a Bag of Tobacco on his Back.

            , Beadle. On Sunday after Church was done, Mr. Kirby sent for me, and desired me to get him four or five Watchmen; I told him I could not tell whether I could or not. But about six he came to me and I got him four Watchmen, and supplanted them in Old Bedlam; one at every Turning; none could pass but they must see them. This was half an Hour after eight, and in half an Hour, or three quarters after they were set, this Fellow came by with a Bag upon his Back; one of the Watchmen let him pass, 'till he came pretty near to another, then they took him, and sent for me; I brought the Constable with me, and the Prisoner is the same Man, that was then taken with the Goods upon him.</p>

We asked him how he came by it; he gave us but a very slender Account of the Matter; he had very little to say; all we could get from him, was, that two Men met him, and gave him a Shilling to carry it for them to St. Catherine's; but he said afterwards he was to carry it to Petticoat Lane; he was in two or three Stories about it. When he was taken, there were two Men with him, and he called out to one of them - Will, Will, take care of my Hat. We judged the Tobacco had been stole, so we secured him in the Compter that Night, and next Morning had him before the Lord Mayor. We had a Warrant after this to search the House of

            . Saturday will be a Fortnight, I made the Cellar fast; I locked it, and it was secure about six o'Clock in the Evening, when it began to be duskish. Between seven and eight the next Morning I got up, and found the Cellar Window broke open; it was Sabbath Day Morning, and had been light some time. I acquainted my Master that the Cellar was broke open; we went down, and found we had lost Tobacco out of a Hogshead, and that it had been spilled in the Cellar, and all up the Stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Tobacco you saw on the Prisoner, your Master's?</p>
               <p>Blood. It was exactly the same Cut, and very much like his Tobacco. I did not see it until I came before the Lord Mayor; and I do not remember that the Prisoner owned then, that the Tobacco that was produced against him was the same that was taken upon him.</p>
               <p>Thompson again. I took the Tobacco from the Prisoner; I seized it on his Shoulder, and the Constable shewed it to this last Witness. It was the same Tobacco we found upon him, and the same that was shewed upon Mr. Kirby's Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Blood.) Do you believe that Tobacco to be your Master's?</p>
               <p>Blood. To the best of my Thoughts, it is. It is the same Cut, and is very much like it; nothing can be more like it - nothing in the World. We have not brought the Parcel we took on the Prisoner, but we have brought Samples of both, and any body that has any Judgment in the Goods, on comparing them together, will think as I do. I was but the Day before cutting and sifting this very Tobacco, and I do look upon it to be my Master's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>On Sunday I went over to Old Street, (I live in White Chappel,) about setting up a Pair of Grates, and the People I went to asked me to stay and dine with them; I staid there until seven or eight of the Clock at Night; and as I was going over Moor-fields towards where I live, I over took two Men, and they said they would give me a Shilling to carry their Bag to the Water-side, in order to their putting it on board a Ship. They appeared like Sailors, and I, thinking no harm, took it, and one of them carried my Hat; so going through Bedlam, I was stopped by these Men.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Witnesses?</p>

            . The Prisoner lodged in my House, about a Week; and while my Wife and I were out, she took that Opportunity to take out Key, and rob us of the Plates and the Bed-screw. They were found upon her. This Woman took the Bed-screw from under her Petticoats. When I saw it, I asked her how she came by it, and she said it was none of mine, I had nothing to do with it: Well says I, how you got the Key of the Door I know not, but I will enquire: Upon this she went down into the Cellar, and two of the Plates dropped from her: I heard them fall, and so I followed her, and found two more dropped down the House of Office.</p>

            . I took the Bed-screw from under her Petticoats, it was thrust under the String that ty'd them. When we had taken this, she went down Stairs into the Cellar, and dropp'd two Plates upon the Stairs, I saw her pull two more out of her Bosom, and two more she dropped down the Vault. I saw her pull the Plates out of her Bosom upon the Stairs.</p>

               <p>I was at a stand, being just come out of St. Martin's Workhouse. That Samuel Pate letts two-penny Lodgings, and entertains Black-shoe-fellows, and sells Drams. I own I had drank three or four Drams, and if I had the Bed-screw, it was unknown to me. How the Plates came there I do not know, I never handled them. That Woman, King, used to be there, and the House used to be full of People, Men and Women, all lie together in the same Room. I happened to say something he did not like - O ye B - h, says he, I will stick upon your Skirts. I have no Friends but God and my self. <rs id="t17361013-33-verdict153" type="verdictDescription">
