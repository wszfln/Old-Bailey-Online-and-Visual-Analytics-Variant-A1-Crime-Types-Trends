I am manager of the Albert Hotel—on April 15th the barmaid spoke down the tube—I went up, and she gave me this five-shilling piece—I went out without speaking to the prisoner, and' got a constable—I asked the prisoner if it was the coin—he said "Yes," and I gave him in custody—he then tendered a shilling, and I gave him a six-pence and fourpence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at East Dulwich—I am a marine insurance underwriter—up to March 1897, I carried on business at 9, Gracechurch Street, under the style of John Thorn and Company, marine insurance brokers and underwriters—that business was very successful—in 1894 I became connected with a patent for tile making, and went into a partnership in the name of the Self-Lock Roofing and Tile Company, and carried on that business till the beginning of 1897—it was made into a limited liability com<lb/>pany—in 1896 I became embarrassed financially through it, in con<lb/>sequence of which I advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> for a partner with capital—in answer to which I received a letter from J.

               <p>by the wish of the Limited Company then formed, to be kept distinct in the books—I drew additional bills upon Agnew in September, 1896, and March, 1897, which he accepted in the same way, and which I have discounted with my bankers and other people—they amount altogether to about £20,000 face value—half the proceeds were remitted to him—these proceeds were always sent through Blumeuthal—the amounts were always fixed by Leon—they were written on pieces of paper given to me, or to my clerk Butler, or communicated through the telephone—they were always for odd amounts, except two bills for £1,000 in December, 1896, in favour of Mr. Hockey—these five receipts (<hi rend="italic">found among the papers at Blumenthal and Co.'s</hi>) are receipts to Blumenthal, who sent his receipts to me—they appear to be for half the proceeds of the bills—at maturity I provided my half of the bills—so that they were met up to March, 1897—after that I was unable to provide any more—neither did Agnew—the bills then current were dishonoured—Blumenthal and Co. introduced me to four or five other firms—in October or November, 1896, I gave them the second commission—among those firms were Freedom, Son and Co., who, I was told, were very large merchants, with stock worth over £20,000, and doing a very good business—another was Dewhurst and Co.—I paid Leon and Co. £200 in respect of each—they are all bankrupt—upon them I drew bills, which were accepted in the same way, for amounts with odd shillings and pence—no goods were supplied except the six machines to Agnew—I asked him, upon his intro<lb/>ducing other firms, what I should say to the bankers if they should put the question what the bills were for—he said I was to say the bills were in the ordinary course of business, but he said, "Do not say they are trade bills"—he did not explain the difference—outside Agnew, the total would not be more than £2,400, if so much—I always sent the half proceeds through Blumenthal and Co.—about October, 1896, the National bank said they would rather the bills would run off before they took any more—I told Leon of that, and he said, "You must open another bank, in order to discount your bills"—he mentioned other banks—amongst them Armstrong's—in consequence of which I opened an account with that bank in the City—I discounted bills with Armstrong's from October, 1896, to February, 1897—in December, 1896, when they had two bills of Agnew's, they wanted to wait till the bills had run off—then, at Leon's suggestion, I opened an account with Brown, Jansen and Co., and trans<lb/>ferred, I think, the whole of my balance from Armstrong's to them, £1,532—that was the proceeds of discounting bills and moneys I had received—I then discounted bills with Brown, Jansen and Co.—one bill was accepted by Freedom and Son, one by Agnew, and two by Dewhurst—Mr. Cooper, of Jansen's, asked me about a bill of Agnew's and a bill of Freedom's, and I told him I had a contract for 100 machines, and the bills were to be drawn against that, and others were drawn in the ordinary course of business—these five bills (Exhibits 32 to 36) I dis<lb/>counted with Mr. Salton and Mr. Noad—in remitting the half proceeds Leon told me not to insert the name of Blumenthal in the cheques, because the banks might easily trace where they came from, and the nature of the transactions that led to them, but to insert the name of my clerk, Butler, or my lady clerk, Boston—I wrote one cheque to Blumenthal and Co., and it was returned to me—all other cheques I made payable to Butler</p>

I am an accountants clerk—I now live at Fulham—up to July, 1895, I carried on business as an asbestos manu<lb/>facturer, at St. Leonard's Works, Bromley-by-Bow—in 1894 I was interested in a patent which led to embarrassment—in October, 1894, I called at 19, Broad Street Avenue, and saw Blumenthal—we conversed about the patent, and he said he did not care about patents, but he would see his partner, Mr. Leon"—I called again within a day or two, and saw both defendants—Leon said if on inquiry they found matters satis<lb/>factory they would be able to introduce me to a friend to draw bills on mutual terms—each party was to take half the proceeds—I was to pay £25 for each introduction—upon his asking me I told him I banked at the National Bank—I showed him my pass book—Leon looked at it, and said it was satisfactory—I then signed this commission note:—"St. Leonard's Asbestos Works, Bromley-by-Bow, R, October 25th, 1894—Messrs. J. Blumenthal and Co., London—Dear Sir,—We hereby agree to pay to you £25 sterling commission as a consideration for introducing to us a firm who would discount either our own acceptance or otherwise assist us financially, and such payment shall be in full discharge of all future transactions with such firm.

Grant for £110, and one in favour of F. Barnett for £155—I also got cheques from Grant and Barnett, which I cashed at Grant's bank—with those proceeds I opened an account at the North-Western Bank at Liverpool—Leon introduced me to Barnett as a bill discounter I believe—I saw Grant at the hotel with Leon—he was the secretary of the Globe Furnishing Company in Liverpool—then bills were put forward for discounting—one of December 4th for £157 8s. 6d.—the usual course was pursued—I wrote this letter from Blumenthal's office forwarding cheque for £77 14s. 3d. and acknowledging acceptance—the cheque was drawn in the name of Payne—the bill was dishonoured at maturity—on December 5th, 1894, I paid Blumenthal and Co. further commissions for introductions to other firms—bills were drawn, accepted, and dishonoured to the extent of £5,000—I paid Blumenthal and Co. altogether for commissions £750 or £800, including £100 in Glasgow—bills of two firms were met out of about a dozen firms to whom they introduced me, and I had to go into the Bank<lb/>ruptcy Court.</p>

               <p>and we could draw or accept bills and divide the proceeds between the drawer and the acceptor, at the time of discount, who could fail three days before the maturity of the bill—I was surprised at the suggestion and was rather diffident about doing it, but he assured me there was no danger, that it was quite safe in every respect, and quite a common thing to be done—I accepted that statement and signed this commission note of January 1sf, 1894. agreeing to pay £25 for the introduction—on January 4th I received this letter from Blumenthal and Co. (<hi rend="italic">suggesting a firm in Liverpool</hi>)—after further correspondence, Leon called upon me in Liverpool—he produced bills on Hutchinsons, of Dundee, which he asked me to accept and said Hutchinsons would get them discounted and remit half the proceeds—I made inquiries through a trade society—Hutchinsons were reported to be people of good standing—I believed the statements and accepted two bills prepared by Leon which were discounted by Hutchinson in Dundee—at the same time I drew two other bills on Brock and Son, of Bristol, who accepted them and they were discounted—Leon said he had to be careful in recommending not to mention the full amount as the bank might think they were not good for £1,000—Leon came several times—I was extremely uneasy and spoke to him about it—he said if inquiries were made by the bank, I was to say they were trade bills—I arranged with both the defendants, who suggested I should make the cheques payable in other names, so that they should not be traced by the bank—Leon gave me the name of L. Boston—I discounted bills drawn and accepted in this way with the North Western Bank at Liverpool, and with the Mold branch of the National and Provincial Bank—in all Leon and Blumenthal introduced about twenty-five names for me to draw upon—bills were in this way put in circulation to the amount of about £50,000—the bills were paid in in the ordinary way as trade bills—I signed these agreements and paid in com<lb/>missions £12 10s., £50, and the various amounts stated for introductions to customers—I had one transaction with Pringle, in which the solicitor was pressing Pringle to return bills which he had obtained from me—I had accepted them, and the proceeds had not been remitted to me—I ascertained they had gone to Barnett and Co., of Liverpool—Canning Street, I think—who had stuck to them—among the bills I discounted I was one for £258 16s., accepted by W. J. Waddell in the spring of 1895; one was accepted by Brock and Son, to which my letter to Blumenthal and Co., of February 1st, 1894, refers in which I state: "We beg now to hand you cheque value £202 9s. 6d. and £67 6s. 6d., two £100 notes, postal order payable J.

We prefer not to pass it through our bank, as they might know your business, and it would not suit any of us. Please ask B. and Son to send receipt for this"—that was the half proceeds which I was sending to Blumenthal and Co.—"One cheque is your own" refers to a cheque they had sent me in another transaction which I returned in this—the bills referred to were for £483 4s. 6d. and £484 7s. 6d.—the average discount is 5 per cent, but for a good trade bill 3 1/2 per cent.—these seven bills were some which I discounted at the "Mold branch of the National Provincial</p>

Grant was the chairman, and subsequently Leon and Blumenthal became liquidators in April, 1895—the members of the company were the names of the wives and daughters and so on of the defendants—Agnew was the first brought into communication with S. Grant, Limited—the earlier agreements were with S. Grant, Limited—there is no trace of the sale of more than six machines by Burckhardt to Agnew—there is a lot of correspondence with Blumenthal and Co., a statement of Agnew's affairs in bankruptcy showing the amount outstanding at the date of his failure to be over £44,500—from the exhibits I find Agnew's payments</p>

               <p>for commission to S. Grant, Limited, and Blumethal and Co., increased from £25, to £200, £300, and up to £1,000, on 3rd December, 1896—the correspondence included the names of Agnew, Cliff, Burden, F. Barnett, Thrutchley Bros., and others—Agnew is financed to the extent of £20,000—the Mineral Estates Corporation, which went into liquida<lb/>tion, had transactions with Blumenthal and Co. to the amount of £130,000 in bills—Blumenthal was an undischarged bankrupt—Agnew banked at the Clydesdale Bank—Mr. Thompson was their agent at Wishaw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and joiner, of 13, Caledonian Street, King's Cross—on the evening of April 11th I was in the Lord Keith—I called for some refreshment—there was nobody in the bar then, but when I got the refreshment I was hustled by two men—one man is undergoing sentence, and the prisoner is the other—my watch chain was broken by Price (<hi rend="italic">See April Sessions, page</hi> 445)—I did not want any bother and left the house walking with my stick under my arm—I had not gone far, when I was hit on the head with a stick, and my eye was cut open—I did not loose consciousness directly—the prisoner sat on my legs—the last things I remember is the prisoner wrenching the stick from me and he kicked me—I recognise his face as that of the man I saw in the public-house—I went to the Police-station, and reported the case—I lost my watch and chain and stick, and about 1s. 10d. in cash—when I got up there was not a soul near—I next saw the prisoner on May 6th at John Street-station, and identified him from five other men—I recognised him at once—I now say he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was certain on that night—I don't think I said when I identified him, "I could almost swear to him"—I can swear he is one of the men who was there—he robbed me of my stick—I wear glasses occasionally—my sight is defective—I can read and work without glasses I did not have them on in the public-house, or when the struggle took pace—I had never seen the prisoner before to my knowledge—there was nothing particular by which I could describe him—the only description I could give was that he was much shorter that 5 feet 10 ins., and that he had a small moustache—the struggle did not last more than two or three minutes—I was partially unconscious—there was only the prisoner, and Price and myself—Price was arrested the same night and tried here.</p>

I am staying at present at Stockwell Park Road—on April 21st I was a little the worse for drink—early in that morning I was in the Euston Road—Kate Watson was with me—a man suddenly made a snatch at my chain—I don't know who it was—I found my hand was cut—I buttoned up my coat, and had hardly recovered when the prisoner rushed across from the other side of the road and cried out, "Who has got it" and tried to put his hand inside my waistcoat—I held.</p>

I live at 12, Nelson's Place, Broad Street, Blooms<lb/>bury, and am the wife of John Watson—on the night of April 21st I was in the Euston Road with the prosecutor—there were six men, and one in a light coat took the gentleman by the throat and said, "You are the one I want"—he gave me a blow on the right side of my head and took a ring off my finger—my little girl screamed out, "Mamma, are you hurt?"—the police came up—I cannot say if the prisoner was one of the men.</p>

About 1.40 on the night of April 22nd I was with Saxby in the Euston Road—I heard cries of "Police"—we ran in the direction, and saw Adams and the prisoner and a third man struggling in the road—somebody called out, "Halloa! police!"—they ran away, but left Adams and the prisoner struggling together—I asked Adams what was the matter—something was said, and I followed the prisoner, who had rejoined the other three—I told them that they had stolen a watch-chain, and asked them if they would come to the station with me; they said they would—in Charlton Street the prisoner got behind—he said, "All right, governor, I am only going to make water"—he ran down the passage—I caught him and brought him back—he became very violent; he knocked ray helmet off, and struck me on my face—two of the other men got away—I detained this one—another constable came up and took Greary to the station, and both were charged—I picked up a bar of a chain near where the struggle took place—one of men wore a light brown overcoat; he got away.</p>

Greary said he would go as a witness for me. He came down voluntarily, and they put him in the dock, and charged him.</p>

Dyae—I received this order for twelve bedsteads, giving as a reference R. H. Vosper, 9, Mincing Lane—I wrote to Vosper, from whom I got this reply on paper with a telegraphic address, "Defia, London," that transactions had been entirely satisfactory—I supplied the goods—I received this acknowledgment of September 5th, 1896, and a further order, which I did not execute—I next got a letter pressing us to deliver—I replied that our usual custom on first transactions was to ask for a cheque before sending the goods, but we had made an exception in their case, and asking for a remittance—the answer was Dyas and Co.'s letter, stating that they had given us a reference, and expected usual terms—I never was paid—I never saw the goods again—£11 11s. 2d. was the trade price, including carriage.</p>

I live at 21, Dartnell Road, Camber well—I am not in employment—I was engaged by Wilkinson as clerk in November last at 25s. a week, at 26, Pilgrim Street—it was a bicycle-riding school—I was afterwards salesman and bicycle instructor—I was only there a month—I think the business would have been prosperous—I afterwards wrote letters at Three Tuns Passage at his dictation to business firms in London and the country—bicycles and bicycle frames, and one or two odds and ends came to Three Tuns Passage—I saw no books—I wrote this letter signed "Brown, Williams and Co.," because Wilkinson asked me to put that name—Brown is not meant for me—I do not know who was trading as Brown, Williams and Co.—I did not ask, I did what he asked me—I I have seen Wilkinson at the Ship public-house at the corner of Three Tuns Passage, and at Paternoster Square or Ivy Lane—I think I saw A. W. Wilson with him once or twice—I have seen Hugh Wilson two or three times since the case came on, not before—I saw him with his father outside the public-house—I have seen Fieth come into the Ship about eleven o'clock and hurry out—I have seen him with Wilkinson on two or three occasions—I have seen Hanik, I could not say where—I saw no shipping business at Wilkinson's office—there was not much business when I was there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Serjeant, N.</hi>) On February 21st, I saw Fieth at Syden<lb/>ham—I told him I was a Serjeant of police, and asked him if his name was Fieth—he said "Yes"—I said I held a warrant for his arrest, and read it to him—he said, "I am not guilty. I have not conspired with anyone. It is only a debt"—the warrant charged him with conspiring with others—he said, "I had the relish, and sold it at a profit"—on the way to the station he said, "I know Wilkinson, I suppose you want him. I insured his life. He asked me if I could do with some relish, and I said, 'Yes.' I have been to his office in Three Tuns Passage. I have been to Wilson's office. I insured his life. I have never had any other dealings with him"—in answer to the charge he said. "I have never conspired with anyone"—I searched his rooms at 52, Fairlawn Park—I found two bottles of "Per<lb/>fection Relish," and a quantity of papers, including bill-heads of A. W. Wilson, 13, Carysfort Road; of the Acme Novelty Company, and R. H. Vosper, 24, Miranda Road; a card of W. Wilkinson, Three Tuns Passage; memorandum of J. Fisher and Co., 6, Foster Lane, and 52, Fairlawn Park; a Police-court summons against Fisher, of 52, Fairlawn Park, for gas; bill-heads of C. A. Marni, of Stone Avenue, Loughborough, and H.

Who are they that I conspired with?"—I said, "Wilkinson, Wilkins, Vosper, and others"—he replied, "Wilkinson is the biggest thief in London, and ought to get fourteen years. Vosper is a <hi rend="italic">mug</hi>, like me. What was it you said we got?"—I said, "Bedsteads, tea, and Treman's cigara. The tea was from Mincing Lane"—he said, "Wilson sold the tea to Crisp's.

When I was separated from my wife I went home with him to 13, Carysfort Road, as a lodger. My references were all right, and he knew it, and got the tea and sold it to Crisp's.

                  <hi rend="italic">not a penny had gone into his pocket; for the different firms he repre<lb/>sented orders were given and inquiries made through trade societies. A. W. Wilson, in his defence, denied any conspiracy; his were only business debts; his object was to sell to the best houses; bills had been picked out, omitting those where he had sold at a profit in London, Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh, and other places; that Vosper travelled with him on commission, and made up his books and did his correspondence in the evening; that he worked from</hi> 9 <hi rend="italic">a.m. till</hi> 10.30 <hi rend="italic">p.m. at the shop, the girls he employed leaving at</hi> 8; <hi rend="italic">and that he was fortunate to get so roomy a place at so little money; that family illness and the death of his eldest girl kept him absent some time. The prisoner here broke down, but later on, continuing, he said that he took a house at</hi> £42 <hi rend="italic">to let off, but could not let it though he advertised; that he made special designs for Jubilee trays and goods, and could show his customers' prices and the manufacturer's charges, and his receipts were with his papers; that he could not keep up his payments through misfortunes, but he could recoup all if he had his liberty. Fieth, in his defence, said that he met with Wilkinson through applying to him on behalf of an insurance company and insuring his life, when Wilkinson introduced goods which he tried to sell at a profit, but was a loser, and so was unable to pay; that he got Marni's card through seeking him to collect money; that Vosper gave him the card of his firm; that there were no papers found or anything to connect him with the prisoners; that it was not criminal to call at Wilson's place once, and he had no reason to think he was not doing a legitimate business; that the sauce was not properly packed, and proved a loss; that he won in a situation as town traveller till arrested, but he never took an order from the other prisoners nor was guilty of conspiracy with them; that he was a German master, and had been a private tutor at the Royal Armoury and Staff Institution at</hi> 39, <hi rend="italic">Lombard Street; that his bankruptcy proceedings in</hi> 1894 <hi rend="italic">were dismissed by a pay<lb/>ment; and there was nothing against his name; that he had a good order from a shipowner, by which he hoped to liquidate his debts, retrieve his lost credit and his health, if he could return home to his wife and little ones, who were in danger of being sent into the world branded with their father's criminality. Hanik stated that he was a naturalised Englishman, and had had a good business, and was once a churchwarden in Aldersgate; that four of the prisoners were unknown to him; that Wilkinson came for orders, and he gave him one for sauce; that his goods were spoiled through the water coming in; that his partner (Cook) gave the order for the curry powder; that he was engaged by Crisp and Co. to look afar their stores, and the name Firth was a printer's error, which he corrected with the pen as he used his bills; that he had never swindled anybody; that the only one of the prisoners he knew was Wilkinson, and he wished he had never seen him; and that he had twenty-seven years' good character. Wilkins stated that having separated from his wife he accepted Wilson's invitation to live at Stoke Newington; the Ty<lb/>pan tea was a trade name, and meant master tea, which he sold in addition to his connections with the wine, cigar, and home and Colonial trades; that at the time he opened his account with</hi>, £10 <hi rend="italic">at the Economic flank he had a country cheque, which was taken to the Cheque flank for convenience; that he travelled on commission, and had endeavoured to do legitimate</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">business, and all the firms dealt with made inquiries; that he had nothing to do with Halliford Street or Rushmore Road, and was only connected with Wilson through giving an order for Lascila coffee, which was bad, and therefore a failure; that he had never met Wilkinson since</hi> 1896, <hi rend="italic">and that connection only lasted three weeks, and lie generally denied the conspiracy to defraud.</hi>

I was an inmate of the Strand Union Workhouse at Edmonton—I have left there now—I have known the prisoner about fourteen years—I was at 9, Dyott Street the whole time he was employed there—Miss Byrne was the landlady—I remember a man named Taylor being there as day deputy—I was employed in the kitchen at the work-house and the prisoner was employed in the same way as I was from April 13th to 17th—he has frequently talked about Miss Byrne during the last two years, and since he left Dyott Street—on April 11th he showed me a letter, and I told him he had better not send it, because of the language—I read it—it was in ink—it was addressed to Miss Byrne—it was not an indecent letter, it was saying that he would come and force her to have some conversation with him—the letter was torn up in my presence—I said, "I will pencil you out another letter, and if you send that, in all probability you will get an answer from Miss Byrne"—I did that, and he copied it in ink, and showed it to me—this is the envelope, it is in my writing—I directed it for him—that is the</p>

               <p>letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had never directed any other envelope for him—he said he had written lots of letters, and never received a reply—he seemed agitated and excited, and very much annoyed—I remember on the Friday seeing him sharpening this knife—it is one of the workhouse knives, used for cutting meat at table—it is a table knife—I saw him sharpening it—I don't know on which side it was, it is sharp on back and front—there are many of these knives in the workhouse, but they are not like this, this has been sharpened to a point—he touched it up again on the Saturday on a piece of slate which the kitchen men use for sharpening their pocket-knives—on Saturday I saw the knife, and saw it was a table knife, and that he was sharpening it at the point—I do not know on which side—in the evening of that day, the 16th, he said, "I am going out to see Maggie. I am going to settle the case one way or the other." On Sunday he said he was going to see Miss Byrne, and he was going to settle the case, as he had said before—I next saw him about 7.15 on Sunday evening, April 17th, in the day-room of the workhouse—he said, "I went to see Maggie this morning, and she banged the door in my face. I went back again during the afternoon and settled the matter"—I said, "I don't believe you"—he said, "You will believe it presently, when you see the <hi rend="italic">coppers</hi> come here"—I noticed he had a fresh cut on the palm of his left hand—he said, "I got it in the scuffle"—he said he had thrown the knife down one of the areas in the square—I saw he was under the influence of drink and very excited, and advised him to go to bed—he went up the stairs, and that is the last I saw of him that evening.</p>

I trust you will not think I am impertinent in again troubling you, but if you only knew my thoughts regarding you, I am sure you would write a line and grant me a few words personally. I am really very much upset thinking of you morning, noon, and night, in fact I do not really know wat will be the result as far as my health goes if you do not do me this favour. I can assure you it is most urgent, I know I have not been very very polite, and have used very strong language towards you, but I hope they will all be for<lb/>gotten, and I only regret that I have not taken your advice, and have taken no notice of him, he caused me to drink, and that hadded to my troubles I wish to God I had never seen you, or it would never have left me in the state I am in. I implore you to grant me this interview or send me a line, so that I know I am forgiven, as you hope to be in the great and last day. I do not want anything from you only a few soothing words to settel and soothe my troubled mind, and then I will be at rest; if you do not you will have a great deal to answer for. I firmly believe if I do not get a suitable reply it will cause my death or loss of reason, which will be worse, for as it is I feel almost distracted, so do drop a line or two if not I must call once more to see you, so do not put me off under any considera<lb/>tion, or you will drive me mad, and then I do not know wat might happen, so as you profess to be a cristian woman just show me one spark of Christianity by getting a sheet of paper and writing a few lines, and if you don't do that I will know by your silence that you will see me when I call and grant me a few words, and that will soothe my minde. You neede not be afraid I will not harme you in the least. I have tolde you before now that I will never offend you again. I am sorry this as ever happened for your sake as well as my own; anything I have put in my former letters that as hurt your feelings I am very sorry for.

                  </hi>, M.D., F.R.C.S. and F.R.S. I am physician to the Hospital for Epileptics and to University College Hospital—I have frequently been consulted by the Treasury in cases of insanity—in connection with Dr. Scott, of Holloway, I have examined the prisoner on two occasions as to his mental condition at the request of the Treasury—I have heard the evidence given before the Magistrate, and have seen the letter of April 12th, 1898—I have had two interviews with the prisoner—on May 13th and 16th—I had a conversation with Dr. Scott concerning them—I have been here nearly all day, not the first hour—I have heard and read the whole of the evidence—I have heard an account of himself—I have some notes I took at the time of the interviews—he told me he had been in the Navy nearly six years, and was discharged on account of his having a doable rupture, and that he had been a barman, a hawker, a night watchman, and for some long period had been in the workhouse; that he first had an attack of <hi rend="italic">delerium tremens</hi> twenty years ago, and several other times; the last time, four years ago—he also said that he lived in the house of Miss Byrne for seven years, either as a lodger or servant, and acted as night porter from May, 1893, to October, 1894; that after his discharge he called twice on Miss Byrne, and wrote one letter to her; that he met a man named Taylor, who bad been a long time in her service, but was discharged, who told him that he had constantly been in the habit of having connection with Miss Byrne, and that certain lodgers also told him that they had had connection with her, and he came to have a different view of her character; he formerly thought she was a religious Christian woman, but now had a different view, and put a different construction on certain events; that she wished him to understand that he might have connection with her, and he became convinced that she wished him to have connec<lb/>tion with her; although he did not appreciate it at the time, he became filled with the suspicion of the rumour on account of his lost oppor<lb/>tunities, and on account of the offence he must have given her, that at the time he called at the house and said that he had now seen the light—that was a reference to one of the newly-interpreted statements made to him when he had been in her service, and he would not oppose her for one minute—in his letters to her I have more than once seen the ex<lb/>pression, "I now see the light"—in one letter he says, "You know in your heart I did not see your meaning. Could I have treated you so? Reason with yourself"—he has told me</p>

               <p>the meaning of those letters—the interpretation he put upon "Have seen the light" was that he then understood the meaning of certain remarks which she had previously made; he thought that certain things she had said to him were that she wished to convey the impression that he might have immoral intercourse with her after he saw Taylor, and then he put that construction upon it, and then he said that he had seen the light—I have presented a copy of this report to the Treasury solicitor—I should like to say I am asked to give my impression—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE HAWKINS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">directed the witness not to interfere as a partizan</hi>)—I am not a portizan, all I want to imply is that I was asked to give my opinion—I incorporated the impression on my mind in this scheme—I asked him how he had been sleeping—he said, "For a few weeks badly, and I could never get that woman out of my mind"—I judged from the expression that from November the feeling seemed to have been increasing—in those letters he makes frequent allusion to offending her—he told me that the offence was his in not comprehending her when she made solicitations for immoral intercourse, that he had failed to understand her—he said that the knife was one which he had kept in his possession while he was in the workhouse, and he had been accustomed to carry it in his pocket in a sheath, and he carried it in his pocket on previous occasions to April 17th—as to the door being slammed in his face he said, "I walked about the street after in a state of madness, I could not hold myself, I was so much upset. I had a few pence, with which I bought a drink, a small quantity of beer, my mind is much clearer to night Now I know she is dead my mind is much clearer"—I have been a practioner thirty-five years, and have come to certain con<lb/>clusions—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was on May 13th that I first saw the prisoner, and he was then in prison—I have no reason to think he knew for what object I had come to examine him—he had no indication even that I was a medical man, until near the end of the interview—I did not give the indication—I felt his pulse and examined his eyes, and he may have come to that conclusion—he told me a great deal about his life, that he had an attack of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> twenty years back, and of the last attack, and I particularly asked about the date—I could not obtain his family history—I should say his father died when he was twelve, and his mother has been dead for thirty years, and he had a number of brothers and sisters, whom he had not seen for years—there is no history of his family to be given by anyone with whom he has come in contact, so far as I know—my impression is that he was speaking the truth—his memory was good—he did not make any reference to the knife on April 17th—he only said that it was his custom to carry the knife—I think there is no doubt that he knew that the act had been committed with this knife—he told me that it was one which he used while he was in the workhouse, for the purpose of disjointing bones, and always kept it for his own use—I thought that statement was true—one</p>

               <p>could only judge from the behaviour of the man—it would influence my opinion if I found he was making untrue statements with regard to that knife—I have no reason to doubt that he was speaking the truth to me—he never attempted to exculpate himself—it is my business to be alive to all such things when I examine persons, and I have been examining them for years—that had an influence on my mind with one element—he said that he had thrown the knife down an area in an adjacent street—his expressions were that he had gone to the house that morning, and was greatly upset by having the door slammed in his face, and how he walked about the streets in a state of madness, and could not hold himself, and having eightpence or tenpence in his pocket he went and bought liquor—I did not ask him how much he spent in getting to London—he told me further that he had had one other glass of beer with a man he met, who gave it to him, and one glass he bought himself, and that he did not recollect going back to the house, and recollected nothing about the occurrence; he did, however, recollect the throwing away of the knife, and, I presume, the killing of the woman—he went back to the workhouse and confessed that he had killed her—I said, "You told the porter where you were going to, and that you were going to settle the matter, and he said, 'Well, if I have killed the woman I have settled the matter"—may I be allowed to say that I go as a friend of the Court to form an opinion—I was asked to give my opinion as to his mental condition—he said that his mind was a blank before it was done, and he remembered the conversa<lb/>tion when he came back—that is very common; it is a well-recognised phase—there was no reason why I should not accept his statement—I have never used the word "delusion."</p>

               <p>not give their names—he said that these statements had made him alter his opinion as to her being a moral and Christian woman—I have had copies of the letters—I have heard him speak of the wrong he had done to Miss Byrne in the letters—he said he knew he had offended' her—I have had several conservations with him about the letters—I asked him for an explanation of the expression in the letter of November 29th, "You know in your heart that I did not see your meaning"—he said he would apologise for not having understood her when she made improper overtures to him—I asked him what he meant by the words, "I assure you I am very much hurt to hear that I hurt you; it is entirely my own fault. You tried all you could to show me the light"—he gave me the same explanation as before, that he did not see what her meaning was—(To other questions he gave replies to the same effect.) I asked him if he had any hope or expectation of marrying Miss Byrne—he said "No," he had no such hopes—I asked him the reason for writing such letters—he said he was desirous, if possible, of getting into her employment again, that he might have further opportunities of having connection with her—I asked him as to his visiting Miss Byrne on the day she was stabbed—he said because she had slammed the door in his face—he said that it drove him mad—he said, after having sent her such a nice letter he ought to have had an answer of some kind—he said if she had only told him quietly that she did not wish to have anything more to do with him he would have gone away satisfied—I asked him if he had taken the knife with him on purpose that morning—he asserted that he had not done so—he said, "I did not know it was in my pocket till some time after I had left the workhouse"—that he was in the habit of carrying this knife in. his pocket—he said he had been a sailor, and had left the Navy in 1867—that he was in the habit of using the knife in the cook-house, and putting it in his pocket and taking it away with him—his answers to my questions gave me the impression that they were sincere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He appeared sensible on other topics far from this one—his answers were connected and sensible—he knew, of course, that I was the prison doctor—he was not informed of Dr. Bastian's visit—his visit to him was next day—he told me he was in the habit of using the knife for disjointing—I have seen the knife—I have noticed its peculiar shape—it has been sharpened to a point—I mentioned that—he said he did not remember any sharpening of it—it was my impression that he had been in the habit of using it for the purpose of disjointing—I asked him if he had sharpened it the day before leaving the workhouse—he said he had no recollection of having done so on that day—I did not call his attention to touching the knife on the Saturday—I asked him about his saying that he was going to settle the matters—he said that he could get no answer, one way or the other, to his letter—he told me that he went and drank while the public-houses were open—that would be till one o'clock, but he said till closing time, three o'clock—he did not tell me where the first public-house was, but he told me as to the last—that was the only one—I asked him if he had gone back to the house, and he said that after leaving the public-house he had no clear recollection of what occurred—he told me that he had thrown the knife away down the area of a house near—that was all he said—he. did not tell me what time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189805160064"/>
               <p>that was—I asked him, but could not get him to fix any definite time—I pressed him frequently—he said that he realised that he had done some<lb/>thing wrong, and threw away the knife—he interpreted the word "settled" that the woman being dead, the matter was settled—I think he realised the fact that he had killed the woman—the conversations with the police are highly important, as revealing the condition of his mind, and evidencing that he had done something wrong—the expres<lb/>sion, "I hope she is dead" is evidence that he knew what he had done, and showed signs of satisfaction that she was settled—he said that he had no recollection of having a knife, till after he left the workhouse on Sun<lb/>day morning; no recollection of having brought it away—he said, "I did not know it was in my pocket till some time after I left the workhouse. I was in the habit of carrying it in my pocket"—Serjeant Blyth's state<lb/>ment that the prisoner said, "I brought the knife away with me from the workhouse" does not shake me at all—his saying, "My mind was not clear till I was coming along the road, and heard that she was dead" was a very important expression.</p>

I live at 21, Upper John Street, Hoxton, and am a marble polisher—I have known the prisoner for some time, and about a month before April 2nd we had a row because I thought he was going to take liberties with my wife—that passed over, and on April 2nd, about nine o'clock p.m., I was in the Griffin public house in St. Leonard's Street, Shoreditch—on coming out I saw the prisoner standing outside, he said, "Hullo, how are you going on?"—I said, "Wait till my head gets better, and I will show you how I am going on for what you have done to my head"—he had wounded my head with a penknife—because of my wife—I had been in the London Hospital—I told him to wait—I said, "You have got a revolver"—he showed me that—he said, "Yes"—so I said, "You know what to do with it"—he said, "Yes"—he was about half a yard from me then—he put his hand inside the right pocket of his overcoat and took out this revolver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he fired two shots at me—the first passed me on the left side—he aimed at me, and the second hit me in the chest—I was taken to the hospital, and have been a patient for five weeks and two days.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 31, Ainsworth Place, Stratford, and am a labourer—on April 30th the prisoner was working for me at this dust-shoot—the prosecutrix came there about 12.30 p.m. with a bit of blue paper in her hand—she said, "You will get this on Monday or Tuesday; mind, it is 7s. 6d. you owe now"—he said, "It is not 7s. 6d., not before next week; I shan't pay at all; there is another bloke living with you "—she said, "You can stick your gun up your b—h—; you have broke the peace and threatened to shoot me, do it, shoot me, go on. There are two or three chaps waiting down at the gate to give you a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi> when you go home"—he said, "Go away"—she said, "I shan't go to please you"—that was all that was said—I heard a shot about two or three minutes afterwards—I did not see it, I was round the bend—after the shot the woman ran towards us, we went to help her, and she jumped down the bank over our heads—the prisoner ran with the gun in his hand round the top of the bank in the direction she was going—the prisoner fired, and then she staggered—two young men went to her assist<lb/>ance—the gun is mine; it is a twelve-bore choke gun—it was a habit of the prisoner to have the gun in his hand examining it—I pay him to work—when I had not got the gun he used to handle it; pick it up and and open it—he shot tins and rats with it—I did not find him a gun licence—I took one myself—I took the gun there to test it—rat shooting was a regular practice of ours.</p>

On Sunday, May 1st, I was on duty at Leyton Police-station, about 10.50 p.m., when the prisoner came into the station, and said, "I have come to give myself up for shooting my wife, Elizabeth Brabben. I am Samuel Robert Brabben"—I said, "Sit down"—I sent for Serjeant Burgess—the prisoner was then taken into custody, and Burgess charged him with feloniously shooting his wife, and cautioned him—the prisoner then made this statement, which was taken down by Burgess, and read over to the prisoner, who signed it: "She came to the dust shoot and showed me a piece of blue paper and said, 'You need not pay any more money as I have got you set, and you will have one Monday to appear on Tuesday, and I can have a solicitor if I like.' I said, 'Go away, go away,' but she would not. The gun was in my hand. She said, 'You ought to have a gun" (using a filthy expression), "and blow your brains out. I am not here by myself, and will see whether you are going to fight my brother <hi rend="italic">Tom.</hi>' I said to her, 'I hear you are living with another chap.' She said, 'He can keep me, that is more than you could.' I then raised the gun and fired. I then came on the bank and fired again. I then ran away. I am very sorry"—I have not in<lb/>quired whether she was behaving improperly with other men—I believe Burgess, the officer in charge of the case, has done that.</p>

                  </hi> I live near the prisoner in Lethbridge Road—I have known him about three months—I have not seen much of him daring that time—[ know nothing about his being bad with influenza—I know nothing about his home—I am generally known as "Harry" at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. THOMSON</hi>. I am house surgeon at the Miller Hospital—on March 28th Jane Banks was admitted, and I examined her—I found her to be covered with blood and suffering from shock and in a weak condition—she had 6 wounds on her head; the first was 2(1/2) inches above her fore head, 3 inches long, reaching to the bone, and separating the coverings of the bone for 2 inches; the wound was a curved one, having its convexity backwards—another was near the vertex on the top of the head, and 3 inches from the centre line there was a wound 2 inches in length and 3 inches from the centre line, running backwards; it penetrated to and fractured the bone—some of them were serious wounds—she is now per<lb/>fectly well, so far as I can judge—I did not see the prisoner—the wounds were of such a nature as might have been inflicted by this chopper, or some other instrument—I think some of them were inflicted by the sharp edge and some by this side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. BURNIE</hi>. I am medical superintendent of the Greenwich Infirmary—there is an insane ward connected with it—it is my duty to observe the inmates, and I have observed numbers of persons suffering from men<lb/>tal disorders—I examined the prisoner—he was admitted on April 4th about 12.15 p.m., and was under my observation for about a month—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189805160081"/>
               <p>during that time I had frequent opportunities of observing him—the result of my observation was that I considered he was in his right senses—a police inspector brought him there under the Lunacy Act; he was transferred from Holloway Prison by the Treasury authorities—he seemed in rather a frightened or dazed condition when admitted—these are notes in my writing:—"John Banks, aged sixty years; brought from the Blackheath Road Police-station on April 4th, at 12.45 p.m., by Sergeant Cragg, supposed to be of unsound mind; quiet since admission. 5th—Quiet all day, now reasonable"—he appeared a little frightened and dazed when admitted—people who get into a state of lunacy may very often, by quiet treatment, and being left alone, without anything to irritate them, recover their reason—his quietness after a day or so would be indicative that he was getting better—"Quiet all day on 5th, now reasonable, and says he is sorry for the assault on his wife; also that the assault was un<lb/>premeditated; is anxious about her; was visited by J. P. White; passed a quiet night. 6th—Is quiet and comfortable, talks reasonably. 7th—Passed a good night, and kept brighter; much better, and slept better. 11th—Very bright, seems almost happy; a good night, and continues to improve. 14th—Seems quite himself; no delusions, all right as regards delusions, quite sane"—he was discharged on May 2nd—I thought it prudent to keep him from April 4th till May 2nd—if I was satisfied that he was not insane when he was brought in, and that his mind was not affected, I should have kept him fourteen days, and I might have dis<lb/>charged him then—I did not discharge him then—he was not well enough in himself, apart from the brain—during the time he was with me he was quiet, took his food, and did not say much—he did not mention any delusions—I talked to him several times—I asked him if he knew what he had done to his wife, and he said he was sorry for what he had done to her—that was two days after he came in—he had grown quite thin—about April 7th, I asked him if he had been taking anything to drink—he said he had a couple of glasses of beer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner, in his statement before the Magistrate, said that on the morn<lb/>ing before it happened lie had dreadful pains in his head; that he had a glass of beer for dinner and another for supper, but nothing to eat; that after he went to bed his head got worse, and he walked the room, as he could not sleep; that in the morning he went to chop some wood; that the pain came on and drove him out of his senses; that he turned and imagined he saw his wife, and chased her up-stairs, and saw, as he imagined, a man standing by the side of the bed', that he began to hammer at her head, and saw the man vanish out of a window, and that he remembered no more till he found his son holding him; that his head had not been right since the influenza, and that his wife had put him into the infirmary at Lewis<lb/>ham, as he was raving mad.</hi>

On March 28th the prisoner was brought to me—when there is a doubt as to a prisoner's state of mind he is remanded generally to Holloway for a week's observation; I then furnish a report to the Magistrate, and if it is such a report as in this case the Magistrate sends the prisoner under the Lunacy Act to the workhouse for a fortnight's observation—it is on my opinion that he is so sent—I have no reason to question the truth of the woman's statements</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189805160082"/>
               <p>—I should not have allowed him to go away to be put under treatment as a lunatic unless I had thought it was proper treatment—he has been under my observation from May 2nd till to-day—I do not think there is much change in his state of mind from the time he went to the infirmary—I think that that which did occur was the result of that which made me send him to the Lunatic Asylum—I would not take the responsibility of his being at large—there were no particular symptons of drink—a very little quantity might have had an effect on him—in answer to my ques<lb/>tions the prisoner stated the circumstances of the case on two occasions—when I examined him on April 1st and May 4th—there was some dis<lb/>crepancies in those statements—in my opinion a man's state of mental confusion satisfactorily explains the difference between the statements—they did not affect my judgment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner, in his defence, repeated in substance the statement he had made before the Magistrate, and added that he was certain he had seen a man by his wife's bed.</hi>
