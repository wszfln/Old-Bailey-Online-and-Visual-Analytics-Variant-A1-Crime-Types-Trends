                  </hi>. I am in the service of the London General omnibus Company—I live at 79, Star Street, Edgware Road—I am a Tafton man—I came up to London in December last for the purpose of getting employment, and I was taken into the London General Omnibus company's service in January, and first conducted the FU omnibus on Saturday, 9th January—I have my book here in which I kept an account—on the 11th and 13th I conducted a different omnibus—those were the only times that I had conducted an omnibus in London before the 14th January—on Thursday morning, 14th January, I was at the company's office in the Edgware Read; I got there about 8 o'clock in the morning—I saw the district road manager, Mr. Wild, and I afterwards saw the prisoner Murphy—I had never seen him before—he came to the office just before 9 o'clock—he asked Mr. Wild for a rest—Mr. Wild said "You are frequently wanting rests," and he said he wanted to go to some place particularly—Mr. Wild told me to go on his <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> for one day, and he was to show me what to do—I went out of the office with Murphy and I went with him to Paddington Green to the King and Queen, public-house, where the stables were—on the way there Murphy said "Are you a new man"—I said I was and had come from Taunton—he said it was lucky he had seen me, he would show me how to manage about the takings—he said that 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day was not much for a man, it was not sufficient to find a man in <hi rend="italic">lush</hi>, and he said I should have to give his driver a dollar a day; he said he did—I said "So much as that" he said "Yes, you can do it very well; you can have four or five <hi rend="italic">hog</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bob</hi>" (I don't know which he said) "a day for yourself"—then he said he would give me his book to show me what he paid in as</p>

               <p>his takings, and I was to take that as a guide—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the book and he said I could refer to it each journey to see what he took, and I was to give it again to his driver at night, and whatever I did I was not to pay in any more than he did, if anything, less; being a new man, he said, they would not take any notice of it—the book was shut when he gave it to me, and no part of it was referred to—I don't recollect that anything further was said about it—when we got to the King and Queen he gave me my time-bills—there were eight time tills and the total bill which were then in blank—he gave me the times of the first two journies, which I wrote down myself—he told me what to put down—he then said "The <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> has come round I will make the driver make out the other times for you"—Bride<lb/>groom was the driver of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—Murphy told me that I could get any fares between the Lonsdale and the office, as there was no one about there, and I was to take a little out of each fare, and the last journey I was to look and if I saw any old <hi rend="italic">fogey</hi> sitting in the corner I was to take stock of him over the door, and if I saw him looking up at the bill mind him, but not to be too timid, as a great many people looked out of curiosity—the omnibus came out—Bridegroom was driving and Murphy got up on the bus by his side and he told me to get up on the other side of the driver, that was when the omnibus came from the King and Queen—I said I would get up behind—I had all the way bills and the book with me—I had not seen what was in the book—I was not aware then that the times were entered in that book—the omnibus went to the Earl Lonsdale, Portobello Road; as we passed the Royal Oak, Murphy called me to come in front to the driver over the roof, but I refused—I said I was going to put in my journey bill, and I got inside and put my journey bill in—when we got to the Earl Lonsdale, which is the starting point, Murphy got down—he said I was to mind what he told me, he had made it all right with the driver and that he would get me a lot of people and we were to mind and take care of ourselves and do as he told me—he told me to mind and give the driver the book in the night—Murphy then went away and I did not see him after that—he said the fares were all right between the Royal Oak and the office because there was no one there—I said "There is a time-keeper at the Royal Oak," and he said "He is nothing, he is nobody"—that was all that passed between us—on the first journey Bridegroom drove properly, and as I received the fares I made the marks on the way-bill—when I had a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. fare I marked it in that line, and so on—we started the first journey at 9.41 and. returned from Charing Cross at 10.38—on my return 1 went into the Earl Lonsdale to add up the amount I had returned, but pre<lb/>viously to that I had called at the office on the way down and made a com<lb/>plaint to Mr. Wild and 1 arranged to see him later in the day—I went into the Earl Lonsdale after the first journey and began to make up my way bill—Bridegroom came in, and, looking over me, he saw 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was the total of the first journey—he said "D----my eyes, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said "Yes"—he asked how much I had kept back—I told him not anything—he said "Why, the other man never paid in as much as that"—he asked me to give him the book, and I took the book out of my pocket and gave it to him—he referred back to some of the previous days and compared my first journey with his first journies, and he said "He has never hardly paid in so much money as that"—I told him I had taken the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had made a penny mistake in putting down, on that journey—I had made a stroke in the penny line, and Bridegroom asked me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187505030005"/>
               <p>the meaning of that—I told him a lady had paid me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and I put it down to the 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. fare, and I had put the penny down there so as to explain at the office—he said I was a b----fool, they would not have known anything about it, but as I had done it it ought to be put down as an excess fare, and he wrote that himself against it—he said if I did not keep back some for him he was not going to get passengers, he was not going to work for six <hi rend="italic">bob</hi> a day, and it was no good for him to get passengers if I gave it all to them—some man came and called him outside; he came back again and said "You are the man who was on the FU" and I said "Yes"—he said "Well, you won't get any 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. fares here on this one"—the FU was the omnibus 1 had been on the previous Saturday and I had taken 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one journey and had returned it properly—the second journey he drove very badly—if he saw an empty <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> in front he would keep behind it, and if the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was full he would get in front of it till he met another, and if I rang for him he would not stop, but for all the passengers I did carry I made the entries on the way-bill and at the end of the journey I had taken 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went into the Earl Lonsdale to make up the way-bill—Bridegroom came in and looked over my bill and he said "You haven't got so much now"—I said "No"—he said he was not going to get a lot of people if I was giving it to them—I spoke to him about the driving and said if he did it again I should report him—I told him I had rung for him and he did not pull up, and he said he did not hear me ring—I said "You must have heard, because I hallowed as well"—I asked him to make out my time-bills for me for the other journies and I gave him the six bills for the remaining six journies—he made out one and gave them all back to me—I said "Make them all out for me now," and he said "No, I shall make them out at the end of each journey"—he wrote all that way-bill, but my figures, the time and "Earl Lonsdale to Charing Cross," and "Bridegroom" and "Poole" as the driver and conductor—I had written the first two—on the third journey I picked up two ladies just at the Earl Lonsdale—before they got in they told me to put them down at a shop in Westbound Grove—I told them I did not know it, but if they told me when they arrived I would put them down—Bridegroom said "I know where it is, I will pull up all right"—the ladies got in, and got out at that place—when they got in he called me up to him on the top of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he said "Have those, they won't know anything about it"—I told him I should not, and I got back on the step again—when they got out they paid me and I put down the fares—the prisoner asked me if I bad put them down—I said "Yes, I have"—he started off very furiously and then he either drove very fast or very slow, which prevented me from getting pas<lb/>sengers properly—at the end of that journey I went into the Earl Lonsdale to make up the way-bill, and I had only earned 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Bridegroom came in and said 1 had not taken so much—I said "No"—he said "Well, I ain't going to get them unless you like to keep back some for ourselves"—I told him I should not do it—he said "Well, I can get as many as any man on the road"—I said "Let me see how much you can get next time"—he made out the bill for the next journey—I wanted him to make out the whole, but he would not—he entered the times and the names at the bottom—he drove very well the fourth journey, and I took 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to the Earl Lous<lb/>dale to make out the bill as before and he said then he could get as many passengers as anyone on the road, but he was not going to work for six <hi rend="italic">bob</hi> a day—I had made out a part of that time-bill and he took it out of my hands and put in 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and seventeen passengers and the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the rest</p>

               <p>is in my own writing—he made out my time-bill for the fifth journey—I got 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that journey—he drove properly—during that journey I saw Mr. Wild at Regent Circus—I made a complaint to him—I filled up my bill of that journey at the Earl Lonsdale, and while I was there Bridegroom came in—there were about half a dozen other people there, conductors and men who had to do with the horses—Bridegroom made up some of this bill for the fifth journey, his figures are nineteen passengers and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the total 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is the total of the two ways—he called the men's atten<lb/>tion to the figures in the book, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he said "You will get all the b----lot of the men <hi rend="italic">sacked</hi>, you will get them all down on you"—I told him if he took my book again I should report him for it—he entered 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my book—before he touched the bills I had entered the full amount of passengers carried in the lines and he added it up—one of the men said I ought to be swamped, and another said I should find myself down Houndsditch one morning—Bridegroom said he would take good care I should not get so many passengers again—he said "I don't believe you have taken so much money"—I said I had—he asked me if I knew how much I had in the morning when I came out—I said "Yes, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he told me to take my money out and count it—I did so, and found I was 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. short—he said "There, you see you are 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. short, I knew d----well you had not taken the money"—I said "There is my dinner and beer, and that"—I reckoned that that came to 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and made it right—I satisfied myself the money was right—he made out the bill for the sixth journey—he drove very badly that time—I believe it was that journey that a gentleman gave me a parcel and sixpence, and told me I was to take it to a place in Westbound Grove—I said 1 did not know where it was—Bride<lb/>groom said "I know where it is," and the gentleman gave the sixpence and the parcel to him—he pulled up at the shop, 119, Westbound Grove, and I took in the parcel—when we arrived at the Earl Lonsdale, I asked Bridegroom for the money for the parcel—(I had taken 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that journey, without the parcel)—he said it was not b----likely, and he should keep it for himself—I told him I should enter it to him, and he said, he would give me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and keep 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. himself—I said "No, I shall have the whole of the sixpence"—he threw it down on the floor, and told me to take the b----sixpence—I picked it up—this is the way-bill—there is no line for parcels, but I made an entry of the parcel on my total-bill—I called at the office to learn how to eater it, and I afterwards put it on the total-bill—I asked Bridegroom to make out the way-bill for the seventh journey—he said he would see me b----first—I said I would go without them, and then he told me to come in and he would make them out for me, and I went in, and he made out the two for the seventh and eighth journies; the two last journies—before we started he said I should not have so many passengers—I earned 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the seventh journey but he did not drive properly—before we started on the eighth journey he said "You can keep back some now because there is nobody about"—I told him I should not do so, I would rather throw the place up and should tell Mr. Wild so; and I wanted to—he drove very badly and I earned 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we did not go back that journey to the Earl Lonsdale—there was only one passenger left at Paddington Station and he got out at Westbourne Grove, and Bridegroom drove to the King and Queen where the stables were—he got down there and told me to go into the house, he would be in in a moment, and I was to give him the other</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had never seen Murphy before the day I went on this omnibus, and he made this proposal that I was to rob the company—I did not make any further observation about it except what I have mentioned—if I had said anything to him he would have told the others, and they would have killed me; they were down on me before—Murphy gave the book to me before we got to the King and Queen—he did not show me the times, and I did not know they were in the book—Bridegroom wrote down the times for me in the Earl Lonsdale—Murphy said "Here is the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, I will ask the coachman to make out the other times for you"—he said "I have made it all right with him, he will get you a lot of passengers, take care of yourselves and give him back the book at night," and he went away—I don't know that I said anything to Bridegroom then, because I wanted to wait till I got to the office to be taken off the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he said "The other man has told you how to manage about the takings, I am not going to get a b----lot of people if you give it all to them"—I did not make any remark on that—he subsequently told me that I should get all the men the sack—on the fourth journey he said "Don't be a b----fool, I can get a lot of passengers, look out for yourself and me too—you see I can earn as much as any man on the road, but I am not going to work for six <hi rend="italic">heg</hi> a day"—I said "Let us see what you can earn the next time"—I did not remonstrate with him, it would not have done for me to have doue so—I had been on other <hi rend="italic">busses.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I filled up the paper that I signed at Scotland Yard, and I had to be very quick, as 1 should have been too late for the post—I had to take it to a gentleman to get it signed so as to be in time for post to send it to Taunton—the first part of the form is not in my writing—my writing is just the "<hi rend="italic">No</hi>, no, no," and the last one "Yes" and the signature—I did that at Scotland Yard—Mr. Goldsmith is the Superintendent of Police for Somerset—I wrote down to him and he had to go and see all the gentlemen who signed my references down there, and he had to sign, himself, after that I think—I had testimonials from the leading gentlemen of Taunton and from the Vicar, and they were given to the company—the perjury indict<lb/>ment against me arose out of an assault case—I charged John Jarvis with an assault—he came and pushed me; he was a great, powerful man, and I summoned him for the assault—Mr. Justice Willies was the Judge who charged the Grand Jury in the charge of perjury against me, and the bill was thrown out—he said it was a malicious prosecution—I went to the office during the first journey, and I went again in the afternoon to ask about the parcel—when Murphy made these proposals to me I did not say anything to him, because I had all sorts of things thrown at my head because I had paid in so much money one day—I believe it was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I am road inspector in the employment of the London General Omnibus Company—I live at 10, Cirencester Street, Paddington—I was at the" office in the Edgware Road on 14th January—Poole came there about 9 o'clock, or a little later, and whilst he was there Murphy came in—he said "Can I rest to-day?"—I said "You are frequently wanting rest"—he said "I want to go somewhere particularly to-day"—I then told Poole, who was in the office, to go for him for the day—I said to Murphy "Instruct him where to go," and they left the office together—I was in the office about 10 o'clock in the morning when the omnibus came down its first journey from the Lonsdale—Poole came in and made a statement to me—he was in rather an excited state—I made arrangements to see him at the Circus in the afternoon—I saw him there at 6 o'clock in the evening—he was stand<lb/>ing behind the omnibus then—I saw him again in the morning and he made a further statement to me—he brought the book which has-been produced, with him—I took him to Mr. Trevitt, the superintendent, and he made a statement to him—Poole was first employed by the company on the 9th January, I think.</p>

I live at 5, Colville Square Mews, Notting Hill, and look after the omnibuses at the Lonsdale for the men—I know Poole by sight and I know Murphy—T remember the day that Poole took Murphy's place, but I don't remember the day of the month—he had a very slight moustache, at least, not upon that day he did not; when he was on FW he had a slight moustache—I remember him on the FW <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I remember when he took Murphy's place; he had no moustache then—I knew Bridegroom—Murphy was not on the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> on the morning that Poole took his place when it came up to the Lonsdale for the first journey.</p>

W. Golding &amp; Son—we had had frequent transactions with them; the prisoner, had called for bills from them—I saw him on the Tuesday; I did not speak to him—our Mr. Child, in my presence, asked him whether he was at our place on that day—he said that he was but he did not come upstairs—I have made inquiries in Mason Street, but cannot find that there is any person named Pavey there, nor has there been for the last three years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a banker and money lender, and carry on business under the title of the National Deposit Bank, at 17, Russell Street, Covent Garden—I first became acquainted with the de<lb/>fendant about two or three years ago—on 13th December, 1873, he executed a bill of sale for 430<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that document was destroyed when another one was signed—it was secured on a mortgage of his stock and crops on the farm called Crow Hall, Denver Felt hall, in the county of Norfolk—that loan was to be repaid by four monthly instalments of 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he made three payments of 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one on 16th February, "' one on 27th March, and one on 8th September, 1874; that left 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due—on 16th January this year he came to me and said he wished to borrow 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money and the remaining 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that was due on the previous loan to be included in it, making 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no one was present at that interview—I gave him a promissory note to take with him to get his son's signature to it—he took the promissory note away on the 16th, and on the 19th he came to me; on that occasion Mr. Thompson, the chief cashier, was present and witnessed the bill of sale—I then said to the pri<lb/>soner "Is your property still unencumbered beyond the bill of sale I hold dated December 13th, 1873, is it absolutely your own"—he said "Yes, it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187505030022"/>
               <p>is"—I inquired of him whether he had full right to assign it to me, because in that inventory they could not be the same crops as were in the inventory of 1873—he assured me that the whole of the property was unencumbered—I am sure that he said that, otherwise I should not have parted with the money—I did not make inquiry about any other bills of sale—I asked him generally whether his property was unencumbered; I then advanced him the money—I wrote the inventory down in his presence from what he told me, and he signed it; this is it, and this is the bill of sale—it was given to him to read and was fully explained to him—he signed it before I gave him the cheque—I should not have given him the money unless he had signed it—after he had signed it I made out this cheque and gave it to him,. and I also released his other bill of sale; it was cancelled, torn up in his presence, and a receipt given to him for the money—I gave him 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I held a previous promissory note of his for the 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I gave him that back and took the new bill of sale to secure the 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payable in four monthly instalments of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—the first instalment was due on 9th February—I was induced to part with my money upon his representation that the property was unencumbered—if I had known that Mr. Stevenson had a bill of sale of March, 1874, I should not have advanced the money—neither of the bills of sale were registered—I got a notice from the Bankruptcy Court about eight or nine days after I had advanced the money; I think on 4th February, as I had advanced the money on 19th January—my cheque has come back from my bankers paid.</p>

Henry," he is here—it was on the 16th January that the defendant called; I had written to him to say that I must have his loan settled up; I did not keep a copy of the letter—I did not ask him for more interest; he did not say when he came that he had come to pay the interest—he did not have a conversation about breeding-horses for me—I wanted a carriage horse and asked him if he had one for sale; he is a breeder of horses—I did not say to him "Do you want any more money—the proposition came from him; would I let him have some more, and I said I would do so on condition that his son signed a fresh promissory note and this bill of sale would then have to be cancelled—I did not let him have the money on the 16th, because he had not got his son's signature—I would not have let him have the money but for his son's signature and the bill of sale—I had a bill of sale on the son's goods as well; he never deposited with me 12, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of security, not a farthing—it is true, as I said before the Magistrate, that I refused to let the defendant have any more money till the promissory note was signed by the son, I waited three or four days till he brought it, and then I advanced the money—I had not shown him the bill of sale on the 16th, it was simply a copy of the original one; it was not prepared then—I spoke to him about it then, I swear that; no one was present—I am not aware that a prisoner on his trial cannot <hi rend="italic">give</hi> evidence—this is only the second time I have been here, I was here about six years ago when I prosecuted a person; I know nothing of criminal matters—the prisoner owed me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for inte<lb/>rest after he had signed the bill, and after I had received the son's promis<lb/>sory note, the costs made it 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there was the cost of the bill of sale, the cost of inquiry into his responsibility at Stubbs and Perry's, and the stamps—we always have fresh inquiries, to see whether there is any other bill of sale registered—at that time the son also owed me 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for an advance of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not have that by driblets; he had 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week by his own desire—he has paid back the whole of that and he gave me 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to release his liability to these promissory notes; he was liable for the whole 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but a few days prior to my receiving the 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. his solicitor called and told me if I did not receive the money he would file a petition for liquidation, and under</p>

I received from the son relates to the second loan—the money I lent in December, 1873, did not come back till February, 1875, and then not the whole of it, and I should not have got it unless I had written to him a great many times—I should not have parted with my money upon the promissory notes without the bill of sale—if he had refused to sign the bill of sale, I should not have parted with the money; it was on the bill of sale and the promis<lb/>sory notes that I parted with it; the bill of sale was the only security I had—the son's loan was 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I gave him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—that loan was granted on 23rd September, 1874—he is of full age and a well-educated man—that loan was between the two loans to the prisoner—he was only too pleased to borrow the money on the terms; he took away half of it, and requested me to send him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week to pay his men's wages—that was entirely his own wish, and I was at the expense of registering the letters every week—I should not have parted with the 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prisoner but for his statement that there was no encumbrance on his property beyond the residue of the old bill of sale.</p>

I am a house painter, and live at 39, Wellclose Square—on the evening of 13th April I went out about 6 or 7 o'clock, leaving my family at home—I returned about 12 o'clock or a little after—I did not miss anything till I went upstairs—I then found my drawers open and missed the articles stated—my wife was in bed; I awoke her—I found the window open—a person could get on to the leads over the shop, also in at the window—my wife is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Registrar of the Edmonton County Court—I produce the proceedings in the bankruptcy of James Charles Harding—the petition is dated July, 1874, it was filed the same day—the adjudication was July 23rd, and on August 11th J. B. Bradfield was appointed trustee—that appointment was afterwards vacated by order of the Judge, and George Frederick Flower was appointed, trustee—this is the bankrupt's statement of affairs, it shows a liability of 2, 936<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he represents his assets to be 878<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., showing a deficiency of about 2, 057<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no de<lb/>ficiency account—I find two or more orders by the Court for filing cash accounts, but he has filed none—I sat as judge in an examination held before me on 22nd December; I took these notes of that examination (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These are not official notes taken by a short-hand writer, nor are they made from my recollection; they were made at the time and I will undertake to say that they are correct word for word—official short-hand notes would be filed but not my notes—I cannot say that my notes contain all he said; the answers only are put, not the questions—I remember the purport of it exactly, but there are other matters which I cannot remember without refreshing my memory.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did he say A. He was examined by Mr. Lewis as to Butcher's loan of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said that the debts were received in capacity of an auctioneer, and appropriated to his own use; that Mr. Bowron's claim was for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was instructed in October or November in 1873, to sell live and dead stock—the sale realised over 2, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the balance owing to Bowron was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less commission—he said "I did not pay all I received"—I do not say that part of Mr. Butcher's loan went in discharge of Mr. Bowron's debt—it went in the business generally—as to John Luigay he said "I was instructed to sell live and dead stock, <hi rend="italic">—t</hi> realised about 1, 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; fifty sheep were not sold, and came into the assets; that was paid into my account in the usual way of business"—as to David Kidd he said "The house and homestead at Tanner's End were purchased through me, 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit was paid to my bankers. Alfred Lott is not a creditor for 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he is a creditor for 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the proceeds of a sale; the greater part was not received by me, and is owing now. I received money from the local board and handed it over to him"—as to Mr. Gilbert he said "The farm produce was sold, the estate owes him the money, 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a little over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is owing now"—as to the Provident Building Society he said "Holder of lease</p>

               <p>held house for residue of ninety-nine years, executed a mortgage to them, received clear money, about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I knew then that I was hopelessly in<lb/>solvent. I was then in treaty for a partnership. I had told my proposed partner of the fact—the treaty went off after I was gazetted—I was pressed by my bankers, my account was considerably overdrawn; this 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. went into the Imperial Bank. I wanted two bankers, because the Imperial had a branch at Waltham. The receipts being about equal to the office and house-hold expenses, the sums received in business went into the general business"—Bradfield the horse dealer, was then mentioned, and the prisoner said "He is a creditor for over 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I paid him very likely as much as 1, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for borrowed money had at different times, between June 1873 and another date; 25 and 30 per cent. I was sometimes paying him at a time when I knew I was hopelessly insolvent. I continued borrowing money of Bradfield on the same terms. I can't say how much I borrowed of Bradfield; I kept no private book of account. I may have borrowed from first to last of Bradfield 2, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I won't swear to any amount, not even that it was more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the expenses of advertising, &amp; c., where property has not sold. There were a great many sales in two years; I cannot say how many. There were other sources of loss, bad debts; some are brought forward as assets, and some crossed off"—then the new offices and lease were touched upon "part paid for the lease, and part paid for the building"—Batten was mentioned "Had no interest in his business; borrowed no money of him; have paid him money for horse hire. I did not pay him so much as 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. He used to exchange cheques for me. He has not dined at my house; I lived at Ingleside the house is not furnished. There is not furniture in every room; in one room, a back one, there is none. The furniture now in the house is the same as it was before the sale; 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of furniture was given back to me by the trustee, Bradfield; Hart, a broker, purchased for Jay, the auctioneer who was acting for Mr. Bradfield, the trustee. I have an appointment bringing me in 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; rent of Ingleside is 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; I keep no servant; I consider I am living rent free; I am holding the house for the mortgage, simply taking possession of the house. The trustee has all books I kept; I had a kind of ledger, sale book, rough journal or cash book no other book. Monies received on account of customers were entered on separate memoranda. I did not know I was insolvent until Christmas, 1873; I found I was short of money in February, 1874. In June, 1873, I did believe I was solvent. I never made out any balance-sheet. April 25, 1874, re-sale of property in Cambridge shire. Mr. Rudd lives at Enfield"—then he was re-examined—those are all the notes I have—the re-examina<lb/>tion was not taken down—Mr. Bignall appeared and asked leave to cross-examine the bankrupt, and I believe it was objected to—I have no recollec<lb/>tion that he proceeded with any examination, and probably that is the reason I have taken nothing down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If he was re-examined not a word has been taken down—I believe Mr. Bignall appeared for the defendant; he also appeared for one of the creditors, and there were other people there—I have nothing to refresh my memory as to whether there were interpolations or questions by different solicitors—the words "hopelessly insolvent" might have been Mr. Lewis' words, but the bankrupt adopted them—the last examination was on the 22nd December, 1874—the application was made on February 6th, and the order was filed on February 9th—the examination had been adjourned then and the adjourned examination has never been held yet, because he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187505030029"/>
               <p>ordered to be prosecuted—I think Mr. Bignall offered to answer any requisi<lb/>tion that might be made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After the examination an order was made on more than one occasion for him to file a cash account; the adjournment was to give him the opportunity of doing so—a further examination was of no use whatever without his filing a cash account; everything hinged on the cash account; requisitions were of no use till we got that—he simply said that he could not do so, because no accounts had been kept.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of Southampton Build<lb/>ings, Chancery Lane—I was not the original trustee, I was appointed trustee last October and saw the bankrupt about a fortnight afterwards—I had: received his books from the Edmonton Bankruptcy Court in his presence; a large number of them were of no use, with the exception of a cash-book and a ledger which was labeled "Day-book" and which was used as a sort of ledger—there are about forty-eight accounts in it, half of which commence in 1874—I sometimes find the debtor side on the right and sometimes on the left and sometimes the two are intermixed—on folio 1 4 the debtor account is on the right and the creditor on the left, and on folio 18 they are both on the same page—I also received a book called the day-book containing about 500 pages, it is not labelled "Day-book," but it appears to have been used as a day-book—it commences in 1872 and contains records of business up to May, 1874, during which time 11 pages only have been filled with the records of the business—I was not able to gain any information from the way in which the books were kept—this is the banker's pass-book and this is the sales-! book which commences in 1874—I also received a book of blank forms with counterfoils, apparently to be used to represent contracts for sales—one leaf of it has been torn out, but otherwise it has not been used at all—in conse<lb/>quence of not being able to glean information from the books, I applied to him from time to time for a cash account and he told me that he would give it, but he never performed, and I applied to the Court to compel him—his explanation of the deficiency was that it arose from the illness of his first wife and that he had expended a great deal of money in advertisements which he could not charge his customers with—he delivered to me two banker's pass-books from which I found cheques payable to himself amounting to 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., wages to 282<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., expenses 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., less 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. rates and taxes 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; amounting altogether to 738<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in thirteen months—the 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is for "self," 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for "wages," and 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for "expenses"—I find the name of Bradfield occurring frequently in the pass-book, but not in any of the other books—I find no account in the sold ledger referring to Bradfield—the first entry relating to Bradfield in Barnett &amp; Hoare's pass-book of 1873 is "10 June, Bradfield 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and on 19th June, I find Bradfield, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 4th July 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10th July 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 18th July 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 2nd August 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 23rd August 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 2nd September 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I am the wife of Major Butcher, we live at Waltham Abbey—the prisoner was introduced to me by Mr. Gardiner, his cousin, and in April, 1874, he and his wife called on us and the prisoner asked me if I would let him have a loan of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as he required 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make an; advance for a client of his to secure a large sale of freehold, leasehold, and copyhold at Cambridge, and if I would let him have 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he had the rest by him—I said that I would let him have it if it was perfectly secure because it would reduce my income—he said that it was as safe as the Bank of England, and that the writings were in his iron chest, and he appealed to his wife to say if it was not so—she said "Yes"—I said that I could not let him have the money then as I should be obliged to sell out some stock—about three days after that his wife brought me this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 16th <hi rend="italic">April</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to the witness, requesting her to let him have the</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">at once.</hi>) They afterwards came together for the money and he told me that he had just come from his brother Paul, who would let him have the money in a moment, only he had just been paying a large sum, and knowing them to be established people, I believed him—he repeated several times that the writings were in his iron chest—after that I let him have the money and took from him a bill of exchange—he said that he only required the money for a month, but Major Batcher said that it would be impossible to get the money in a month, and the bill had better be drawn for two months, which was done—it was dishonored and I have never got a penny—I afterwards let him have some furniture to sell for me which I had to spare—it realised about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but I never got a penny—I am now a creditor for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should not have parted with my money if I had not believed his statement.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "31, Victoria Road, Peckham, December 3rd, 1874.

Yours in confidence, C. Barker.") Browning called the following day and wished to know whether the references were satisfactory—I told him Mr. Graham had consented to give him credit—when he gave Mr. Barker as a reference, he said he was a gentleman living in a fine house and worth thousands of pounds—he also said "I am a retired publican, and have just sold my business for 6, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he gave me his address on the first occasion as 3, Stacey Terrace, Peckham—I first supplied him with goods on 9th December, to the amount of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a cart came and fetched the goods away, and they were delivered to a person who signed for Browning—on the 18th I supplied goods to the. amount 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the whole amount of goods supplied was 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., consisting of boiler tubes of different classes, gutters, pipes, stoves, ranges and such things—those goods were taken away from time to time in the same manner—he came again in January and brought a further order which I declined to execute until the goods which had been already delivered were paid for—he did not have the goods then—a day or two afterwards he brought this bill dated 18th January, drawn by Browning, and accepted by, Charles Barker payable to us for 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said it was the same Barker whom he had referred us to—I took that bill and believed it to be genuine—he asked if he could have the goods that he wanted before, and he had them on the 20th January—they amounted to 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we delivered further goods to the amount of about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making altogether 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods delivered—about 10th February he brought or sent another order which I declined to execute until the bill was paid—the bill passed through the banker's but was not paid—I did not present it myself—there is an endorsement on it "Gone away"—the matter was then placed in the hands' of the police—I communicated to Mr. Graham what had happened—we have never been paid for any portion of the goods.</p>

He has lodged in" my house with his wife Tory about a month. I know nothing of him"—Barker was then near the fire at the end of the room—I noticed him tearing some papers in his pocket and took possession of them—I produce them—as I took them from him he said "Be very careful with those papers, they are of great importance to me, they are communications between me and my solicitor"—I looked at them, some were addressed "Charles Harrison, 25, Quadrant Grove," and others "Charles Barker, 24, Chalcott Crescent, Regent's Park"—I asked him what his name was—he said "Harrison"—I said "The papers are not all addressed in the name of Harrison, some are addressed Barker"—he said "Yes, my correct name is Charles Harrison Barker.

                  </hi>. I live at Oxford Market, and have the letting of the shops there—on 26th November I let a shop, No. 6, in the market to Browning, who gave the name of Henry Byrne, 24, Chalcott Crescent Regent's Park—an agreement was entered into—he gave me two references which are on that paper, "Refer to Mr. Reynolds, hay salesman, 31, Vic<lb/>toria Road, Peckham; also, Mr. W. Kelly, 54, Regina Road, Tollington Park, Holloway"—our people in the office applied to those references and had very satisfactory answers—this was one—"Dear Sir, In reply to your enquiry respecting Mr. H. Byrnes, I beg to state he held a house of mine at Barnet fourteen or fifteen years; I regularly received my rent, 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, and I believe him to be a responsible man, and make no doubt you will find him a desirable tenant. Yours obediently, Samuel Reynolds"—I did not find him a desirable tenant—goods came to the shop, poultry, pigs, butter, eggs, and all manner of goods, which were taken away either in the morning or the night as they were delivered in the day by railway vans—I gave them notice to quit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Browning.</hi> I did not see you sign the agreement you went to the office with a clerk to sign it—Byrne did not owe any rent when he went away, because we always have two months down in advance—two months' rent was paid, and you were there two months all but one week—lots of things came there—I don't know whether they were paid for or not.</p>

Ours is a very old firm, and a very extensive one—it might be taken that we discharged the men, we told them that we should not do day work any more—they were told definitely on the Friday that they were discharged on the Saturday unless they chose to take our new terms—the first thing the deputation asked was why the men had been discharged on Saturday—the Oxford Street factory had been working on piece work—that which we proposed at Ogle Street was a different mode to that—the men did not tell me that if we chose to adopt the Oxford Street</p>

Howard's factory which is about 150 yards off—their dinner hour was the same as ours—none of the men ever spoke to me—I don't know whether or not I saw any of our old hands in the street at any time.</p>

We had about forty men employed at Ogle Street in November—Stride was one; Parr was foreman; Woodrow, Jewell, Carr and Russell—Jewell was the only man who remained in the service with the two boys—Carr is foreman of the polishers, and has been there all along; the notice would not apply to him—Woodrow did not remain, he went out on the Saturday or Monday—I don't quite know how Jewell was paid prior to the discharge of the men—afterwards he was paid by piece work I think—I can't say for certain, I mean lump work, I believe he had to make a contract, but I don't know, because some of the men began by working day time again, to finish the work that was in hand—I can't tell 'you whether Jewell was one of these, my foreman will be able to tell you—I believe all the men who entered the service after 24th November adopted the piece work system, the foreman can tell you—I know several:' of them began day work to finish the work in hand, and after that they went on at lump work—when they left nearly every man had one or two pieces of furniture that he was making to finish, and some of that was not finished for five or six months—during that time payment by the hour was not going on, they were working lump work—I think all the finishing was day work, and that has continued up to the present time—their may have; been one man working day work to finish—we manufacture our own cabinet work—during the strike we had to buy a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> things—a great many upholsterers in London do not manufacture, they are supplied by trade working masters—as a rule they are cheap houses and can under sell us, except in machine made furniture—our adopting the lump system would. not be quite the same thing—we should be more able to compete with the cheap houses, it would benefit the men—it would benefit both parties—it was not entirely to compete with the cheap houses; in part it was—I made a note of the time when I saw Reed (<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>), it was the second week in</p>

                  </hi>. I live in London Street, Fitzroy Square—I am now in the employment of Messrs. Jackson &amp; Graham, and have been so ever since the latter end of last May—in November I was a member of the Alliance Cabinet-makers' Society—I remember the notice which was given by Messrs. Jackson &amp; Graham, of their intention to alter the mode of payment—on Saturday 14th, a meeting was held on the subject at the King and Queen public-house, at the corner of Foley Street; it was a meeting of the workmen of the firm belonging to the society, Ham was the chairman, Weiler and Reed were present—there was a dis<lb/>cussion upon the subject of Messrs. Jackson &amp; Graham's proposed altera<lb/>tion, and an arrangement was made that none of us should go in to work at the factory again until it was announced by the executive committee that the shop should be thrown open again, it was closed until then—we were not to commence work again till we had orders from "the executive committee—it was proposed that a deputation should wait on Mr. Graham, to see if he could make arrangements for our coming into work again under the old system—a resolution was passed that we should sign the book each day at the society house, the King and Queen, between 10 and 12 o'clock in the morning and 2 and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> o'clock in the afternoon, to receive strike pay, that was a guinea a week, the regular strike pay—I heard something said by some of the executive, I won't be certain whether it was the" chairman or secretary, about advertising in the. different papers and sending to the different secretaries of the society to block all towns they had corres<lb/>pondence with to prevent men from being sent to fill our places—I spoke as to my desire of going back and trying the new system, and I was scarcely allowed a hearing—I said there would be other men to take our places from all parts of the country, only too glad to get in if we came out, and that was the answer I received, that they would advertise-after the deputation had waited upon Mr. Graham, there was another meeting, on the 16th—Mr. Ham took the chair—the matter was discussed by several members, I among the number, and each had a hearing but myself—there was one or two besides that were anxious to go back, but they said' they would abide by the decision of the executive committee, that they should like to go back and try it, but they would not if the executive wished" them not—Reed was present at that meeting, and I am almost certain Weiler was—one of the members; I can't say which, said "Had we not better keep some pickets on the. outside of the factory to watch the premises; I will go as one," and the chairman remarked "Don't be in too great a hurry, that will come on very likely by-and-bye; if you listen to me you will wait till you get orders from us"—the subject of picketing was dis<lb/>cussed among them, but nothing further, as I know of, arranged—on the Tuesday, I resigned my membership of the society, and on the Wednesday morning after breakfast I went back to my work in Ogle Street, and except when I have been ill I have been working there ever since—I did not see any picketing the first day—I did some five or six days after, or it may be a day or two more; I first noticed some men walking up and down outside the window close to the head of my bench where I could look out and have a view of them all day long—I don't remember who I first saw—it was in Ogle Street—ray place looks into Ogle Street, facing the church—it was generally after breakfast that I saw them walking up and down—I</p>

               <p>scarcely ever saw them before breakfast that I remember, and it continued up to 7 o'clock in the evening more or less—our breakfast is at 8 o'clock, we have half an hour—to the best of my recollection I have not. seen any<lb/>body when I have gone to work in the morning, not to notice them; sometimes it was dark in the morning—this picketing continued as far as I was cognisant of it up to the second Tuesday, in February, which was the Tuesday prior to my going to the Police Court on the Thursday—it was about the same each day during the whole of that time, from morning till evening; if I looked out at many different hours I would see them—I have seen from two to four men engaged in this occupation, sometimes two, some<lb/>times three, sometimes four—I have seen all the defendants engaged in it, some more than others, Matthews most—he was there very often, in all weathers—next to Matthews Weiler was most frequently there—I saw Ham one week almost every day, at intervals—being a member of the executive, he was similar to a sergeant walking about to see that, the men were on duty—Hibbert was the last I saw there—I saw him the last morning of any—he was walking up and down in the same way—I-saw Reed at several intervals, but not very frequently, he was doing the same as the others—I might have seen him before, but I was not aware who he was till I asked, and after that I noticed him—he stopped me one morning as I was going back from breakfast—I can scarcely: say which of the defendants I have seen together—I have seen. Reed in conversation with the others that were on picket more than once or twice—I have not seen the whole five together that I am aware of—but I have seen Reed with each of them at different times, walking up and down—have seen several of them together walking up and down, I can. scarcely tell which, because I little thought it would come to this, or I should have taken greater notice—when I have seen them, whether together or not, they have been doing the same thing as the others—I have been spoken to by Matthews, on one occasion—fol<lb/>lowed me into. the Wheatsheaf public-house in Upper Marylebone Street, when I was coming from my work going to my dinner he followed me along with some of the new hands till he saw where we went, and then he came in and commenced conversation about the work, and who the men were that were with me—he then asked me if I would have a glass of ale with him—I said I had no objection—after that he stood a glass of wine or gin, and he left me at the counter and turned his conversation to. the new hands—he tried to influence them, I can't say exactly what he said—he persuaded them by all means to come out—as near as I can recollect he said "Don't you think you are acting very foolish to stay in there and work, when if you come out we can get you other shops, as good as that or better"—they said they did not see as they were doing anything detrimental to their cause, they wanted work, they understood that they were giving very good prices 'and they had always been used to. piece work, therefore they should try it for the present—he then asked me if I could not influence them to come out, and why did 1 not come round to the society house with him on the next lodge night and get reinstated to, the society again—I said "<hi rend="italic">I</hi> am very well satisfied where I am, I am very comfortable at present, and until I see things take a change I wish to remain where I am"—I told him that all I wanted was good work and to be well paid for it, which I had got at present—he said he was surprised at me after my being a leading man in the society at Bristol as the secretary for some time, setting such a bad example—he wished me to come out and they would support me, and anything in</p>

               <p>reason that I wanted they would furnish me for coming out, he had got that authority—I still stood to my previous answer—when he was leaving there was another person in the trade with him that I was not acquainted with, and he said "Mind, I hope I shall see you on the next lodge night, I shall be looking out for you, I shall speak to them about you, we want to get you back again as you will be useful to us"—I did not go—I saw Matthews again a few days after—he frequently spoke to me on the subject, he would follow me—we generally went to this public-house, being the nearest I passed coming towards my home—on one occasion he said to me "Of-course you are aware you will be called a black, go where you will, and you will find that you won't be able to get any work in any shop in London or else-where where there is any society of ours held"—on one occasion Reed spoke to me as I was-coming from my breakfast, and just going into the factory, he beckoned me and said "How are you. getting on inside, how is things looking with the new hands" and while we were in the midst of conversation Mr. Rawlins, one of our foremen, came up and I went away into the factory—the picketing went on after these conversations just the same as ever.</p>

I com<lb/>menced working for Jackson and Graham—was secretary to the Cabinet-makers' Society at Bristol; it was a society that was understood to protect the interests of the men-against the employers—it is generally understood that a man is considered a black if he opposes himself to the rest of the society—I-have never treated any so I never had occasion for it—at the meeting on the Saturday I most emphatically opposed coming out from Jackson &amp; Graham's; I say that on my bath—I did not vote either time—there was a division; some went to the right and some to the left—the side I happened to be sitting, at the right, voted for coming out—I sat there, but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> did not vote—I never held up my hands—I did not know they were going to divide—I can't say how many went to, the other side of the room—I can't say that one went—I announced on that occasion that I differed from the rest—I had two or three says, and they put me down on each occasion—I heard more than two say they wished to go back; I heard two I am certain besides myself, but there were more than two—I can't say how many were there; all the men that were at work at Jackson &amp; Graham's—I did not go back to work on lump work; I went on at day work for a month or two, finishing the. work I had left unfinished.</p>

I should not get a job and should not stay there the picketing did not prevent my going Out, but I-would not go out on account of it—did not wish to be bothered about it; it made it unpleasant for me to go out, and that was why I kept in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker—previous to November I was working at Dyer's, at lump work—I went to Jackson &amp; Graham's to seek employment—to the best of my recollection some time in November, I could not swear to the date, I saw the foreman—I went to work on the Friday and have continued there up to the present time—on the Saturday after I went in I saw some men in the street, picketing, watching the premises—I have generally seen two or three, from about 8 a.m. till 5 o'clock—I recognise all the defendants as having been there—this continued till the commencement of this prosecution—none of the defendants spoke to me in the street—on the Saturday as I commenced work on the Friday, Matthews spoke to me in the Wheatsheaf in Great Marylebone Street—he asked me if I knew that I was doing the men who were out an injury, and likewise doing myself an injury in working there against them—he asked if I would discontinue working there, and why I left Dyer's, as I was pretty comfortable there—I said to better myself—he asked if I would come out—I said no—he asked if anything would induce me to come out—I said no—other persons were present, but not the prisoners—I knew some of them to be cabinet makers, and they said in Matthews' hearing that I should be blacked, and should not get a job anywhere if I continued working there—I was spoken to again between a week and a fortnight afterwards by Matthews at another public-house at the corner of Ogle Street, kept by Tenuant—it was on the same subject—he asked if I still meant to keep at work where I was, and I said "Yes"—a man named Bawling, belonging to the firm, came in and the conversation dropped, and I walked out—nothing occurred to me on leaving work from the men who were picketing.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187505030063"/>
               <p>out on an errand for my husband, leaving the prisoner there with my husband and the baby—I had given the baby some milk from a bottle before the prisoner came in, and there was very little milk left in the bottle, which I left on the sofa with the baby—I returned in I think less than a quarter of an hour and still found them there, but there was more milk in the bottle than there was when I went out—the baby looked sleepy, drowsy and very heavy—it was about 9.30 when the prisoner left, but I cannot tell to a minute or two—I smelt the bottle and noticed a very peculiar, smell and so did my husband—it was rather a smoky smell—the baby got worse, and my husband ran for a doctor who came and gave it some medicine and it vomited milk, and afterwards some thing with more of a browny tinge, and the smell of what came from the baby was the same as what was in the bottle—we had to pinch and beat the baby and had great difficulty all night to keep it awake—the doctor took the bottle away—the milk in the bottle came from a milk jug in the same room, there had been some taken out of the jug when I came home, and I had a small portion in a cup of coffee—the prisoner said when I came home that she had put a little more milk in the bottle, and the baby had the bottle when I came back, but I cannot say whether it was in its mouth—I have a basin of warm water to keep the bottle warm.</p>

Baxter, Poultry, Babbitt, Butter and Pork Dealer</hi>, 27, <hi rend="italic">George Street, Chelsea Market," stating that he would give the price named, and on receipt of the bicycle and invoice-would remit cheque for the amount.</hi>) I sent the bicycle by Great Western Railway to Paddington Station to be called for, addressed to J.

Baxter, potatoes, corn, and coal merchant"—I was not altogether satisfied and came up to town on Saturday, 6th February, and made inquiries, and on the Sunday I went to 27, George Street—I found there was no name over the door and I made inquiries from the people opposite—I then wrote to Baxter to meet the mare on the Monday, and arranged that a telegram should be sent—on Monday morning after</p>

"Are you Baxter"—he said "No, I work for Mr. Baxter"—I said that I expected to meet Mr. Baiter, with a cheque for the horse—he said "Mr. Baxter told me to say he was in the country and could not come, and he would send a draft or a cheque"—I said that I could hardly part with the horse in that way—he; offered to take, the horse to a livery stable if I would wait while he went to see if he could get the draft—I would not consent to that—I endeavoured: to ascertain something about him—I said that he was very young and I did not like trusting a horse with him, I did not think he was accustomed:; to take horses from railway, stations, and it was rather risky—he said that he was accustomed to fetch horses from railway stations—I said "Who for?"—he said that on two or three occasions he had fetched them for Mr. Baxter—after that I said "Very well, I will take the chance of it, and you shall have the horse"—the train was due in about two minutes—he said I will go out and be back when the train comes in"—he told me he was going to take the horse to George Street, Chelsea Market—he was then taken in custody.</p>

Baxter "All right, the mare will arrive at Waterloo on Monday, 1.30 p.m., send or bring cheque for the price"—I asked him who sent him for the horse, he said young Mr. Baxter had sent him from 27, George Street, he said "He gave me two sovereigns to pay for the carriage"—I found 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I asked him if he had been in the habit of working for Mr. Baxter, and he said he had done two or three jobs for him—he said he had fetched a horse from the station before—on 18th March I went to 20, Quadrant Grove, Kentish Town—I saw Barker leave that house and I ultimately took him in custody for conspiring with one J.

I was on duty in Great Preseott Street, Whitechapel—I saw the prisoner And a man not in custody, loitering at the corner of Magnum Passage—I con<lb/>cealed myself in a dark place and watched them—I saw Bamford come out of St. Mark's street very drunk—the prisoner and the other man crossed the street and stopped him—I saw him fall. And they fell on the top of him in a kneeling position—a soon as they saw me they got up and crossed the street to where I had previously seen them standing—the prisoner spoke to the other man and they walked up a passage—I followed them—the other man was carrying this hat—the prisoner looked back and saw I was following them and the other man threw the hat down and ran away, at the same time the prisoner threw this handkerchief down in a doorway—I ran and caught hold of him—I told him I wanted him—he said "What for?"—I said "You have just robbed a man in Great Prescott Street"—he said "Not me; I have been to see my cousin"—I picked the handkerchief up and said "You shrew this down"—he made no answer—I took him back into Great Prescott Street where I found Bamford close to where I saw him fall—had no had—he said—"That's the man that knocked me down"—I asked him where his hat-was—he pointed to the prisoner and said "That man stole it"—I asked him if he had lost his handkerchief and he said "Yes"—I produced the hat and handkerchief, and he said they-were his property.</p>

I should expect to find in convulsions to a certain extent—the congested state of the brain, the chest, and the. lungs, might be explicable by the fact that the child had died of convulsions—mucous in the mouth which gathered there in. a violent attempt at respiration would not be likely to remain unless the effort to breathe continued for some considerable time—I found nothing at all in the stomach, no water—that is a thing I should expect to find, but not always—it is an indication</p>

               <p>of death by suffocation from drowning, but not a leading one; it is very often found, but not always—the stomach was completely empty—the state of the brain and stomach could all be accounted for by the fact that the child died from convulsions—both ventricles of the heart were charged with fluid blood; that would be adverse to convulsions; it would be impossible for the child to die of convulsions and have fluid blood in the ventricles—with that one exception you may take it that the general appearances all indicated that convulsions might be the cause of death—it was only at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> that I discovered the fluid blood—you would not find the protrusion of the tongue in convulsions; I should say that would be quite incompatible and impossible—the tongue would not hang from the mouth after death if it had not done so before death—the" mouth was shut on the tongue.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons—either the inflammation of the brain alone or the inflammation of the lungs alone, would amply account for death—the inflammation of the lungs had materially weakened the child and rendered its state more serious—the other organs were healthy—I saw the mark round the throat—I do not think a handkerchief tied sufficiently tight to make that mark would affect the inflammation of the brain in any way.</p>

A. Millar's handwriting—I have been acquainted with Mr. Millar, for many years—I asked him his business, and he said he bad come over from Ireland, on 27th October, in charge of four horses, hunters, which had been sold by his firm in Dublin to a Mr. Alfred Hughes, of High Street, Aldershot, through Hughes' agent, one Michael Hunt, that the price agreed was two at 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; and two at 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, making together 408<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that Michael Hunt had paid his firm ten 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes on account, leaving 308<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he had come over at his father's request to settle the matter, that he had seen Mr. Hughes on one or two occasions, that Hughes wanted a reduction in the price of the horses; that he had written to his father about it, and his father declined to make any reduction—I think he used the words "To sell the horses over again"—that he wanted proceedings taken against Mr. Hughes to recover the 308<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—then asked him for the Christian and surnames of the partners in his firm—he told me there-were his father, Thomas Haughton, and himself, that his name was James Haughton—I asked their address and he told me "The Q uay, Dublin"—he asked me if there would be any necessity for him to stop in London—I told him "No"—he said'he had placed the horses at Burton's Livery Stables, Marylebone Road, and that he had served Hughe's with notice that the horses were there at his risk and expenses—I told him the matter should be attended to—he then said "I apologise for troubling you, but Mr. Millar was in a great hurry when he wrote the introduction—was just going into Court, and when I came over I had no idea there would be any difficulty with Mr. Hughes—I am stopping at the Euston Hotel, and I am afraid I may run short of money, as you do not want me to stop in London, I shall be glad to get back to-night, could you oblige me by exchanging my firm's cheque; Mr. Millar will be very happy to give you the money for it, or you can pay it into your banker's"—I rang the bell and my cashier came in, and I wrote out my cheque and prisoner wrote</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Brussels—in March, 1872, I first had some business relations with the prisoner respecting these pictures—I sent him several pictures to London on many occasions to sell and subsequently, not hearing from him I wrote—the letter was returned to me by the postoffice—some time afterwards I saw the prisoner at Brussels, in March, 1873—I saw him through a window and went and asked him for the pictures and he said he had them no longer—I explained the matter to, the Queen's prosecutor and the prisoner was taken into custody—an arrangement was then made, by which the prisoner sold his furniture for my and a Mr. Vanderton's benefit—the arrangement was to pay us for the pictures that he could not account for—the amount, due at that time was 1, 950 francs (78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—after the sale about 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. remained due to me—prisoner. Afterwards came to see me and told me he would make a clean breast of it, that he had disposed of the pictures in different pawn shops and now that he had sold his furniture to pay for them he was a totally broken man, inasmuch as the pictures were all in different pawnbroker's hands in the city of London; but that the tickets were of a certain value and would I buy them of him—to see that he was not playing me false I wrote to the. different pawnbrokers as to the authenticity of these tickets—having done this I agreed to give him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling for himself and to take the pictures-out of the pawnbroker's hands at my own expense—this was to settle all his claims on the pictures, and they were to become my individual property—I came to London with the prisoner bringing with me a picture "The Arming of Minerva at Vulcan's Forge"—he had had that picture in his possession for re-varnishing—it was not one of the pictures I had sold to him—the man of whom I bought it gave it to the prisoner to re-varnish—it was deposited at Thomas Newell's in Jermyn Street—I then redeemed the pictures he (prisoner) had sold to me and deposited them also at Mr. Newell's—it was about April 15th, 1873, that I came to London—the prisoner returned</p>

               <p>to Brussels to take his trial and I followed—in June or July of that year I heard some report that induced me to come to London—I went to Mr. Newell's office, and finding some pictures had been removed I went to Vine Street to take out a warrant against the prisoner—I saw him once in Richmond Street, West End—I could not say the date—that was on a subsequent visit to London, about August or September the same year—I asked him for my pictures back as I did not want to be bothered in the matter—he then said if he had them The would give them me, he had dis<lb/>posed of: them, and if he had any trouble in the matter he would knife me if he had to go across the water for it—that was said in French—there were thirteen pictures missing—"The Arming at Vulcan's Forge" was amongst those stowed away at Mr. Newell's, and which he told me he had made away with—I went over to Brussels the next morning—this was 8 o'clock at night—some time after, in this year, I received information about one of my pictures, and I went to Richmond Street on the 14th of last month, I believe, and saw it in the window—it is by Teniers—I can identify it—I told the prisoner that it was my picture, and he then said something to me in Flemish which I did not understand, and the detective took him in charge—I have discovered some of the other pictures—two have been produced by Mr. Cox, pawnbroker—five I stopped some fortnight after the robbery, and it has been at Vine, Street ever since—I am in no way indebted to the prisoner—he owes me about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I bought the pictures and returned to Brussels there was an arrangement by which, if the prisoner brought a customer to Mr. Newell, he (prisoner) was to be allowed 10 percent.—I made no arrangement giving him authority to re<lb/>move them from Mr. Newell's—I would not have allowed him to have the pictures outside the door.</p>

When I asked Mr. Newell three or four months afterwards if any pictures of mine had been sold he said "No, the prices for your pictures are a great deal too high," and he then asked me to make out another list which I did at a lower price than the former one. If, therefore, these pictures were not my property, that I could not have done either; I should not have thought of selling the pictures for 2, 500 francs—40 odd pictures—when for 15 of them alone I had paid to Wilkin<lb/>son and others 5, 000 francs. I want to refer here that my commercial affairs have since 1862 been placed under guardianship under some liquidator or official person named by the Court in Brussels and Mr. Wil<lb/>kinson was fully aware of this, and therefore profited by this fact to my prejudice.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Kettledrum Tavern; St. George's Street, East—I assist my father—on Sunday evening, the 14th March, there were three sailors in the public-house when the prisoner came in and joined them and they called for brandy and soda—the prisoner was not drunk—I cannot say whether he had been drinking—he appeared to be sober—he spoke to the sailors, they appeared to know him and they spoke to him and addressed him by his name "Antonio"—I thought they had been shipmates together and they treated him on one or two occasions to lemonade and so on, and there were three sodas called for and brandy in each—at the time they were called for the prisoner had gone outside when put on the bar the prisoner came in and he took hold of one of the glasses and said "good health" or something of that kind—he spoke in English, and the man who called for the drinks said "You put that down,</p>

               <p>Antonio," that it belonged to him or Jack or somebody, and the prisoner looked very savage and dashed it down, and the party who called for the drinks then said "Call for what you like"—prisouer said "Come out, you b," and opened the door, and the party tried to laugh it off and said: "Nothing of that kind, come and have a drink"—the prisoner-didn't take any notice of that and kept on magging for twenty minutes at least—I thought it would be wise for me to go round and try. to pacify him—I spoke to him and said' "You must not make this raw here to night, Sunday night, these men don't want: to quarrel with you, they seem to be friends of yours," and he said <hi rend="italic">Vot do you want you</hi> b----—?"—I said "I want nothing, you must keep quiet"—while I was speaking one of the sailors caught hold of his scarf round his neck and up with his other-hand to hit him as I thought—put my right hand up before the prisoner's face and the other hand to release the prisoner from the other's grip—while—had my two hauds up and trying to keep order I felt the knife—I could not see him take the knife out—he thrust it into my left thigh and then into my right on the outside—I then put "my right hand up as I thought to protect myself from further violence, and he gave my hand a cut <hi rend="italic">here</hi> just outside the doorway—he made three or four stabs at me which ran through my side in four places—then, I believe, he made three or four more which did not strike me—the knife was afterwards picked up on the kerb by Collins-two customers came across the road and the prisoner made to go off, and got four or five doors further from our house and they ran after him and he was taken into custody—they met a policeman at 200 or 300 yards—he was taken to the statioin—was under the doctor's care for nearly four weeks, I believe, within three or four days—a fortnight last Friday I came out—I bad never seen the prisoner before—he was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi>). On 19th, April, about 3 o'clock—I was in Tower Dock, a very little distance from Tower Hill, with. Halse and Forrester—there-was a great crowd on the free opening of the Tower, there was also a crowd round a man with performing cats—watched them and saw the prosecutor come into the crowd—Anderson placed himself by his side, and Thompson immediately behind—they remained there a minute or two, left and crossed Tower Hill, and Anderson gave something to Thompson, who looked at it, and they <hi rend="italic">went through Savage Gardens, and Crutched Friars, to the corner of Mark Lane, wheh they</hi> appeared <hi rend="italic">to notice</hi> that they were being followed—they commenced</p>

               <p>running, crying out "Stop thief!"—100 or 200 gentlemen were coming out from the Corn Exchange, and they wedged them in—Thompson ran up a court where there was no thorough fare, he put his hand in his trousers' pocket, and threw something up against a lot of cases against the wall—we searched the cases and found this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced) in a</hi> number of pieces—Halse picked it up—when I saw the prosecutor there, I noticed a chain hanging from his pocket—I conveyed Thompson to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prosecutor did not go into the middle of the crowd, but outside—I did not know any one else behind him except the prisoners and myself; I was standing by, just on the pavement—I, was watching them for some time—I did not see either of them take the watch—I noticed the chain gone from the prosecutor's waistcoat—I did not speak to him—I did not ask him whether he had lost anything, because I knew he had—he went away and I saw him afterwards at the station—if he had not gone to the station we might have had an indictment here for stealing the watch of somebody unknown—I am guided by circumstances in asking if anything is lost; perhaps I know how to manage those things better than you do had spoken to the prosecutor, the prisoners would have been-off. and I should have got neither prisoners nor watch—it is very possible if I had spoken to the prosecutor that they would have got away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Petticoat Square, and am a cigar-maker—on the night of the 29th March I was in a barber's shop in Wentworth, Street—when I came out I saw a man named Driscol outside—I knew him before—there were a good many others outside—I saw the prisoner alongside of me—Driscol had his coat off, and wanted to fight—I touched him on the shoulder, and told him to go home—he said he would fight anyone—he punched me on the cheek, and I told him not to be foolish, but to go home—I said "I don't want to fight," and he hit me again-a third time he made an attempt, and of course I defended myself, and I was thrown down by Driscol, and I found my left arm being ripped up—I could not see what it was done with—Driscol had hold of me—I did not see the prisoner at that time—when I was going off to the hospital my attention was called to the prisoner who was in custody, and they said "This is the man that done it"—I went to the station, and Dr. Phillips, the divisional surgeon, was called to, dress, my arm—I was laid up nearly six weeks; it is getting well now.</p>

Solomon Green. I live at 72, Goulston Street, and keep a beer shop—on the night of 29th March I was in Wentworth Street, and saw Mendoza there and a man named Driscol-Driscol was fighting with several-persons—there was a crowd—Carthy was there, and he and Driscol were wrangling together—Carthy was endeavouring to get, his coat on and then he was pulling it off and then on again, and Mendoza came out of the barber's shop and tried to get them away—Mendoza and Driscol wrestled, and they were first down on the ground and then up again—I heard-Mendoza say he was stabbed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 2, Claremont Villas, Kew Bridge—on the morning of lst April I was called to 11, Spring Grove, I got there a few minutes past 7 o'clock—I saw the prosecutor in the front room standing up—I found three small wounds on the back of his head; they were bleeding very slightly—I went out into the scullery, got some water and washed the back of his head, and clipped his hair—I found the skin blackened; I probed the wound, and to the best of my belief found three bullets, one in each wound; I detected them with the probe—they were in a triangle, at a rough guess, about the size of the palm of my hand—on the left cheek bone there was a small cut and the side of the face was bruised—also examined the prisoner and found a cut on his forehead—he said "It was caused in the struggle, we fell through the fence and I cut my head"—I found this pistol on the mantelshelf in the front room—I said to the prisoner ""'Have you had the pistol long?"—he said "Many years"—I asked him when it was last charged—he made no reply—I said "How many bullets were there in the pistol?"—he did not answer—Isent the prosecutor to the West London Hospital—we were looking for the chopper, and I said to the constable "Where is the chopper?"—the prisoner said "It is in the wash-house," and it was found there—the wounds were not in themselves dangerous—I had never seen either the prisoner or his son before—when I first saw the prisoner he was on the ground detained by Mr. Flack—his appearance struck me; I believed myself to be in the presence of a man affected with progressive general paralysis of the insane—I was led to that conclusion by his unnaturally calm manner under the circumstances, a child like expression of face, and eyes that I can only describe as being hot, chronically inflamed, but not such inflammation as would attract common attention, not acute inflammation—when I spoke to him I noticed the trembling lips and the halting manner of speech characteristic of general</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187505030108"/>
               <p>paralysis—I afterwards saw him walk, he had a shuffling, staggering gait which would tend still more to coufirm my impression—he seemed to have no idea whatever of the gravity of the offence he had committed—when I told him that he would be taken to prison he asked for his spectacles so that he could read there—I saw him afterwards the same morning at the Hammersmith Police Court and he seemed like a man in a dream—the opinion 1 formed was that he was affected with general paralysis of the insane—I had no reason to suppose that those appearances were assumed—I did not see him afterwards until I saw him here yesterday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am a member of the College of Surgeons, a licentiate of the faculty of Glasgow, and a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company—when I saw him yesterday in the dock he still had the same appearance of face, a face almost without wrinkles—I was for nearly four years resident in the City of London Asylum, during which time I had many cases of general paralysis of the insane under my. charge—the symptoms I observed in these cases entirely coincided with those that I observed in this—I do not con<lb/>sider that I had sufficient opportunity of observing the prisoner to come to a definite conclusion as to his mental state, but his bodily condition would lead me to believe that his mental state was affected—I have found persons of this kind suffering; from, delusions; it is frequently a marked symptom—those delusions take several forms; I have known it take the ft form of intense dislike towards members of their family without any apparent ground—I do not consider a person in that state of health to be of sound mind—the delusions existing in such cases are very numerous; a common delusion is that they are in danger of some violence, or of being attacked, and they provide themselves with means of resisting the attack.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The earliest age at which I have known progressive paralysis of insanity is twenty-eight, and the oldest sixty-six—speaking from my own experience, the average age is between thirty and forty-five—the symptoms are not generally preceded by a paralytic stroke or seizuro—you seldom have those symptoms after a long interval in a person who has had a paralytic stroke; it. is generally the result of a damaged brain—I should not expect to find delusion manifest itself previous to an act of violence—I have known the; delusion to manifest itself suddenly—the patient in, these cases is usually insane some time before it is noticed, and. some indecent, violent or murderous act, brings the patient before a Court of Law; then in some caaes he is recognised as being insane; in others cases he is tried, con<lb/>victed and sent to prison, and afterwards found to be insane and sent to an asylum—I am speaking of instances I have seen in ray own experience, cases in which I have been professionally engaged—I was assistant medical officer at the City of London Asylum, one of the two, medical officers in charge that is eighteen months ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the West London Hospital, Hammersmith—on 1st April the prosecutor was brought there, and remained under my charge until he left—I have heard the description given of the wounds by Mr. Weatherhead—the wounds in themselves were not dangerous individually, but when taken collectively I considered the case exceedingly dangerous—at the commencement his life might have been in danger—I examined the wounds, and extracted from them two pellets of lead, which produce—I examined him again yesterday, and discovered a lump beneath the scalp, which I have no doubt is a third pellet John Sycamore. I am a smith, and live at 2, Prospect Place, Kew</p>

               <p>Bridge—about the middle of March the prisoner brought this pistol to me and asked me to take the top barrel out; he had got the two bottom barrels out—I had to put it in a vice to get it out; it had got rusty; I oiled it and filed it and repaired the wards and gave it back to him; he waited while I did it—you can load the pistol either at the muzzle or by taking the barrel out—the first barrel would not fire before I altered it.</p>

I am the wife of Frederick Powell, provision merchant, 98, York Road—about 1 p.m. on the 28th April the prisoner knocked at the door—I was called to the door—he said "I have brought you a box from the Great Western Railway, for which you will have to pay me half a crown"—he handed me this consignment note—I asked him to let me look at the box, but he at first refused; afterwards he let me look at a part of it—I had my suspicions, and refused to give him the money unless he gave me the box in my hand, and he ultimately gave it me—he wished to have the half-crown before he gave me the box—I preferred seeing the box—I asked the prisoner to wait till I got change for half a sovereign—I took it into the parlour to my father and broke it open; it contained a brick <hi rend="italic">very</hi> carefully wrapped in brown paper, and the box was tied very well and tightly—I asked the prisoner to come inside while I went for change for half a sovereign, and I went for a constable—I saw a man outside whom I believe I have seen before.</p>
