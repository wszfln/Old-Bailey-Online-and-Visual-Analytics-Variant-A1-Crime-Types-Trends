               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>S. Count. He used to write for my husband, my husband writes for stationers. After that he was charged with taking a pair of breeches that were missing; he owned he did take them, and sold them near the Seven Dials; I went there and found them; he mentioned his selling the waistcoat at another shop, where Mr. Moore found that.

            . On the 26th of Sept. last I came from Deptford in the evening, at Saltpetre-bank I met OHarra and Kenedy, OHarra said, What chear? I said, Brave and hearty; said he, will you take a cruise? With all my heart, said I; they took me to a house on Saltpetre-bank, then we went through an alley in company with one Swinney, OHarra asked him to come with us, he is about 17 years of age, coming through a narrow passage towards Wellclose-Square, OHarra stopped a man, the man cried out, they knocked his hat off, and took it up, he making a noise we got off immediately, and went to the New Road; there was a man on horseback, I took him to be a bricklayer's labourer, OHarra and Kenedy pulled their knives out, and said, if he made any noise they would cut his throat; there was a gentleman coming along, the man on horseback called out, These men have robbed me; OHarra and Kenedy left the man on horseback, and came to Mr. Pitfield, and stopped him, and demanded his money, and while they were searching his pockets I took his watch, and left them; after that Kenedy came up, and said, Here is 2 s. which is all I have got; I said, I had his watch. OHarra came after me to a field towards Stepney, and pulled out a barber's hone, and some halfpence, and said, that was all he had got; then we went and drank in East Smithfield, from thence we went towards Saltpetre-bank, where we met another man; then OHarra and Kenedy brought Nonorkan, there were five of us then together; we went to the New Road, the first man that came past was the prosecutor, and another man with him, Barret ran up to him, and stopped him, I took his watch and buckles, Kenedy took his hat and wig, he gave me the wig, and the hat to Barret; another man coming past Barret immediately stopped him, and demanded his money with his knife drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. What side was OHarra on to the prosecutor at the time you took the things?</p>
               <p>Folliott. I believe he was the man that ran after the man that ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. from Kenedy. How long have you known me?</p>

            . I am turnkey to the Tower goal, the prosecutor came to our house the morning after the robbery, and told us he had lost his watch and buckles; in came a sailor and said, he had seen the watch, wig and buckles; he went out and soon returned and said, the man that had them was fast asleep; we went and took him, it was Folliott, he had the wig on, which the prosecutor swore to, I found the hook in his pocket, (producing it) he named Barret and O'Harra being with him, they were both at our door just before, but were gone away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing of Kenedy?</p>
               <p>Grief. No, he did not then, but he did before the Bench of Justices, and two more that are not taken. When Barret was taken, he had the hat on, and the prosecutor swore to it. When we had got O'Harra, he said, Let me go along and be evidence, and by the Holy Ghost, I'll tuck them. Kenedy was desired to be evidence, he would not, and when he found the other was admitted, then he cry'd, and owned to the robbery.</p>

            . On the Monday night this robbery was committed, I was coming home, I heard a noise and was told, a man had been robbed; I went down and found Caen, he was put in my charge. The next morning the prosecutor came and said, he was none of the men; the next morning came a sailor and said, he believed he knew the men that did the robbery; I was at the taking the evidence, when he was asleep. After that we heard O'Harra and Barret went by the Tower-goal, we went into Muckle Roy's house, there we took them, the hat was found on Barret. On the Thursday following they were ordered to be re-examined, I said to Kenedy when at the Coach and Horses, White-chapel, you seem to be a young man, make yourself an evidence; he denied knowing any thing of the matter, Then Folliott came down, and we were ordered up; when Kenedy found Folliott was admitted evidence he cried, and said something to the men, what it was I</p>

I asked him the name of his captain; he said, captain Harvey, I asked him if any of the lieutenants were stain at the Havanna, and their names; he did not know either of their names; he could not answer any other question that was asked him. I told him he was come to receive money falsly, and that I would send for the constable, and take him up he did not receive the money, but confessed he was put on to do it by one that belonged to the ship, name

Mr. Dixon came in the mean time, and after I had told him the affair he sent for a constable and he was taken to the Mansion-house, there he confessed that his name was Darby Quin, and that he was a waiter at a public-house in Berry-street, St. James's, and that this Rearden had used his master's house, and had borrowed money of him to the amount of 11 s. and when he asked him for it he told him if he would put on his cloaths, and go to the King's head, and demand the money in the name of Campbell that he would pay him half, and the rest of the money this Rearden was to have.

I went to Mr. Puget, and found him in his compting-house, and told him I had got a bill which I believed to be a forgery, it not being his hand writing. Stevens was called in, he gave an account who he lived with, and how he came by it; it was thought proper to detain Mr. Stevens till we could be better informed, and in the afternoon Mr. Puget, Mr. Brown, his clerk, myself, and Mr. Stevens went to Sir

He said, he should be ready in about an hour and an half; when I went to him, he said he was not very well, and a gentleman was to call upon him; so I went by myself; I thought the bill was not good, seeing the date was not set properly for the payment. He told me the drawer lived at the Grecian Coffee-house, Temple-Bar. I went to the Bank to Mr. Jewson, he said he had no order to pay it, and desired I would go along with him to Mr. Puget; I went with him; Mr. Puget asked me, how I came by it? I told him; then he went to the Grecian Coffee-house to enquire after Mr. Parnell; the person told us there had been such a person there, but he was gone to Ireland. They took me back into the city to the Bank, and from thence to Justice Fielding, who examined how I came by the bill; I gave him the same account as before; then we went and brought Mr. Quin before him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you part with Broughton that morning?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I parted with him between 10 and 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Broughton before?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I had seen him at Mr. Quin's house several times, as I have gone there about business. Broughton said, Parnell was a relation of his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where Parnell liv'd?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Lawrance Quin. I received this bill of the prisoner at the bar, (holding it in his hand) the minute I got it, I past it to Mr. Stevens as cash; Broughton owed me a great deal more than that.</p>
               <p>When was this?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176310190015"/>Quin. This was the 28th of last month. The prisoner lodged with me, off and on, 6 or 7 years. When this came to be enquired into I did not see him till I met with him in Thames-street, he never came home that night, nor the next night; he was advertised several times; I found him concealed between the bed and the tick.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner at the bar a great many years, I never saw any harm by him, only that of getting in liquor, till this happened; that very day that this happened I had some business in Westminster, I live in Bishop's-gate-street, I went to his house, he was drinking at the Barley-mow; I went there, and called for a pint of beer, and asked for him, he happened to be drinking in a box with a soldier, I put my pint to their pot, we drank three pots and a pint, we shook hands, and all parted in peace; coming out at the door, he said, Adam, will you go to supper with me? he said, he had three rabbits, and he would smother them with onions. I went with him to his lodgings, and supped with him, his eldest daughter was there, and I think two more, he put some by for his wife and them; after some time his wife came home, and as soon as she came in he went and fetched part of the rabbits, and she eat; sometime after this his wife and he had words together, she struck him several times, and used him very ill; I parted them, and after that she got at him, and struck him again several times in the face; I went and sat down in a chair, she flew at him again, they were bustling and fighting together in the entry, the young fellow, the deceased, happened to come in, in the God speed; he struck the prisoner once or twice, I heard the blows, but did not see it, I was at the farther end of the house. After he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176310190017"/> came into the house I sat down, and reasoned the case with him, and asked him if he knew the consequence of striking a man in his own house? he made answer, and said, if he does not like this or that I'll give him more to-morrow, or something to that purpose; after that I drank to him, I had never seen him in my life before. The prisoner's wife sat between the young man and I, she and he were talking together, the prisoner came in at the door at the time we were talking and drinking, he made a blow at the deceased, and directly he jumped out of his chair, and said he was stabb'd. I jumped up, and took him in my arms, and said, For God or Christ's sake don't go out of the room, and held him fast; he dragged me out of the room into the passage, and down a step or two into the street, and got loose from me, and ran down the street cryi ng he was stabb'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any weapon in the prisoner's hand?</p>
               <p>Robertson. No, I did not till after the murder was done, I saw it when before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he come to New?</p>
               <p>Robertson. He came fronting him as he was sitting in a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. What space of time might there be between the two blows given in the entry to the prisoner, and this happening?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I believe it might be four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner go after them two blows?</p>
               <p>Robertson. Whether he went out, or up stairs, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. As you did not see New strike them two blows, how do you know who gave the blows?</p>
               <p>Robertson. The deceased gave the blows; I know by the conversation between him and me afterwards; he said he would give him more on the morrow if he did not like that; that was when the prisoner's wife, New, and I were sitting talking together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was out of the room for five hours.</p>
               <p>Robertson. He was not in the house while New was there, for the blows that past were in the passage, and after that I never saw him till he came in and did the mischief;</p>
               <p>Q. What induced the deceased to struggle and get away when you would have kept him in the room after he received the blow?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I cannot tell. After the prisoner had stabbed him, he went directly out of the room; where he went, I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blood?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I did, I had some on my shirt.</p>

            . Betwixt 8 and 9 o'clock on Friday night last, I had almost done supper, I heard a man by my door cry, I am stabbed, I am stabbed; I went out. They knowing I had been constable, came to me and cry'd, for God's sake go out, Mr. Sinderbury has killed a man; I went to his house and asked where he was, I was told he was run up stairs, they desired I would not go up, for he says, he will kill the first man that comes to him; I went into his lower room and asked for a stick, I found a churmstaff handle, I took it and desired some people to follow me up stairs. There were some women followed me, I begged they would go down and send up some men, they did. I said, Sinderbury, open the door; he said, he would not; I said, you are a villain, you have killed a man, and I am determined to take you; he begged I would not come into the room. He had a knife in his hand, which I saw, (producing a large long sharp pointed knife) this is it. He came walking round, I said, down with the knife, or the first blow I give you I'll kill you. I was not in the room, but I saw him through a place where some lath and plaister was down; he came there and looked at us, I struck at him, he walked back again, I said, will you open the door? and several times pushed my foot against it; as the door opened, he whipt the knife under his coat, and I thought went to lodge it in his apron-string behind him, the string gave way, and the knife fell down; he said, you say I had a knife in my hand, where is it? and held his hands up; I jump'd upon him and laid hold of both his wrists, and with assistance brought him down and took him before the sitting Gentlemen at Guildhall. Then I went back to the deceased and said, I understand you have been sadly used, who has done it? said he, Mr. Freeman, Sinderbury has stabbed me, and if I die, he has killed me; I asked him, how it came about? he said, he went in for a halfpenny worth of milk, Sinderbury and his wife had some words; he said, Sinderbury, you are always beating your wife, what is the matter? that the prisoner made no answer, but trod on my feet, and I was ready to saint, that I gave him a push, and pushed him from me, then Sinderbury went up stairs and came down again with a knife in his hand and stabbed me.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you see the knife fall from the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I did not, but I found it in the room where he stood, with one side all over bloody.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176310190018"/> I went to the deceased again and asked him the same over again, he told me the same story he had before, and said he hoped he would be hang'd: I said you should not think of that now you are dying, then he said, he hoped God would forgive him, and he did.</p>

            . I was coming out at my own door, and the deceased came crying along. He was stabb'd, he was stabb'd! He came running into my arms, saying, Dear Mr. Terry I am stabb'd. I said, By whom? He said, Mr. Sinderbury, Mr. Sinderbury has stabb'd me, what shall I do! He ran all on one side and bled, I never saw a man bleed so in my life: He ran thro' my passage; I went to Sinderbury's house, Mr. Freeman came, he catch'd up a churm-staff, and I a broom and pull'd the head of it off; he went up stairs first, some women followed betwixt me and him, he shov'd them down; he said, Mr. Sinderbury, open the door; he said he would not, d - n you, you are all a parcel of bailiffs and rogues. Mr. Freeman kept pressing against the door, at last it flew open, I will not say it was by Mr. Freeman's pressing, or by the prisoner; the prisoner stood with his knife in his left hand, I said, dear Mr. Freeman, there is the knife now; the prisoner clapt his hand behind him, then Mr. Freeman ran up to him and laid hold of him, and I took hold of one hand, and we took him to Guild-hall, Westminster. The next day I went to the deceased, and asked him how he did, he said, he went to Sinderbury's for a halfpenny worth of milk, and Mr. Sinderbury went up stairs he believed and stay'd about 4 or 5 minutes, while he was talking to Sinderbury's countryman about how he behaved in quarrelling with his wife, that he came in and gave him a stab without any words at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about what passed in the entry?</p>
               <p>Terry. He said, Sinderbury violently stamped on his toes in the entry, and he believed he did give him a slap on the face with his open hand, he called out much on a pain in his breast; I went in again and said, Tom, you are not a man for this world; he said, I am afraid not. And he told me the same again.</p>
               <p>Thomas Lane. I live in the same house with the deceased. I was sitting in my house and heard a great cry, I am stabbed, I am stabbed! the deceased was brought up stairs to his mother's door, his mother got him by one arm, he said, Sinderbury has stabbed me, Sinderbury has stabbed me. I saw all the blood on the ground where he lay, he had not time to get into his mother's room; I ran down stairs, and saw Mr. Freeman and Mr. Terry with the prisoner, I went with them to Guildhall, he was committed to the Gatehouse, while I was there, the deceased was taken away to the Infirmary bleeding.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, upon examining the body of the deceased we found a wound, which externally in the skin was about an inch in length, it passed between two ribs, went through part of the lungs, and to the heart; it was extraordinary the man had not died immediately, there was a little circumstance in the direction of the wound that the blood was not discharged from the heart at once, but gradually.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. How far was the wound in the body?</p>
               <p>Watson. There must be great violence used, because two of the ribs were divided. I imagine the back of the knife went through the under rib, it was betwixt the 6th and 7th ribs; it went through the lungs, through the perricardium, and to the heart; it went in at the lower part of the heart, and out at the upper; he died on the 16th of October.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am not guilty of the crime; I never saw the man with my eyes, before he came into the house, and before he mentioned a word he gave me two if not three blows; I asked him the reason of it, and said, I don't know you. He followed my wife, and said, D - n your eyes or limbs, if you don't like that you shall have more, and if he did not do for me to night he would to morrow. I thought he had got some bad gang, having never set my eyes on him before, (he never asked for any milk) what should he do in my house? I ought to stand upon my own defence; why should I not strive to get him out as fast as I could? He sat himself down in a chair, I ordered him out of the house, he would not go, we struggled together about the room: I said, If you will not go I shall do you an injury. I believe in the struggle, in getting him out of the house, the knife might do him an injury; I did not know who he had got with him; it behoves every man to take care of himself in his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Robertson. Who was in the passage when the deceased came into the house?</p>
               <p>Robertson. Nobody but the prisoner and his wife, struggling and fighting together.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176310190019"/>Q. Was any body in the room with you at that time?</p>
               <p>Robertson. No, nobody; I was sitting down in a chair</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not part them?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I parted them twice, and did not think proper to part them any more.</p>

I am an officer, on the 3d of this instant I was sent for to Mr. Stevens's house, there was the prisoner and prosecutrix sitting together in the back parlour, there were a pair of ruffles lying on a table; the prosecutrix said, she had lost a pair of ruffles, and had found them in the prisoner's box that was open; the prisoner said they were her own ruffles. Upon talking a good deal to her, and telling her the consequence would be very bad, she seemed to be a little flusterated, but before the Justice she insisted on them as her own; she said, in the entry, if they are your property you may take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing to you about letting her go.</p>

I am her brother, I went to demand her cloaths and wages of Mrs. Stevens; she desired us to take the cloaths away; I desired her to come and see that there was nothing but her own; we went into the kitchen, a candle was lighted, the prisoner went to look for her cloaths, lying wet in a dish; the first thing she took up was an apron, after that an handkerchief, Mrs. Stevens gave the girl a push against the dresser, and said the things were her's.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. She had cut a handkerchief of mine to make a flounce to her apron at the bottom, and I claimed the flounce.</p>
               <p>Mr. Angish. The prisoner came to live in my family in January 61, and stay'd a year and three quarters, she went away about this time twelve months; she behaved herself faithfully and honestly the whole time she was in my service, she was never suspected of any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason she left your service?</p>
               <p>Angish. The reason she went away was we thought her rather too young to take care of children.</p>

He pretended he had no acquaintance in London, but since I have taken him up, I find he has two people acquainted with him; he said there were 14 or 15 guineas in the parcel; he would lend me money to carry me down to my friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Have any of the things been found again?</p>

               <p>West. He was taken up about eight weeks afterwards that was done, the 25th of July; when he was charged with the thing, he said he would give me half a guinea to let him go, and he would never do the like again; this he said before the constable; he said he had sold the things in Cheapside, but did not say to whom.</p>
