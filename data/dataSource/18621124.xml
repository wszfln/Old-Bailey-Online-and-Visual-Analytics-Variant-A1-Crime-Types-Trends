Dear Sir,—I have yours of the 10th instant, covering copy of a letter to W. Chambers, Esq., upon which I have no remark to offer at present. You are aware that from the first I was drawn into the Haford mines affair, upon the clear understanding that the profits was to be equally divided between yourself, Mr. Crane, and me. That understanding was ratified by an agreement entered into between us three parties, and which was no more hastily entered into by you than by myself; and, therefore, to make an agreement one day to abrogate the next, seems to be absurd. As I understand the agreement, it is to divide between us equally the profits after all expenses are paid; and to that I adhere. Tour responsibility in the matter is no more than any one of us are liable to in any way. You must be aware that the time of a pro<lb/>fessional man, like myself, cannot be taken up with impunity to disregard in remuneration. You speak of the prejudice of Taylor. Do you think that I, for one moment, care a straw for the prejudice of a dishonest and dishonourable man like Taylor? My name shall not be even brought in question with such a fellow. I apprehend that Messrs. Le Blane &amp; Co. and Mr. Canceller know some one besides yourself in this matter, whatever you may think or write. You say that you bring all the property to market. You brought only Fair Rhos; the remainder have been added in the course of the correspondence that have taken place thereon. But who drew up that correspondence? We might go on to the end of our days making agreements to break them in letter and spirit. I am not so inclined, whatever be the hesitation which you shadow forth. I am, dear sir, yours faithfully, William B. Bray. Memorandum.—Haford mines pro<lb/>perty was publicly brought to market by repeated advertisement; but who found the customers? P. S.

I am a Mining agent—I have been very unfortunate in business, and have been insolvent three times—in 1858 I knew Mr. Bray, the prisoner—I had known him before that; nine or twelve months, perhaps; I won't be certain—I remember an attempt to establish a com<lb/>pany in respect of the Haford Mine, in Cardiganshire, belonging to Mr. Willliam Chambers, who was the owner of the soil—Mr. Bray had some<lb/>thing to do with it—I knew a person of the name of John Arthur at that time quite well—he was a coal-owner at one time—I think he had some interest in the colliery—he has died since then—about eighteen months from that time, or, perhaps, more, I don't exactly know, I and Arthur had com<lb/>munications with the prisoner respecting this mine—I don't exactly recollect the dates, but it was about three months before that agreement of 30th April—I saw Mr. Bray pretty nearly every day—we met on the subject of the arrangement of a company for the Haford property; the mining property—Arthur lived at that time in Dalby-terrace, City-road; No. 16, I think—we used to meet on 'Change, or at the Ship, and occasionally in Dalby-terrace—we met nearly every day, at one place or another, on that subject—it was discussed by me, Mr. Bray, and Arthur—the body of this document (<hi rend="italic">the agreement</hi>) is in my handwriting, and I saw the prisoner write this signature, "William Bray," and I wrote mine immediately afterwards—the initials, "W. B.," to the alteration, are his—I am sure I saw him put them—there were three agreements signed at the same time; Bray had one, Arthur one, and I had one—this is the one that Arthur had—the signature, "William Bray," to this is also the prisoner's; they are all the same—I think this took place at 16, Dalby-terrace; I am not positive of it; we used to meet sometimes at one place and sometimes another—we were all three together when the three agreements were drawn up and signed by the prisoner, and when the initials were put to the alteration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, in April, May, and July, order certain work to be done by Messrs. Waterlow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took certain work, on this property and other, for Bray—the items on the writ, of April 13th and 14th, 1858, refer to the Haford Mine—the item of May 14th refers to the agreement that I left at Messrs. Waterlow's to be stamped—I have no recollection of the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for postage-stamps on 17th May—the report of the Cappagh Copper Mine was a report of Bray's, and the Horse Island also—I took them for him; I had nothing to do with them; I had no interest in them whatever—the only interest I had was in the Haford—I had no interest whatever in the Cappagh Copper Mine, or the Horse Island Mine; they were for Mr. Bray—he was aware that this work was being done by Messrs. Waterlow—he requested me to take it for him to Waterlow's—he wanted them done in a particular way, and he said it would cost 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I told him they would not do that without security, or something of that sort—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the reports that I ordered from Messrs. Waterlow—this is the prisoner's signature—there are four of them here which Mr. Bray drew up—they were ordered by Mr. Bray's direction—I took them there for him—they were his composing—this is his signature at the back of one of these reports—I received some copies when they were lithographed—I gave some copies to Mr. Bray—we divided them pretty equally—this letter of 11th May, is in Bray's writing, and also this letter of let February—this letter of 26th March, 1858, is also his—(<hi rend="italic">The following postage was read from this letter</hi>)—"Dear Neale, I have had a letter from Crane; he says they have a satisfactory letter from Mr. Chambers; I hope to be at the Jamaica on Saturday, at half-past 12"—This letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is headed "London, 10th April, 1858,</p>

I am a working engineer, at 13, Palace New-road, Lambeth—I have been acquainted with the prisoner since 1842, during that time I have had considerable correspondence with him—I have seen him write very frequently—the signature of "William Bray" to this agreement is in his writing, and also the signature to the duplicate agree<lb/>ment—the signatures on these reports are in his writing—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are his writing—I introduced Crane to the prisoner in the year 1858—I also introduced Arthur to the prisoner—Arthur is dead—I intro<lb/>duced him about the same time—it was some time in the beginning of 1858, in April, and the early part of May, 1858—I frequently saw the prisoner—I was often with them at that time; with all three, the prisoner, Crane, and Arthur—they were in conversation about the mine when I saw them—they were talking it over about sending some letters to Mr. Chambers, and one thing and another, about the Haford Mine—the prisoner afterwards told me that he had signed the agreement, and that he intended to get it stamped—he said the agreement was between Arthur, Crane, and himself—he said he had signed the agreement between Arthur, Crane, and himself, and that he was going to send it to get it stamped—he did not tell me where he was going to send it to get it stamped, but he told me a few days afterwards that it had been stamped—the prisoner was not a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers—I never heard him say that he was—when I first knew him he was looking after a furnace belonging to Messrs. Mitchell, at a place called Pencoid—he was a workman there—he left there some time after<lb/>wards; before I did; it was not so much as a year before—I don't know what he did for some time after that, but in 1845 or 1846 he was at Mullens' works at Battersea—he was an assayer in their employment—I believed he remained there till 1847, or thereabouts—he then went to South America—I did not follow him there—it must have been nearly two years after<lb/>wards that I saw him again—he was then looking out for another situation—he got another situation, somewhere in the same quarter, to go out to South America—he was sent out by Messrs. Powles—he went out for them—I corresponded with him, and had some letters from him when he was abroad—this letter of 26th April, 1858, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prisoner's writing—it was sent to me—(<hi rend="italic">This letter wot read in part; is related to some other property, and contained this postage, "You had better write to Mr. Lampart to get the things copied at Waterlow's, or somewhere, and tend to me"</hi>)—I never knew the prisoner by the name of William Bayley Bray, merely as William Bray.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that a book which, in the course of your duties as secretary, you would use from day to day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, every meet<lb/>ing day I had it in my hand, and looked at it—Mr. William Bailey Bray, when a pupil at 23, Great George-street, Westminster, was elected an asso<lb/>ciate on 25th January, 1836, and was then transferred by the council to be a member on 18th February, 1845—persons who become members sign a book; they are obliged to sign a document which is sent to them for their signature before they can be balloted for, it is returned to the secretary and registered—the prisoner was not either an associate or a member of the institution from 1836 to 1860—I saw the prisoner about this matter—I did not go on purpose to see him, but having to make inquiries for a friend about a mining speculation at Gresham house, on one day, with a clerk of mine, I thought I would go and see the Mr. Bray who signed himself a member of the institution—I did so, and saw the prisoner; it was on 27th June, 1860—my clerk made this entry of it at the time (<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>)—I saw the prisoner at the office of the Imperial Thessalian Company—I made inquiries about that company, and he told me it was wound up—I asked him if he was Mr. William Bailey Bray, a member of the institution; he said he was—I said, "You are making a mistake, you are not our Mr. William Bailey Bray"—he turned on his heel, said the company was wound up, and walked away—the president has no power whatever to make a member; the only mode is by election in the general body as a graduate, associate, or member, except for transfer, which is in the bosom of the council—I told the prisoner who I was; I said, "I am secretary of the institution of civil engineers, and you do not belong to it; you are not that Mr. William Bailey Bray."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do not a great number of persons practise as civil engineers, and call themselves civil engineers, who are not members of the institute? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A great many, and men in a certain sort of position—it is not considered essential to be a member of the institute, it is quite volun<lb/>tary—it is considered advantageous to a man in the profession to be a member of the institute; it implies that he has gone through a certain education.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the standing necessary to become a member of the institution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That he shall have been regularly educated according to the rules of pupilage with a civil engineer, or a mechanical engineer, and shall have practised and held a position as resident engineer on works upwards of five years, or been in business on his own account, holding responsible work, and having the responsibility of works for five years—all the great engineers have not belonged to the institute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The following postage was read firm a letter, dated 26th April</hi>, 1858:—"I cannot go to Mr. Robert Stephenson without papers or any authority, and to do this, as well as to open the matter in Newcastle, some understand<lb/>ing should be come to how I am to be paid, for it is no trifle to bring this business before the Institute of Civil Engineers."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was a material variance between the evidence and the allegation in the indictment; the averment was that the action before Mr. Justice Mellor was then and there duly tried by a jury, whereas from the proof it appeared that the then plaintiff elected to be non<lb/>suited, so that the case being withdrawn from the Jury, was not in reality duly tried by than; upon this, two questions would arise; first, whether it was an im<lb/>material</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">allegation which could be rejected at surplusage, and secondly, whether it could be amended. As to the first point, he apprehended that it could not be rejected at surplusage; a similar point had recently arisen in the Court of Appeal, not yet reported, and he urged that the point should be reserved; with regard to the second question, no doubt under 14 &amp; 15 Vic. c. 100, the Court had very extensive powers of amendment, but those powers could not be exercised upon a matter calculated to prejudice the defendant in the smallest degree; he was not aware of any instance of an indictment for perjury on a case ending in a nonsuit; indeed it might be urged that so long at a man was under examina<lb/>tion, and his suit was pending, there was a locus pœnitentice, if instead of going on to the end of his examination he withdrew from the case, the suit would be incomplete, and matter might have been introduced which would have had an effect upon the suit; supposing perjury could not be assigned in a matter in which a person had himself withdrawn the case, then the allegation became material, because if the allegation was properly made, and the plaintiff was therein nonsuited, the defendant would him the opportunity, which he now had not, of demurring to the indictment, and of raising the question in point of law as to whether or not an indictment could be preferred for perjury where a non<lb/>suit had taken place; for these reasons he submitted that the variance could not be cured.</hi>

I went in, and my wife followed me, leaving our room door open. Having my coat and cap on, I took them off and threw them on the bed, and took a seat at the table, where the things were set for tea. The young man who was with Salter went down stairs, saying he must go to a shop and pay what he owed. Hearing somebody come up, I went to open the door, thinking it was him, and the officers came in upon me. I am innocent.</p>

The things were found in my room, but I am not guilty of making them.</p>

I am in the prosecutor's service—on Saturday evening, 25th October, about 7 o'clock—I put the horse in the stable, and locked it with a padlock resembling this—it was a brown gelding—half an hour afterwards I found the lock broken, the door open, and missed the horse—I went and told my master—he got on a horse and went on the Mimms-road, I got on another, and went on the Halfield-road, and found the hone on Hadley-green—I brought him back and left him at the White Lion on the Mimms-road, and then fetched Mr. Goodwin.</p>

From some information I received from Mr. Jamison, I apprehended Darcy on Saturday evening—I told him I should take him in custody for uttering a forged order for some cloth, purporting to be signed by Jamison and Forskut, of New Bond-street, and also on another charge—he said, "You have made a mistake, Mr. White, I never went for any cloth"—on the way to the station he said, "I did not know it was a forged order; I was sent in by a man who was at the corner of the street, and he promised me half a pint if I would go in with the order"—some short time after he said, "Well, Mr. White, you'll get the other <hi rend="italic">chap;</hi> you know him very well—it is a pity I should be let in for it all—his name is George Johnson—he lives at 1, Henry-place—you saw him with me the other night at the station-house"—he particularly wished me to get the other prisoner, as he said he had written the order out for him—I cautioned him when he spoke about Johnson, and said I should</p>

A gentlemanly looking man, about five feet six, came up, and asked if we wanted a job; we said, "Certainly." He said he wanted two packages taken to Tower-street; that they were heavy, and we should want a trunk. We said we could not get a truck at that time, so we took a bale each—he gave us a glass of half-and-half each at the "Marquis of Granby," and gave us a lift up with the bales. We had several rests with them as we went along, and when we got into Tower-street we lost sight of the gentleman, and the policeman came and took us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by the Mint authorities—I went on Friday, 7th November, to 126, Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, accompanied by other officers—it is a common lodging-house—the street door was open—I proceeded through the kitchen and across the yard to a room at the far end, the door of which I pushed open, and saw the whole of the prisoners sitting at a table by a clear bright fire, the prisoner Barrett holding a sixpence in one hand and a file in the other—on seeing me she placed the file on the mantel<lb/>shelf—I took this sixpence (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of her left hand—at that time I saw Campbell, who sat next to her, place his left-hand in her lap—five or six of the officers were then in the room—I said, "Consider yourselves in custody for being here manufacturing this counterfeit coin"—I did not see</p>

               <p>what Campbell had in his hand, but I took thirteen counterfeit sixpences out of Barrett's lap—that was after I had said this—Campbell laughed, and said, "Sure, I only came in, sir, to solder this girl's coffee-pot"—I said, "Just attend to me, will you; you won't find this a laughing matter here<lb/>after, to be found with these people in manufacturing this counterfeit join"—he said, "Oh, by Jesus, I solder all the coffee-pots and things for these girls, and all the people in the neighbourhood; they all know me well"—the fourteen sixpences are here, the file is not—it was mislaid yesterday—I saw Barrett using it—she had the file in one hand and the sixpence in the other.</p>

               <p>between 5 and 6, the prisoner came to my house for a pint of ale—that was after my daughter served him—he gave me a shilling, I put it in the till, and gave him ninepence change—there was no other shilling in the till—soon after that he asked for another pint of ale, and paid me another shilling—I found that was a bad one, and told him so—he picked it np, and said, "Is it," and gave me a good one—I then went to the till and found the other was bad—I turned round, and the prisoner was gone—I went to look after him, followed him to another beerehop, and then gave him in charge—I gave the constable tho shilling that I put in the till, and another which my daughter gave me—one bad shilling I gave back to the prisoner, and the others I gave to the policeman.</p>

I live at 7, Henry-street, Upper Kennington-lane, Vaux<lb/>hall, and am a clerk—I was at the corner of Bloomsbury-street on Thursday evening, 23d October, at a little after 6 o'clock, and saw Mr. Le Sueur there—I was about twenty yards from him—I saw one of the prisoners, who, I should think, by the look of him, was Anderson, push against him, and then another struck him on the mouth, and ran away—I should not like to say, who that was—I saw Mr. Le Sueur on the ground, and Anderson feeling about his chest—Anderson then ran away past me—I saw his face, and fol<lb/>lowed him through two or three streets; he then turned round the corner of a street and walked back again—I was running behind him at the time, and was able to see his face again—I looked him in the face, and said, "You are the one who took the gentleman's watch"—he said, "Bill, look here</p>

               <p>what this young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> says, that I have been and took a gentleman's watch"—there were several persons walking behind him, to one of whom he spoke—when he said that we just came to the corner of a street, a crowd began to collect, and a policeman said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "A man has taken a gentleman's watch;" and when I looked round again I could not see the prisoner—when Anderson ran off, Roberts passed me—that was before Anderson ran down the street—I was not able to see him as he went by; I took no notice of him—I saw Anderson next, at Bow-street station, on the following Saturday, with several other men, and pointed him out to the constable.</p>

I am the landlord of the Old Dog public-house, Holywell-street, Strand—on the evening of 23d October, about 20 minutes past 6, I was crossing from Oxford-street into Bloomsbury-street, and saw the prosecutor coming towards me—just as he got to the saddler's shop, by Thorney-street, Anderson pushed at the side of him; whether he struck a blow or not, I cannot say—Roberts then came round and struck the prose<lb/>cutor in the face, and then went up Thorney-street—whether he had anything in his hand I cannot tell-the gentleman was in a stooping position when Roberts went away—Roberts walked very fast up Thorney-street, and I went</p>

               <p>after him—he turned round and upon we, under lamp, in Thorney-street, and I stepped back and saw his face—he turned round on me a second time—I saw him again, on the following Friday week, at Bow-street Police-court, and picked him out, the first man, from among a number of people—on the night this took place I gave a description of the prisoners at Bow-street—when I left, Anderson was in front of the prosecutor, and there was a boy close to them—I did not see Anderson again till the Saturday morning; the day after I recognised Roberts—I picked him out from among thirty people.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief of the audit-office of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company—the prisoner was in the service of the, Com<lb/>pany, and had been so, I should say, about three months—he had to register what we call the excess baggage, principally that which we forward to the continent—the sheets are printed in duplicate—on the extreme right he enters the number of passengers, the number of packages, and the excess, weight, which is the weight of the passengers' baggage over that which is allowed by the Company; and in the next column he enters the amount charged for that excess weight—the number applies not only to the excess, but to the whole number and the whole weight, the net weight that is charged for—the number is the whole number, and the weight is only the excess weight—this sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in the prisoner's handwriting—it is number 332, filled up by the prisoner—this is his own duplicate, which is afterwards sent to my office—it ought to be an exact copy of the ticket given to the guard—the way bill and the passenger's ticket show, weight, 200lbs. charge 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., while his own duplicate leaves those columns in blank—those columns being left blank in the return made to my office would indicate that there was no excess weight and no charge—the passenger's ticket and the guard's way bill correspond exactly—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the book for Paris and Calais, which it was the prisoner's duty to keep—this sheet numbered 332 is his writing—that does not show any sum charged for excess luggage—if he had received any sum charged for excess luggage in respect of this number it was his duty to eater it in this book—there are two other sums received on that same day for excets by two other trains, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in one case, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the other—the total of those two sums is made up at the end of the next day, Sunday, the 28th, with 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more received on that day—the total is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had tickets which properly account for those three sums—there is "No, 347, 2 passengers, 3 packages, 56 lbs. excess weight, charge 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the next is "No, 354, 1 passenger, 1 baggage, 28lbs. excess weight, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—on Sunday, 28th,"No. 370, 1 passenger, 3 packages, 56lbs. excess weight, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—those are exact specimens of what they all ought to be, the ticket of the passenger, the ticket of the guard, and that book—the duplicate of this sheet 361 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), on the 28th, is the pri<lb/>soner's handwriting—it is, "No. 361, 1 passenger, 5 packages, 392lbs. excess weight, and 58<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received"—in the book, "1 passenger, 5 packages, and no excess weight or amount"—No. 389, on 29th, is all in the prisoner's handwriting—on the duplicate there is "2 passengers, 3 baggages, no weight, no amount"—on the guard's bill, and on the ticket given to the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. F. H. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The prisoner had been about two or three mouths in the Company's service, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he is seventeen years of age, and son of Lieutenant Colonel Beckham, who dis<lb/>tinguished himself in the Peninsular War, I believe—the guard's ticket and the passenger's ticket would come back to the audit-office—they would give notice to the Company of what was the excess of weight, and what was the amount received—he ought to have made out a sort of check for himself—he would enter the amount, weight, &amp;c. from the duplicate into the book—if it were wrong in the duplicate, and copied from there faithfully, it would be wroug in the book—that book is called the "Continental luggage-book," and from that book it was his duty to enter into another book, the small cash-book—that is merely a statement of the totals—there was a drawer for the money which he received, in the prisoner's office—I don't know whether there were other clerks who used to put money in the same drawer—I cannot undertake to say that it was not so—there were usually two luggage clerks—there may have been three on one or two occasions, but very seldom indeed—they would not have the same duty as the prisoner at the same time—they would assist him—I don't think three ever were in the office at the same time—I should imagine if they received money for the luggage it would be their duty to put it in the till as well—the prisoner would make the ticket out for the sum received, whether he had it or not—it was his duty to make out the duplicate—he would not make out the passengers, the number of packages, and the excess of weight, and leave it to the person who received the money to put in the amount, certainly not—he would make out the whole of the ticket, notwithstanding he had not received the money, although he might have seen it paid—one would make out one part of the bill and one the other, but it is impossible to know how they would arrange it—all No. 332 is the prisoner's handwriting, and the duplicate—I cannot say whether he received that 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or whether one of the clerks who assitsted him did; and the other sum, the second charge in the indictment, would come under the same head—there are a great number of persons come in about the same time to have their luggage weighed, when we are busy—we were not busy at this time—the latter end of September we were doing very little business in fact—even if there was no excess the prisoner would have to give tickets if the passengers wished their luggage registered—I should say the proportion of persons of those who did pay excess to those who did not would be about ten to one, or not so many as that; and if the ten passengers wished their luggage marked and registered, it would still be the prisoner's duty to do it—I have heard of cases of passengers who are dis<lb/>honest enough to go away without paying at all—in those cases the ticket would be made out in the same way, but he would not hand it to the passenger unless he received the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I mean where the ticket has been handed to the passenger, and he has gone away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An intelligent clerk would never allow himself to be cheated</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just take those green tickets in your hand again; do those show every ticket issued by the prisoner, whether there is excess laggage charged on them or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when there is excess—there are twenty-one registered to Paris on 27th, three by the 7 A.M. train, which is the one in respect of which the complaint is made on 27th and 28th—the whole of the vouchers on that occasion are made out by the prisoner—I have known such a case as a clerk in the office writing one part of the ticket, and he the other—the person who was receiving the money would know what sum to charge, by the weight being called out to him through the window—according to the ordinary course of practice the person who is in the office taking the weight on the ticket is the person who also receives the money—I know of no one assisting the prisoner on 37th, 28th, or 29th—I know Berlin assisted him on 28th—the prisoner proffessed to account every day—the omissions that I speak of were small sums that we were able to discover had been omitted—in than cases we had no means—those small sums amounted in the month to about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we have a travelling auditor who goes to different stations when he thinks proper—whatever the pri<lb/>soner's excuse was, it was accepted at the time—we discover it when we go through the accounts, and after the tickets are sent to us; that is how we discovered it—the tickets are returned to us for that purpose, from France, and we return theirs in the same manner—six passengers took tickets on 28th, by the 7 o'clock train, and five on the 29th—the prisoner would have to attend to the local passengers, but not to passengers for Paris—I know by that book how many the local patseigers are—when luggage is over the weight allowed, then it is excess weight, and it is charged—there were two local passengers on 27th who were excessed, none on 28th, and none on 29th—there is no system of registeration unless there is excess.</p>

I said, "Yes, it will.' He then said he was going down to Brighton. I had no idea it was stolen, or I should not have taken it on my premises.</p>

I am a bookbinder, of 14, Little Britain—I know the prisoner—he called upon me in May last—he took of me the warehouse, 13, Little Britain—he and another of the name of Lister came—the name put up was Teed, Lister, and Co.—the prisoner occupied the premises until he was taken into custody—on the inner door leading to the warehouse there was recently put" Walter Berthold and Co."—I knew no one at Walter Berthold—I did not know of any one except the prisoner and the person who came with him first—the person calling himself Lester came—I do not know what has become of him—I did not know the prisoner by the name of "Hugo Dullens" at all—I did not know he had been bankrupt until these pro<lb/>ceedings—he gave me a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of rent due at Miohaelmas,</p>

Grant and Erwood, also in Gretham-street—I went to both those parties, and likewise to "Stubbs"'—I then agreed to let him have a parcel of goods—the amount was 114<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. upon the terms to pay half cash, and the rest on our usual credit; to be paid on the 10th December—I sent the goods—I sent two boys with them with a pair of wheels—I went with the first lot of goods myself—I did not intend to part with them until I got the cash—I received this cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received it on the 4th; it is dated the 5th—he gave me in the first place a crossed cheque, dated the 8th, which I objected to in <hi rend="italic">toto</hi>, and told him I would not accept it at all; and it was after banking hours when I received this, and I told him I wanted it the following day to make use of—I presented the cheque next day about 2 o'clock, as near as I can tell—I did not get any money upon it—I have never got any money for either the cheque or goods—the goods are in the hands of the police at present—after presenting the cheque I saw the prisoner—I asked him the reason of his giving me a cheque when he knew well there were no assets to meet it, and requested him then to pay me the amount of the cheque, or give up the goods, as he had broken the arrangement he had made—he said he would see me in the course of an hour's time, and he should be able to pay me the money, but he did not come—he, did not pay me—if I had not received that cheque I would not have left the goods—I would not have taken the cheque if I had not believed it was valid at the time—I believed he had authority to direct Jones and Webster to pay the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clock and watchmaker, living at 41, Oakley-street—on the 2d November I remember the works of the clock produced, being brought to me—the two prisoners brought them—I gave those works to the police-sergeant—when the prisoners brought the works they wanted some repair—they wanted me to repair another—I told them what was required to be done, and they were to give me an answer about the second when the first was repaired—one was a clock, the other was a bronze timepiece—they did not come again—they left them both; one was to be repaired, and the other was to inquire what price it would be.</p>

I am a surgeon, living at 5, Belgrave-terrace, Upper Holloway—on the night of 4th November, the deceased was brought to my house; he was sensible—he had received a blow on the head—the orbit of the left eye was very much swollen and effused—I attended him up to the time of his death—he continued in a state of insensibility the whole time—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was the effusion of blood over the substance and in the ventricles of the brain—that effusion might have been occasioned by either a blow or fall—I saw the prisoner that night—he seemed to be almost in a state of stupor—I considered that he had been drinking too much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Robinson, a shoemaker, of 5, James-street—on 31st October last, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, I was engaged washing in the kitchen of No. 2, Bacon-street—I could see into the back yard of that house—I heard a great many words, but too bad to ex<lb/>press, between a young man and the prisoner—I saw the prisoner; she had a child in her arms—after about twenty minutes, and after having a great many words with the young man, I saw her take the child and put it into the water-butt; the child rather struggled, and clutched its little hands on the edge of the water-butt, and she took its hands off and put it down into the water—she went a little way from the butt, and left it in the water—the same young man came up momentarily, and took the child out of the butt by the heels, and gave it to Mrs. Merrett—I saw her undress it; it was rather exhausted—it appeared to be about twelve or thirteen months old—there was a cry of "Police," and a constable came and took the prisoner in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk—on 5th November, very near 2 o'clock, I was returning from the Haymarket, and when I was at the second lamp in Cockspur-street I was suddenly seized from behind, and fell violently on my face to the ground—I called out "Police"—I could not see who the persons were who seized me, or how many there were; but there must have been more than one—I rose up, and was held in a leaning position backwards by a hand thrust over my eyes, and my arms pinioned behind—I called "Police" again, when a hand was slapped on my mouth—I felt two hands at my waistcoat-pocket, where my watch and chain were, which I protected with my hands—after that I felt a hand grasp my throat tightly to take my scarf-pin—they bent the pin and then commenced unbuttoning my waist<lb/>coat, and endeavouring to release the chain from my button-hole—the police then came near, I believe, for the men pushed me to the ground and made off—they did not succeed in taking anything from me—the police did not come to me—I have a scar on my face, and a large bruise, which were inflicted in the fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Paynter.</hi> I was going home, and the gentleman was intoxicated and ran against me; I only shoved him in self-defence. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> If I was intoxi<lb/>cated I could not have risen up again.</p>

                  </hi>. On 5th November, about 2 in the morning, I was in Cockspur-street, and saw the prosecutor, but not before he was attacked by that young man, the shortest prisoner of the two (<hi rend="italic">Paynter</hi>)—he picked Mr. Prior up, chucked him on his face, and walked away from him—the other prisoner was close by him—the gentleman hallooed out, "Police," and the two policemen walked round the corner close together—I did not see them before Mr. Prior was knocked to the ground—the prisoners then walked away, and Thompson aaked me for a light—I told the police, in the pri<lb/>soners' hearing, that they were the young men who knocked Mr. Prior down,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240089"/>
               <p>and the police took them in custody—there were no other persons near—Thompson threatened me at the police-court—he said, God blind him, he would make it hot for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson. Q.</hi> Was I speaking to a female when I asked you for a light? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I said, "I shall not give you one"—there was nobody else with you when the gentleman was knocked down—a man came to the station and said that you were not the man, but there was nobody but you two present when the gentleman was knocked down—the lady in my cab said that she could not swear to either of you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson.</hi> I want to know why the lady and gentleman are not here; they swore positively at the station that I was not the person. I was coming down Cockspur-street, heard the disturbance, and came up and saw the gentleman on the ground. I asked the man for a light, and he said I think you are one of the men who were attacking that man, and the policeman took me; that is all I know of the transaction. This man is a perfect stranger to me. I certainly said, "If you accuse me of this I will make it hot for you." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was a lady inside that you said that to, but you threatened me at the station-house—the lady is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not see these two men together before Mr. Prior was attacked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This young man had got Mr. Prior, and was chucking him down when Thompson passed by; he was eight yards away when the other chucked him down—Thompson never touched him, but he was close by the side of him, and in his company—after Paynter left the gentleman he went to Thompson; and when the policeman came, Thompson asked me for a light, and then called Paynter, saying, "Come on, we are going home; we have not done anything."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson. Q.</hi> Did I call him by name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, you called him <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>—you were against the lamp-post, which is half a dozen yards from where the gentleman was—I did not say that it was twelve yards—you went quietly to the station—I do not know you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you or did you not see any attempt to rob? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—he merely threw him down and walked away—I cannot say whether the prosecutor had done anything to cause that—he did not throw him down, and walk away immediately: he held him a minute or so in his arms, and then threw him down—he had got him at the back—the gentleman had had a little to drink—I do not know whether he told the Magistrate at Bow-street that he was drunk.</p>

               <p>and am in the employ of the post-office, as a postman—on Monday night, 10th December, I was by the City-road-bridge, going towards Islington—I was not in uniform—the female prisoner came up to me by the bridge, and asked me to go home with her—I consented to do so—I had known her before by sight—I walked along the City-road with her, towards Islington—she said she would go into the City Arms public-house for her key—she went in, remained about a minute, and came out again—we then turned down Graham-street, which is a continuation of Macclesfield-street, and went as far as Hope-wharf, which is on the right-hand side of Graham-street, and leads down to the canal—there is no thoroughfare; the water is at the other end—she then said she should not go home, and said, "Let us turn down here"—we turned down on the right-hand side, near a heap of sand, and stood there talking about five minutes—I then heard footsteps—I turned my head round, and saw the two male prisoners coming down—I said to her, "Who are these?"—she said, "Hush! hold your tongue"—by that time they had got up to me, and asked me what I had to do with that girl—Thomas Radshaw went partly behind me, and Dixon partly in front—the woman then took hold of my chain—I scuffled with the two men some little while, but they got me down—I struggled with them—they both began kicking me brutally on my head—I caught one of them by the leg, and held it—I found a hand on my mouth, and I left go of the leg to take the hand away—I caught the leg several times—I called "Police" and "Murder"—they were some little while doing this—there must have been some alarm, for they then got up and went to the top of Hope-wharf—I ran after them, and saw Thomas Rad<lb/>shaw running without his hat—my right eye was closed, and my left filled with blood, so that I could not see which way they turned—I turned back, and picked up my umbrella, and a hat which belongs to Thomas Radshaw; also my hat, which was lying on the ground—I went to the top of the wharf, but the blood ran down my face, and shirt, and trousers, and all my clothes—I was all over mud—I got so faint that I was obliged to be led to a doctor's by two men—I afterwards went home in a cab to my father's, and on my way noticed that part of my chain had gone—it was rather a dark place, but there was sufficient light for me to see the prisoner's face—I missed eighteen pence, which was safe when I was on the wharf with the female prisoner—I have been in the hospital nearly three weeks, and after I came out I went with Sergeant Hooper to Oxford-street, where I came full face with the female prisoner, and I turned round and saw Dixon crossing the road with a constable—I said, "That is the man who assaulted me, and that is the female who assaulted me"—Maria Ballard was with the sergeant.</p>

I am a clerk in the Examiner's-office at the Custom-house—on 1st November, between 7 and half-past, in the evening, I was in Fenchurch-street—a woman came up and made an observation, and I told her to be off—I did not notice whether she followed me, but a few yards further on I took out my purse where there was a light, as I wished to see for a coin I wanted—on attempting to return it to my pocket the same woman snatched it out of my hand, and ran down Church-row—I ran after her, calling "Stop thief"—having proceeded thirty or forty yards, I heard a whistle, and a man came in front of me from some small archway or door<lb/>way—that man was Hall—he pushed me in the chest, and said, "What is your game? where are you going?"—I said, "Stand aside; a woman has stolen a purse, and I am after her"—he said, "Oh, nonsense!" and stopped me effectually—I intended to go back again, but on turning round, I found two other men, who must have come down the court from Fenchurch-street, as there is no passage there which they could have come out of, and I did not observe any other passengers—one of those men was Leat and the third man escaped—one got me by my collar, and another by my left arm—I sprang away, and said, "I see what it is"—I swung my stick round, and it came in contact with the head of the man who has escaped—he then made off, and then I struck Hall on the back of the neck two or three times—I tried to strike Leat, but cannot say whether I did or not, but I kept hold of him—he is the man who took hold of me by the collar, and pressed me—this is the stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a powerful one, and is loaded with lead—I kept following Leat, sometimes holding him, sometimes losing him, but never losing sight of him till I got to St. Mary Axe—he was never more than two or three yards from me—I was still struggling with him there when a constable came up with Hall in custody—I identified him, saying, "That is an accomplice"—I recognised him instantly—he made some remark to the constable, but I was perfectly exhausted, and did not hear it—the constable took Leat.</p>

Abra<lb/>hams, of Manchester, and accepted by you—Abrahams shortly after that failed, and we said to you, "There is a bill here of your acceptance for 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; what about that?"—you said you had never received a farthing value for it, and we believed you, and asked if you would undertake to meet that bill when it became due; if so, we would supply you with the amount for it—the bill was paid, but you had the value in goods—Christmas is in our employ now—he has been with us about three weeks—we have opened a shop in London since you were arrested, in the same line of business as you were—I have never been summoned before a Magistrate—I have been twice before a County-court Judge, and in each case have had the verdict—I decline to answer whether I have been in Wakefield gaol for felony—I will explain it, when we are apprenticed, it is very customary for persons who begin business for themselves, to get patterns, and there is no way of getting them except by buying them; the prosecutor knew I had taken them, and charged me with stealing them—he had been charged with the same offence—I pleaded guilty—I could not deny having taken them, I was advised to plead guilty—I took them away at night, and brought them back the next morning—we have been ten years in business, and nothing has occurred against our characters since then—the witness Wilkinson, who is here, is not in my service.</p>

I am a merchant, carrying on business at 65, Queen-street, Cheapside—on 20th November, about half-past 6, I was on Blackfriars-bridge, looking at the fire, which was then burning—I had this overcoat on, buttoned as it is now—I happened to look down, and found the lower button unbuttoned—I felt to see if my watch was safe, and then saw it in the hand of the prisoner—I immediately seized him, and called, "Stop thief"—the watch was withdrawn, and I saw the prisoner distinctly drop it down, exactly where he was when I seized him—a boy afterwards handed it to me—the watch was worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a detective came up, and I gave the prisoner into custody—I only called "Stop thief," in order that he might not get away—I never left go of him—the little ring of the watch is broken—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was broken at the top.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Barking-churchyard—a little after 3 in the afternoon of 7th November, I was in Cannon-street, and saw the prisoner go up to a carriage which was standing by the kerb, put his arm in at the window, and take a leather bag out—he then walked slowly away—I told the coachman, and he instantly got down and went after him—the prisoner ran then—I stopped till he was brought back, and then the coachman and the policeman asked me if that was the man who took it, and I said, "Yes"—he had dropped the bag, I believe—I did not see him drop it.</p>

I certainly was out this night, or the morning this robbery was committed, and I stayed at the Oak until half-past 2, when I left the house, and went down in the direction of the Pakenham; from there I made my <hi rend="italic">debut</hi> in this coffee-house, as this policeman says; I fell asleep, and he came in and woke me up. I went out, but I did not go home. I went to the Two Brewers' public-house; I went straight there from the coffee-shop, and I remained there for an hour or an hour and a half, and then went home to my lodging, and got home at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning. I never was in that man's shop that night later than 11 o'clock; staying in a public-house at night is not my occupation. I was in the shop with one or two working men, who bid me good night.</p>

On 17th November, about 5 minutes past 8 in the morning, I was coming up Snow-hill, towards the Old Bailey—Cooper was being executed that morning; he was hanging at the time—I turned into the Old Bailey—there was a crowd—previous to my getting to the Old Bailey the two prisoners followed me up Snow-hill, and kept very close to me—I did not like their appearance—when I got opposite the gallows, I thought I would turn back and go to Snow-hill again, where they hustled me, got my hands up right over my head, and got my watch from my pocket, breaking the guard from the key—as soon as I got my hands free, I seized them both by the collar—I told them they had my watch—I saw Windsor take it and pass it to Hurley—I saw him take it from my pocket; and I saw the guard in his hand, passing down from my waistcoat pocket, before I seized him—I did not see what became of it—I think it was passed, but I can't say where it went—it had been safe in my pocket a second before I saw the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, at 5, Queen-square, Hoxton. I was at the Old Bailey about 8 o'clock, on the morning of 17th November, and saw the prisoners standing by the side of me—I looked at Hurley—he said, "What are you looking at?"—I said, "I suppose you may be looked at?"—he said, "If you look at me again I will hit you in the b—eye"—they moved away then—just as they moved, the prosecutor was coming past—they followed him, and got him with his arms forced up; and I saw Windsor put his hand to his waistcoat pocket, and take it away very quickly; whether he passed anything or not, I cannot say, but he passed his hands towards Hurley—I tried to catch hold of him, but there were so many round I could not—the prosecutor detained them till the constable came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, at Whitby, in Yorkshire. On 14th November, I was at Rose's public-house, at Wapping—I suppose it was rather early when I left, nearly 2 o'clock—I was not aware it was so late, there were a few friends there—after I had proceeded a short distance two men came up, one at each side, and wanted to know where I was going—I said I was going home; it was rather late—they wanted me to treat them—I refused; I said I did not make a practice of treating people—I walked on a little, and before I knew anything further, the prisoner seized me by the collar from behind, and the other by the throat—he put his arm in the front of my throat, and I fell to the ground from the pressure on my throat—I felt the effects of it at the back of my neck the day after—I felt stunned; and the first I remember afterwards was that this man had got his hand into my trouser's pocket—the prisoner was rifling my pockets—it was quite light where they attacked me, but where they pulled me down it was not such a good light—the prisoner was never out of my sight—I had in an inside pocket a half sovereign, some silver, and copper—I cannot say whether anything was missing or not; I don't think he got anything—after I recovered myself I tried to get away from them, and the prisoner struck me across the cheek and nose, and in the eye, and I fell again—I have the marks on my face now; my nose was knocked all on one side—I made an alarm when I had the chance, but the prisoner put his hand across my mouth, and rather stopped me; I shouted, "Murder!" and "Police!"—I thought I was going to be killed—the other man made away, and got off—I got hold of the prisoner by the coat, and said, "Stop till the policeman comes"—he got away, right facing the police, and they brought him back in a second or two—he left me lying in the road—I did not feel the effects before the Magistrate so much as I do now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was in the public-house, waiting for the Aberdeen boat coming up, and I saw this man drinking there, along with some men and women. I went to the pier head, and coming back I met this man talking to another. He asked me, did I know a place where he could get a glass; I said I did not. He said, "Then, what is the use of you?" making a punch at me, and hitting me right in the face. To defend myself I hit him in the face, and that was all I did; there was no one with me, only myself. He sang out for the police, and the policeman and the watchman came over the bridge, and took me to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at Chelsea—on 3d November there was a ball at the Teetotal-hall, 56, Lower George-street, Chelsea—there were posters like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) put up, to show where it was to be—I was employed, along with another man, to stand at the entrance, to take the money and tickets—the other one took the tickets, and I took the money—whilst I was standing there people passing could see me quite plainly—it was about 1 o'clock when I left—I had to go across Sloane-square to reach my home—as I was going past the "Star and Garter" I thought I heard foot<lb/>steps</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240119"/>
               <p>behind me—I turned round, and saw a shadow cast, but I saw nobody—I went straight on into Symonds-street, which leads into Sloane-square—when I reached No. 2, Symonds-street I heard some very quick steps come—I was turning round to see whether they were coming on to me or no, and before I got round, Marks came—he had a white jacket, or a white something on him at the time—he worked himself right behind me, and put his arms round me, under my chin—I was going to say "hallo," but I could not say "hallo"—I said "ho"—that was all I could say, and he pulled me back as hard as he could pull—I was trying to stoop down, but he pulled me back, so that I could not stoop—with that three more came up, and began to ran-sack my pockets—they took what they thought proper—my watch was in my waistcoat pocket, and my purse in my left-hand trousers pocket, with 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I did not carry home the night's receipts with me, I left that at the hall—the value of my watch was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after they had taken the things Marks let go of me, and then struck me with some heavy thing that he had in his hand—it was something that came cold, and very hard—he struck me in the mouth, and the blow sent my teeth all back—I fell down, and was bleeding very much at the mouth—I am quite sure Marks is the man that did it—I had never known him before, but he stood a second to see whether I would get up—I could see his countenance, and he had on a white jacket or something of that sort—I am quite sure he is the man—I could not swear to the faces of the other three, but their size and dress resembles them very much—I went to the station-house on the 6th, I think, on the Thursday, and was shown several men sitting along a form—I picked out Marks and Lane, and there was another I picked out, but I could not say that he was the man at all—I believe Lane was one of the men—I only believe it.</p>

Q.</hi> You say you picked out Lane at the station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there might have been a dozen men or more shown to me, for what I know—I cannot say positively, because I was taken out of my bed at 11 o'clock at night—I could not swear that they were policemen; they were in plain clothes—I cannot swear that Lane is the man—I only form an opinion from his size and dress.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you, or not, state that you are positive it was Lane that was with me at the time they came before you, and ransacked your pockets? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not say positively—I have said that I can't swear positively to any of these three—I swear positively that you are the person that came behind me, and choked me—I was not told so by other persons—my wife's daugh<lb/>ter's husband did not come to me, and tell me this, not that night he did not—after I had picked you out I was told it was you, not previously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Marks.</hi> It is a person, a relation of his, who is implicated in the case; when I say implicated, he is wholly and solely concerned; the innocent is now suffering for the guilty; and the prosecutor openly said in Court that he would not prosecute that man. Lane is suffering for the party who is guilty, his name is Hurley; were you not told by the police that they were in search of that party? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes—his name is Hurley—he is a brother of my wife's daughter's husband that he is speaking about—I heard afterwards that he was implicated in the case—my wife did not then say to me, "Now I know Lane is innocent of this"—she did not tell me that Lane was innocent, and that a hair of his head should not be hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Marks.</hi> If this Hurley was not a party concerned, why should he abscond from his home; but he would not have him taken because he is his relation, so they make Lane answer for him. I know it is useless to ask anything about my own case; I know I can't speak anything in my own behalf,</p>

Bouser—I proposed sending it there, because he was my salesman—the prisoner was not present when I gave instructions to my son—I saw the prisoner again, on the Wednesday after the meat had been sent to London—I cannot all the exact words; we talked about it, and he said it was a bad job—I told him if he had been ruled by me he would not have sent it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of Meat to Newgate-market, and have been so for nearly three years—on 9th September, I saw a hamper of meat at Messrs. Bouser's, at about half-past 5—it was four quarters of a cow, less the briskets, which had been out off—it was wet, and very flabby, and emaciated; the flesh of it was very much inflamed and very dark—I could not tell what state the animal was in when it died, as there were no lungs or any of the inside—I should say it was decidedly not a healthy animal—it must have been suffering from some internal disease for a considerable time—it was not merely poor, it was diseased—it was decidedly unfit for human food, and that unfitness was decidedly apparent to any person who saw it—I should think it would have been apparent on the day before to any one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there not a great distinction between what is called diseased meat, and that which is merely bad by reason of the weather? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is—the leading distinction is not inflammation—traces of in<lb/>flammation might indicate disease—mere wetness may be produced by bad weather accompanied by putrefaction—I was examined immediately after this matter occurred, and gave evidence before the Magistrate—I do not know whether I said anything about any traces of inflammation then; I know I said it was very bad (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, did not con<lb/>tain the word "inflammation," but stated "It looked of very bad quality, and as bad as ever I saw bad meat</hi>.")—before I was a City meat inspector, I was a meat inspector to the Board of Health for St. Pancras for five years—I in<lb/>pected lodging-houses—I previously kept a butcher's shop—I have been a baker some years; back—four' years back; then I went to the Board of Health—I was a lawyer's clerk once.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of meat in Newgate-market, and have been so for fourteen years—on the 9th September, I saw some meat in Messrs. Bouser's shop, Newgate-market—it was four quarters of a cow, less the briskets—I examined it, and found it in a very wet state, I should apprehend, from disease; it was what in the trade is called a "wet 'un," generally the result of disease the general appearance of the meat indicated that the animal had been diseased—I can only indicate the wetness, and flabbiness, and general appearance altogether; to a practised eye it would be so—I doubt whether those indications would be apparent to a person who was not a butcher—when I saw the meat it was out of the hamper—I cannot tell who took it out—I did not see it taken out—in my opinion it was totally unfit for human food—I say so from its diseased state—there is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240130"/>
               <p>no doubt it would have presented the same appearance for some time pre<lb/>viously—I should think immediately it was slaughtered.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the Royal Marines, quartered at Woolwich—the prisoner is a private in the same corps—on Thursday, the 30th October, he came to my house, No. 4, Bowling-green-row, Woolwich—it was a quarter-past 9 as near as possible—I heard him ask if I was at home—I know his voice well, being acquainted with him for a considerable time—I immediately rose from my seat, and told him I should take him to the Barracks, as I knew he had no business there, and he had broken the Bar<lb/>racks' confinement—I had had him confined that morning for some military offence—he said he would see me b—d, and he advanced to me with his right hand in his pocket, and asked me why I had been talking about him—I told him I had not—he said I was a liar—he then, in a very cool manner, seated himself on a chair for a minute or two, and said he had a word to say; one or two words would be quite sufficient—I objected to his sitting down, and he said, "You b—, you shall have it"—he then struck me a blow on the mouth with his left fist—the landlady, Mrs. Norton, interposed—he caught me by the hair—I got away, and went up stairs and locked myself in—that is all I saw of him; we were not together again that night, except at the police-station.</p>

I am the wife of John Norton, of Bowling-green-row, Woolwich—the prisoner came to the house on the evening of the 30th October, about a quarter-past 9—he asked for Sergeant Povis—the sergeant saw him, and there was some discussion, and the prisoner struck him on the mouth slightly—I urged the sergeant to go upstairs, and he did so—the pri<lb/>soner went away in a few minutes, and came back again—he had a knife in one hand and a bottle in the other, containing liquid—the knife was not open—he said the knife was for the sergeant and the contents of the bottle for himself—the sergeant had then gone to barracks, but I told the prisoner he was up<lb/>stairs—he then went away, and came back again—he came two or three times—I could not say whether he had anything in his hands after the first time—shortly after, the police-constable Sykes came to the house—he asked the prisoner what he had got in his hand—he said a bottle—then he asked him what he had got in his hand behind him, and he said, "Would you not like to have it?" and ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Huard, a surgeon—I attended the last witness for some time after the 30th October—he had a wound on the top of the shoulder—the knife produced would cause such a wound—I ob<lb/>served the cape, coats, and brace, they had been cut through, corresponding to the wound in the shoulder—it would require considerable force to inflict such a wound—I examined the contents of the bottle marked "Laudanum"—they consist of laudanum and sulphuric ether, not sufficient to destroy life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What was the depth of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was superficial—more than an eighth of an inch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the night of the 30th October, I went out with a few comrades to a public-horse. I was sitting there, when one of the men told me that Sergeant Povis had been talking about me. I wanted to find out what he said, but they would not tell me. Then I got up to go to Ser<lb/>geant Povis to find out from him. I went there. He knowing I was absent from barracks wanted me to go to the guard room. I told him I wanted to talk with him first. I made a blow at him and struck him; I do not think I hurt him at all, but as for getting him by the hair I could not possibly get at him, for this woman was standing between him and me. Then he went out, whether to barracks or up stairs, I do not know. I came back two or three times. I might have had a knife in my hand; I do not know whether I did or not. I was standing at the top of the street, when a man named Fish came by and told me to go away. I was going towards Bowling-green-row, when I met the constable Sykes; he got in front of me to stop me. I struck at him with my left hand, then he struck me across the wrist with his <hi rend="italic">buton.</hi> He closed with me, and struck me across the head and made a serious wound. He raised his staff again. When I saw him raising his staff again, I put my hand in my pocket and drew my knife, and closed with him, and somehow he got a wound. It was not done with any in<lb/>tention, because I had nothing against the constable. If it had been the sergeant who closed with me, I would not have said what the consequence might have been, but I had no intention to injure the constable. That is all I have to say.</p>

The deceased, Mrs. Day, was my daughter—she was thirty-three years of age—she was married to the prisoner; it would have been three years come Christmas—they lived together two years and nine months—for five or six weeks they were lodging at Rochester-row, West<lb/>minster—I was living in Tower-street—my daughter was with me there for five weeks; she left the prisoner and came to reside with me, but he was continually coming to my house to annoy us—the day before she left Rochester-row, I was there—the prisoner was aware that she was about to leave—he swore, with heavy threats, that he would murder her if he found her there on the Friday—he said if the things were not removed he would take the hatchet and break them all up to bits—"So," he said, "you had better take them away"—when he came home to tea he began quarrelling over the tea-table, and he quarrelled very much indeed with her, so much that I made her leave the room—I then went into the room, and he began to talk to me about my daughter's leaving him; and he swore bitterly to me, that if she was not out of the house on Friday, he would take her b—life away, and break up everything in the place—I said, "Harry, these are horrid words for a mother to hear; do you really mean Annie to leave you? let us do it quietly; don't take her life; spare her for me, as I am getting old"—he said, "No, I won't stain my hands with the b—b—; she may go; and let some other b—man have a tying up with her, as I have had"—he said he meant her to leave him; he was quite tired of her—I then said to him, "Harry, you had better write out on a piece of paper what she is to take," meaning the goods; and I asked him if there was anything he chose to have left, to say so, and not, when we were gone, to say that we had robbed him—he then said what was to be left, and what was to be taken—I said, "I had rather Mr. Parcel, the landlord, came up as a witness;" and Mr. Parcel came up, and heard what the prisoner had to say; and it was finally settled that Annie was to go away on the Friday—I went there on the Friday—I did not see the prisoner there that day—my daughter left on the Friday, and came home with me, and the things that had been named the day before were removed—that was about five weeks before this transaction—during that five weeks the prisoner came several times to my house—he came on a Sunday morning, when I was pre<lb/>paring the dinner in the shop, sat himself down, and asked if I had got any beer—I said I had a little in a bottle—he then stayed and dined with us, and remained all night, and he slept there the whole of that week till the Friday, when I wished Annie to go back and live with him again: I thought it would, perhaps, be as well if she gave him another trial; and she went, poor thing, with great reluctance—she remained with him from the Saturday night till the Friday following—I did not go to the house to Rochester-row that week, while she was there—she returned to me once more on the Friday—the prisoner came to the house on the Monday after, I think, and annoyed us very much, and broke a looking-glass in front of the house—he abused my daughter very much, and caused a great mob round the door, so much so that I was very much alarmed, and at last the policeman, Mr. Cook, came along and got him away from the door—the prisoner came several times: one night he came and broke the hasp off the door, and burst right in, and said he would come in—I sent for a policeman then and got him away—the policeman wanted me to give him in charge, but I did not, though I ought to have done so—I was not at home on Thursday, 18th September, when this happened—I returned home about a</p>

I am the wife of Richard Westcot Jones, of 74, Tower-street—on Thursday, 18th September, I was sitting at my window at needle-work—my attention was attracted by a lot of boys round the door of No. 75, and there was a very great row—I went next door to 75, and saw Mr. Cook push Mr. King out of the parlour door into the shop—I saw the deceased, and heard her say that Mr. King had hit her in the stomach—I could not say that the policeman heard that—she said she was very much hurt in the stomach, and was in such dreadful pain—I asked her to let me look—she refused, she said she did not like to—she stood at the foot of the bed—she said, "Oh dear, I can't bear myself"—I said, "You had better let me look"—she laid down on the bed and I looked, and found a wound in her stomach and one on her hip—when I first saw her she was at the parlour door, with Mr. King's hat in her hand—I undressed her and put her to bed—I saw her again about ten minutes before she died, and I saw her after she was dead—about five weeks before this there was a great row with them, and Mr. King asked for his looking-glass—I don't know who gave it to him,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240152"/>
               <p>but I saw him strike it down on the pavement, and it broke all to pieces—they had very high words, and he said, "You b—b—, I will be the b—death of you; if I don't have you, no one else shall."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How was the deceased dressed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She had on a light muslin dress, and a black Garibaldi jacket, and a watch and chain at her side; a flannel petticoat, and two black petticoats to the best of my knowledge—I know Cook by sight, not in any other way—I have had no communication with him—I never spoke to him above twice in my life, and that was the night the murder was done—I have not seen him since, no more than coming backwards and forwards here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in the Westminster-road—I knew the deceased Sarah Ann Day—I attended her two or three years back—on 18th September. I was called in to see her, about 6 o'clock—she was apparently about thirty-three years of age—I found her on the bed partly undressed—I examined her—I found a longitudinal wound in the abdomen—there were two wounds, the first appeared to be made with a screwdriver, and the second was over the hip (<hi rend="italic">pointing out their positions</hi>),—one was longitudinal, and the other transverse, in a line with the body, that was the one in front—the wound in front was about an inch from the navel, and a little below it—that penetrated the abdominal cavity, dividing the mesenteric vessels—I can't speak with any certainty as to the depth of that wound, the parts beneath being yielding—the other wound was over the hip, as if it was done in that direction (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—I cannot speak with any certainty as regards the depth of that wound—the first wound was such as would be inflicted with a blunter instrument than a chisel, and the second, the one the hip, was evidently done with a sharp instrument like a chisel—the clothes were cut likewise, corresponding with the wounds, in both instances—there must have been some force used in the infliction of the wounds—she died the next day about 3 o'clock, or a little after—by direction of the Coroner, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found the cause of death to be internal hemorrhage—that was caused by the wounds, there is no doubt of it.</p>

I am landlord of the house, 75, Tower-street—the room in question is but seven feet long, and the space between the bedstead and the partition is about seven feet by three or four—as the witness described it as thirteen or fourteen feet, I thought it right to state this—the width of the room would be about six feet, or from that to seven—it is a square room, but the distance between the bedstead and the partition where the circumstance took place, would only be about three feet six—the room is about seven feet square; it may be a little shorter one way than the other—I was married in that same house, and have known that room for twenty-five years—I know the length and width of it, even by the tread of the foot—I have not actually measured it; but I am confident that is about the size.</p>

I am a surgeon—I was called in on this night to see Mr. Cooke—I found him lying on a bed, faint, and exhausted—on removing the clothes I found a bloody patch—I ripped up his shirt, and found his flannel-shirt saturated, and found ten holes on the right side—I probed each of them, but could discover nothing at the bottom, owing to the fact that he would probably be in a different position at the time he received the wound to what he was at the time I examined him, and the holes would not correspond, the parts are so moveable under the intercostal muscles—I did not find any shot—that is quite consistent with the fact that he might have received the wounds from a pistol loaded with shot—the shot were evidently internal from the symptoms that occurred—they are there still—I have not been able to extract them—he has recovered for the present, but the lower part of the lung is permanently destroyed, con<lb/>solidated—I do not hope to be able to extricate the shot—for the present, probably he may not be likely to suffer much; many cases have been known in which foreign bodies have been in the lungs, and the patient has recovered at the time, and then traumatic phthisis has come on.</p>

I am assistant to Miss Ferris, my cousin, of 115, Portland-street, Walworth—on 10th November, about 8 o'clock at night, the prisoner came for a penny candle and a box of lucifers—he gave me a shilling—I tried it in the detector, and found it was bad—he said, "I will go and fetch another one"—Miss Ferris came in, and bent it very much in the detector, so that it could not pass—the prisoner took it up, and went out, and Miss Ferris and Mrs. Anderson, my cousins, followed him.</p>

I said, "I have no means of hiding myself up; if I do, how am I to live?" He then went away. I never hid myself up, and when the officer took me I told him all about it; that I received them of Yates, and all that. He asked me if I had pledged any other things. I said, "Yes," I had.

I said, "To Walworth." He said, "I am going to Blackheath, and you can go with me." I rode with him, and when we got on to the heath he stopped and said, "Oh, I wish to go to a friend of mine, for a few minutes." He went into a house and left me with the horse—I did not understand the horse. I then saw a policeman, and thought he was noticing my awkward<lb/>ness. I walked away, and when I came back I could not see this man. I asked the man who was sweeping the crossing, to mind the horse and chaise for a few moments, and gave him twopence. I then went and got some re<lb/>freshment; this man told me his name, and I inquired for it at one of the houses, I saw the two policemen when I went round, one was the same as I met on the heath. I went up to the horse and chaise, and he asked me if it was mine. I said, "No; why?" He said, "Whom does it belong to." I said, "A gentleman." He said, "Do you know him?" I said I had a slight acquaintance with him; he had left me on the heath. He then said, "You must consider yourself in my custody." I said, "What for?" He said, "Loitering with intent to commit a felony." I was charged and taken to the station. Next morning I was called up, and two females said they thought I was the man who committed a robbery some weeks ago. If this is the last hour I live, I am innocent of it, and I have a witness here to prove that I have been under an engagement with him for the last year, all the time these robberies were being committed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Crown and Anchor public-house, in Charles-street, Bermondsey, and have been so nearly two years—my house was broken into on the morning of 11th March, to the best of my knowledge—I went to bed at 12 o'clock, or a few minutes after, the night before, leaving the house bolted up as usual—I saw to it myself before I went to bed—one window up-stairs was not fastened, the others were—I bolted the folding doors down-stairs myself—I was disturbed a little before 3—I jumped out of bed, and opened the window—it was not a very dark morning, not a foggy morning at all, much as usual—I looked out of the window—for a moment I did not see anything—I only heard screaming—I sung out "Police" directly—I was sure there was something the matter, and then I saw the prisoner and two more rush out of the house through the folding-doors, and they turned to the right, up towards Dockhead—I forget the name of the street—I afterwards looked at the window of the club-room, and found it partly open—it was not in the same state as I left it in when I went to bed at 12—the folding-doors bad not been forced—one bolt was pulled down, and the other pulled back—they were not opened from the outside—I missed my spectacles, my snuff-box, a kitchen poker, lots of tobacco, and various other things—I had seen the prisoner before, often—many a time, in my own house, as well as out of doors—I am positive he is the man I saw running away with others—I next saw him at the police-station the other night, last week, I think, I forget the day.</p>

                  </hi>. At the beginning of March I lived at the Crown and Anchor in Charles-street, Dockhead—the woman who is now my wife came and called me up on the night of the robbery—I got a poker and ran out—I ran about 100 yards away from the place, but I saw nobody—I heard no noise—I was called up—I took the poker because I thought if I saw them, I would knock them down—I saw nobody, and brought the poker back—I saw Mr. Price about five minutes after I came back.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">recalled</hi>). I was called up by hearing screams of "Cape<lb/>lin, Capelin, there are thieves in the house!"—that roused me—I did not see Mrs. Young come to my door, it was locked—I always lock the bottom door—she could not get to my door—I am sure that the moment I heard her scream "Capelin, Capelin," I threw open my window—I am quite sure I saw the men run away—I saw Mr. Young about two or three minutes after I saw the last man run away—they were just out of my sight when I saw him.</p>
