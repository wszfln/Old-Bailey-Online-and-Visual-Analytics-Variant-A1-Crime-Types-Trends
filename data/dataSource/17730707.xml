I am certain the prisoners were the persons I saw in the garden; it was star light, and the light was very good; I could very well distinguish the persons and their dress. An alarm being given one of them said somebody was at the door: then immediately I heard a voice at the door say bush, if you don't open the door I'll blow your brains out; then the same voice bid us all go into bed; then a man came in with a dark lanthorn; the two persons that I saw in the garden were the two Youngers; the youngest sat by the side of the bed and the other at the bottom of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure as to their persons?</p>
               <p>Mortimer. Yes, I am positive to them. While they were in the room the youngest Younger said blow their brains out and then they will not blow us; one said no, save their lives; that man is not taken: there were eight in all, four above stairs and four below; they said if we stirred they would blow our brains out. When they went away they ordered us to lie two hours or they would blow our brains out.</p>

            . I was waked, and desired Miss Mortimer to get up for there were thieves in the house; Miss Mortimer got up and said there was a man at the door and two men coming up the yard; they said bush, open the door, or we will blow your brains out; I opened the door and they came in, and bid us get into bed and cover our faces. As they were coming up stairs I reached out of bed to hide something, and saw Grear's face as he came up stairs; I imagine he lighted his candle by the lanthorn and put it in the chimney; he demanded the plate; Miss Mortimer said there were six silver spoons in the drawer; he came from the drawer and said to his companion, take this silk; I then thought I heard some more voices in the room; the sheet was off my head, and he said if I did not cover up my face he would blow my brains out. When there was light in the room I saw the shade of a man take down some gowns from a rail; one of them asked for a handkerchief; Miss Mortimer said they were in a drawer; Grear got on the bed and trod on my hand, and never left the bed but to go to the door of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so light that you could distinguish his person?</p>
               <p>Creighton. I saw him come up stairs with the light; I reached out of bed to get a piece of sattin out of the drawer, and Miss Mortimer pulled me back; he called for a chissel to wrench open the drawer, and his companion brought him one; when he had got it open, Grear said you did not tell us there was some money here, we have found it, and there is more in the house, and we must have it or we will cut your heads off, and blow your brains out; he called to the other and bid him charge the other pistol; then one that is not taken said don't kill them; they asked what business we carried on, and one said a milliner's; then they asked where the laces were; Grear said they were Jackson's gang and seared nobody; the boy said blow their brains out, and then they cannot tell tales or give information. Before they went away he said there were four above stairs and four below stairs; that they should be there two hours, and if we got up to alarm any body they would blow our brains out. Grear asked for my pockets; I slid my pocket book out of them and gave him my empty pockets; I knew them again when I saw them at the Justice's. When they were gone, we got out of bed, between three and four o'clock, and locked the door, and threw up the window; Miss Mortimer saw a man walking along with a pitch fork, and said she was sure he was one of the men that had robbed us; that was the eldest of the Youngers.</p>

               <p>Sherwood. Yes, by hear say.</p>
               <p>Q. What character have you heard of them?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. That old woman that was upon her evidence when I came in (Whitefield) is one of those that are very remarkable for receiving stolen goods, along with that boy's mother, who is now under sentence of transportation.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the character of any of the rest?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. I do not know any of the rest.</p>

               <p>Q. to Pagett. Do you know the character of the other two women?</p>
               <p>Pagett. I have seen them in the house at divers times; I know no more of them than seeing them in that house. I have found chissels buried under ground there: the house comes almost to the back of the lady's garden.</p>

               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived there?</p>
               <p>Boss. Two years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 14th of June any alteration happening in Mr. Brailsford's family?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes, that was the day. Mr. Housman was to be left with me, to take care of me and the house, and the maid: I should not have continued there but Mr. Brailsford begged of me to stay. There were some things of my brother's and mine there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the three prisoners coming, that evening to your house?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They came in with an execution along with Mr. Vere I believe?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes; there were only two in the morning, the other was added afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Vere left these three men in possession in the night of the 14th?</p>
               <p>Boss. The 14th.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell my Lord and the Jury what happened on the 15th.</p>

               <p>Boss. The 15th was the day they committed the fact; Mr. Housman went away; the maid servant continued in the house with me till near five o'clock I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means did she go out of the house?</p>
               <p>Boss. I told her to go to Mrs. Wyat's to let her know I would as soon as I had dressed myself come over and wait upon her; then there remained nobody in the house but the three prisoners and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you?</p>
               <p>Boss. I went up stairs for the purpose of dressing myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was you in?</p>
               <p>Boss. I believe it to be up two pair of stairs; I was so frightened with his entering into the room that I was hardly able to know any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070007"/>Q. Who entered into the room?</p>

               <p>Boss. Lennard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut or locked?</p>
               <p>Boss. The door was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it shut to?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cannot tell; he proceeded to violence directly; I was so hurried I was almost distracted; I could hardly recollect any thing; from what I recollect as soon as he entered he proceeded to violence immediately; the first victory I perceived he had gained over me was, that his hand was where it ought not to be; I endeavoured to defend myself from that but found it impossible; I perceived then he was going to unbutton his breeches; with that I left myself unguarded, and with one hand seized him by the throat, and with the other endeavoured to prevent him; then I was quite conquered and he proceeded to lie with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he throw you down?</p>
               <p>Boss. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on the bed?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes, it was on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you undressed; had you your stays off or on?</p>
               <p>Boss. My stays were on but not laced.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pull off your stays?</p>
               <p>Boss. That I cannot tell; my stays were loose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come off?</p>
               <p>Boss. That I cannot tell, they were quite loose; I suppose they might come loose in my struggling.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your stays ever quite loosed?</p>
               <p>Boss. No, they were not; when I got up in the morning I did not stay to lace them quite, but wound the lace round.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you dined in company with these men that day?</p>
               <p>Boss. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in their company that day?</p>
               <p>Boss. I had been in the house with them.</p>
               <p>Q. But not particularly in company with them?</p>
               <p>Boss. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he proceeded to lie with you, will you now give a particular account of what you perceived?</p>
               <p>Boss. I do not know how to describe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any extraordinary appearance?</p>
               <p>Boss. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his privy parts touch you?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in your body?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found that his privy parts were in your body did you find any particular emotion; did you perceive any thing come from him?</p>
               <p>Boss. He was so violent that he hurt me prodigiously; I was very near fainting.</p>
               <p>Q. With what did he hurt you; was it with his members, his privy parts?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he continue on the bed with you?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any sort of guess at the time?</p>
               <p>Boss. I was so distracted with attempting to get out of their hands that I had no recollection at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When his privy parts were in your body did you feel any thing come from him?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards examine your linen; did you look at your shift?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing wet or any appearance of any thing wet?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you examine your shift?</p>

               <p>Boss. I found myself wet; I perceived myself wet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it blood upon your shift or what?</p>
               <p>Boss. Not blood.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it after that you looked at your shift?</p>
               <p>Boss. I did not look at my shift at all; it was from my own perception I found it wet.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was not blood; how do you know if you did not look; was it at any time after you looked at it?</p>
               <p>Boss. The next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave you as soon as he had lain with you, or continue any time after in the room?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you actually did faint or not?</p>
               <p>Boss. I know I felt so ill I thought I was dying, and I believe I fainted more than once.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he knowledge of you more than once?</p>
               <p>Boss. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in any sort consenting to his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070008"/> carnal knowledge of you, or did you resist him to the utmost of your power?</p>

               <p>Boss. I resisted him to my very utmost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you during the time he was struggling with you make use of any outcry or endeavour to alarm?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cried out all I could.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you cry out?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cannot express the words I made use of; I made use of many out-cries. When I had got down in the parlour (I do not know how I got down) I recollect very well that he endeavoured to sooth me, and said there was no harm done; I called out then, and said, you villain you know you have ruined me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a front room or back room?</p>
               <p>Boss. A back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the room you usually lie in?</p>
               <p>Boss. I believe it was in that room. The three prisoners, when I endeavoured to get out, all three endeavoured to prevent me.</p>
               <p>Q. That was afterwards?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes; I can say very little about the other two men; some one of them, but which it was I do not know, d - n'd me for a bitch, and bid me not make such a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. This was after he had lain with you?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection which that was?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Lennard himself?</p>
               <p>Boss. I really cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your lodgings up two or one pair of stairs?</p>
               <p>Boss. Two pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any room but a lodging room?</p>
               <p>Boss. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had lain with you, I believe it was sometime before you was permited to get out of the house?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any attempt to get out of the house?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes, as much as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means was you prevented going out of the house, and by whom?</p>
               <p>Boss. I was crying and was just distracted; I cannot give an account by whom.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect finding yourself some time in the garden?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How got you there?</p>
               <p>Boss. I believe Lennard led me there; when the mob was raised they endeavoured to drag me out; Mr. Giddes's servant maid, whose name is Molly, called to me, and endeavoured to help me over the wall when I was in the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of the prisoners in the garden with you?</p>
               <p>Boss. One was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in his behaviour then?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you continued at the house of Mr. Giddes all the night before?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Sandys come there?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it was not till the next morning that you had any particular conversation with Mrs. Sandys?</p>
               <p>Boss. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her what had passed between Lennard and you?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first time you told any body of it?</p>
               <p>Boss. I really cannot tell what I said over night; but I recollect giving a particular account to Mrs. Sandys the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect particularly what you called out when you was up the two pair of stairs?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cannot tell particularly; I know I made use of a great many expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find yourself the next day, or some days afterwards?</p>
               <p>Boss. Very ill; I was so sore that it was with great difficulty that I walked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that soreness in your privy parts?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any particular pain when you had occasion to void your urine?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that he came into the room where you were?</p>
               <p>Boss. About five in the afternoon; it might be after five; I cannot be particular.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the room before he came into it?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you dined that day?</p>
               <p>Boss. I had ate no dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you upon the bed when he came into the room?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070009"/>Boss. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you upon the bed?</p>
               <p>Boss. I have no recollection of that; I believe he forced me there.</p>
               <p>Q. You only believe it?</p>

               <p>Boss. I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came into the room first of all one would think you could recollect because your fright could not be so great then, not knowing what his intention was?</p>
               <p>Boss. My fright has robbed me almost of all recollection of what passed before and after; I am pretty sure I was not upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what room it was?</p>
               <p>Boss. Not certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect your purpose of being in the room?</p>
               <p>Boss. To dress myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then one would think you would go to that room where you usually sleep?</p>
               <p>Boss. I believe myself to have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you dressed yourself different from what you had been in before that day?</p>
               <p>Boss. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no recollection how long you had been in the room before he came in?</p>
               <p>Boss. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I would not say any thing to give you offence, but upon your oath had you drank with the man that day?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cannot say whether I did or not; I recollect what passed at Justice Fielding's; Lennard there said that I desired him to bring me some rum and water; when I thought I was dying I might desire him to bring me some, but I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect whether before this matter passed you had desired him to bring up a little rum and water to your bedside?</p>
               <p>Boss. I do not believe any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told there was a good deal of rum in the house: now before this thing happened have you no recollection of ordering, or desiring him to bring you a little rum and water?</p>
               <p>Boss. I have not; I do not believe I did such a thing; the maid and I had a dish of tea in the kitchen; that was all the dinner I had; she knows I had nothing that day to disorder me at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cannot find her any where; I do not know where she is; I have sent many times to enquire after her.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that your stays were loose, that you had wrapped the lace round you?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had no time from the morning till five in the afternoon to lace your stays?</p>
               <p>Boss. He followed me so quick I apprehend I had no time to dress me.</p>
               <p>Q. That is from mere apprehension?</p>
               <p>Boss. It is not from mere apprehension I say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you conversed much with Lennard during the morning, or been in company with him?</p>
               <p>Boss. I might talk with him being backwards and forwards in the house, but not to ask him to drink; I am sure I had no other thought than to induce him to behave well till I could get out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Were all the three prisoners in the house during the time?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes, they were in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither of the other men were in the room?</p>
               <p>Boss. Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. The other part of the day were the prisoners in the kitchen floor or the parlour floor?</p>
               <p>Boss. They sat in the parlour, but walked up and down.</p>
               <p>Q. When Lennard came to the room can you recollect whether be shut the door or not?</p>
               <p>Boss. I really cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the parlour in the front or back room?</p>
               <p>Boss. The back room.</p>
               <p>Q. As you had sometimes conversation with Lennard in a free manner, had he offered any civilities to you?</p>
               <p>Boss. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he offered to kiss you?</p>
               <p>Boss. O dear, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he drink tea with you and your maid?</p>
               <p>Boss. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank tea in the kitchen?</p>
               <p>Boss. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the kitchen at the time or in the parlour?</p>
               <p>Boss. I do not believe they were in the kitchen.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070010"/>Q. Do you remember any thing that passed on the 15th of June?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect hearing any thing particular that took your attention?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Give an account of what you heard and what you did.</p>
               <p>Cobbs. I believe it was between seven and eight o'clock I was coming down stairs; I heard the cries of some woman, and as there is but a thin partition, I heard her say, I can't, I can't. I immediately ran down stairs and gave a knock at Mr. Brailsford's door.</p>
               <p>Q. The fore door?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. Yes; the men did not come so soon as I thought they might; I knocked again; two of them immediately came; Lennard is one, and I think that man with his hair tied (Guy) is the other; they did not come to the street door, they lifted up the sash of the fore parlour window on the ground floor; they did not come out; I asked to speak with the maid; they said she was not in the house; I asked where she was gone? they said she was gone somewhere, they did not know where; I asked them what woman they had got in the house that was screaming so; they said there was no woman at all in the house, only a girl that was drunk spewing all over the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. Lennard said that; I said do not tell me of a girl being in the house spewing all over the floor, I won't cease till she is out of the house; they shut down the window and bid me go along about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Which shut down the window?</p>

               <p>Cobbs. I think Lennard, but am not sure. I went into the house where I lived and shut the door, and went into the garden to listen if I could hear any thing of her there, but could not; Mrs. Sandys and Miss Wyat came and knocked at our door; I went down and opened the door to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the stairs was you standing on when you first heard these cries?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. The two pair of stairs; when I came down the two pair of stairs I heard these cries.</p>
               <p>Q. You called them screams, did you hear any more screams?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. Not in the house; Mrs. Sandys and Miss Wyat asked me what was my reason for knocking at the door and putting myself in such a passion; I told them the men had got some woman in the house, whom I believed they were not using well; Mrs. Sandys said she would go to the officer's, to Mr. Vere, and fetch him; when she was gone, the mob raised before the door, and then they let Miss Boss into the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. What raised the mob, the outcries or the knocking at the door?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. There was a woman stood opposite that heard what I said.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the information spread and that was the way the mob was raised?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Miss Boss when she was in the garden?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. When she was at the bottom of the garden, the gate that leads into the park, I saw her crying , wringing her hands, and begging to go out; the man said he had not got the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with her then?</p>

               <p>Q. How did she appear?</p>

               <p>Cobbs. I really thought she was drunk, but next morning seeing her in such great distress, I then thought she was not.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning was her distress and behaviour the same as it was that evening when you saw her first in the garden, when you supposed her to be drunk?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. Yes, it was of the same sort.</p>

             was gone back for the key of the gate, I called to her, and said I would try to pull her over the wall; she immediately came to me; the men came so quickly back with the key, and having threatened me before, I desisted.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had they threatened you before?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. Two of them came into the garden before, with two drawn swords; a gentleman that stood by me d - d them, called them a parcel of villains, and asked them why they would not let the woman out; that gentleman was in my master's garden.</p>

               <p>Cobbs. Lennard and Guy.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did they make?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. They d - d him for a villain, and said if they had him there they would run him through the liver, or something to that purpose; on his coming back so soon with the key I let go of her; I had hold of her hand; they had got down together to the gate, she begging and praying to be let out; I not knowing whether he would let her out or not, called to the centinel standing in the park; upon his coming up, Lennard opened the door and let her out.</p>
               <p>Q. The other two prisoners were not in the garden at the time she was let out?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. No, I only saw Lennard.</p>

               <p>Cobbs. I think Lennard, but I will not be positive.</p>

               <p>Cobbs. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her situation during the night?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. I brought her into the parlour, and set her down on the chair; she wrung her hands, and cried, and said she was ruined and undone for ever.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night might this be?</p>
               <p>Cobbs. Between nine and ten, almost ten.</p>

               <p>Cobbs. I really thought she was drunk; I thought she had been drunk, but by her behaviour in the morning I had reason to think she was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What shop did Mr. Brailsford keep; what business did he follow?</p>

               <p>Walters.

I said put down your sword and come here; I do not know but I am as good a man as you; and I might swear an oath I believe; he shut the door; then I went through the gentleman's house adjoining to Mr. Brailsford's; he was a foreigner; he did not understand much of English, and they told me there was a woman there, they were using very ill; there is a wall that parts the garden of Mr. Brailsford's and this gentleman's; it was so high, I could not look over it; there was a settle or chair, I stood up upon it; the injured lady that I supposed to be, was then in the parlour; I heard her say to somebody you have ruined me! you have ruined me! this was about eight o'clock as nigh as I could guess; then I went to the door again, and said it was a pity but somebody would go to a Justice of peace and take the woman out by force: I came through the garden again and heard the lady still exclaiming in a deplorable condition, making an outcry in the same manner as before. I heard one of them saying d - n you what are you crying about, why don't you lace your stays up?</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell which said that?</p>
               <p>Walter. No; there was another made answer and said d - n you what are you crying about? we will not hurt you, here is a bed in this house, you may lie in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070012"/>Q. Was the voice you heard the second time different from the first, that you could distinguish they were different persons spoke?</p>
               <p>Walters. I think it was; but I cannot be positive; I went to the door as formerly, and there were a great concourse of people there; I lifted up my foot to the door to see if I could push it open, but I could not; I went back to Mr. Giddes's garden again; there is a terrace there; I stood upon the top of the terrace, it is a kind of a mount, and called to them and asked them why they did not let the woman out; they said there was no woman in the house; all the three prisoners came out together; one of them said so.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them in the hearing of the rest said that?</p>
               <p>Walters. Yes; one advanced further to the terrace than the rest, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak loud enough for the other men to hear?</p>
               <p>Walters. Yes, or else I could not have heard him where I was; I said there was a woman in the house, for I heard her cry; I went through the garden and went round to Mr. Brailsford's back door; when I returned back again the woman was brought into the garden; I came back again and told them if they would not open the door, we would haul the woman up over the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was with her when she was brought out?</p>
               <p>Walters. I believe two men; I cannot positively say who; the woman that was | standing by, I believe; had hold of Miss Boss's hand; she called to me for assistance, and before I could possibly come she let go her hand; then I told them if they did not let the lady out immediately I would call to the sentry.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about half an hour or twenty minutes after eight?</p>
               <p>Walters. I cannot be positive to the time. Then I went round and looked through a hole in Mr. Brailsford's back door, and saw her there crying and wringing her hands, and one of the prisoners said they had no key; then I came back again, and by the time that I came back she was let out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw these three men come into the garden upon your calling out, had they any arms?</p>
               <p>Walters. Yes; they had at that time all three cutlasses in their hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her in Mr. Giddes's parlour?</p>
               <p>Walters. No; her hair was all loose, her stays all loose, and her handkerchief off; I asked her how she did? she said, where am I got too? The woman that had her, wished me good night and I came away.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she appear?</p>
               <p>Walters. In much distress of mind; before I saw her I talked with the three prisoners, and asked them how they could be so base and so vile; to use a woman ill; they said they had used no woman ill; that was just as they let her out; I was on the top of the terrace when they let her out.</p>
               <p>Q. Which said that?</p>
               <p>Walters. Guy; then the other made answer, O let him alone, he is some barbering son of a bitch or another; he took me to be a barber I suppose.</p>

               <p>Q. Did both of them say so?</p>
               <p>Walters. Yes; I did not know at this time that the woman was out; they were in their garden then; I told them they were quite mistaken, for if I saw them in another place I would convince them to the contrary; one of them was coming over the wall with his drawn cutlass; it was then duskish; I cannot tell which that was; and as I came close by the wall he made a blow at me; I came down from the terrace and then met Miss Boss.</p>
               <p>Guy. I know Miss Boss left the place between six and seven.</p>
               <p>Q. from Guy. Was I ever in the garden?</p>
               <p>Walters. They were all three there twice.</p>
               <p>Q. from Lennard. Whether he saw Miss Boss in the garden when he came on the terrace, and who let her out?</p>
               <p>Walters. I cannot tell who let her out.</p>
               <p>Q. from Lennard. Whether he saw us three at the bottom of the garden?</p>
               <p>Walters. Yes; two went after the keys to let her out.</p>

            . I got into Mr. Giddes's garden between eight and nine I believe; I first heard a young lady scream very much before I saw any thing of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you then?</p>
               <p>Goodland. In Mr. Giddes's garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her scream as from the house?</p>
               <p>Goodland. Yes; then I saw two men and her come out of the house with cutlasses in their hands one on each side of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Which were they?</p>
               <p>Goodland. I cannot tell their persons; after that one man came out with a cutlass; there were three in all out. Mr. Walters, and the girl with me, asked why they did not let the lady out; they said they could not find the key<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070013"/> of the door; then Mr. Waters and the girl tried to get the young lady over the wall; upon which one of them swore he would cut the girl's arm off if she reached over the wall, or cut her liver out if she attempted to get her over the wall; I do not know which said that; they called to the centinel, and then she was let out.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. She was at the same side of the wall at the time of this expression as the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Goodland. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if they had chose to hurt her they might?</p>
               <p>Goodland. It was spoke to us; to the servant maid, I believe.</p>

            ?</p>
               <p>Sandys. Yes; I keep a house in the same street. I went between five and six o'clock to enquire for Miss Boss, being informed in the morning that she and the maid were left in the house: I went first to Mrs. Wyat's; she told me the affair that had happened; there was Miss Boss's servant maid; she said she would not lie in the house another night for a great deal, from some behaviour she had seen the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she explain what that behaviour was?</p>
               <p>Sandys. No; I did not ask her, nor did she explain any thing; I then thought it was unsafe for Miss Boss to be there all night; I had no intention before of asking her to come to my house; I asked Mrs. Wyat whether I should be admitted to go over and ask Miss to come to my house; her daughter went with me to Mr. Brailsford's; Lennard opened the door to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was that?</p>
               <p>Sandys. Between five and six I believe; I asked him if Mr. Vere was there, knowing him; he said no; I asked for Miss Boss; he said she was just gone out; I replied, good God, which way can she be gone, she promised to come over to Mrs. Wyatt's to drink tea; I think it very ungenteel of her: she did not come out of this door or else we should have seen her; no, says he, ma'am, she is gone into the park with a small bundle in her handkerchief; I asked him if he thought I could overtake her, and how long had she been gone; he said six minutes; I then begged of him to let me out at the garden door; he ran to the door with me; when he came he had forgot the key; I went to the garden, but the door was locked; he returned and brought the key and let us both out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear any noise in the house as you passed through.</p>
               <p>Sandys. Not the least; I enquired as soon as I got into the park, of a man that was working there, if he had seen a young lady come into the park; he said there had not that half hour; I went round the park and looked for her; I came home then, and went down to enquire, being uneasy on account of what I had heard the maid, express; I went again a second time; I enquired for Lennard, as I had seen him before; he came to the window; I asked him if Miss Boss was come in yet; he told me no; he flung up the sash of the hall window; I asked him if she left word when she should return, and left word for him to tell her when she came in, that I wanted to speak to her; one of them, I think Graves, said, I could not speak to one that was not in the house; I did not rightly observe who that was, as I did not then suspect her to be in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not Lennard?</p>
               <p>Sandys. No. I went for Mr. Vere, and brought him down about ten o'clock at night, or a little after; they acquainted me then that she was got out, and the manner in which she had been got out. I went to Miss Boss to Mr. Giddes's.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find her?</p>
               <p>Sandys. In great trouble, wringing her hands, and saying she was ruined and undone for ever.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the maid that you saw at Mrs. Wyatt's?</p>
               <p>Sandys. I never saw her afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she gone from Mrs. Wyatt's before you went out?</p>
               <p>Sandys. I believe I left her there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to you as a person in distress or in liquor?</p>
               <p>Sandys. In distress entirely; I was clear of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps as you have known her long you can inform us whether she is a person addicted to liquor?</p>
               <p>Sandys. Not in the least; I would not say it for the world if I did not think so; I have heard my husband speak much of her being a very sober, virtuous, spotless girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her that night in what manner she was undone?</p>
               <p>Sandys. There were so many people about, a gentleman or two, that I did not thing it was so proper; I was happy she was so safe out of the house. Next morning Mr. Giddes's maid came to me, and told me the trouble that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070014"/> my friend had been in all night. My husband desired me to get up and go to her. I several times asked her what she meant by being ruined; she said nothing but these villains! these villains!</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in bed when you came to her?</p>
               <p>Sandys. Yes, crying, and in the greatest distress I ever saw; then I said what has these villains done to you; I was in hopes last night you had got out of the house in good time, and had not been injured; O said she one man! one man! well, what has this one man done to you; Mr. Giddes's maid sat at the side of the bed; I looked at her to leave the room; she did; then I asked her if this one man came into the room; she said yes; I said, did he dare to come to bed to you; she said he did; did he dare to do all that was bad to you; he did Mrs. Sandys. I expressed to her she ought to get him punished; and asked her what defence she made for herself; she said she did all in her power; nay, says she, once I caught him by the throat, and then, says she, I was in hopes I had done for him; that was all she expressed of the affair to me that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you that morning, or at any other time, examine Miss Boss?</p>
               <p>Sandys. I did not examine her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you occasion to look at her linen?</p>
               <p>Sandys. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. The question you asked Miss Boss was this, did he dare to come to bed to you? had you the curiosity to enquire about what time this was?</p>
               <p>Sandys. No; I said I would send some more able persons to discourse with her.</p>

             and asked her whether Miss Boss had told her that any of the men had lain with her; she said yes. I said if any one particular man has used you ill, and has ravished you, and had any knowledge of your body, in justice to yourself, and in justice to the world, take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you any thing of the particulars of it?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. Yes, she described the man which I believe to be Lennard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say whether it was by her consent?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I asked her that, and she said no, very far from that; I told her a man's life was depending, and she ought to take care and be particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her about what time it happened?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. She said, to the best of my knowledge about tea time; when she was to have come to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. Only by words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at her linen?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been acquainted with her a great while?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. About three or four weeks: I keep a shop on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her disordered in liquor?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear she drank?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of the maid servant, do you know?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. She went away after she had drank two or three dishes; I have seen her but once since?</p>
               <p>Q. Was she examined then?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Miss Boss the morning following particularize to you how she found herself?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. That the man had used her very ill; she described that she was very much disordered, very much swelled and sore round her waist, and with great difficulty made her urine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the maid servant explain what she meant by the bad behaviour she had seen in the house?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No; it was because of an alarm or disturbance the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. from Lennard. What did you go there for?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. There was a trifle owing me: I keep a shop; I asked Miss Boss about it; she seemed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070015"/> frightened; I said don't be afraid, they are Mr. Vere's men, and I believe him to be an honest man. I went into the back room and the prisoners were there.</p>
               <p>Lennard. Let her tell how Miss Boss and she got drunk together.</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I will tell your lordship all that passed: Miss Boss told me she had nothing to give me; I said ma'am, I don't want any thing; I went up stairs and enquired of the men after Mr. Vere's family; when I came down again she had a bottle of rum; she endeavoured to draw the cork; she could not draw it, and I either broke it or pushed it in, and she gave me a little of the rum, about the 6th part of a gill; Miss Boss was sick; I advised her to drink a little; she drank a little but brought it up again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you set together?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. Not a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her drink any more rum but that little you mentioned.</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any more?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and Miss Boss drank rum together before?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I never drank any thing with her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bottle of rum full when it was opened?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I cannot tell; I went again in the afternoon to see for her; I believe about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to be perfectly sober?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I do not know any thing to the contrary, but she was uneasy about Mr. Brailsford; I attributed it to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to you to be perfectly sober or otherwise?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. She appeared to be very unhappy, and said she did not like to stay in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think her perfectly sober in the afternoon, or otherwise?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I thought her so the same as in the morning, only distressed upon Mr. Brailsford's account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she talk coherently and sensibly?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. Very sensibly.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she dressed when you first came in the morning?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. In a black silk night gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she laced?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I cannot say; I do not take particular notice of people's dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a cap on then?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a handkerchief round her bosom?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you go up into?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. In the first floor back room I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. She said she had got nothing to give you for they had got the keys, where did she get rum from?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. When I came down I asked her where she got it; she said I asked them for it, and I believe it was Lennard gave it her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you stay with her the second time?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I believe about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a good deal of conversation with her at this time?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I desired she would dress herself and come over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she up or lying on the bed?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. Sitting down upon the bed when I was there, and I would have had her lain down and composed herself, as she said she had had no rest the night before; she said no, she could not think of sleeping in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask you to drink rum this afternoon?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you seen the maid since?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. She called one day, but did not sit down; one day when she was going to Sir

            's, or did she go there?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. She went down to go to her lodgings; she said she had to go as far as Temple Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Miss Boss when you came in the afternoon?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. In the kitchen to the best of my knowledge?</p>
               <p>Q. Were the men with her?</p>

               <p>Wyatt. I did not see the men with her; that was the first time I was there I saw Lennard in the kitchen doing something; he said nothing to me nor to her.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she drink nothing in the afternoon?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No.</p>

               <p>Miss Boss is sent for into Court again.</p>
               <p>Q. You was certainly very much frightened and distracted at this outrage offered you; what was the first thing you recollect after the time this fact was committed; where do you recollect finding yourself?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070016"/>Boss. The first recollection I have was in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Now can you recollect how you got into the parlour?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the circumstances that you recollect first to have happened in the parlour?</p>
               <p>Boss. Nothing more than his behaviour, that being bad, and bad language.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, during the time you was in the parlour, making use of those expressions I can't, I can't.</p>
               <p>Boss. I do not recollect those expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember some particulars very correctly, can you recollect whether you was lying down or not in the room above stairs when Lennard came in?</p>
               <p>Boss. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect?</p>
               <p>Boss. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You was asked whether you could recollect the circumstances of having drank some rum and water before this fact was committed; you said you did not, but was not sure whether you might ask for some when you thought you was dying?</p>
               <p>Boss. I don't recollect whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect drinking any thing in the morning?</p>

               <p>Boss. Mrs. Wyatt was there in the morning, I was exceeding sick; I drank about a spoonful, which came up almost as soon as I had drank it.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said when I asked you whether any civilities passed between you and him, you said he was rather civiler than he was the night before?</p>
               <p>Boss. My maid said something; they were up in her room; Mr. Housman was to have staid to defend me and they sent him away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the maid lie with you the night before or by herself?</p>
               <p>Boss. By herself.</p>
               <p>Q. And you laid by yourself; did you fasten your bed chamber that night?</p>
               <p>Boss. No, I never do.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get this bottle of rum from?</p>
               <p>Boss. From Lennard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any more of the rum, either in the morning or in the afternoon, besides that quantity, when Mrs. Wyat was with you?</p>
               <p>Boss. I did not, unless it was when I was insensible, and did not know whether I had it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that rum after Mrs. Wyat went away?</p>
               <p>Boss. I left it on the kitchen dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you had nothing the whole day but the tea and bread and butter, where had you the tea from?</p>
               <p>Boss. The maid went out and bought it?</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it that you recovered your recollection, before the time you was let go?</p>
               <p>Boss. I really cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems extraordinary, that you should have no recollection after the fact, till you found yourself in the parlour; do you apprehend you was in a fit?</p>
               <p>Boss. I really cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Lennard's Defence.</p>

               <p>When I was put in upon the execution by Mr. Vere, these two gentlemen were in first; and Mr. Vere not finding them sufficient people to take care of the premises, left me to take care with them; a man in boots, I do not know him if I was to see him again, was along with Miss Boss, and had been with her all day, Houseman I believe his name is, I did not know him, what he was, nor ever asked him what he was; they dined together in the back parlour; we had some cold veal together; this was the 14th, the day the execution came in; after they had dined they went up stairs together, they drank pretty hearty below; then they took up a bottle of rum and the glass with them, and I never saw Miss Boss, nor this Housman, till two in the morning; then we three went up stairs to know the reason of his staying there so late, he said he was left there to take care of Miss Boss; I said his pulling his boots off to get into bed to her was no care at all of her; he had one boot off and was pulling the other off, and Miss Boss was very drunk; we told him he must come out of that room; he said he would be there; when he found we would not let him be in the room he drew the other boot on, and came down stairs; then he said, now you villains, when he got to the door, I will bring people that shall get you out of the house: it was our business to take care of the sheriff: presently after I heard a double tap at the door; I heard Housman say he was there: he brought a whole parcel of people there: we would not open the door to him, he staid there from a quarter before three knocking at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070017"/> the door; at last the mob dispersed, he came about ten the next morning; I opened the door to him, he said he wanted to come in, I told him for his ill behaviour he should not come in; he said he begged my pardon, it was not him but the liquor and he was sorry for it; I let him in and he went up stairs to Miss Boss, and staid there ten or twenty minutes. I let him out to the Park and never saw him afterwards. The next day this Mrs. Wyatt came and knocked at the door, I opened it; she asked me for Miss Boss, I said I did not know whether she was up or not for I was in the back parlour; but she had got down stairs without either cap or any thing else, and her hair all over her eyes; this Mrs. Wyat went down stairs to her; presently I was called; they asked me to let them have a drop of rum; she said these people where she was had robbed her of all her property, and she was ruined and undone; I said I could not help that: she said you behaved very well young man, I shall for ever regard you for your civility last night; she went into the cellar with me and Mrs. Wyatt, and put her hand upon the top of a puncheon, and took up a bottle of rum, and she gave me and my partners another between us to drink: they took this rum into the fore kitchen, and this woman staid about an hour and an half; I saw Mrs. Wyatt almost drunk then, and let her out; she came back again and went down stairs; I went down, and we got dressing a mouthful of cold veal for our breakfasts, and Miss Boss was so drunk she could not speak, and was crying, and said she was ruined and undone; I asked her at last where was the rum; she said, I do not know what is become of it. Mrs. Wyatt was so drunk she could not stand, and Miss Boss was drunk, with her head on her hand, something slipping down; at last Mrs. Wyatt came up stairs; that was the second time of returning. I did not see her in the afternoon; she fell in the passage she was so drunk: in about half an hour after Miss Boss came up stairs, and in catching hold of the bannister, fell upon her hands and knees. I heard something fall; there she was lying and could not get up she was so intoxicated, and crying; we helped her upon her feet, and she came into the back parlour and sat down upon the chair; she was not capable of walking up stairs; these men and I led her up stairs; we let her go at her room door; instead of her throwing herself on the bed lengthways, she threw herself upon her face, and cried out, murder! we left her; she said, for God's sake bring me some rum and water! I brought her up some rum and water, and I never saw her more. After that these men came up, and said let her lay there; I never saw her any more till she came down into the yard; she came into the back parlour between five and six, and she had then no hat or cap on.</p>
               <p>Graves's Defence.</p>

               <p>I was in the house, in possession, at the same time, and this Miss Boss went up stairs; he and I led her up stairs; she laid herself upon the bed, and he left her: he carried her some rum and water as she asked for; I came down that instant, and never saw her from that time till about five in the evening. People knocking at the door, and throwing mud at the door, we brought down cutlasses to defend ourselves.</p>
               <p>Guy's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was in possession the same as the other; she got drunk on the 14th about one or two. Lennard said it is not proper for this stranger to be in the house; we don't know what he may do in the night. We went up stairs; he was sitting upon the chair, and his elbow upon the side of the bed: Lennard asked him what he did there: he went away, and said, on the other side of the door going out, I will take care in a short space of time none of you three shall be here. In about half an hour after he got four or five men, and made a great deal of noise at the door, but they could not break it: there was quite a mob. The next day he came again. Lennard had a key of the back and front door, and the wine-cellar: he let them in; he said I beg pardon, it was the liquor that did it: they dined, I think, in the back parlour; she got herself intosticated in liquor very much; they went down stairs: these men and I played at cards in the front parlour; the man went away; this old gentlewoman (Mrs. Wyatt) and she went down stairs; which way they were carried up stairs I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Wyatt. You have heard what Lennard says, that you went down into the cellar, took a bottle of rum from the puncheon, and drank so plentiful that you was quite drunk, and fell down in the passage?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I am upon my oath: I was as sober as when I got out of my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go down into the cellar to get the rum?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070018"/>Wyatt. No. Miss Boss took it from the dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give Lennard any of the rum?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at all drunk?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No more than when I was born.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the second time when you went there?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give Lennard any rum?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. None at all. I do not know that he was in the room.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sandys again.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was at Mrs. Wyatt's do you think she was in liquor?</p>
               <p>Sandys. No; perfectly sober: I have known her 15 years, and know her to be a sober woman. I can bring several of my family to vindicate her in that respect.</p>

               <p>Q. How is Miss Boss connected with Mr. Brailsford?</p>
               <p>Houseman. I always understood as a boarder and lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he her guardian, or had he the care of her estate?</p>
               <p>Houseman. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Houseman. An acquaintance of Mr. Brailsford's. I have a set of mills at Berkhamstead in Hertfordshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you married or single?</p>
               <p>Houseman. Married.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be left in this house?</p>
               <p>Houseman. At the request of Mr. Brailsford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you dine there on Monday?</p>
               <p>Houseman. Yes; in the further parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. With whom?</p>
               <p>Houseman. Miss Boss and the children; they were there then.</p>
               <p>Q. What drink had you at or after dinner?</p>
               <p>Houseman. I believe there was wine on the table, and I believe we might drink about two glasses apiece.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any rum?</p>
               <p>Houseman. No; I saw no rum.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you stay after dinner in the parlour?</p>
               <p>Houseman. About a quarter of an hour, as near as I can recollect. I was in and out of the house several times in the afternoon; I went to enquire for Mr. Brailsford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up stairs with Miss Boss?</p>
               <p>Houseman. No, I was not till evening; and then a gentleman of Mr. Brailsford's acquaintance called me up in the evening, (this was night) and desired me to take care of Miss Boss.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your boots on?</p>
               <p>Houseman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening did you go up to her?</p>
               <p>Houseman. I believe about twelve o'clock at night, that gentleman when he went away called me up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with Miss Boss before, or only with Mr. Brailsford's family?</p>

               <p>Houseman. I have known of her being there for, I believe, a year and a half, but I never conversed with her, till within a few months that I had been in town about some particular business, and frequently called there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she continue below stairs or above?</p>
               <p>Houseman. Below stairs, while I was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and she drank any rum from the time you was below till you went up stairs?</p>
               <p>Houseman. No, none at all.</p>

               <p>Q. What room did you go into?</p>
               <p>Houseman. It was the first room.</p>
               <p>Q. A bed-chamber?</p>
               <p>Houseman. It was a bed-chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it her bedchamber?</p>
               <p>Houseman. I apprehended it was Mr. Brailsford's bedchamber where he and his wife lay.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you stay there with her before these people came up?</p>
               <p>Houseman. Three or four, but not exceeding five minutes, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any liquor there?</p>
               <p>Houseman. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pulled off one of your boots?</p>
               <p>Houseman. No, nor never attempted it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no liquor there?</p>
               <p>Houseman. None that I know of; I had none I am sure; I saw none; they came up stairs, and one of them tapped at the chamber-door; I was sitting upon the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. The door was shut?</p>
               <p>Houseman. The door was shut. I was sitting within two yards of the door; they demanded of me the keys of the cellar. I told them I had no keys. But, said they, if you have no keys, you can get us the keys. I said, I had none; I cannot get them; I won't get them; that I had no business with keys of any sort; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070019"/> told me then if I did not get the keys they would turn me neck and heels out of the house. They took and turned me out of doors. As soon as they had turned me out I considered the situation that Miss Boss and the maid-servant must be in: I thought it very disagreeable. I immediately knocked at the door, and called the watch. There were two watchmen came up. I said that the bailiffs were in that house, and two young ladies there, and I was apprehensive they might be used ill. I asked them if they could break open the door? they said they had no authority to do that. I said I would apply to the peace officer, and have them out of the house if it was possible. Upon this I continued knocking till Miss Boss and the servant-maid looked out of the window; I desired them to come down, and I would take the best care of them I could: they said they could not come down, or they could not get out.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Was it the women or men you meant to get out of the house?</p>
               <p>Houseman. The women.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with Miss Boss next day?</p>
               <p>Houseman. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any liquor with her next day; did you drink any rum with her?</p>

            : our house was broke open between the 27th and 28th of June. Mr. Ireson rented a parlour, a dining room, and a back chamber: they got in at the fore parlour window; there were two outside shutters to the window secured by bolts; I fastened that window at nine at night, when I went to bed. The bolt was found in the yard wrenched off.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what Mr. Ireson lost I supoose?</p>
               <p>Evans. No. Between one and two in the morning I heard a noise in the house; I lie on the second floor; I got up, and saw a man upon my landing place with a mould candle in his hand: my bed chamber door was open; I went to the window and called the watch; I saw three men; one went out first upon my crying out; then three went out, and the last man that went out fired a pistol at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak with certainty as to the man you saw standing with the candle in his hand?</p>
               <p>Evans. I think that is the man (pointing to Cherry.)</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from you when you saw him?</p>
               <p>Evans. About ten stairs. My husband is at Jamaica: he has been gone fourteen weeks last Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who fired the pistol at you?</p>
               <p>Evans. The same I saw upon the stairs - Cherry.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think it was between one and two o'clock?</p>
               <p>Evans. When I got up I saw it was star light; they all went out and left the door open, and the last man fired at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of either of the other three?</p>
               <p>Evans. No; as soon as I cried, watch! they immediately got out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Ireson was not at home?</p>
               <p>Evans. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from Cherry. Did you swear to me before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Evans. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. from Cherry. She said she had never seen me to her knowledge.</p>
               <p>Evans. No; I was not asked any thing about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you asked before the Justice whether you knew any of the men?</p>
               <p>Evans. Yes; I said then I thought Hudson was the man that stood upon the stair case and fired the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think now Cherry was the man?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070025"/>Evans. By their dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason to alter your opinion?</p>
               <p>Evans. No other reason; I believe I was mistaken then; I won't positively swear to Cherry.</p>

I went into the country on Saturday night about four o'clock; on Monday morning this boy, who I employ as a foot boy, brought me word my house was broke open, and all the things plundered; I came back about seven in the morning; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them); these things lay in a japan box in a wardrobe in my parlour, in the front room up stairs; the lock of the japan box was broke off; every bureau and desk I had was broke open, and every thing scattered about; they left a loaded pistol in my bed chamber.</p>

               <p>Q It was not day break then?</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. It was on the outside.</p>
               <p>Gains. I ran to the house; I saw three men come out, and heard a pistol fired; I at first thought it was fired out of the window at the people, but when I came up I found it was a mistake; the first man I met was Fowler.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the house?</p>
               <p>Gains. Five doors; that was before the pistol was fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Fowler was the man you met five doors from the house?</p>
               <p>Gains. Yes; when I met him he struck at me with something in his hand, which I took to be a cutlass; I struck at him; he hit me on the shoulder; I had no mark on my coat or shoulder; I ran after the second, wh o came across the road and went over the bank. I drew out my pistol and snapped at him as he went across the road, but it missed fire.</p>

            . I live next door to Mrs. Evans: about two o'clock I heard the cry of murder and thieves; I threw open my sash and cried fire immediately; I saw three men come out of Mrs. Evans's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it break of day?</p>
               <p>Barber. It was twilight; it was more than break of day: the first that came out was Barret.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man?</p>
               <p>Barber. Yes, I took particular notice; he came out with his hat flapped in his hand; he turned round and looked up to see who was crying; and Cherry was the man to the best of my knowledge that fired the pistol at me; the shot entered the window two panes above my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man?</p>
               <p>Barber. I cannot swear down right, but to the best of my opinion he is the man.</p>

On the 31st of May, about half after twelve at noon, I saw the prisoner and another lad about his window for half an hour together; I suspected them, and kept my eye upon them; at last I saw them close together doing something to the window; I believe they cut the glass; the prisoner took a card of buttons out and made off; I pursued him, and I saw him drop the buttons down a cellar. (The buttons produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

            , I am son-in-law to Mr. Robbins: my mother waked me; I jumped up, opened the window, and saw the prisoner run from the house; I put my shoes, stockings, and breeches on: I went out and saw a man behind an elm tree; I went after him; I traced him as far as Davis's; there I got intelligence of him, and then took him at the Black Lion, at Kingsbury; there were three more, which three were in the house; whether those two were in the house or no I cannot tell; the house is a lone house 30 yards out of the lane, and a considerable way out of the high road; there is no other house near it. When I took him, his white stockings were all wet and dirty, seemingly as if he had been going through wet grass. I am sure the man I took at Kilburn is the same man I saw at the door; I know him by the clothes, and one shoulder was higher than the other.</p>

I am a butcher: I saw these lads at Chelsea, first of all on the 28th of May, playing at skittles, then at another public house next morning at skittles, then again on the 29th; I described them to Mr. Wright, and desired to know whether any robbery had been committed near Chelsea; he said there had; then I suspected they might be the persons that had committed the robbery, and as I was going over Chelsea fields, on the morning of the 29th, I saw old Marchant looking at some clothes; I took it to be a shirt; I made enquiry after these boys of some woman; I asked whether she had seen a boy with one arm; ( Marchant, jun. has but one arm); some woman walking on, cried, here is the boy with one arm, and at that time old Marchant was with them; upon their crying out, the old man, with the young ones, tied up the bundle, and the lad with one arm carried it with him; the old man went with the two boys, but Lock jumped over the bank; they hurried on; I walked slowly after them; the lad gave his father the bundle; I followed the old man into his ward; he is a Chelsea pensioner; I said, you have some things come unlawfully by; he said, go you scoundrel, don't breed a riot here, they are my own, I shall do with them as I like; I said they are not your own; he said he had bought them, and would sell them; he put the bundle in the ward and took some victuals out for the lads; I went in search of them, and found them playing again; then Wright came up and took the lads in a public house; Wright searched the boys, and found the spectacle case upon Marchant the Younger; he said it belonged to his father; we took these lads then, and went to the College to see after the father; we asked the captain of the College for leave to search the rooms; he said we might search all the wards; then we searched old Marchant's room, and in his box found a bundle with the several things produced in court, all sworn to by Richardson; I think it is the same bundle I saw old Marchant with because wrapped up in such a handkerchief.</p>

I had concealed my watch; I told him I had none; then said he your pocket book! I told him I had never a one; then he demanded our rings; I gave him a mourning one; then he went round again to Mr. Colberg, and demanded his watch, and I believe he gave him more money; then he returned again to me, and said d - n you, I will search you; he opened the door of the chaise and saw a red trunk between my legs; he said he would have it; he took it out of the chaise with great violence, and then called to his companion, and they both went off with it.</p>

There was found in his pocket a large key; he was asked what that was the key of; he said his lodgings; he was asked where his lodgings were; he said he had forgot. I spoke very positively to his person, and he said I was mistaken; he was asked then, if I was mistaken where he was; he said that he had been that evening, a quarter before eleven, at the Ship ale-house, in Bambridge-street, St. Giles's, in company with a person whose name was Clarke, a shoe-maker, with whom he had no great acquaintance, and did not know where he was to be found.

            . I was in company with the last witness on Wednesday evening the 23d of June. On our return from Coventry, in a chaise with four horses, we were accosted, on the road near the three mile stone, by two footpads that were on the cause-way; they booted, stop hollow; on which the post boys stopped their horses; two men immediately jumped off the cause-way, and one came to one side of the chaise, and the other to the other: one was a short thick fat man, with no disguise, but only his hat flapped before; the other was a lustier man, taller, and had something of a crape round his face; it was then pretty near eleven o'clock; there was no moon, but the hemisphere was pretty light; we could distinguish particularly. The prisoner very much represents the person who went to the shafts of the horse on the side where I was; he did not utter a word; the other came up to the chaise and demanded our money or our lives, and swore several violent oaths to the prisoner, and said what was the reason he did not come on the other side and plunder me. Mr. Dadley gave him some money; he said d - n you, these are all halfpence, give me your gold and silver; he clapped a pistol to Mr. Dadley's breast; I then, to prevent his doing any mischief, immediately gave him two guineas; he then demanded our watches and rings; we told him we had none; he then came to my side and demanded my money; I gave him a guinea, a sixpence, and a penny; he demanded my watch and rings; I told him I had none; he then swore, d - n you, we will not be trifled with, give me your watches; we said we had none; then Mr. Dadley gave him a gold ring; he asked if we had any more; we said no; he asked for our pocket books; I gave him a bill case, in which there was a receipt; he then went on the other side and opened the door, and he saw a little trunk; he snatched it out in a hurry, and said, d - n me, here is the booty; we said there was nothing of consequence in it, he might look at it; he then called the other; they took the trunk behind the chaise, and then bid us drive on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see which way they went?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070034"/>Colberg. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You only speak to the resemblance, you cannot swear to him?</p>
               <p>Colberg. No; it is a very great resemblance. I went in the coach afterwards with Mr. Dadley and Sir John's men to Hornsey, and, on our return, Clark said there goes Plunket; I looked at him, and said he resembled the man that stood by the shaft horse. I forgot to mention, when we went to lay the information, I described the person to be a short thick man of a blackish complexion, and Sir John said it was Plunket; Sir John said, did he speak; I said no, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Hornsey, did you find the trunk?</p>
               <p>Colberg. Yes.</p>

            . I went with Dadley and Colberg to Hornsey; on coming back, a little on this side the turnpike, I saw Plunket, and said to Clarke there goes Plunket. One of the gentlemen looked out of the coach and said that was one of the men that robbed them. We got out of the coach and went after him, and told him there were two gentlemen in the coach wanted to speak to him; he came with us to the coach; I asked the gentlemen if they thought he was one of the men; they were both of opinion he was; they were sure he was; we put him into the coach.</p>

When I was examined before the Justice, the Justice asked what I had to say; I said I had persons to prove where I was, and Sir John made a laugh at it, and said the people had sworn against me. When I was brought up on the Wednesday following, I was asked what I had to say; I told Sir John it did not signify saying there, he had made a laugh at it, I would appeal to a higher court, and now, my Lord, I have evidence to prove where I was drinking that night.

               <p>Shaw. I met him promiscusly in Wych-street; I told him I was going to see such a-one at St. Giles's, and we would have some drink before we parted; I never saw him again till I saw him in Newgate.</p>

I searched him and found the nails mentioned in the indictment; I charged him with having some of my nails; he said yes, he had a little job to do, intimating as if it was a small quantity of nails. I proceeded to search him, and found this large quantity of nails packed up in paper, so I could swear to them; the marks are upon the papers. (They are produced by the constable, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

             and I are partners in the houses from which the lead was stole. On Sunday the 4th of June, about ten o'clock at night, the watchman came to my house and informed me there was a man on the house stealing the lead; he is a watchman we employ ourselves; I went with him to the back of the houses; there was a ladder; I placed the watchman at the bottom, and went up the ladder myself, and found the prisoner on the top of the house, and within half a yard of him there was a bag with 40 lb. of lead in it. I asked him if he had any confederates; he said he had not, but owned he cut the lead; it was taken from the sky light.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she speak of any pain she found?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine to see if there was any bruises on her back while she was alive?</p>
               <p>Hookham. Yes, they were black on the small of her back, and some bruises on her ribs on one side; I am not positive which side. She desired I would see justice done, to see her body cut open, which I did on Wednesday; I assisted in doing it; there was a boy, a fine one if it had been alive; it was dead; it appeared to be in the last month; she might have gone a fortnight or three weeks if she had gone her time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it have been dead?</p>
               <p>Hookham. The child was black round the belly and navel, and as it lay on the right side, the left shoulder was cracked as it lay uppermost.</p>
               <p>Q. By the appearance of the child how long might it have been dead?</p>
               <p>Hookham. It might have been dead ten or twelve days before, being putrified; I cannot be positive to a few days how long it might have been dead.</p>
               <p>Q. This dead child would have killed the woman then if there had not been bruises?</p>
               <p>Hookham. No, no, a great many women live after a dead child.</p>

               <p>Hookham. She said she was sure she should die; I felt her pulse and it beat very high; I thought she had a fever coming.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not disclose on Sunday the scuffle between her and Fox?</p>
               <p>Hookham. No.</p>

               <p>Q. She was going to bring the goods away?</p>

               <p>Q. Is he here?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I believe he is in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. What observations did you make upon the body?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Outwardly there was blackness upon different parts of the body about the loins and hips.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it very black?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Very black.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the skin broke at all?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Not at all that I perceived: I examined carefully all the internal parts of the abdomen, and especially those that corresponded with the external injuries, but they seemed to be quite in a found state excepting the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Then according to appearance the contusions did not penetrate farther than the external superficies?</p>
               <p>Cooper. No, they were not farther than the external supersicies muscular substance; the child was quite in a putrid state.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend the putrid state of the child was occasioned by these blows?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I apprehend the child had been dead for at least three weeks, consequently before the fray.</p>
               <p>Q. By your observations do you think these external bruises could be the occasion of the woman's death?</p>

This kitchen window looks into Warwick-court, in Holborn: a table cloth was taken from a table drawer in the kitchen; I folded it up on Sunday night and laid it in the drawer; there was a tea spoon taken out of the mustard pot. These people came to me next day, and I was subpoena'd to attend at the office in Litchfield-street. I saw my cloth there and the prisoner was produced; I never saw him before.</p>

            . I am a journeyman carpenter: going across Moorfields, about eight in the morning, I saw Levi with a sack: he rested it upon the rails; he then threw it down on the ground; upon this I and Mr. Jones went up to him, questioned him upon it, and told him we were afraid he came not honestly by it; Levi said it was his master's, and said he would go and call his master; he went away and never returned. The lead was delivered into the custody of the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both the prisoners together?</p>
               <p>Simkins. No, only Levi by himself; I never saw the prisoner again. Levi before the Justice acknowledged he took it away, and he said that the other man (Carr) was by; the confession Levi made was that the other cut it and he took it away.</p>

I went on board the ship; he rolled out a small cask; as he rolled it out, the cask rattled; I said I do not think this is rice, so he shook it, and said no, I do not think it is rice; said I, what is it? he said throw it over board, we shall have the officers come down, and we shall have the ship exchequered; I told him he need not throw it over board, if he could get it on shore, and I could have a sample, I had no objection to buy it; he asked me if I could get him a waterman; I said yes; he asked me to send it to my house; I said no, I should have it seized; I sent a waterman; I believe he brought it on shore. A little after that the waterman came to me with a sample of it; I went and enquired the value of it, and some offered me 3 s. 6 d. others 3 s. 9 d. I offered him 3 s. 6 d. he would not take less than 4 s. I believe the mate might easily have robbed the ship before that time if he chose.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070052"/>Q. Did you hear Captain Jones say any thing to Preston about this?</p>
               <p>Brown. I heard Jones say there were some sweepings on board the ship, he might make the best use of them he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing about the cask?</p>
               <p>Brown. I heard nothing about the cask.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Could this be called sweepings?</p>
               <p>Jones. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been broke after you took it in from Carolina?</p>
               <p>Jones. No; we had a hard gale of wind, and a large quantity of rice casks stove on the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. It was that that was sweepings?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mean he should open any casks?</p>
               <p>Jones. No. He has a wife and family in America therefore I do not give evidence of the value, as I hope the Court will be favourable to him.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Marshall: the prisoner was in the tap room between five and six o'clock; he had a pint of beer in a silver pint mug; I saw it when I received the reckoning of him; I missed it as soon as he was gone; there were no more than two other gentlemen in the room, but they sat at a considerable distance. Last Friday the prisoner was brought to my master's house; I heard him say he had sold it for meer want.</p>
               <p>Marshall again. I was informed on my return home that the prisoner had stole my mug; I told the story to a person who said he knew him, and he brought him on Friday; being taxed with stealing it, he said he had sold it in Oxford-road for 3 l. we went together there, and there the mug was found.</p>

               <p>I am a very unfortunate man: I had a genteel fortune when I came of age, but by my bad economy have squandered it away: my brother lives at the corner of Hatton Garden, a man of character and fortune, and I have two sisters in town married and settled, all of exceeding good characters. Till this unfortunate affair happened my character was unimpeached. I was brought up to a genteel business.</p>

            . I was going to find out a public house in the Strand; it was between ten and eleven at night of the 15th of June; I was much intoxicated with liquor; I met with the prisoner; she took me to a house; I lay there all night. I found myself alone in the morning, and missed my money out of my breeches pocket; I found my breeches under my head where I had put them over night.</p>

               <p>Blair. I had received eight guineas for another man; the other three guineas were my own, I had saved them to pay my rent; when I found myself robbed, I came down and interrogated the landlady; she used me very rough, and told me I might go about my business, and the man a-bed with her bid me go along, or said he would bundle me out of the house; the woman said she had seen but 1 s. 6 d. in my pocket.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness: the two prisoners came on the 15th of June and desired to see a first floor we had to lett; they both went up stairs with me to see it; when we came down, we went into the fore parlour; I told them there that they might have a back parlour for the use of a servant. Ring asked if he could see the kitchen; I went down with him, and left Dunbar at the back door; when we came up they went away, and soon after I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, from a beaufet in the fore parlour; I have never seen any of them since. The prisoners said they would come again next day.</p>

Dunbar and Jennings came to our house on the 24th of May, about six in the afternoon, and desired to see a first floor I had to let; they agreed with me for it for three months, for a gentleman. Jennings came again the next morning with Ring, and desired Ring might see his master's apartments; he said he was a servant out of livery; I went up stairs with Ring, and left Jennings in the passage; I shewed him his master's bed; he desired he might see his own bed; he said he approved of every thing, and desired I would be in the way at four o'clock, as his master would come then; when I came down Jennings had the knocker of the door in his hand, and they went away.

               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Did the prisoner go with you to the pawnbroker's after she was taken up?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes; Maylin took her up and brought her to my house, and she confessed where she had pawned the gown; I went with her, and she took it out; it was given into Maylin's custody. (The gown deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

             and Daniel; the two prisoners lived with him at that time; the first day I came there I was employed in scouring copper plates; I came there about a quarter of a year ago; the next business I did was to pull at the fly.</p>
               <p>Q. A fly of what?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I never heard any name to it; it was cutting copper pieces; we called them buttons; they were to be half-pence; the fly was made use of in striking them; I have seen them out in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What part did the other men do?</p>
               <p>Phillips. We were not particular in our branches when we came to be used to it; one knew as well others; we were employed about seven weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you make in a day?</p>
               <p>Phillips. We counted for a couple of plates to be a piece, which cut 24 s. worth, that was a guinea's worth; we made eleven pieces to the amount of eleven guineas worth a day.</p>
               <p>Q. For how long time was it you thus continued employed?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Two months; sometimes we composed our day's work by four or five o'clock; it was eleven pieces. Palmer used to take out some himself; I believe I carried some out to a place I discovered to Mr. Gates; I do not know the name of it. The tools were removed from London to a house at <placeName id="t17730707-79-crimeloc390">Kensington Gravel Pits</placeName>

               <p>Q. Whose house was that to which they were removed?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I know the house but do not know whose house it is: I had half a guinea a week, meat, drink and lodging; all the striking part was done at Kensington.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compleat them entirely the time you struck them?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Davis to?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel. They are good looking halfpence; they are very little inferior to good money; there is one where the die has missed.</p>

               <p>Q. You were all of you but a sort of journeymen?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes, to one Palmer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Palmer used to tell you that he was a button-maker? what trade did Palmer profess himself to be?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. They were made under the notion as buttons?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he pay you your half guinea in?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Always in gold?</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen these men work at that fly?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Davis employed in any thing more than carrying out parcels?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes, the same as we all; we were employed equally.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Davy. You know a halfpenny from a button when you see it?</p>

            ; I saw Phillips, and Tonner the prisoner; they were removing a grindstone in the cellar; I observed on the floor of the cellar a plank of wood fixed in the ground where something had been fixed of a machine for stamping; I then went up into the garret; I asked them what they were doing; they said they were only porters hired by a gentleman in Fleet-street that day; they said they did not know him; I asked where they lay; they said in a hay field; I searched them, and found near 3 l. a piece upon each of them, gold and other money; I asked them where they were going to remove to; they said a cart and horses was waiting in Black Friars to receive them; that they had been with other thing with a knot to Black Friars, and there found the cart and horse; I went there with them, and waited for the cart and horse; nobody came to it; then I sent it to the Green yard, and took the two men to the Compter. I went up stairs before, and found two forms that were in the garret with a quantity of nine sand for casting metals. I said they should go to different prisons, and then Phillips confessed there was an information made, and in consequence of it I went to Kensington; Palmer was removed there; it was on the 16th at night, near ten o'clock; we went to Kensington and took Phillips with us; we rang a great while at the door and nobody came; I then put my hand through the gate, lifted up the latch and got into the yard; they assisted me and we broke the door open; I went and searched all over the house and there was nobody in it; we found a wheel (producing it) for the purpose of polishing brass: after they are punched out by one instrument the roughness is taken of and they are brightened by that wheel. I found a quantity of blanks for half-pence not stamped (producing some of them); I found the wheel in the fore cellar; it was lined with leather; they put emery and oil in it, and turn it round, and their own weight on the leather brightens them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of the back door open?</p>
               <p>Gates. I believe they went out at the back door as we went in at the fore door. This scoter ( producing it) I found in the out house; it marks the width of the halfpence, and then they cut it with shears. We found this (producing a large engine with a fly to it) that cuts the halfpence out of the slips of copper; we found it in the stable. We found a back door into another stable, that we broke open; there we found a stamping machine; we also found a quantity of blank dyes, 50 I suppose; there is no impression on them. We stayed in the house four or five hours at least before we got the things into a cart to get them away to the Mansion House. When I came away I left Burton, Wilson and Evans in the house. There is always three persons employed to work the machine with the fly; one stands at each end of the fly, and one puts the copper under; it cannot be worked without three persons.</p>
               <p>Q. You found all these things by the direction of Phillips?</p>
               <p>Gates. Yes; Phillips gave an account of them before we went; every thing tallied very minutely with the account he gave. There is a quantity of new halfpence I found under the stamping instrument.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. All these things you are talking of were found in the house of Mr. Palmer?</p>

            . I keep the Two Butchers, a public house in Hog-lane. On the 14th of May the prisoner and another man came to my house; they asked for a private room; they were shewn into a back parlour; they had some beef steaks for supper; the other man asked for a bed for his friend, meaning the prisoner; he went to bed. They both dined at my house next day; after dinner the prisoner asked me if I had cash in the house, if I could give him twenty guineas upon a 50 l. bank note; I told him I believed I could not, but that I would go and ask my brother; my brother said he had not so much: the other man came to me, and asked me if I had spoke to my brother; he said it was a good note, and I need not be afraid of it; he said before that, that if I had not cash a 10 l. bank note would do; I got thirteen guineas; when I went in I was rather doubtful; I told them I would send it to my baker's and get it changed; the prisoner said he did not chuse to have it changed, because it would do to send into the country in a letter to pay his creditors; I said I hope you do not intend to trick me, I have a large family; the prisoner said it is a good bank note, before I would injure you I would cut my right hand off; I gave him thirteen guineas; he held the note up, and said, see, it is a good Bank note, and gave it me; I said I did not understand it, but I hoped they were no ways going to defraud me; they said they should be back at nine o'clock; they ordered a supper and said they would give me the money when they came to supper. I went into the kitchen; a gentleman there said the note was not a good one; I went and shewed it to my butcher; he said don't be afraid I will give you cash for it; his wife said you are no judge, I will take it to the grocer's; she took it to the grocer's, and he said it was not good. (The note is shewn to her.) This is the note; I can swear to it by the marks at each corner; I took particular notice of it before I gave it out of my own hands; they never came to the house again. The prisoner was taken up the Thursday following. (The note was read, and corresponded literall, with the note set forth in the indictment.)</p>

The prisoner afterwards appointed her to meet him at the Swan in Walbrook; I went there and the prisoner came to me; I staid till ten o'clock, and was a good deal uneasy that Mrs. Lake did not come; the prisoner went out as if he was going to the Compter and then I went away.</p>
