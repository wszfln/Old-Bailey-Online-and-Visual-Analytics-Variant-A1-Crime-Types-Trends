I am a butcher at 12, Great Carter-lane—on the morning of 28th June I was walking with my wife and a friend down Fleet-street—I saw some women fighting outside a public-house—I attempted to separate them, and instantly felt a man's arms round my waist, and felt that he had hold of my watch in my waistcoat pocket—I caught hold of the man's arms and never let him go till I got him to the station—it was the prisoner, he—pleaded guilty twice at the police-station—he passed my watch to a woman, one of those who were fighting, but I could not hold them all, there was no one else near me at the time, except the pri<lb/>soner and the women—there was a large ring cleared for the fight, which seemed to be a regular got up affair.</p>

I bad a fall four or five years ago, and the least excitement I am not conscious of what I am doing; I am obliged to take liquor before I can go on with my work; I am very nervous; my mother was in an asylum, and my father made away with himself; my wife knows it; I have often told her never to take any notice of what I say; my son has very often found me crying, and he has asked me what I have been crying for, and all I could do I could not make it out. Since my wife hit me over the head I lost so much blood, I have been worse; while I was leaning over the basin my wife came behind me and said, 'You b----thing, I will do it for you before many hours are over; you b----, I have got you now, and I will pay you; you will faint soon, and you will want some brandy and water. 'I can't account for the action on this night, or what I did; I had been drinking in the day, and cannot recollect what I did on that day, and hardly on the next day."</p>

I am surgeon at the Ear Infirmary, 10, Death-street, Soho—the prisoner is secretary to that infirmary, and had been so I think about thirty years—I have known him personally for eighteen years—his duties were to receive letters and donations, and conduct the corre<lb/>spondence, also to make out the accounts and submit them to the managers—he had always discharged his duty in a proper manner up to within the last mouth or six weeks—I have noticed a very considerable change in him since that; generally speaking a want of power in his recognising individuals and a want of attention to his duties; in fact, a general break-up of mind and body—I have had considerable experience as a surgeon, independently of diseases of the ear—I have noticed eccentricities about the prisoner; incoherence of language occasionally, and particularly a want of cleanliness in his person and dress—that was quite contrary to his previous habits—I have noticed fits of passion once or twice, but they have generally been curbed in my presence—that was very unusual with him—I have noticed forgetfuluess of names and great bodily debility, weakness, and falling away in his person, a lassitude with regard to his duties, and a peculiar infirmity in his walk—previous to that ho was in the habit of rendering his accounts in a proper and intelligible way, but since then his calculations have been</p>

               <p>frequently wrong, the figures were right when properly calculated for him—I have had in consideration whether he should be removed from the situation—from what I observed I think he was most likely suffering from brain disease—the obscurity is very great in such cases, but they were very much the marks of softening of the brain—I know that he had a weakness in his lungs, and generally speaking the pectoral apparatus was weak, but I did not examine him—that would still less enable him to struggle with mental disease—I believe about twelve years ago he purchased a commis<lb/>sion in the corps of gentlemen-at-arms—I know he belonged to the corps.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general practitioner at Norwood—T have known the prisoner for about nine months, and have attended his family—his wife keeps a large ladies' school at Ellesmere-house, South Penge—on 17th June, about 11 o'clock at night, I was called by Mrs. Smythe to her residence—I found the prisoner running about the house in a very excited state, refusing to see me, and reproaching Mrs. Smythe for sending for me—he was en-deavouring to make his way out of the house by the doors, which were all securely bolted—he was shaking them violently, and finding they resisted him he went to several of the windows and tried the same plan—he was so violent that I thought it would be unwise forcibly to restrain him—he said that his children did not care for him, and he seemed annoyed and irritated—I remained with him for an hour, and soothed him, and eventually got him to bed—as he went up stairs he broke into a violent fit of crying—I do not think this was the result of drink—I wrote to his brother.</p>

I am a teacher in the school kept by the prisoner's wife, at Ellesmere-house, Penge—I have resided there just a year—during that time I have noticed peculiarities in the prisoner's condition—about the 17th June, I remember his having a paroxysm, as I supposed, but it seemed more like weakness of mind—I went one day into the dining-room and found all the chairs piled on the table—I heard him there, and saw him leave the room—that is about a fortnight ago—on the evening of 17th June, I heard a great tumult up stairs—I saw very little of what hap<lb/>pened, Mrs. Smythe went me for Dr. Duke—I heard some one rushing about up stairs—the prisoner rushed into the school-room, and said he wished to throw himself out of the window, but he could not get it open—he was in the habit of bringing home parcels of sweetmeat and putting them away in a cupboard, which no one used but himself, and I have found them there in a state of rottenness, soiling the rest of the parcels in the cupboard—there were a great many newspapers and other papers there—I have noticed a strangeness about him since February—he often slammed the doors very violently, in a strange way, and I have seen him muttering to himself in a very strange way—I could not understand what he said—he was different to what he was before—I have noticed a great loss of memory in respect to dates and names—there was a concert at the house in June, and I saw him come into the room, stare wildly nil round upon the company, and then leave the room—he was dressed in an old coat that he usually wore at home, with the pockets stuffed full of papers, which could be seen through the holes of the pockets, and the sleeves of the coat were torn so that you could see his shirt-sleeves—I saw him go up stairs to bed—he rushed up as if he had been provoked very much and was angry—there had been nothing to provoke him that I know of.</p>

On the night of the 5th or morning of the 6th of June, a few minutes after twelve o'clock, I was on duty at the station in Arbour-square—Mr. Debenham came there—he came very hastily—he was running—he said to me, "Policeman, can you send one of your men to my house"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "I was in bed, I heard a noise as if a brick fell at the rear of my house, I got out of bed, opened the window, looked out, and saw a figure crouching down in a corner close to my kitchen window, I called out several times, 'Who are you, what do you want 1' but received no answer, I then went and called my assistant and we both looked out at the window together, I said, 'Do you see a dark figure standing there?' he said, 'Yes, 'I then called out once or twice, 'Who are you, what do you want? if you don't speak I will about you,'—I then fired and I think he fell"—I said to Mr. Debenham, "You had better go inside and speak to the acting-inspector"—he did so in my presence I then went with the prisoner and 697 <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> to his house—I said, "Where did you fire the pistol?"—he said, "I will show you"—I then passed through the house till I came to a back door that leads on to the lawn, that was barred and bolted—I unfastened it and there I saw the deceased lying on some flag stones, about three feet from the kitchen window—I said, "Here is the man, but I do not think he is dead"—his feet were just about the same distance from the window as his head—I felt him, he was quite warm—the prisoner then examined him and said, "He is quite dead"—I said to the other constable, "You remain here with the body till I come back"—I asked the prisoner where the pistol was, he said it was on the counter and he gave it to me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is a six-barreled revolver—I then took the prisoner to the station and handed him over to Inspector Hayes and gave him the pistol—the window from where the shot was fired was about forty-two feet from the place where I saw the man, it was in a slanting direc<lb/>tion—it is a bow-window, the man was on the flag stones—there is a lawn surrounding the house, that is divided by a little bit of wall and then it</p>

               <p>palings are very sharp and the tops were indented as if some one had stood upon them—those palings are a little over four feet high, about four feet two or three inches, and the paint looked as if the feet of some one had been scraping against it—I was shown the window from which the shot was fired; it is forty-two feet from where the deceased was standing—I noticed a chip from off one of the bricks of the wall—I first noticed that after the first examination at the police-court; it was on one of the bricks of the wall, which projects about three inches; it was about eight or ten feet from the ground—the wall falls back there about three inches leaving a sort of plinth or foundation, that was where the chip was—it is the wall of the house—it was very little distance from where the man was lying—the chip appeared to be recent—I found no indication of any attempt to break into the house—I am pretty well acquainted with the house—the front gates are left unlocked at night, but closed, only fastened with a latch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> With regard to this chip on the wall; was it between the window from which the shot was fired and where the man was found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; in that direction—the wall projects—behind where the deceased was standing there is a narrow alley and a corner leading round to the surgery—there is space enough there for more than four or five persons to stand, without being visible—it was rather darker at that time than it had been previously; it was rather cloudy; the place would be very much shaded—an entry might be made into the drug-room as well as through the kitchen window.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Debenham—he is a sur<lb/>geon in practice—on the night of the 5th June I went to bed about twenty or twenty-five minutes to twelve—I don't know what time Mr. Debenham went to bed, he went before I did—after I bad been in bed some little time I was aroused by Mr. Debenham coming to my room—I went back with him to his own room—his window was open at that time—he told me that he had heard somebody in the garden and that he bad spoken to this person or persons ever so many times—he then pointed out to me where he thought the persons were and I certainly thought I could see an object against the wall—I could not make out what it was, whether it was a human being or not—Mr. Debenham called out very loudly indeed, "Come, who are you? if you don't speak I will shoot you"—he then cooked the pistol—there was a slight pause, and he fired—I looked out again and I could just see a white shirt on the ground, but it was so dark I could hardly see—I dare say what passed after I got to the window only occupied about a minute—Mr. Debenham then put on his trousers and went off for the police—at the time he was putting on his trousers he said, "I fired high; if I had thought I should have hit him I should not have fired"—I think he said, "If I had thought I should have <hi rend="italic">killed</hi> him, "but I have no doubt he meant hit him—I think <hi rend="italic">killed</hi> was what he said—I was down in the surgery walking to and fro till the police returned with Mr. Debenham; I did not go out, I did not think he would have been so long, the distance to the station is only four or five minutes—I think I was the last person to go to bed that night—the establishment consisted of Mr. Debenham, myself, and three female servants—the house stands back about fifteen yards from the footpath of the main road; there are windows fronting the road—there was nothing to prevent our going to the front windows and calling out to persons in the main road</p>

I live at 105, Hackney-road—the prisoner is my husband—we were married about a fortnight before Christmas—on Monday night, the 9th of May, we went to bed about eleven o'clock as usual—we were both sober—we had been quarrelling during the day—I went to sleep—I awoke with a feeling of something at my throat—I cannot tell how long I had been in bed—I instantly jumped up, and made my way to the window—there was blood about my throat—I cannot say how much—I saw ray husband, he had an ice spoon in his hand—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was holding it in his hand—he said nothing to me—I went out of my bed room into the next room, and out of that room into the cistern, and from the cistern into the yard—there was water in the cistern—it is about ten feet from the ground—I jumped from there into the yard—I tried to get over the palings, and I got over—I then turned round and saw my husband in the little room, at the window I got out of—I got over the wall at the bottom of the garden, and went into the next house up stairs—I remember nothing more—I was not cut any where else besides the throat—I know this razor, it is my husband's—it was kept in all places, sometimes down stairs, and sometimes up stairs—sometimes he would shave in the kitchen, sometimes in the bed room, and sometimes in the parlour—this knife was kept in the shop, and sometimes in the parlour—it is a confectioner's shop—my little finger was cut, I cannot account for how that was done—my husband and I attended to the shop—we had no servant—no one else lived in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long after you went to bed did you feel this at your throat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As near as possible it was twenty minutes or half-past 6 in the morning—my husband had treated me with the greatest kindness since we have been married—he has been subject to sudden fits of gloom and despondency since he lost his money—he has very often told the customers that they had come in to rob him—the day before this occurred he went into the garden and tore up the ground with his mouth, or endeavoured to do so—on the day this happened there had been a quarrel between us, and I had run into the shop and made a noise before the customers—he did not threaten me in any way while we were in bed; he only said he did not think I should have disgraced him—I had struck him whilst in the shop—he did not say a word to me while he was standing at the bed-side, or while I was getting out of the window.</p>

I am a surgeon at 85, Church-street—I was called to Mr. Wood's house on this morning—I got there about twenty minutes to 7—I saw the prisoner first at his house—he was in the back room on the left hand side—his throat was out—it was a clear incised wound right across the throat about five inches in length and two inches in depth, cutting through the gullet and the wind pipe—I afterwards went in next door and saw Mrs. Moretti—I found her throat was out—it was a triangular cut, about three inches by two—the wind pipe was severed—I attended to them both, and they were afterwards removed to the hospital—the wound on the wife's throat was a dangerous one—it might have been dangerous to life, if it had been left alone—the prisoner's wound was, I think, more dangerous than hers—there was a very slight swelling on the back of Mrs. Moretti's head—it might have been caused by a fall or anything—this razor might have been used for the man's throat—I cannot say whether it was used for the woman; it was a different kind of cut—the razor might do it—I don't think the knife could have done it; I don't think it would be capable of doing it—I don't think it was done with that knife.</p>

I certainly did as there was nobody else there—she said, "If you think I am the thief you had better search me"—she then went out of the shop came in a few minutes afterwards and abused me and said, "Now.

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor—at the time in question, I lived at Nunhead-lodge, Peckham Rye—I am now living at Gravesend—on 28th April last, about half-past 8 in the evening, I left home, and called at the Belvedere tavern about half-past 9—I was in conversation with the landlord for some considerable time, I should say nearly an hour—I had two three-pennyworths of brandy-and-water—I then heard skittles playing, and said, "Have you a skittle ground?"—he said, "Yes, a very nice one, would you like to see it?"—I said, "Yes"—I went in and saw several persons play<lb/>ing, amongst them the two prisoners—I sat some time watching them—I afterwards played a game with Harwood—the prisoners both betted on the game, I don't know what amount—they betted on my play—I lost the game—they abused me for losing their money, and Ray said, "What are you going to stand, now you have lost my money?"—I said, "You can have anything you like"—he called for two pots of cider, which I objected to—I said, "You can have a pot of stout if you like," and I called for it, and paid for it—I just drank about a quarter of a glass with them—Ray then said, "Come, I will toss you for a bottle of wine, to see what you are made of"—I said I was not in the habit of tossing for wine, but I did not mind—we tossed, and I lost, as they stated, but I don't consider it was a fair toss; I therefore objected to pay, and the landlord demanded 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the wine, which I considered an extravagant charge—upon that they very much abused me, and called me everything they could lay their tongue to, and the landlord seemed to acquiesce in everything they said—I said it was not because I had not the money to pay, and I took out six sovereigns to show him—eventually the landlord turned us all out, saying he would have no disturbance there—I am quite satisfied that I had the six sovereigns about me when I left the house—when I left the house I went towards my own residence—I had to go down Linden-grove—that is a very retired road, shaded by trees; you can see no lamps—I had got nearly half the distance down the grove when I was knocked down on my face by a violent blow from behind, on the back of my head, and was fallen upon immediately by more than one person—I received several other blows, and several very severe kicks—I was turned on to my back and knelt upon—they then com<lb/>menced</p>

I am the wife of James Moyes, of 2, Nunhead-cottageg, Nunhead—Ray has lodged at my house near upon two yeans—his character has been sober and honest in every respect—I recollect the night of 28th April—Ray came home about a minute after 12 o'clock that night—I was examined before the Magistrate at the last examination—my memory is quite clear as to it's being the 28th—I was at needlework at the time; it was the day before he was taken into custody.</p>
