               <p>Q: Did you see him take away the Tankard?</p>
               <p>Broomhead. No; but I advertised it; and about a Week afterwards, a Person came and informed me, that he had pawn'd it in his own Name for four Guineas; and we went and found it accordingly at this Woman, Mrs. Snelling's House. The Tankard had been pawn'd there, but it was taken from thence to another Place where I found it.</p>

            . On the 7th of October, the Prisoner came to our House with another Man to recommend him, and desired to have 4 Guineas on a Tankard. I accordingly lent him the Money, and if he had asked for more, I should have lent it him. The next Day, the other Man's Wife came, and desired to have the Tankard. I scrupled it, and said, it was not usual to deliver Goods, but to the Persons that brought them, upon which she went away. She soon afterwards returned with another Person, who was to lay down the Money for it; but I still insisted on seeing the Person that brought it; upon which, she went and fetched me a Note, sign'd

I went with them to the Prosecutor's House, and found the Prisoner there in Custody of an Officer with several other Persons; and I heard him confess, that he stole the Tankard, and (he said) he would tell no Lies.</p>

               <p>Snelling. I asked him when he came into the Room, and he directly own'd it, and said, he would tell no lies; he likewise confess'd, that he pledg'd it at our House the same Evening that he stole it.</p>

Mr. Martin came to me, and informed me, he had got a Piece of Plate at 2 Pawnbroker's, who, he believed was not in good Circumstances, therefore desired me to prevail on my Landlord to lay down the Money for him, that he might redeem it. I think he said, it was in for 4 Pounds or 4 Guineas, I can't tell which. My Landlord agreed to take it out, and they went away together, and in a short Time Swanson returned with the Tankard.</p>

It stood within the Window, and the Shop Door was bolted.</p>

            . Mrs. Stock came to my House about six Weeks ago, and asked me for the Constable. I told her I was his Wife, and called him to her. He asked her what she came about? and she told him she was recommended to him by Justice Trent. She said she was undressing her Child in the back Room, and heard the Sash throw up. She then threw the Child out of her Arms, and ran into the Shop, and saw no Body at all; that she immediately went to her next Door Neighbour and told him the Story; and they went away together to Justice Trent, who recommended her to my Husband.</p>

             - n your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174202240007"/> Eyes, Jack, why don't you come along? I did not go directly to him, but put Mr. Paines's Back against the Wall again, upon which the Prisoner came over to me, and catch'd me by the Arm, and lugg'd me away for fear we should be taken, for he had got the Watch, he said. We then went down to the Bottom of Bow-street, and came up again to see whether he was gone or no. He said he supposed he had got more Money about him, and when we came to the End of the Court, there were two or three Gentlemen with him. After this, we went into Phoenix-Alley, and by the Light of the Lamp, the Prisoner opened the Watch, and said, it was a very good one, but it was very large, and would fetch about a Ridge. I asked him what he mean'd by a Ridge? and he told me, it was a Guinea, and that he would not sell the Watch that Night, but I should go Home and lie with him The next Morning he and Flack's Girl went and pawn'd the Watch in Fox's-Court, Gray's-Inn-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with them then?</p>
               <p>Gilson. Yes; but I did not go into the House. He told me he had pawn'd it for 25 s. but it seems he had thirty-five upon it, and he gave me Half a Guinea out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not he give you half?</p>
               <p>Gilson. He did not give it me as my Share, but bid me go, and get a clean Shirt and a Waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Pris. Ask him if there were not two Women coming by when the Man lay drunk?</p>
               <p>Gilson. Not that I perceived.</p>
               <p>Pris Did he see me take the Watch out of his Drawer?</p>
               <p>Gilson No, but I heard the Chain gingle, and I afterwards saw the Key in his Hand.</p>
               <p>Pris. I took the Watch off the Ground, 4 Yards from the Man. Drift or assist him to set the Man up against the Wall?</p>
               <p>Gilson. No, when I set him up, the Prisoner pushed him down again.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Thornton. I have seen him about twice; - his Father was a Watch and Clock-maker, and I remember something of him. I was called to a French woman's in Shorts-Gardens, between six and seven in the Evening, and when I came from thence, I took my Servant and a Man with me, to see me safe Home, and just by Bow-street, there is a kind of a Bagnio, and I heard some Body say, There is a Man lies dead. It was Moon-light, and I saw that young Man at the Bar snatch up something from the Ground which shone very much. I have seen the Prisoner twice before, to the best of my Knowledge, and that is as much as I have, and he had the very same Cloaths on as he has now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Man that lay for dead?</p>
               <p>Thornton. I saw something lie along; I don't know that I saw the Evidence, Gilson there: What I took most Notice of, was, the Colour of the Buttons on the Prisoner's Coat.</p>
               <p>Jury. We desire she may be asked how she knew that the Prisoner was taken up?</p>
               <p>Thornton. I live in Half-Moon-street, and heard that such a Neighbour's Son was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Man set up against the Wall?</p>
               <p>Thornton. No, I was afraid to stay when I heard that the Man was dead, and I saw the Prisoner snatch up something, and it might be a Watch or a Snuff-box, for I did not stay to see.</p>

               <p>Hickson. No, I did not see him, for I was behind my Mistres, and had hold of her Arm.</p>

             On Saturday the 9th of Jan. I was alone in our back Shop, when two Men open'd the Door and came in. I met them just at the back Shop Door, and immediately the first Man asked me if one Mr. Franklin liv'd there? The second Man made a sort of a Bustle with his Feet, and said, D - you, you are the Man. The third Man then put a Pistol to my breast, and said I was a dead Man, and indeed I was in such a Fright that I thought I was dead. I look'd over one of their Shoulders, and saw the third Fellow making behind the Counter, for which Reason I cry'd out, and the two Men who stood over me then st me, and likewise the third Fellow who had the Money, and in the Confusion one of the Pistols went off, as I thought by accident, upon which they ran out of the Shop. I then perceived that 3 Bags had been removed to a different End of the Counter from the Place where t hey first were, and there were upwards of a 1000 l. them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner one of those Persons?</p>

My Time being expired, my Mistress was paving me my Money, when I was alarmed by the Report of a Pistol I looked and saw 2 Fellows in the Banker's Shop, and immediately a Man in Grey Cloaths (something taller than the Prisoner) opened the Door. The Prisoner was then behind him in the Shop, and as soon as the Door was open'd, they both ran athwart our Shop towards Chancery-Lane. Mr. Simpson's Footman presently came to the Door, seemingly in some Confusion, and cry'd, Stop Thief! I joined in the Pursuit, and in Bell-Yard the Prisoner was taken, but the other Man made his Escape.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was taken what did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Hall. He desired us to let him go, for he was afraid of being Arrested</p>

             On the 19th of January about 3 in the Afternoon, I had some Business at Mr. Brome's Shop, facing Mr. Simpson's, and heard the Report of a Pistol. Immediately two Men came out, and after them a third, and were pursued by Mr. Simpson's Footman with a Cry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174202240009"/> of Stop Thief! They ran up Chancery-Lane, and I went through the King's-Head Tavern in order to meet them, and just at Crown-Court I heard some People say, Let him go, it is only an Arrest! Notwithstanding that, I follow'd them, and a Gentleman who was then coming down the Court stopp'd the Prisoner. I likewise took hold of his Collar, and he desir'd me to let him go, for they were Bailiffs (he said) that were after him.</p>

            . I was going down Crown-Court on an Errand, and met the Prisoner running as swift as he could with something in his Hand, but what it was I could not discern. He threw it under a Gutter which the Water runs through, and the Mob saying he had shot a Man, I put my Hand under the Gutter, and found this Pistol: - it was discharg'd, and the Cock was broken off with the Fall. When the Prisoner was taken, and carried before Mr. Alderman Hoare, I was desir'd to put my Hand up the Gutter again to search for the Cock of the Pistol: I did so, and found it accordingly.</p>

            . On Sunday Morning, the Day after this Robbery was committed, I went to Newgate to see the Prisoner. I asked him how he could be guilty of such a notorious Thing? He at first denied it, but upon my telling him that he would certainly be hanged. He cry'd and fell on his Knees; I then told him, I would make him no Promises of Favour, and he then said, that he work'd at Hackney; that his Brother fetched him from thence to get into better Bread; and that they had walked about this Place for three Days to take an Opportunity to commit this Fact. He added, that it was his Pistol that went off, and that the Discharge of it was occasioned by his accidentally hirting it against the Side of the Counter; and that Lucas (one of the Persons not taken) went into the Shop, and held the Pistol to the young Man, and then his Brother Lloyd went behind the Counter to take the Bags, and that he was to stand Centry with a Pistol at the Stairs Foot to prevent any Person's coming up or down.</p>

             fetched me away, and said they had got a Place for me, upon which I came to Town, and then I was disappointed. In a few Days I got another Place at Black-Fryars, where I staid about 7 or 8 Days, and then they took me from thence, and that Day we committed this Fact, they made me suddled; they went in to ask for a fictitious Name, and Lucas clapp'd a Pistol to that Gentleman's Face. It is the first Fact I ever did, and I hope you will have Mercy and consider me.</p>

            . It was on the 21st of January last, I was standing at Gray's-Inn-Gate, in Holborn, when the Prisoner came to me, and asked me, if I would go on an Errand for him. I told him, I would if he pleas'd: he had then an half Sheet of Paper in his Hand, and we went into the Elephant and Castle together. I saw him write this (here) Paper, and he directed me to go with it to Mr. Alexander's, a Brasier and I, against St. Alban's Church in Wood-street. Accordingly I went there, and as soon as I came into the Shop, I delivered the Paper to Mr. Coking, Mr. Alexander's Servant. Coking looked over the Paper, and seemed to suspect it: he carried to Mr. Combes, who asked me, if I came from Mr. Gough; I told him, I did not know who Mr. Gough was, but the Person who gave me that Paper, was then waiting at the Elephant and Castle. Upon this, they scrupled giving me the Goods, and after I had waited half an Hour and upwards Mr. Combes sent two of his Servants before, and one of them went with me to the Elephant and Castle. When we came there, the Prisoner was gone from thence; but had left Word, that he would be back in an Hour. When he returned, this Paper was produced to him, and he own'd it was his Hand-writing, and wondered why Mr. Alexander did not send the Goods, for he had a Coffin to finish in haste in Bloomsbury-Square.</p>

               <p>Gough. No, I believe it to be the Prisoner's, for I have compared it with several Receipts which I received from him when he was an Apprentice, and the Writing agrees exactly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Combes. The Prisoner confessed over and over that this Paper was his Hand-writing. Hutton brought it to our House, and desired to have Goods upon it. He first gave it to my Servant, who delivered it to me, and we went to the Elephant and Castle, and found the Prisoner. He at first said, he would send for his Master Gough, but afterwards begged for Mercy, and owned it was his Hand-writing.</p>

            . I am a Welshman, and belong to the second Regiment of Guards, and I believe it was three Weeks ago when I first saw the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Counc. What Employment do you follow when you are not upon Duty?</p>
               <p>Meredith. I used to work on the Keys between Billingsgate and the Tower.</p>
               <p>Counc. Where did you see him first?</p>
               <p>Meredith. Upon the Keys. His Countryman told me he carried Men abroad, upon which I went to him, and talk'd to him sometime. He told me he was then a Soldier in the Service of France, and if I would go with him, I should have 5 Pence Half-penny a Day, and 4 Loaves a Week, every one as big as a three-penny Loaf.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was that all you were to do, barely to go along with him?</p>
               <p>Meredith My Brother came to me in his Soldier's Cloaths, upon which the Prisoner seemed to be very much frighted to see him, but I bid him not be afraid, for he was my Brother. Then says he, we will go and drink a Mug of Beer: I told him, I had no Money; never mind that (said he) I have Money enough. We then went over the Bridge, to a public House on the other Side of the Water, by the Borough-Market, and had some Beer, He told us there, if we would go along with him, we must go that very Night, and by the next Night we should get to Dover, and with a fair Wind, we should be over in 3 or 4 Hours; after which, we had got about four and forty Miles to travel by Land.</p>
               <p>Counc. To what Purpose where you to go those four and forty Miles?</p>
               <p>Meredith. I was to go with him to meet his Regiment.</p>
               <p>Counc. After this Conversation passed, what was done then?</p>
               <p>Meredith. He told us, if we would go with him to his Quarters, he would give us a Dram; accordingly I went with him to his Quarters in Kent street, very near the Red-Cow, and there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174202240011"/> we had 3 Quarterns of Gin, and some Bread and Cheese, and he told me, he had been to sell a Pound of Tea for 7 s. which cost him but 3 s. in France.</p>
               <p>Jury. We desire he may be asked, whether he then had his Regimentals on?</p>
               <p>Meredith. Only my Regimental Waistcoat: my Brother was in his Regimentals. He called us up Stairs, and talk'd to us a good while, and his Landlady came, and talk'd to us too, and told us, when we came to France, we should live like Gentlemen. After we had been there some Time, the Prisoner came along with us, in order to sell my Brother's Cloaths, but before he went away, his Landlady gave him some Money to buy a Breast of Mutton for us, and he desired her, as there were a great many Lodgers in the House, to send them to Bed before we came back. We went from thence into the Strand, and turned down to the Barracks before we went to the Public House, because my Brother wanted to ask the Serjeant what we must do with the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Counc. Where did you go to after that?</p>
               <p>Meredith. We went to the Coal Hole, a public House just by the Savoy.</p>
               <p>Counc. Who was there when you came to that House?</p>
               <p>Meredith. There were 4 Welshmen of us in all,

               <p>Counc. Was there any Body else present then?</p>

               <p>Counc. You say, that when you went out together, you told him you had no Money, and that he then gave you 6 d. did he give it you to pay the Reckoning, or to go with him?</p>
               <p>Meredith. I took it, and considered it as Money given to me to 'list to go with him, and he at that Time promised me 3 or 4 Guineas Advance when I came over.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did he promise any Thing else?</p>
               <p>Meredith. Yes, five Peace Halfpenny a Day, and 4 Loaves a Week, every one as big as a three penny Loaf. When I came in again, the other Welshman and I told him we would all go with him, and he then shewed us his Furloe. One of the Men pretended to read it, but could not, upon which the Prisoner attempted to snatch it out of his Hand, and tore out a Piece of it, and then we took him Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Counc. See if that Paper is the same?</p>
               <p>Meredith. Yes, this is the same, I wrote my Name on the Back of it when we were before the Justice.</p>

               <p>Meredith. He said, here is 6 d. on the Account of going along with me, and (says he) after you go over, you must make every Thing good to me, and perhaps as soon as you are there, you shall have 3 or 4 Guineas Advance Money.</p>
               <p>Counc. What was you to be when you went over?</p>

I was then in my Regimentals, and I asked him how I could go with him in those Cloaths, for I should certainly be taken up. Then, says he, you must have coloured Cloaths, and we must sell them that you have on; and after this, we went down to the Savoy Barracks.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you hear the Prisoner say any Thing to your Brother?</p>
               <p>Meredith. Yes, he ask'd him to enlist in the King of France's Service as a Soldier.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you go to the Borough with them?</p>
               <p>Meredith. Yes, but I was going to the Savoy Barracks, and then the Prisoner said, we must have a Pot of Beer together. I told him I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174202240012"/> no Money; well then says he, I have so much Brass as that; and then we went over London-Bridge to a House in the Borough. He there told me it was better living there than here, for we should have 5 d. halfpenny a Day, and four Leaves a Week; said I, I have taken my Oath here to be true to this King, and I suppose I must take my Oath again when I go over. No, no, said he, there is nothing in it, you only kiss the Book. We then went with him to his Quarters in Kent street, and had some Gin, and he told us if we had a Mind to go with him we must go to Rag-Fair and sell our Cloaths.</p>
               <p>Counc. How came you not to go to Rag-Fair?</p>
               <p>Meredith. I told him Monmouth-street was a better Place, for I had a Mind to ask some Advice before I took him up, and accordingly when we came to the Savoy I ask'd Serjeant Taylor what I must do with him? and he told me I must take Care of him. We went from thence to the Coal-Hole, Griffith and Richards were there when we came in, and I told the Prisoner that one of them might go with us. He had some Talk with them about listing, and then I went out and can't tell what passed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you see this Paper taken from the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Meredith. Yes, and he tore a Piece out of it in pulling it away: - this is the same; I wrote my Name on the Back of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Occasion of the Prisoner's producing that Paper at all?</p>
               <p>Meredith. Griffith said to him, How can I know that you belong to the King of France? Why, said the Prisoner, I have a Furloe; let me see it, said Griffith, and he then pulled it out directly.</p>

            , The first Place where I ever saw the Prisoner, was at the Coal- Hole by the Savoy. I sat down and drank there, and these three Men told the Prisoner, that I would go along with him: Upon that, he talk'd to me about enlisting myself, and I ask'd how I should know that he belonged to the King of France? for he might want to carry me to another Place. O! says he, I have a Furloe from my Captain in my Pocket, and he desired me to go with him to be a Soldier in the King of France's Service.</p>

               <p>Griffith. I desir'd him to lend me the Furloe, for I told him I could read French; upon which Richards talked to me in Welch, and desired me to keep it: The Prisoner then wanted to snatch it away, and broke the Piece out.</p>

I cry'd out Watch; and directly the Prisoner said hold of me; - the whole Transaction was not so long as I have been speaking. The Prisoner immediately tripp'd up my Heels, and stood over me, and beat my Right Fore-finger in a terrible Manner. I believe it will appear by the Evidence that I shall produce, that this Man and the Woman were found talking together at Creed-Lane, about 12 o'Clock.

               <p>Mr. Fawdrey. Between 12 and 1: - I did not meet with her, she met with me, and came forcibly upon me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fawdrey It was very near the Lamp, and I knew the Prisoner the Moment he was taken.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fawdrey. At the very Instant that my Watch was taken away, my Heels flew up, from whence I apprehend, that the Man was behind me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fawdrey. No, nor her neither, for the whole Transaction was but half a Minute.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fawdrey. It was so near, that I believe I could say it wanted about a Quarter of one.</p>

I crossed over the Way to the Corner of Creed-Lane, and while I was standing there, I saw the Prisoner and another Man, with a Woman in a white Cloak and a Velvet Hood. One of the Men, who was a tallish Man, cross'd the Way from her, and when he had got about half a-cross, the Woman call'd, Hog! Hog! I want to speak with you.

            , a Watchman, after which, I walked pretty leisurely till I came beyond the Change. The Prisoner and the Woman in the Cloak then passed me. I was not positive which Way they turned, but just as I came to the Corner of Cornhill, by Bishopsgate-Street, there stood a Hackney-Coach just cross the Street. I stopp'd there to make the Coachman drive out of the Way, which being done, I went down Bishopsgate-street; and when I had got 3 or 4 Doors down, I heard a Cry of Watch! Hearing that, I mended my Pace, and there is a great Pair of wooden Gates on the Right Hand side of the Way; and next Door to them, I saw Mr. Fawdrey upon his Back. The Prisoner and the Woman in the white Cloak were then upon him: What (said I) are you going to murder the Man? and as soon as I had said that, the Prisoner turned about, and ran over the Way directly: - he ran one Way, and the Woman another. The Prosecutor said he had lost his Watch, upon which, after I had helped him up, I pursued the Prisoner. He ran about as far as the Pump, and then he turned his Back against the Wall, and asked me what I wanted with him? I told him, the Gentleman said he had robbed him of his Watch, and he must go with me. I brought him over the Way, and as soon as Mr. Fawdrey saw him, he said, that is the Man that knocked me down. We then, with the Assistance of a Watchman, carried him to the Watch-house, and there he denied that he knew any thing of the Matter.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Fawdrey. What Dress was the Woman in that came up to you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fawdrey. I take it that she had on a Linnen or Cotton Gown, with a light Colour'd short Cloak, and a Velvet Hood.</p>

               <p>Hind. Because he then had a blue Handkerchief with white Spots about his Neck, and the same Coat on as he has now.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Was it dark or light when this happened?</p>
               <p>Hind. I can't remember, but there is a Lamp just by the Tavern Door, at the End of Creed-Lane, and another at the Door over-against it.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. What o'Clock was it when you saw them there?</p>
               <p>Hind I believe it was a Quarter after 12, because when the Watch go 12 o'Clock, Mr. Darby always turns the Customers out of Doors, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174202240015"/> only staid to pay my Reckoning and finish a Pot of Beer, and then I came away.</p>

            . Watchman, confirm'd the Deposition of Palmer Hind, so far as it related to the apprehending the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Thomas Hill, Constable. On Tuesday Morning, a little after one, the Prisoner was brought into the Watch-House. Mr. Fawdrey gave me charge of the Prisoner, for knocking him down, and rescuing a Person who had robbed him of his Watch. I asked Mr. Fawdrey in what Manner this was done, and he related it to me. He told me, he was coming down Bishopsgate-street, and a Woman laid hold of him, and asked him to give her a Glass of Wine: He bid her go about her Business, and he then perceived the Watch taken from him; upon which he attempted to lay hold of her, and immediately the Prisoner knocked him down, or struck up his Heels. That as soon as he recovered himself, he called Watch! and the Fellow then made off, and was pursued by Palmer Hind, who was then coming by, and with the Assistance of a Watchman, the Prisoner was taken. I asked the Prisoner several Questions, and he told me, he was going down on the other Side of the Way, and saw a Man and a Woman upon the Ground. He said, he went over to see what was the Matter, and when the Gentleman cry'd Watch! he ran - for Fear of coming into Trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that he knew the Woman who was there?</p>
               <p>Hill. No, he pretended that he knew nothing of her.</p>
               <p>It was insisted on by the Prisoner in his Defence, that he had been in Company with two Friends towards St. Giles's, 'till late at Night, and that he came from thence with them only towards Bishopsgate-street; that as he was going on one Side of Bishopsgate-street, he saw a Gentleman and a Woman struggling. That he went away directly, and soon afterwards the Gentleman complained of the Injury, and pursued him.</p>

            . Last Monday Evening, between 7 and 8 o'Clock, the Prisoner and I were drinking at the Bull Head, in White chapple. He said, he was going into Catherine street, to receive some Money, and desired me to take a Walk with him. Accordingly I did, and then we took our Departure from thence, and directed our Way Home.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. How long did you stay in Catherine-street ?</p>
               <p>Cumber. I believe we came from thence between 12 and 1:

             was with us. We came directly for the City, and we took our Leaves of the Prisoner at the End of Bishopsgate-street, and went towards White chapple. There was nobody at all in Company but we three, and when we parted with the Prisoner, I believe it was about 1 o'Clock, and I saw no more of him that Night. I am a Shoemaker, and live in the Minories; Gibbs lives in White chapple, and I parted with him at the End of the Minories. I have known the Prisoner 20 Years, he is a Butcher, and I have bought Meat of him lately. He does not keep any Shop, but carries it about in a Tray. I never heard no ill Character of him, but he seems to take an industrious Care for his Bread. - I live in Well-Court, just by Mr. Fowler's the Barber's.</p>

            . I was in Company with Cumber and the Prisoner at a Shop like a Chandler's Shop in Catherine-street: - it was pretty near 9 o'Clock, and we staid there till a little after 12. From thence we came with the Prisoner alone to the End of Bishopsgate-street, and there parted with him. There was no Woman in our Company, and we turn'd down no Street at all till we came to Bishopsgate-street, where we parted with the Prisoner, and went on directly towards Whitechappel. I believe it was then very near 1 o'Clock, if not quite. As to the Prisoner's Character, I have known him 20 Years, and never heard any Body give him an ill Character.</p>

            . On Monday last about 1 o'Clock, I was coming from the Yorkshire Grey in Gravel-Lane, and just as I was going to cross to Thread-needle-street, I heard a Person say, Stop her, I have lost my Watch! Presently a Woman ran by, as fast as if she had Wings, and I saw another Person like the Prisoner, and he was taken hold of. The Mob then began to gather, and I went Home, and saw no more of it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ayres. It is indorsed - Mr. Metcalfe does not object to the Persons within mention'd, provided they justifie before a Baron, J. Tyton, for Mr. Metcalse.</p>
               <p>Counc. Who is Mr. Tyton ?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ayres. He is Clerk to Mr. Metcalse: I have seen him write ten thousand Times, and I take that to be his Hand.</p>
               <p>Pris. Ask Mr. Ayres whether I was in the Baron's Chambers?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ayres. He went before me to the Baron's Chambers, and asked me whether it was necessary for him to go up? I told him he might do as he pleased, and I think he staid below Stairs.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. When this Matter was first mov'd in the Court of Exchequer, did not I attend without an Order?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ayres. I believe he did; - I really can't say, but I believe there was an Order made for him to attend, and upon his Attendance the Court order'd him into Custody.</p>
               <p>Heneage Norton. About the 20th of May, the Prisoner came to my House in Friday-street, and told me he had been arrested for running Goods, and that he wanted to give Bail to an Information. He inform'd me that he was recommended to me by Mr. Russel in the Temple. I then told him he must get two honest Persons to propose to the Sollicitor of the Customs. He said he was a Stranger in Town, but he believ'd he could get Friends; and accordingly he came to me sometime afterwards, and gave me this Paper, on which are written the Names of

Upon that, I wrote the Note which has been read, and gave it to Mr. Metcalfe's Clerk; and Mr. Metcalfe informing me that those Persons were not sufficient, I told the Prisoner of it, and he said Dowling was a Relation of his, a Man of Fortune, and lived in Grays-Inn; and that Durmot was a Man of good Repute, and liv'd at Adlam's Coffee-House. I inform'd Mr. Metcalfe of the Prisoner's Answer, and he then said that Dowling was an ancient Man, but however if they would justifie, he would have no Objection to them. I then gave Mr. Ayres this Note that has been read, and desir'd him to get the Bail Piece ready, and likewise desir'd the Prisoner to attend me at the Exchequer-Office, or at Brown's Coffee-House hard by, any Time that suited his Conveniency, and he said he would bring the Bail with him. Accordingly he came to me as I was at the Office-Door, and told me the Bail were ready, and were waiting at a Public House in Wych-street. I desir'd him to bring them down to the Office, and soon afterwards Mr. Russel told me, that Handley and his Bail were come to a Public House just above Brown's Coffee-House in Mitre-Court, and that they desir'd I would come and read the Bail-Piece to them.

            , and then I read the Bail-Piece to them: the Prisoner, to the best of my Knowledge was present all the Time. I told them the Consequence of it, and that they might sign it there if they pleased; upon which they took a Pen and Ink, and I observed that the old Man (Dowling ) wrote a very good Hand. From thence I took them to the Exchequer-Office to Mr. Ayres, and I told him those were the two Persons who had sign'd the Bail-Piece, and desir'd him to go with them before the Baron.</p>

            . About the Beginning of June last, the Prisoner came recommended to me, and told me he had been taken up on an Information, and came up to London to put in Bail, upon which I recommended him to Mr. Norton. He told me one Mr. Dowling would become his Bail, and likewise one Durmot of Adlam's Coffee-House; but after that, he said there was some Difficulty with the Coffee-Man, and he was afraid it would not do. Instructions were afterwards sent to me, and I wrote this Bail-Piece by Mr. Ayres's Order. I was likewise present when the two Bail subscrib'd it; - it was at a Public House called the Vine, just by Brown's Coffee-House, and I saw them sign their Names; Mr. Norton was present at the same Time; I gave him Notice that they were there. Mr. Dowling I have known many Years by Sight, and he sign'd first: the other Man I did not take much Notice of, but I saw him write - Durmot, after it had been read over to them by Mr. Norton.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was the Prisoner present ?</p>
               <p>Russel. I think he was, but I can't be positive to that. After this when we were coming out of the House together, Mr. Norton asked me in the Passage for the Fees: I told the Prisoner of it, and he ran away to get the Money, and in a few Minutes brought it to Mr. Norton.</p>

            . I have kept Adlam's Coffee-House about a Year and 3 Quarters to the best of my Knowledge. I never was Bail for any Person, nor ever sign'd any Recognizance.</p>
               <p>Counc. Look upon that Recognizance, and tell the Court whether you ever sign'd it in one Part or another?</p>
               <p>Macdurmot No, I never did: I always spell my Name - Macdurmot; but the English call me - Durmot. About the middle of May last, the Prisoner and one Conrade came to my House and called for Coffee, and other Liquors. Conrade called me into a Back Room, and told me there was a poor Man accused on Account of some run Goods, therefore desir'd me to bail him. I told him if it was my own Brother I would not; and sometime afterwards I heard that somebody had bailed the Prisoner in my Name.</p>
               <p>Counc. How came you to hear of this afterwards?</p>
               <p>Macdurmot. One of my Neighbours informed me that some Persons had been to enquire my Character, and whether I was worth 186 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ayres being ask'd whether this Witness was the Person who went with him to the Baron's Chambers, answer'd in the Negative.</p>

               <p>Macdurmot. I always take my Receipts in the Name of Macdurmot, but a great many People call me Durmot.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did the Prisoner ever ask you to be bail?</p>
               <p>Macdurmot. No, not that I remember.</p>

               <p>Macdurmot. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. When this Matter became public, did you never declare, that you would deny it, and that you would hang one, and transport the other?</p>
               <p>Macdurmot. I never did.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Did not you employ Mr. Williscot to draw a Bond of Indemnity?</p>
               <p>Macdurmot Dowling came to my House with a View of making it up, and I not knowing any Thing of the Law, went to that Gentleman's House to ask his Advice, and he would not have any Hand in the Action.

               <p>Dennis. I might ask both ways. I likewise enquired Dowling's Character of a Porter at Gray's-Inn-Gate, and told him, he was propos'd for Bail, and the Porter said, he would go and ask him whether he would be Bail or no, for perhaps he might get 6 d or 1 s. by the Job.</p>

That Conrade went out of the Room with Dowling, and sometime afterwards, Conrade sent him (the Prisoner) Word, that Durmot would become his Bail; and accordingly a Person came with Durmot's own Brother, and that the Bail-piece was then sign'd.</p>

This was about 10 or 11 in the Day Time, on a Monday Morning; - we had been strolling about all Night. After I had missed my Watch - I did not charge the Prisoner with it, for I locked all the People up together in the House for fear they should run away.</p>

Then they began to try for my Watch, I therefore kept it in my Hand, and twisted the String round my Finger; but they bit my Fingers to make me let it go, and then I put it into my Bosom. Upon this they threw me upon the Bed, and with the Assistance of 2 Men, took the Watch from me.</p>

            , Constable. On Sunday Night about a quarter after 10 o'Clock, I came into the Watch-house, and the Prosecutor told me he had been robb'd in Thatch'd-Alley. I took two Watchmen with me to the House, and when I came into the Ground Room, there was a sick Child there. We went into the upper Part of the House, and met with no body, but when we came into the Ground Room again we saw the Prisoner Cooper. The Prosecutor no sooner saw her, but he said she was one of the Persons who assisted in taking his Watch. Accordingly we laid hold of her; - there was a Man in the House whom we likewise took to the Watch-house, but the Prosecutor not swearing positively to him, I discharg'd him. When Cooper was brought in, she desir'd that we would go and search on the Bed for the Watch, and we accordingly did, and found it under the Coverlid of the Bed.</p>
               <p>A Watchman. I went along with my Master Ward to Carter's House, - the Prosecutor shew'd us the House, and we found Cooper in the Ground Room; and in the one pair of Stairs Room we found the Prosecutor's Stick. There was a Man in the House, and my Master order'd me to take Cooper out while he examin'd him; and then Cooper said it was hard she should suffer, for she was Innocent, and she asked me if we had look'd on the Bed, for perhaps the Man might drop the Watch there. My Master and I afterwards found it on the Bed under the Rug.</p>
               <p>Pris Carter. Ask the Prosecutor whether I brought him into the House?</p>
               <p>Dudley. No, I believe Mrs. Carter was not concern'd at first, but came into the Room afterwards: - She came about the middle of the Fray, when I had four upon me; and she held my Hands, or did something that Way, as the rest did.</p>
               <p>Carter. Ask the Watchman whether I keep the House?</p>
               <p>Watchman. It always goes in her Husband's Name; they live in the lower Appartment; I can't tell whether they have the whole House.</p>

On Saturday Night last, I had been out, and when I returned, I found my Wife in a great Surprize, and some Neighbours informed me that they had seen three Men in my Shop. I missed the Goods mentioned in the Indictment, and therefore got a Warrant to search a House which I suspected, at Saltpeter-Bank. When we went in, we found the Prisoner Hale there, - it was her House, and the Gentlemen drew their Swords and Daggers, and threatened our Lives. There were three Thieves, and four Women there: Hale was one of them, and she gave the Men the Key to get the Weapons, in order to drive us out of the House.</p>

There was another Man in the Entry, who seemed to be opening the Hatch.

I met Peterson and another, as I was going to tell my Neighbour. The other Man had an Apron as full of something as it could hold. I had been threaten'd by these Men before, therefore dust not take any Notice of them; but I went to my Neighbour Mrs. Rogers, and told her that her House was beset by Thieves She started up as I was talking to her, and out started a Man from the same Side as my Neighbour sells his Shoes on.

            , The first Proceeding of coming into the Thing was, that I was robbed last Friday Night. I happened to be along with a Customer in my Way of Business, and my Wife came to me, and told me, my Shop had been robbed. On Saturday, about 7 at Night I was informed, that Mr. Rogers had been robbed much in the same Manner as myself, a little after Candle-light, and therefore went to his House, and thought by our going together, we might meet with the Thieves who had robb'd us. He happened not to be at Home then, but on the Monday following, we took out a Warrant to search Hale's House. When we came in, there were the Prisoner and two more, who were the three Thieves of whom we had Information One of them I knew by Sight, because he is the Captain of New Prisons Son, I told the Constable - there was his Prisoner, and then one of them said, - D - you have is a Search Warrant! Why don't you give me the Key? Upon that, the Prisoner Hale put her Hand into her Pocket, and he made Use of a great many vile Expressions, and took the Key from her, and said, he would shew us what we came to search for. He open'd a Closet, and took out a Sword and two Doggers, or other dangerous Weapons, and after they had each taken one, he cried, - Now clear the House, or else D - n you, I will pin you up, or cut you down directly! Upon that, we having nothing to defend ourselves, the Constable went out first, and we being in Danger, were very ready to follow: - My Wife was the last in the House. The Prisoner took the shortest Weapon of the three; - they were all ready drawn in the Closet, and he held it up as if he was making an Offer to push at us. We told them, we had a search Warrant when we went into the House; - that was the first Thing we mentioned: the Woman ( Hale) was there at the same Time. After they had turned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174202240023"/> us out of the House, they all made their Escape backwards, and in a turning by Grace's-Alley, I saw the three Men together. I caught hold of the Prisoner Peterson, and a Knife was taken from him, which is here to be produced, which is not a proper Thing for People to carry about them. This is the Knife, and I found it open in the Prisoner's Pocket. - It appeared to be a French Knife about a Foot long</p>

             We went with a Warrant to search the House, and a tall, thin Man, almost 6 foot high, asked me what I wanted: - It was the Prisoner Hale's House, she owned it was hers before the Justice I told them I had a Search Warrant, and they would not give us Time to shew it them, for the tall Man Cavanah, called the Woman B - n, for some such Thing, and ask'd her for the Key, and said, he would shew us something; after which, he pulled out a Sword, and swore he would stick me.</p>

               <p>Wiman. I can't tell what Weapon he had, for when the other Man pushed at me, I turned my Head. The Prisoner Hale was there all the Time, for she gave them the Key to get the Arms.</p>

            , and went with him and the others to Hale's House in Saltpetre Bank. The Constable was going to knock at the Door, but a Woman came out, and we got in without any Resistance. There were three Men sitting in the Kitchen, - Peterson was one, the Captain of New-Prison's Son another, and a Man in a grey Coat was the other. Cavannah, the tallest of the three, asked us what we wanted? Rogers and the Headborough told him, they had a Search Warrant. Upon that, he ran up Stairs, and left Peterson and the other in the Room. We heard a rustling above Stairs for 2 or 3 Minutes, and then Cavanah came down and damn'd the Prisoner Hale, and bid her give him the Key; upon which he said, - D - n them, I will shew them what they search for. He then opened the Closet, and took out three drawn Weapons, one of them was longer than the others, and that he kept for himself, and gave the others to the Prisoner Peterson and the other Man. He told us, if we did not quit the House that Moment, he would stick us against the Wall. The first Man that turn'd his Back was the Constable, and the others were very ready to follow him. I let my Husband go out first, because I thought they would not hurt me, and Cavannah swore if I did not go out, it should be the worse for me. When Peterson was apprehended, I saw my Husband take this Knife out of his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Peterson. This Woman (Hale) used to wash Shirts for me, and I went to her House to get one. I had ben at Sea, and thought these People were coming to press me, therefore I took this Knife to drive them out of Doors.</p>
