On 22nd Aug., about four o'clock in the morning, I found the prisoner drunk, lying in the middle of the road in Wellington-street—his trowsers were torn—the right pocket was torn out—I saw two men run away from him—I took him to the police-office, and he was discharged next morning—he had five sovereigns, six shillings, a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece, and some halfpence in his pocket—I went with him to the Black Sam, at the corner of Brydges-street, to see if he could find the party who robbed him—he asked the landlord if he knew the parties who were in the house with him the night previous—he said, "No"—the prisoner explained what liquor he paid for, and mentioned changing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, and then the landlord knew him—the note was got, and the prisoner said that was the note he had changed, that he knew it by his name on the back—he said he could not walk the streets as his clothes were in such a state, and the inspector told him</p>

On 20th Aug., between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I passed down Whitechapel, and met the prisoner McCarthy—she asked me to treat her—she then asked me to go to a coffee-house, which I agreed to, and went with her to one in Somerset-street, Aldgate—I went with her to a room on the first-floor, where there was a bed—I was only there three or four minutes, when she asked me to stand treat, as she called it, and put her hand into my pocket, and took out all the gold money I had; it was five sovereigns—I said, "You have robbed me;" and she ran to the opposite side of the room—I opened the door, called for assistance, and I saw her put a sovereign into her mouth and swallow it—when I called, the prisoner Hailes was the first who came in, and I said, "This woman has robbed me;" and almost instantly she put her hand over my shoulder, and almost under my face, and I became insensible, and do not recollect anything afterwards—I was perfectly sober when I went into the house—I did not recover my senses till the next afternoon, to the best of my recollection between four and six o'clock, when I found myself at home—I lost five sovereigns out of my left waistcoat pocket, and two half-crowns, and seven shillings in silver, and a white pocket-handkerchief—I had a pocket-book, the papers in it were all disturbed, and apparently examined; my address was in it; I found it in my pocket when I was at home—I was very ill for four or five days—on the day after my recovery, I went with the policeman in search of the parties—we</p>

               <p>20th August, I met the prosecutor, about half-past six o'clock, in Fleet-street, and went with him to the New-cut, to see a party on business—I was with him till half-past eleven or a quarter to twelve—I did not go with him to any coffee-house—we supped at the house where we went on business—we had a small glass of brandy and water each—I parted with him opposite Aldgate Church, about two minutes' walk from this coffee-shop—he was quite sober—I knew him before.</p>

I said—"Yes," he said, "of every shilling"—I said, "That is very pretty; before I proceed any further I shall expect you will account for this money, or give me security for it"—he said he could not do that himself, but he could get the security of two persons—he sent for them, and they refused to be security for him—they said it was too large a sum for them to encounter—one was a servant, and the other a housekeeper—that being the case I said, "If I cannot find the money I shall give you under the charge of the police"—he seemed rather surprised at that—I said, "I must do that to secure myself," and I gave him in charge—the money I gave him was Lord Yarborough's, given for me to dispose of for the purposes of the household.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Mayers. On 23rd Aug. I was passing from Eldon-street to Wilson-street—a boy came up to me with some lucifers—I do not think that I should know him again; it was not the pri<lb/>soner—he came and offered them a second time to me—I was then crossing the road, some one came to me, and I found I had lost my purse containing half-a-sovereign, half-a-crown, and a sixpence with two holes in it—I had it when I was in King William-street, half an hour before.</p>

I was in Wilson-street, on the night of 23rd Aug.—I heard Mrs. Mayers asked if she had lost her purse—in consequence of that I pursued the prisoner and two other boys, who I saw running down Eldon-street—two of them were stopped, but the prisoner being the biggest, I pur<lb/>sued him—he took a purse out of hrs pocket, and threw it down; I picked it up, this is it—I still ran after him, but lost sight of him—I am sure he is the person that threw it down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On 31st Aug., I was at the George Inn, Uxbridge—the prisoners came in separately—I had not known them before—Britton came in with some cards—he put three cards down on the table, and said he would bet a penny-worth of nuts to a halfpenny-worth, that I did not find the card he named—I betted with him, and found the card he named—he put them down again, and I again found the card he named—that was for a halfpenny-worth of nuts against a penny-worth—I won that three times—he then put down the cards again, and betted me sixpence that I did not find the card he named—I betted, and lost the sixpence—he put them down again, and betted a shilling; I lost that—he then put them down again, and Thompson said he could find the card he named—I betted him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that he did not—Thompson said it was the middle card—he then got up from the table, and Britton took the middle card out, and put it outside, and put the outside one in the middle—Thompson then took up the card, and said he had won it—Thompson took up the money which I had placed down, and then went away—Britton went out a little time afterwards—I went out in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after, and informed the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson.</hi> I made the bet, and won the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live near Prince's-Risboro, Bucks. On 9th August I was at work in the field of Mr. Hodgson, at Greenhill, in the parish of Harrow—the prisoner was at work there with me—his wife came to him after we had finished our work—she wanted money of him—he offered her five shillings—she said that was of no use to her; her children and her had not any bread—she would not take it—we then went to a beer-shop, and had one pint of beer—we then left and went on to Sudbury for another job of work—the prisoner walked on the road before me, and his wife along with him—I was about twenty yards from them—I did not hear what they were saying—they were talking, and appeared to be quarrelling—when they had got about a furlong from the public-house, the woman ran across the road; the prisoner followed her with a scythe in his hand—the scythe had a green brier or a bridle upon it—this is the scythe(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the bridle was nut cut through before this happened, but I looked at it directly afterwards, and it was then cut through as it is now—the prisoner struck the deceased with the scythe on the head—she rather dropped on her knee—he only struck her once—she said, "I am murdered by my husband!" and the prisoner said, "I have killed my poor wife!"—I remained with the woman—she was bleeding very much—the prisoner went for a doctor and returned with him in about five minutes—the deceased had been taking some beer, and I think it had taken some effect upon her, and also on the prisoner—they had nothing but beer.</p>

I was called by the prisoner—he was so confused that I did not understand at all from him what I was to do—he did not tell me who had been hurt—I went with him directly to the public high-road, and saw the deceased sitting on the raised pathway—her cap and bonnet were off; her head was covered with blood, and the blood was flowing profusely from an incised wound on the left</p>

               <p>side of the head; it was four or five inches long, and extended from the fore part backwards—I removed the hair; the scalp was completely cut through; the upper table of the skull was cut through in a corresponding line with the external flesh wound, and much about the same length—I sponged and dressed the wound, and had her taken home to her own residence—after the first few days she went on favourably, and continued to do so for some time—she was in danger for the first eight or ten days—she continued to improve for some twelve days afterwards, and then some serious symptoms set in, and she became comatose and incoherent, and eventually died on Sunday morning, 1st Sept.—I attended her daily, occasionally twice a day, and sometimes three times—a female attended upon her the whole time, and proper attention was paid to her—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was a fracture of the inner table of the skull, in a line corresponding with the cut on the external table—the fracture that caused the death was such as might have been inflicted by this scythe; there was also an abscess in the posterior lobe of the brain—I ascribe the death to the fracture of the skull, with the abscess in the brain resulting from the blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am between seventy and eighty years of age, and live at Bird Wallace-hall, near Doncaster; I am a widower, and have children and grandchildren. On 27th Aug., I arrived at Euston-square from Doncaster, and proceeded directly in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Tavistock Hotel; after dinner I walked out, intending to return and go to bed—I went through the Lowther Arcade, through a street which I do not know, to Hemming's-row—I saw something going on at a shop window, I thought the man was making billiard-balls—I stopped and looked at him; there were four or five persons standing there; Braznell was one, but I did not see Wren—I asked Braznell</p>

               <p>if he knew what the man doing; he said, "Turning"—after that he pressed very much against me, and leant over as if he wished to look into the shop; that had the effect of pressing upon me—I believe I was standing with both hands down; in a moment or two afterwards I perceived that he was pressing his private parts against my hand; I withdrew my hand and walked away about twenty yards—he then came up to me and asked me what I meant by taking indecent liberties with him—I told him I had done no such thing—he said, "Do you think I will allow you to do so for nothing?"—a conversation took place which I cannot remember exactly, but he asked me what I would <hi rend="italic">stand;</hi> it was all to the same purpose—I said I would <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> nothing—he said, then I must take the consequences—I continued walking, and he followed me close—when we got to the bottom of Hemming's-row, he said I had better go into a public-house and have a glass, and we could soon settle the business; that he did not want to have any dispute, nor to be hard upon me—I again told him in the most peremptory manner I was able, "I will neither go into any house, nor give you one farthing"—he said, then he would hand me over to the police; I said I was quite ready to go with the police—I think he said, "Then you had better follow me"—I understood him to mean, to the police; I said I was ready to do so, and walked on—when he said he would hand me over to the police, I said, "Then you mean to threaten me"—he said, "No, I don't, I know the law as well as you do"—Wren was then standing in front of me—I first saw him at the bottom of Hemming's-row—I cannot tell whether he could hear all that was said, he was five or six yards off—a few minutes afterwards I saw the prisoners speak together with a third party, whose name turns out to be White—I went on walking with them both, and when we got into the Haymarket, by the bottom of Panton-street, a policeman came up, with White, who had left to fetch him, about two minutes before—Braznell said to the policeman, "That is him," pointing to me; Wren was close to me—I did not hear Braznell say any<lb/>thing to the policeman about Wren—I gave myself up to the policeman—I do not think Braznell had spoken to the policeman before I did so—I was locked up in the station all night—I told my story to the inspector, nearly the same as I have now—next day I was taken before Mr. Hardwick, the Magi<lb/>strate, at the Marylebone police-court—the prisoners and White appeared as witnesses against me—I had no solicitor or counsel, I thought I could tell my own story better—the prisoners were examined apart, by the Magistrate's order; police were sent out with them—I then told my story—I was dis<lb/>charged, and made the present charge against the prisoners—I never caught hold of Braznell by the private parts, or forced down his trowsers—I took no indecent liberty with him; the moment I perceived him pressing on me I withdrew.</p>

On 30th April the prisoner came to my place, and said he could sell three boxes of cigars; he had a gentleman who would buy them—I said I could not go with him, but I sent Mr. Bullock, a friend, with him to the Tower Shades—he was to bring back the cigars or the money—he had three cases, containing seven pounds and a half altogether.</p>

On 22nd August, about two o'clock in the morning, I was in Bell-street, New-road—I received infor<lb/>mation from Knight, and in consequence went with him and Pierce to the pri<lb/>soner, Martin St. Ledger's house, 75, Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove—it is a beer-shop—while we were outside, I heard as if persons were playing at bagatelle inside—I heard numbers counted, 3, 6, 9, 21, 23, 46, balls rattle, and persons in conversation, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. clink upon the table—I knocked at the door, and a person who I recognised by his voice to be Martin St. Ledger, said, "Who is there?" I said, "Police!" and he said, "Go round to the front-door"—the door I went to first, is a side-door in a court—I went round to the front-door, which is in Devonshire-street, waited five or six minutes, and while doing so I heard several persons going up-stairs, and the rattle of glass—Martin opened the door in five or six minutes, and I then got to the front of the bar; I found no one there—there was a middle door, which goes into the bar, secured by a wedge, and I said, "Where are the people who were here?"—he opened the door, and said, "If there are people there you had better find them"—I looked, and did not see any one—I said, "I am certain you had people playing at bagatelle"—he said, "There is no bagatelle-board here"—I said, no doubt it was a portable one—I did not go up-stairs—sergeant Pierce looked behind a door which shuts against the staircase, and directly he pulled that back, a man and a woman came down-stairs; Knight said, "What are these people here?"—we had been in the house before that night, and Martin said, "You have been here before, and I will serve you out for this"—I said, "Why you are drunk"—he said, "Well if I am, I am in my own house"—the man who came down, was John St. Ledger, and he directly struck Knight on the side of the head, which knocked his hat off—I was at the sill of the door at the time, and I turned farther round to expostulate with him, he made some observation which I</p>

               <p>did not catch, and struck me a tremendous blow in the left eye—I turned round and drew my staff, and then M'Donald ran down-stairs, and the whole three closed on me before I had time to use my staff—that was the first I saw of M'Donald—I did not know him or John St. Ledger before—directly they closed on me there was a scuffle between us, and the side-door in the court was opened by some one, and I received a violent blow behind, which knocked me down in the doorway—I do not know who the blow came from—Pierce was then in the court; he had got out, and I was following him—when the blow was given, Knight was following me, and he got out by a blow which sent him past me; the door was open—directly I was down, the door was closed on my right leg—I was on my face—I hallooed to them to open the door, that my leg was in the door; and I called to the other constables to get me out, and some one inside twisted my boot round, and tried to get my leg out without opening the door: that did not succeed—I remained about five or six minutes with my leg shut in the door—I continued calling out for them to open it—it was ultimately forced open by Cooper—Pierce dragged me out, and I was carriedfhome on a stretcher—I had two large wounds on my ankle<lb/>bone, and I was bruised very much on the right side; there was not a great deal of blood—I have not been able to go on duty since—I had not used my staff on the prisoners at all, I had only drawn it.</p>

About two o'clock on the morning of 22nd, I went with Steer and Knight to this beer-shop in Devonshire-street, kept by Martin St. Ledger—while outside I heard sounds which appeared to be bagatelle balls, and heard numbers counted, 3, 9, 21, and glasses rattle "we knocked at the door—I said we were police—we were told to go round to the other door, and we should be let in—about five minutes after that, Martin let us in—while waiting we heard sounds of several people going up-stairs—when the door was opened I said to Martin, "Where are the people who were playing at bagatelle or skittles?"—he said there were no people—I said, "It is wrong for you to have people playing at this time and drinking, and you drunk"—he said, "If I am drunk, I an in my own house"—I said,</p>

               <p>"Very well, that will do; let me out", and I went out; Steer was follow<lb/>ing me, and Knight after him—as we were going out, John came down-stairs with a woman, and said, "Hallo, what is the matter?" and struck Knight, and knocked his hat off, and he staggered out at the door—the door was closed, and Steer's leg came between the door and the door-post, and the door was closed upon him—Steer cried out, "My leg, my leg! open the door"—I should say the door was kept closed five minutes, during which time I cried out to the persons inside, "Open the floor; you will break the man's leg!"—I did not get any answer—I sprang my rattle—some other constables came up—we then pushed the door open, and got Steer away—when we got him into the street be fainted—when the door was pushed open, I saw Martin and John St. Ledger—I did not see M'Donald.</p>

On 22nd Aug., at a quarter-past two o'clock, I went with Steer and Pierce, to Martin St. Ledger's house; after a little time we were admitted—Steer's evidence is substantially correct—John St. Ledger came down, and struck me on the side of the head—that was the commencement of the assault—I was struck out into the court, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Collard, a policeman, and live in Eccleston-place, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. I know George Stevens—on Thursday afternoon, 3rd Sept., I saw him in Eccleston-place with his child, bowling the child's hoop—I also saw George Fox there—I knew him before; he lodged at our house—the child's hoop struck Fox's leg—he put his hand on the top of the hoop, and smiled—George Stevens was about a couple of yards from him, and said, "You b—, if you do not leave hold of the hoop, I will punch your b—head"—Fox said, "If you do, I can do the same"—they then both struck each other one blow—Mrs. Stevens came out of the beer-shop, took Fox by the collar, and pushed his head against the shutters—he had nothing on his head—Hayes then came out and struck him on the head, and two or three more rushed on him as well, and kept striking him till they got him across the road—they got him near a cart, and Hayes struck him down, with his body across the shafts of the cart, and his head was lying on the ground; and Mrs. Stevens took him by the hair of the head and knocked his head on the stones—I cannot say on what part of the body Hayes struck him—they lifted him up, and Hayes knocked him down again—the other two prisoners were close to him at the time—Hayes knocked him down several times after that—the Stevens's were striking him while he was down—he got up by himself, and he and Hayes fought again—Hayes knocked him down again, and he came on the side of his head in the road; and Hayes knocked him down again, and that was the last blow, it was under the ear—he did not get up till he was picked up, and carried away to my house—he was insensible—a medical man was sent for—I had seen him before that day, about two o'clock—he was a little the worse for liquor, and went to bed and slept—this happened about five—he was a little the worse for liquor when he went out—his hat was knocked off.</p>

On this afternoon I was looking out of window, I saw the hoop go against Fox—I saw him strike Stevens, and as soon as he had struck him, his wife came out of the beer-shop, took hold of Fox, struck him, and there was a scream; several came out of the beer-shop and began to fight with Fox till they got across the road, then they fell, and Fox fell under the cart by the blows he received from the men—Hayes was one of them, and another man who has escaped—I did not see the Stevens's strike him at the cart, but they were round—his head turned round under the cart—Mrs. Stevens was close to him, but could not get at him—she came round to the back of the cart, took his hair, and beat his head on the stones while he was lying on the ground under the cart—Stevens was standing by, but not doing anything—Fox was assisted up by the crowd, and there was "Shame!" cried—Hayes and the deceased then commenced fighting, and Fox fell opposite my window, his head came on the ground; it seemed a very bad fall—I ran down to protect my children, who were at the door, and when I got down he was on his feet again—I was close to him then, and he was deliberately struck down by Hayes at my feet; his head came on a stone that projected up, such a stone as they pave mews with—he did not get up again—I exclaimed that he was a dead man I he did not move, and was taken away.</p>

The deceased was brought there on 3rd Sept., about half-past six o'clock, by two policemen, Collard and Thompson, I believe—he was perfectly insensible—I examined his head, and found a small wound or graze on the front of the right temple, and blood flowing from the right ear, which is a most dangerous symptom—he rallied the next morning between five and six, became partially sensible, and remained so till one in the morning of the 6th, when I was called, and found him perfectly insensible, and he died at half-past six—I made a post mortem examination, and found a graze in front of the right temple, and a fracture at the base of the skull leading into the right ear, which would account fur the blood, and a large quantity of extravasated blood between the bones of the skull and the membranes: that would cause death—it might be occasioned by a heavy blow, or a fall.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The effect of that would be to shut off the passengers in Churton-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a person in the ordinary course of business would have no occasion to be near the window; it is but of the direct course—the father of the child resides in Churton-street—if the child was coming from his school in Rochester-row to his father's house, he was about thirty feet out of the direct line—a person of ordinary care and caution would not expect that anybody would be walking at that spot.</p>

PARNELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person wanted to go from Rochester-row to Mr. hisicles' shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Then I think the course would be fronting the toll-house, towards Pimlico—a person coming from the south of Rochester-row to Mrs. hisicles' would come within four feet of the window, if they crossed close to the angle of the privy—there are not so many persons passing on that side of the toll-house as there are on the other—there are a good many persons pawing about; it is a thoroughfare, a good deal used, but not near the window—I think, if a person passed in a direct line from this mark south of Rochester-row to the corner of Churton-street, they would not be so near the window as that any water thrown from the window could have reached them—the window itself is but one pane of glass, and I think, at a distance of four feet, it would be difficult, out of so small a window, to throw a pint of water to do the mischief which seems to have been done; I think the water would have been distributed about, and a very small portion would have reached him.</p>

I knew the deceased—on 22nd July I was standing on the pave<lb/>ment, by Mr. hisicles, the baker's, and saw young Towers walking along in the road, with another little boy, catching hold of his hand—they were walking towards the pavement, not towards me, but the other way, towards his own house—as he came by the toll-house, some water came out of the window, and went right down his back—I looked at the window, and saw the prisoner there—the boy screamed out—he was taken into Mrs. hisicles' shop</p>

I was on duty in Vauxhall-bridge-road—I heard the child scream, and went to him immediately—he was then in the road, about ten yards from the toll-house, screaming and dancing—a female took him into Mr. hisicles' shop—the prisoner came out of the toll-home, and informed me that he had been washing a basin out with some hot water out of the kettle, and that he threw it out at the back window, and it accident<lb/>ally went over the child—I took the child home, and then went back to the prisoner, and told him how badly the child had been scalded—he said he was very sorry, it was quite an accident, and he was quite willing to pay all reasonable expenses—my beat is in Vauxhall-bridge-road, and I know this place well—a great many persons are in the habit of passing across the road there, both at the back and front of the toll-house—they are in the habit of passing as close to the back of the toll-house as they can, in passing to Churton-street from Rochester-row—the rubhish at the back does not hinder them from passing—the toll-house is about eight or ten feet square, and at the back of it there is a small angle of about half that size—in going to Churton-street they would have to pass away from that line; if they an coming from Vauxhall-bridge way, they have to cross right close up in the corner, within a yard of it—persons are in the habit of passing within a yard of it—I have seen children playing on the bars, and at the back of the toll-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living in Regent-street, Westminster. On the afternoon of 22nd July I was called to the deceased, who I found in bed at his father's—he was suffering from a very extensive scald, covering the whole of the neck and back, in fact the whole of the body, except the arms and legs—the child suffered very severely, and, I consider, was never out of danger till its death—very extensive sloughs formed over the whole of the back, which separated about a week before death—it died from the scalding—there was nothing else to which I could attribute it—Dr. Lavies was called in—he agreed in the treatment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to Mr. William Henry Cole, of High Holborn. The prisoner was his porter—on 1st Oct., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw twenty sovereigns, and five half-sovereigns in a drawer belonging to me in the counting-house—it was Mr. Cole's money—the prisoner knew that cash was kept there—I used to pay him his wages from that drawer—at half-past five I went to tea, and left the key in the drawer—I afterwards missed the money—the prisoner had been in the house the whole day, but he was not there when I went to tea—he was let in while I was at tea—he had been a porter nearly ten years—he left that evening, and did not return—he had given no notice that he was going away—I did not see him again till he was in custody, about a fortnight ago—he had no right to go out at the lack-door—he always went out at the front, unless he had the truck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Browning. I have heard Mr. Browning's evidence; it is correct—Rooke drove the wagon—on 30th Aug., between five and six o'clock in the morning, I saw the cans—Rooke came to work about six, and about nine he took the wagon out of the yard, to the front of the premises, to have it loaded—he bad a load of five pipes of seal-oil—he helped to load the wagon, and was in it—I gave him a delivery-note for these five pipes of oil—he had not to take two cans of fine olive-oil—when goods are sent out, it is a rule that delivery-notes are to be given with them—four of those pipes were to go to Hale's Wharf, and one to Topping's Wharf—I do not know how the cans of oil got into the wagon—I gave no order for their being taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and lodge at 255, Strand, at the house of Mr. Nicholas, a tobacconist. On Saturday, 7th Sept., a short time before four o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by Mrs. Nicholas (Mr. Nicholas was absent in the country)—I went down and spoke to a policeman—I then went to the back of the premises, and waited with Thur<lb/>tell, eighty or ninety paces from the front entrance—I then went to the front entrance, opened the window of a back-room, got out on to the leads of Mr. Nicholas's house, and saw the prisoners on Mr. Wilson's house, the second house to the right towards Temple-bar—I shouted, "Look out, there are two of them!"—I was then about four yards from them—in half a minute after, they walked along the wall of the next house to ours, and dropped four feet down from Mr. Tomlinson's wall—one of them, I should say by his voice it was Charles, said to those below, "Well, we will come down"—I saw nobody below—they immediately dropped into a passage at the back of the house to the ground—it leads to some houses, but is no thoroughfare—I ran to the back, and found George in custody of a policeman, and Charles in Thurtell's charge, who was holding him by the left-hand, with a loaded pistol in his right—I tried to seize him twice—he put himself in a very menacing attitude, and said he would not move from that spot without a policeman, and threatened to knock the teeth down the throat of anybody who attempted him—I ran and found another policeman—we all went to the station.</p>

I was asleep at the top of the house about four o'clock in the morning, and was awoke by the landlady—I went down with Ryder, and remained outside with a policeman—Ryder left us and shortly after he called out, "Look out below, there's two of them!"—saw the prisoners come from Mr. Tomlinson's wall—they got down about four feet, then got down on to our roof, and dropped down into the street near us—I had a pistol; I put it to Charles's head, and threatened to shoot him if he made the least resistance—Ryder came up—Charles put himself in a fighting attitude, and said he would not go off the spot unless we had the assistance of a policeman, and he would knock the teeth down any man's throat who attempted to take him—another policeman came and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Dobree and Tomlinson, pawnbrokers and silversmiths, of 254, Strand; it is Mr. William Benham Tomlinson's dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Clement Danes; I sleep in a room at the back. On 7th Sept., I was awoke by Mrs. Tomlinson about four o'clock—I looked out at the back window, and saw two men crossing the back premises to the wall of Mr. Nicholas's house, where they dropped—I afterwards saw the prisoners in custody—I examined Mr. Tomlinson's premises about a quarter-past six—the bar of the back-parlour window had been wrested out of its place and bent—there are two bars which cross each other; they go through, and a pin is put inside—the other bar was in its original state—I had fastened the window at seven the evening before—the bar was not bent then, or the pin could not have been put in—I found the bracket of the spout removed, and a piece chipped off, as if somebody had come over there—the slides were displaced three or four feet from there—the back-parlour shutters were newly painted, and I saw the print of a dirty hand just in the middle where it clasps—that mark was not there the night before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What sort of a bar was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A quarter of an inch thick; there was a mark of the palm of a hand upon the bar, and of the fingers on the shutters—that is about six or eight yards from the front of the houses in Newcastle-court—from Mr. Tomlinson's you can look up New<lb/>castle-court, or down into Pickett-place—it was a very nice light morning—you could distinguish a person at the length of this Court—the parlour-win<lb/>dow looks into a yard which is enclosed by a wall about nineteen feet high.</p>

Elliott, the brewers, deal with us for straw—on 27th Aug. I sent three loads of straw to their brewery—I sent Wren and Brace with it in two carts, about four o'clock—I saw them leave Smith<lb/>field with it—I directed them to deliver it at Elliott's and Co., at Pimlico—it would take them about an hour to go—I saw Wren and Brace again the same evening about eight—Brace produced to me the receipt for the two loads of straw—they were worth 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load, four guineas altogether—this is the receipt—(<hi rend="italic">read—27th August,</hi> 1850, <hi rend="italic">received three loads of straw.

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Browning's, of St. John-street. On the morning of 30th Aug., I was watching in their yard for another purpose—I saw the prisoner carry a can of oil, and place it by the side of a wagon, near the centre of the yard—there was a cart which stood partly before it, and partly covered it from view—he left it there, and returned in about half an hour and took it into the turpentine warehouse—about an hour afterwards I saw the can in the turpentine warehouse—it was the only can of oil that was there—I believe it to be the same can that I saw the pri<lb/>soner bring into the yard—it had no business there—I spoke to Mr. Brown<lb/>ing about it—it turned out to be olive oil, which is never taken but by an order from Mr. William Browning—the olive oil is kept in the new warehouse—the prisoner was coming in a direction from that warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of James Browning and others. My attention was called to the can of oil by Huggins, on 30th Aug., between ten and eleven o'clock—it was a can of olive oil, containing six gallons, and worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the olive oil is kept in casks, in the new warehouse, and is never drawn out but by my orders—I did not give the prisoner orders to draw this—a can of oil had no right to be in the turpentine warehouse—I gave the prisoner into custody—he told the officer he wished to make a statement—the officer told him if he had any statement, he had better make it to his master—he said to me, "I have been trapped into this; there are others in it besides me"—I believe the can of oil was then in the counting-house, where this conversation took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is the door of the turpentine warehouse kept locked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and the key hangs by the side—to the best of my recollection, it was locked at that time—the prisoner was a porter—our warehouseman, who has the general superintendence, gave him orders—other men work under him, but they have no right to give orders—I think when I first spoke to the prisoner, I said, "Manley, we want you"—he did not say he had been told by one of the men to take the can from one place to the other—no one take olive oil without an order from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to a wine-merchant at 14, Mark-lane—I live at 1, York-terrace. On 6th Sept. the prisoner called on me in Mark-lane, at a quarter before one o'clock, with a cask of stout and a cask of ale—I gave him directions to take the ale to my residence in York-terrace—considering that he had a truck I do not think he could have gone there in less than three-quarters of an hour; it takes me half an hour to walk, if I walk fast—the prisoner returned to me about three o'clock, and he asked me where he was to take the cask of stout to that he had left with me—I said, "To Hampstead-road;" but while he was gone I had asked the cellarman to tap it for me to taste—it was not quite what I approved of; and when the prisoner came again I told him to take it back to Mr. Jones, and I would see him about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, Pratt-street, Camden-town, and am an undertaker's man. Last Saturday night, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in Victoria-street—the prisoner Williams stopped me, and asked me to go home with her—I asked her where—she said down a court in Field-lane—I asked her whereabouts—she said "Just down here, not far"—at the same time a man came up, put his left arm round my waist, struck me a blow under the ear, and ran away—I called "Police!" looked round, and saw the man running towards Field-lane—I missed my watch, seal, guard, and key—two men in private clothes, who said they were policeman, came up, arres-ted Williams, and found the watch on her—it was a silk guard, gold key and seal—I have not found them—this is my watch(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Moram appears the same size as the man, and he had a cap on—Moram had one on at the station that night.</p>

Last Saturday night, about twenty minutes-past eleven o'clock, I was standing at a post in Victoria-street—I saw Moram go across the road towards a man and woman who were standing by the rails—he put his left arm round the prosecutor's waist, struck him with his right fist at the side of the head, and ran off—there was a cry of "Police"—I went after the pri-soner, and when I got to the corner of Field-lane I was tripped up by some males and females—I then ran back, and saw Williams in custody—when I first saw Moram I was walking towards him, and was about a yard and a half, or two yards from him, and I had a good look at him, and gave Fisher a description of him—we went to several places, and at last found him standing at the corner of a narrow dark court in Fox-court, Gray's-inn-lane—the in-stant I saw him I said he was the man—Fisher arrested him, and told him the charge—he said it was a d—d lie, he had not been in Victoria-street all that day—he resisted very much—Fisher was obliged to call two more police-men before he could secure him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. In Oct. 1843, I lived at 12, Golden-lane, Cripplegate, and carried on business in the general line, a chandler's-shop—I then knew the prisoner, and had done so a couple of years; he is a servant, and was then out of place—he came to my house very frequently—in the Sept. before I had drawn 148<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, out of the Camberwell Savings-bank, to go into business—in Oct. I had a 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver, in a desk in the parlour on the ground-floor behind the shop—the desk was generally unlocked—adjoining the parlour there is a bedroom—I missed this money on a Sunday morning, having seen it safe on the Friday night—the prisoner came on the Saturday, and was in and out of the parlour most part of the day till he left—a person named Hart was there that day cleaning out the parlour and bedroom—the prisoner was in the parlour when I was not—he knew I kept money in the desk—I had never sent him there for money, but I sent him that morning to fetch a wafer, which he brought to me—about three o'clock I asked him to bring some coppers out of the bedroom, which he did, and then went to the parlour, fetched his hat, and went off directly, saying he should return in a quarter of an hour—I was at home the whole day, and he did not return—I next saw him at Moor-lane station, last month—on the Sunday morning I went to my desk to put some more money in, and missed the notes and the money—I sent Hart to Mr. John Trinnick, a friend of mine, and made known to him what had happened—I could get no information at the Savings-bank about the notes—I had not taken the numbers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Hart. Seven years ago I was lodging with Mrs. Lawrence, of 12, Golden-lane—on a Saturday in Oct., I went to clean her parlour and bedroom for her for, the first time—till that day I had not been further than the shop, to pay my rent—I never saw the prisoner before that day—I went about eight o'clock in the morning—he was then in the parlour—after dinner I was cleaning knives in the parlour—he asked me if it would make any difference to me if I cleaned the bedroom first</p>

               <p>instead of the parlour—I said it would not be so convenient, but if he wished it I would do so, and did so in consequence—when I left the parlour the desk was on the table, on the right side of the parlour—I do not know whether it was locked or not; it was very small, and I thought it was a workbox—I did what was necessary in the bedroom—I was there an hour, more or less—I was in and out of the parlour during the time—I fetched the prisoner a pint of half-and-half, and he sat drinking it and smoking his pipe—when I had finished in the bedroom I went to the parlour and saw the prisoner at the desk—he took something out and went into the bedroom—he stood with his back towards me, and I saw him empty some money out of a piece of brown sugar paper, and put it into his left-hand trowsers pocket—I saw gold in his hand—he then turned round to the desk, put in the empty paper and took out another piece of paper—he went into the bedroom, and I distinctly saw him folding two pieces of paper exactly the size of bank-notes, which had figures and letters on them—he put them into his right-hand trowsers pocket—Mrs. Lawrence then called him to bring a few coppers, as she was paying the baker in the shop at the time—he took her the coppers, which he got from a basket under the drawers in the bedroom, and went into the shop—he then returned to the bedroom, searched for something, which he did not seem to find, returned into the parlour, took up his hat, and went out, stating to Mrs. Lawrence, in the shop, that he would be back in a quarter of an hour, as he was going to the landlord about some alterations that were to be made—I did not see him again till he was in custody at Guildhall—I said nothing to Mrs. Lawrence about what I had seen—on the Sunday morning she sent me to Mr. Trinnick, of Elm-street, Gray's-inn-lane—he came, and I then heard her complain about the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you saw him going out, did not you say, "Why, Mr. Clayton has been at your desk and got a lot of your money?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because she had sent him to it for wafers—I was not in the parlour by myself that morning—Clayton was only in the bedroom doorway—I was cleaning knives—of course he saw me—he did not go out till three in the afternoon—I was there the whole time till nine at night—Mr. Trinnick came about three on the Sunday—I did not know of the loss at twelve o'clock—I knew there was something the matter with Mrs. Lawrence; she was crying—I mentioned to my husband on the Saturday night that there had been a man there and taken some money out of the desk—on the Saturday night I said to Mrs. Lawrence, that Clayton was a long time, she remarked, no doubt he had been drinking as he was tipsy the night before—I do not know that I was suspected at all—nothing was ever said to me about it—my husband is a bricklayer—I was married at that time, and have been ten years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Thomas Green—he keeps the George and Dragon, High-street, Woolwich—the prisoner had been in my service about six or seven weeks. On 12th Aug. I went out about seven o'clock, and came back about eleven—the prisoner was there when I went away—I had no idea that she was about to leave—there had been no warning on either side, but when I came back she was gone—I missed two dresses, a dress-pin, a finger-ring, some silk, and other things—the dresses were safe the week before—the bracelets were safe when I left home that evening—the other things were safe when she came to the house—on 24th the prisoner was brought by my father into the bar, and my husband said she had done a pretty thing for herself—she said, "So help me God! I have never seen the things; I know nothing about them"—she said she was willing to pay, but she could not pay all at once—I sent for Mrs. Poole, and I said to her, "Is this the person that brought you the silk to be made into a bonnet?"—she said, "Yes"—the prisoner again denied it, and I gave her in charge—she was searched at the police-station, and she had on a petticoat and a pair of gloves of mine—these are my property, and what I missed—the bracelets have not been found.</p>

               <p>in Feb.—he came to my house with a female and had supper—I cut their suppers, and then went into the Green Dragon next door—I had only been there a few minutes, when my waiter came in and said, "Here is a gentleman wants to speak to you about taking the house"—I went in, and Saunders said, "I have been speaking to your waiter about taking your house; I have dined at your place a good many times, and I know it is a good one"—he said he knew an old gentleman who had a nephew in the country, and wanted to take a business of that description, would I object to disposing of it—I said I had no objection, provided I could get my price—he asked what I wanted—I said 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Well, I don't consider that at all out of the way, and I will bring the old gentleman next day"—he said the nephew had come into 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and was about getting married, but he would come next day, Saturday, and bring the old gentleman to settle the business—I had never seen the prisoner at my house before; he never dined there, to my knowledge—he came next day, with a man named Anderson, who has been tried—I was very busy, and asked them to walk up-stairs, and my waiter attended to them—in about half an hour Anderson came down, and said he wished to speak to me about taking the house for his nephew—I said it was impossible I could speak to them then, I would in half an hour; they had better come back again here—they said, "No, we will meet you at some house"—I said the most convenient place was next door, the Green Dragon—I went, and he asked me all the particulars about the business—I asked 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and the prisoner said I was to give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if his friend took it for his nephew—they both said that the young man had come into 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he lived at Dover—I said he had better bring the nephew there, to satisfy himself about it—Anderson said, "Oh, it rests with me and his aunt; be is but a youngster"—an appointment was made for the Monday following, at the Albion, at four o'clock—I went, and Saunders came after I had been there about a quarter of an hour—he said he hoped he had not kept me waiting, he had had a letter from his friend, which he pro<lb/>duced—I said, "I suppose, then, it is all knocked on the head; they have declined"—he said, "No, it is all right"—he read the letter to me, but he would not let me read it, or handle the letter—the letter was, "Dover,—Dear Uncle, I received yours of," a certain day, I cannot exactly recollect now, "and I am glad to think you have taken a house for me in London; there is no business I should like better than an eating-house; it is impossible for me to be up by this morning's train, but I will be with you to<lb/>morrow afternoon, by the three o'clock train. I have spoken to my intended, Miss Watson, on the matter, and she approves of it very much. I remain, Dear Uncle, yours etc."—that was the letter, as near as I can recollect—as soon as he had put it into his pocket, I saw Anderson looking through the window—I said, "Dear me, there is your friend"—he said, "Oh, that is impossible, I have just left his house"—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said a few doors from the Bricklayers' Arms"—I said, "What is he?"—he said, "A cigar<lb/>merchant"—I said, "He must have been very fast after you"—Anderson then came in and joined us—he said to Saunders, "Dear me, as soon as I sent you out of the house with the letter, my niece came up by the last train from Dover, and I expect my nephew up by the seven o'clock train; they are up buying the wedding-dress; it is no use our stopping here any longer, we will meet here this evening, at seven o'clock"—I went and found Anderson there alone, smoking his pipe, and having a pint of half-and-half—in about half an hour the prisoner came in with another man, and after them a man pretending to be drunk, and another man who pretended to be <hi rend="italic">disinterested</hi> with him, but they both sat at the same table—I thought the man was drunk at the time—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185009160090"/>
               <p>talked a parcel of nonsense—he first addressed his conversation to Anderson about throwing a heavy weight—Anderson laughed at him, and told him to mind his own business, but he dare say he could find a person to throw as heavy a weight as him, meaning Saunders—I know he meant Saunders, because he was sitting alongside of him at the time—I told the man to mind his own business, and told Saunders to take no notice of him—Saun<lb/>ders said he could throw as heavy a weight as he could—the man pulled out some sovereigns, and said he had been selling some cows at Smithfield-market for his mother—Anderson said it was near nine o'clock and his wife ought to have been there, to let him know whether his nephew had arrived or not, therefore he must go; because if she was not there at that time, she was to be at the Surrey Theatre; and he said, "We will go down there together"—we went—the drunken man, and the other with him, left first—we went out immediately after—they went across the road, and I lost sight of them for a time—Saunders, Anderson, and the man that came into the Albion with Saunders, left with me—we walked down to the Surrey Theatre, and Anderson pretended to go and see whether his wife had come—his wife was not there, and we adjourned to a beer-shop, named the Flying-horse, kept by Dickenson, in the Webber-road—when I went in, I said, "This is not a place for us to meet, let us go to some respectable house"—we went to the bar, and there I saw the drunken man and the other standing—the drunken man was leaning over the counter; and the landlord came round, and said, "The ground is ready for you now, gentlemen; you can go in and do as you like with it;" and I saw eight or nine persons come out of the skittle-ground—I did not like to go in; but Anderson said, "Come in; I don't like to see my friend challenged, and not to accept it"—we went in, six of us altogether, with myself—there was no one else in the ground but the landlord; he brought in two pots of ale, and said, "I shall not allow anybody else to come in the ground while you are here"—I do not know who paid for the ale—I did not see it paid for—no other drink was brought in—when we were in the skittle-ground, the door was closed, I cannot say whether it was fastened—they began to play—they had some chucks for several sovereigns—Saunders and the drunken man tried the weight of the ball—they played for money—I saw 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pass—the drunken man lost a great deal; and Saunders said, "You may as well go in and have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as well as us; he has been and sold his cows, and you may as well have his money as us"—I said no, if I did play with a man, it should be when he was sober, and he should have as good a chance as myself; therefore I did not go in with them—I did not play at all—while the play was going on, I was sitting on a stool on the left side of the ground—one or two of the persons sat on the stool by me at different times—I think the man that came along with the drunken man sat alongside of me once or twice, and Saunders, and I think the man that came in along with Saunders—I had a green silk purse, containing 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a gold Spanish piece—I think the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was eleven sovereigns, and four half-sovereigns—at the end of the playing they <hi rend="italic">kicked</hi> up a dispute about cheating: Saunders, the drunken man, and the other one—they got pushing one another against me as I was sitting on the form—I got up several times, and pushed them away—they trod on my toes, and as I got up they were all round me once or twice—I was rather exasperated; and the last time I fancied I saw, in fact I did see, my purse in Saunders's hand—that was while they were all round me—I saw Saunders close to me—whether he took the purse out of my pocket, or not, I cannot say—it had been safe in my right-hand pocket a quarter of an hour before—I am certain it was taken from me during the scuffle—I put</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185009160091"/>
               <p>my hand into my pocket, and said, "Halloo, you have got my purse out of my pocket!"—I said that to all of them; they could all hear—Saunders was perhaps about a yard from them—two of them then fell down, and some money fell out, and two or three of them fell down on the other side of the ground; and the man who came in along with Saunders at the Albion, stood before me and said, "For God's sake, don't talk like that," or something to that effect; "I would not be known to be in such a concern as this for the world, for I hold a responsible situation in the City;" and he kept me back, and said "I know the man that I came in with very well; I will take you to him"—while he was doing this, the others all went out; Saunders among the rest—they all went out, one after another—the drunken man went out with his coat on his arm—I did not see any of them stopped as they went out—I came out along with the other man, and went to a public-house in the Black friars-road—I saw Saunders again, I think on the Friday following—I gave information to the police, I think the week following—I first went to the City-police in my own neighbourhood—I afterwards went with the police to the skittle-ground, and there I found my purse, behind the frame, at the end of the skittle-ground—I do not know how long that was after this occurrence—I do not think it was the same week—I can speak to the purse, I believe one of my children netted it for me—there was a piece of paper in it when I found it, which had been written by Anderson in the public-house—this is it, it is "Meet me at four o'clock."</p>

BALLANTTNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You could see the purse in Saunders' hand perfectly well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not make a catch at it—I should have done so if I had not been stopped by one of their confederates—the man that came in with Saunders stood before me with a stick—I was making my way towards Saunders, to get my purse—the man was alongside of the others, and turned round, and stood before me; and with that all of them got away—I called out, "That is my purse"—I do not know the name of the man that had the stick; he remained behind—I did not give him into custody, because he said he knew where to take me to—he did not use the sick—he had it on his shoulder, or rather in his mouth—he might have hurt me with the stick if he had liked, and I have not the least doubt that was his intention—I did not expect it then; but he got first on one side of me, and then on the other, to prevent me getting out—it was quite evident he was enabling the others to get my purse—I was foolish to walk about with him afterwards, but I did it because he said he could take me where the man was—Anderson was tried, I think, about a week or a fortnight afterwards—I forget whether I told the landlord that Saunders had robbed me—I ought to have done so I dare say, but I did not—I gave this man that stopped with me my address, I thought be was a respectable young man—I did not think at that time that he was preventing me from getting my purse, or I should have given him into custody—after I had been to the landlord, Saunders came to me with a policeman—I suppose it must have been a week or a fortnight afterwards—he did not say, "What do you mean by spreading "about that I robbed you?"—I do not think he used any words to that effect—I cannot swear that he did not—he said, when he came in, to the best of my recollection, that I had said I had been robbed at the public-house, and I said I had been so—he then said, "Why you lost your money by betting"—I did not say, "I did not lose it, I was robbed;" nor did he say, "You scoundrel, who robbed you?"—he did not call me a scoundrel—I cannot swear whether he did or not—I told him that he was there, and that I saw my Purse in his hand—he said, "Give me into custody," and I said, "I will do so now, for I have been after you many days"—he was taken to the South-wark</p>

               <p>police-court, and I told my story—I said there that I saw my pruse in his hand—I swear that—very likely it might not have been taken down—the prisoner was let out on bail, brought up on the Monday following, and then discharged—that was by a different Magistrate—I then indicted him, but not till Anderson was taken—he has surrendered to-day—I do not know what day it was that I found my purse—I did not, when I was first examined on this subject, say that I had found it on the following day—I do not think I did—I cannot say positively—I have not sold my eating-house, I have got it on hand now.</p>

On 1st March I saw the prisoner at the Tower-street station—he was taken before the Magistrate that day, remanded, and afterwards discharged. On Wednesday, 27th March, I first saw Mr. Alldis—on the Friday I went with him to the Flying Horse, Webber-street, Blackfriars-road—we went into the skittle-ground—he said, "Look here!" and called my attention to a hole between two pieces of wood, put to prevent the ball from striking the wall—he put his fingers in and drew this purse out (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found only this piece of paper in it—on the Wednesday, Mr. Alldis had given me two pieces of a broken ring which cor<lb/>respond with the one in the purse.</p>

On Friday morning, 23rd Aug., between two and three o'clock, I was near Folly-bridge, Dockhead, and hearing a dog bark at the back of the prosecutor's premises, I went into the adjoining yard, and saw two persons—one was attempting to escape over the wall, and the other, who was the prisoner, was assisting him over—I asked what business they bad there—they said they came there to sleep in a cart—there were several carts in the yard—I took them into custody but the other got away—I kept the prisoner, and took him to the station—I found on him some tobacco loose in his pocket, a tobacco-pouch, 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, a comb, and a quantity of lucifer matches.</p>

About half-past six o'clock on the morning of the 23rd, I received information from Mr. Clark, and examined his premises—they had been entered by the back-parlour window—I saw marks on the wall where persons had got over—I fonnd this cruet-stand on the adjoining premises in the corner of the yard close by where I saw the marks—I have found the snuffer-tray, and half a pound of tobacco.</p>

On 4th Sept., about ten minutes past nine o'clock in the morning, I was called to see the deceased at No. 5, New-alley, White-street—I found her dying—I examined her body after death—I found a bruise under the right eye, and immediately within the private parts I found a laceration of the skin, where a large quantity of blood had collected—the skin had given way to the extent of one inch, and immediately under the skin a large vein was torn, the pressure of the blood which poured from that vein had broken the skin.—the rupture of that vein was the cause of death—she was in a state of pregnancy; I should say between the seventh and eighth month—the rupture of the vein might have occurred either from external violence, such as falling against any sharp object, or a blow or kick, or it might have occurred during a violent struggle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, in the employment of Charles James Saunders, and another, of Collingwood-street, Blackfriars. It was my duty to take money to the bank every morning—my time of doing so varied from half-past nine o'clock to between ten and eleven—I had been in the habit of taking money to the bank every morning prior to 15th Aug.—the bank was the Southwark Branch of the London and Westminster Bank, in Wellington-street, London-bridge—I am generally in the habit of going one way—I go through a passage near St. Saviour's Dock, by St. Saviour's Church, close by the Borough-market—on the morning of 15th Aug. I started from Collingwood-street, I think about half-past nine—I had with me 357<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., consisting of Bank of England notes, gold, and silver—there was one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note I know, which I had taken myself the day before, seven "fives," I think, and 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, in half-crowns, shillings, &amp;c.—there was upwards of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns—I think I had the money in my hand—I sometimes carried it over my shoulder when I had a heavier amount—it was in a bag—I very often have a heavy weight, upwards of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—nothing happened to me on my way until I got to the passage near St. Saviour's-dock—I then saw a man standing against the door at the end of Church-passage—it is a very small passage, which goes under a house, with a door at one end, near the Church—that door is fastened back to the wall in the daytime, with a hook—I saw the man unhook the door, and fasten it to a staple, which would close the door—I could not swear to that man—it was neither of the prisoners—I put out my hand to try to pass when I had got quite close to him, and he gave me a blow, which was evidently intended to hit me on the head—it did not hit my head, but it struck my hat—immedi<lb/>ately upon that my hat was knocked over my eyes, and they tripped me up from behind—I turned round, and saw two men standing—I was then on the ground—those two men used every effort to get the money—I clung to it as long as I could—they kicked me, and one fell upon my chest—I called, "Murder!" as loud as I could call—they got the money from me; and as soon as they got it, they ran—I could plainly see the bag in the prisoner Archer's possession—I swear positively that Archer is one of the men—I could not swear to the other—there were two men behind me, and Archer is the man who took the bag—I have a belief as to Davis being the other man—</p>

               <p>I saw him among a number of prisoners at the Southwark police-court, and picked him out as the man who I believed, from his general appearance, was the man who was in company with Archer that morning—I will not under<lb/>take to swear positively to him—I got up, and followed Archer, crying, "Stop thief!"—I did not notice where the other men went; I kept my attention on the bag of money—Archer ran in a direction towards Bankside, and came to a flour-mill there, where a lot of men were stationed outside—I called, "Stop thief," and begged them to stop him—they put out their arms to stop him, and he ran in a direction as though he was coming to the passage again—I stood at the end of the passage—he appeared to be coming right at me, but he took a different direction, and ran down a street at the back of the passage—I still followed him into a court where there is no thoroughfare, and he then ran into a house—some gentleman, who is not here, ran in, and seized him—I saw him seize him—I got up before him—Archer was standing, looking round, as if he was about to make for the stairs; but there was some one I believe on the stairs, and he stood there—I ran up to him, and said, "Now, you wretch, give me that bag," and he handed it over to me—it contained the money—he was then given into custody—I think it was on the Thursday after, that I saw Davis—I had never seen either of the pri<lb/>soners before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruit-salesman, in the Borough-market. On the morning of 15th Aug., a little before ten o'clock, I was passing St. Mary Overy dock, in the direction from Southwark towards Blackfriars-bridge, and when I got about the middle of the passage, underneath the archway, I saw three men coming towards me, Archer, Davis, and another man—the passage is very narrow, and I stood on one side to allow them to pass, thinking they, were coming through, but they did not—they came up to the end of the pas<lb/>sage—Archer stationed himself nearest to me on the footpath—Davis placed himself underneath the loophole of the warehouse, exactly facing Archer—the third person placed his back towards the river, but each with their faces directed towards Blackfriars-bridge, the way they came from—I looked very hard at them, and as I passed, Archer said to Davis, "Here he comes!" and looked up towards Bankside—I particularly noticed the faces of these two—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185009160099"/>
               <p>Davis had his eyes on the ground, and when Archer spoke to him he looked up and looked that way—this could not have occupied more than a minute—I passed them, and went on fifteen or twenty feet further—I then heard a cry of "Stop thief! murder!"—I had gone into a water-closet, which is there for the use of the clerks of the wharf—I kept on the alert more than I should have done, having noticed these three men there—when I heard the cry I came out, and the moment I came out Archer had got a blue bag in his hand, and was making away as fast as he could—the prosecutor was crying out "Murder! stop thief! he has got my money," or something of that sort—exactly facing me, and behind him, was Davis and the other man together—I said, "You scoundrels, you are both of you engaged in this robbery, as well as he"—they all three ran—I followed Archer, and never lost sight of him till he gave the bag into Mr. Greenland's hands—I saw Davis about a week after at the police-station—there was no other person there but the policemen—I have no hesitation in swearing, that Davis is the man I addressed, when I said, "You two scoundrels are connected in this robbery."</p>

(I had seen him before)—he said he would see me b—before he would go to the station, and began to be very violent—I was sent on my back in the gutter, and the other two on the top of me—I received several kicks from the prisoner, and he struck me several times—I got up, and saw him strike Sergeant Jones with a life-preserver twice, the last time was over the eye—he ran away, brandishing the life-preserver—I saw blood running down Jones's face—I ran after the prisoner—he knocked me down senseless with the life-preserver, and got away.</p>

R.," and "B.
