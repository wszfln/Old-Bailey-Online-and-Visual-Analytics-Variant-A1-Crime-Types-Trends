I am servant to Mr. Kirby, I have known the prisoner 20 years, he came over from Antegoa at the same time as I came over with my master; I asked him to dine with me, and it is a very hard thing if a man asks a person to eat a bit of victuals, that he must steal a silver spoon.

             . I lost a silver tankard the 13th of March, and on the 14th it was brought to my house . I don't know that the Prisoner took it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sellon . I keep a goldsmith's shop in the Borough of Southwark. On the 14th of March last, the Prisoner came to buy a pair of silver buckles , and asked me, if I would take silver in exchange , and pulled out this piece of a tankard [ The body of the tankard was produced without lid or bottom. ] This appearing so very suspicious, I asked him his name, where he lived, and how he came by it ; he said, he bought it of a man for two guinea and an half. I sent for a constable, and carried him before Justice Lacey, who committed him for further examination, because he would not confess any thing: but when he was in goal, he sent to his brother and he brought Mrs. Burgess, and she owned the tankard.</p>

               <p>Ashfield. I said I would have nothing to do with it. He put it into my hand, and said, I should have it for three pounds. I said again I would have nothing to do with it; but he left it with me.</p>

             (a waterman.) I was at Mrs. Udall's about twelve o'clock that night, the prisoner was there, and lay with his head upon the table. The maid came and took hold of the tankard to put it upon the fire; he said, that is my beer ; the maid said, do you belong to the brewers; he said, yes, and I saw him lay his hand upon the tankard. Then I was called away to go with a fare, and saw no more.</p>

            . The Justice came to Mrs. Ashfield's house, and the prisoner struggled with me and collared me in the presence of the Justice, and I was almost strangled . He took hold of these tormenters. [A flesh fork, used in taking meat out of a pot, was produced] The prisoner jobbed this at the Justice's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174504240005"/> throat, and if he had happened to have hit him with it, it would have killed him. Then we overpowered him, and he said if the Justice would let him sit down, he would not oppose him any more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going down to the water side to work, and found this tankard by the side of some sugar hogsheads. I saw the handle of a tankard, so I took it and buried it in a dunghill; and the next day I went to my landlady Mrs. Ashfield , and told her I had found a silver tankard; said I, shall I cry it or keep it. She said, what occasion have you to cry it, as you found it, keep it . And then I went and fetched it out of the dunghill, gave it to my landlady, and she put it under her bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been concerned with him before?</p>
               <p>Uptebake . Only in selling brass rings, no farther. When we met him, we desired him to take a walk with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know what you were going upon?</p>
               <p>Uptebake . I don't know that he did. As we came by Mr. Thompson's house (just by Oxford Chapel) we saw the door upon a jar; Leekey went in first , and Robinson followed him in, with a candle he had in a dark lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Uptebake. Between 8 and 9 at night Leekey came out with a bundle of wearing apparel up to his chin, and he let them tumble in the street. Leekey made use of some bitter imprecations; and made Graham [the prisoner] take them up in his apron: and we carried them to one

               <p>Q. How did you divide the money?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174504240006"/>Uptebake. Between Leekey, Robinson and I.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any part of the money?</p>
               <p>Uptebake. I believe not; I believe he had a pair of silver shoe buckles and knee buckles, that Leekey concealed. I know Leekey and he had some difference about them (we did not know that Leekey had concealed them, till we saw the advertisement ) and they were going to fight about them, at Mr. Bradbury's, the Black Horse in Church Lane St. Giles's; Graham said to Leekey had cheated him in pawning the shoe buckles and knee buckles; and Leekey said , that then he was even with him, for Graham had cheated him of money, in selling brass rings for gold ones, in not giving him so much of the money as belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Graham off when the house was robbed ?</p>
               <p>Uptebake . I believe he was twice as far as the length of this court.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be so far off?</p>
               <p>Uptebake. I believe he did not know what * enterprise we were going out upon.</p>
               <p>* Uptebake in the information he made before justice Poulson differs very much from what he swars now: for there he says, they agreed to go out together, and met for that purpose, and that the prisoner had part of the goods, and part of the money, which amounted to three or four pounds a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how could he expect any part of the buckles?</p>
               <p>Uptebake . I am convinced in my mind, he had only a part of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had you any design to put me into your information, till you was desired to do it by the high constable ?</p>
               <p>Uptebake . I did not know there was any occasion to do it upon such trifling affairs, because, I believe he did not know at first what we were going about; afterwards I was informed that the prisoner was the principal instrument of my being taken up, then I put him into my information - He never committed any other robbery with me but this. <rs id="t17450424-9-verdict49" type="verdictDescription">

I said I was robbed of my ring; she said, there is no body here that will hurt you; she told me my hat sell off my head, and she had taken it up, and put it into the closet; I said, I believe you have my ring; she said, she knew nothing of it. There was a drummer there, (not in soldiers clothes, but in a drummer's habit) and he said, he believed no body there would take away my ring. Finding I was in a bad house, I was not willing to make a noise, but went away; I went into the Butcher Row by Temple Bar, and staid till between eight and nine, then I went to the cellar again , there was one

I cannot but say the prisoner was very impertinent in her way; I will say nothing but what is true, did not I offer you what was very fair, did not I offer to give you a crown? I said, if the ring was pawned, I would give her a crown, besides what the ring is pawned for, and she d - n'd her poor eyes, and said she knew nothing of the ring.</p>

I was called up by these two neighbours, on the 4th of March at twelve o'clock at night, and they had got the prisoner lying upon his back in the yard. There were seven hens killed, one cock, and four ducks; they were lying in a bag a little way from the road. The prisoner said he would have killed them all, if he had not been disturbed; he said there was another with him, and owned he held the bag while the fowls were killing.</p>

I saw the prisoner and another man come out of Mr. Smith's hen-house. I took hold of the prisoner with one hand, and had my gun in the other. He pulled at it several times, but could not get it out of my hand. One got away, and I threw the prisoner upon his back in the snow.

            . I had been to buy a beast, and saw Keep and Kingsland together at the Rose and Star in Mill yard, Goodman's-fields. Keep said, won't you drink with me; I sat down and we had two tankards of beer. I happened to see Stone at work; he had killed four of those sheep, so I lent him a hand, and killed ten of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Keep?</p>
               <p>Scales. He was a clay carter. I always took him to be an honest man.</p>

               <p>Q. What business are you?</p>
               <p>James, I am a trumpet - I have been in the King's service, but I am not now. - I was going to pay some money to the woman at the Adam and Eve at Pancras. The prisoner said he wanted my money; I said I had none for my self, nor he neither. (I had 3 s. 6 d. in my pocket, and was going to pay half a crown away) He struck at me with a bag, jumped upon me, and seized me. He pulled and hawled me, and tore all my clothes. I bid him let me alone, for he should get no good of me. And he said, you black son of a b - h I'll be revenged on you, and finding he could get no good of me, he let me go, and went away. Then he came back, and attacked me again, laid hold of me, and said, you are not gone yet; but he soon let go his hold and run. There happened to be a gentleman and his lady in the church-yard ; the gentleman said he saw all the action, and advised me to get an officer to take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he strike at you with?</p>
               <p>James. He struck at me with a bag with an empty cag in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he struck at you?</p>
               <p>James. He demanded my money. I had a young woman with me, and she bid him be easy; and he struck at her, and knocked her down upon her back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know that ever I saw him in my life. Ask him what I had to strike the gentlewoman down with.</p>
               <p>James. He struck her down with his fist, but he struck me with the cag, and stripped himself naked to fight me, at the second attack; and when he ran away, I followed him, and took him - the prisoner was not drunk.</p>

            . I live in Monmouth Street, I deal in clothes; I was coming from the barber's between 9 and 10 in the morning - about five or six weeks ago; and Mr. Fraser (one who keeps an oil shop, and a man of as good a character as any man in the parish) called to me, and said, Mr. Foster will you buy any cloth (this is the cloth that I bought of the prisoner at the bar) said I, this is the wrong season of the year for such cloths as these (they are kerseys or narrow cloths) but I bought them of the prisoner outright; for Mr Fraser is his brother-in-law. He said he was a book-keeper 13 or 14 years at the Green Dragon in Bishopsgate street; and 3 or 4 years a ticket-porter. Just as he had told me the price of the cloths, Mr. Lamb came in, and said, don't buy those cloths, for I have had the price of them already, and I am willing to have them, as they are come honestly by. This made some words between Mr. Lamb and I, but we agreed to divide them, he had two pieces, and I two pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there another man in the shop who owned that the cloths were his?</p>
               <p>Bragg. There was another man in the shop, whether he was with him or not, I cannot say, but he did not say any thing about the cloths. I thought I bought them as fair as ever I bought any thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say how he came by them?</p>
               <p>Foster. He said he bought them of an hostler at an inn (I believe it was the Three Cups in Bread street) but it was the inn he said he was porter at.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my house with these cloths, and asked me how I did; I said, pretty well. He laid the cloths down upon the counter, and said he wanted to sell them for a person who had a friend dead in the country; and they were sent up to sell to raise a sum of money. And he wanted to sell them that afternoon. I sent for Mr. Lamb, and he looked at them. Mr. Foster came by the door at the same time. Said I, you may look upon these cloths, for you are a good judge of cloths; so Mr. Foster and Mr. Lamb bought them, and had each of them 2 pieces. He was a porter at the Green Dragon in Bishopsgate gate street.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not he been thought for some time past to be out of his senses?</p>
               <p>Fraser . Yes, he has, he has been at my house till 12 o'clock at night, and I could not ge t him out, and he would ramble into a parcel of nonsense. He has wandered up and down, and the watchmen have taken him to be a sort of a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time when he came to your house, take him to be out of his senses?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174504240013"/>Fraser. He has gone backward and forward with his words, that there was no notice to be taken of him.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had thought him disordered in his senses at that time he brought these cloths to your house, would you have advised these gentlemen to have bought them?</p>
               <p>Fraser . No. But at that time he spoke very well. And if I had thought they had been stolen, I would not have advised them to have bought them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lamb. I was sent for by Mr. Fraser , and he told me the prisoner was a brother-in-law of his, and had got 4 pieces of cloth to sell. The prisoner said the maker was dead in the country; and that they were sent up to be sold, because they wanted money, and he was to sell them for half a crown a yard, for ready money [exactly half the price they are laid at in the indictment] I took a pattern to show to a friend who is a very large dealer in cloths, to know whether they were a bargain or not, which I found they were. When I came back, Mr. Foster was there; I said, I was the first person spoke to about them: but Mr. Foster insisting upon part, he had two, and I two. I sold my two pieces in a day or two, for six pence a yard profit.</p>

             . I keep the Bell Inn in Woodstreet. I ordered my chamberlain to go to the Three Cups in Bread street, for a truss that was directed by Mr. Bragg, the maker of these cloths, to be left there till called for. And the cloths were brought to my house; they were sent to one Mr. Jarvis, who is agent for Mr. Bragg, and puts up his goods there. The truss was missing, and I enquired after it; my chamberlain told me the prisoner had taken it away: said I, what business has he to take it away? The prisoner was then absent; but he returned again in about ten days time. Said I, George, let me speak to you; what have you done with the little truss of cloth that was here? said he, the right owner came for it, and I have given it to the right owner. He said, the man that brought it, ordered him to carry it away; and he met with a carter who took it quite away. Said I, sure it must be carried to some inn: he said, he could not tell where it was carried to.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he done business at your house?</p>
               <p>Whaley . He has been a porter at my house about three years. He was porter to most of the ironmongers. When he came before the Justice, he said that he took the truss to Temple Bar, and then went to Monmouth street to sell it: that he disposed of it there, and had half a crown for his labour.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not he apt to be disordered in his senses, and he absent from his business sometimes?</p>
               <p>Whaley . I believe he would get now and then drunk with gin; and then he would absent him self two or three days, and say he was ill, and had got the cholick and gripes.</p>

            . On the 27th of February the prisoner at the bar came up into the gallery at the Bell Inn in Woodstreet; went into one of the rooms in the gallery, and took out a truss of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the gallery any ways locked up with the house?</p>

               <p>Richards . It was lodged in one of the rooms in the gallery, which has been a lodging room. He said, Mr. Richards, I should be obliged to you if you would help me up with this cloth. I asked him where he was going to take it; he told me he was taking it to the right owner's in the Strand.

            , And please you, my lord, I am come to speak in my neighbour's behalf. The prisoner at the bar at times is not in his senses, he has been forced to be confined in his bed, and sometimes he has been absent from his family for a week or fortnight together.</p>
               <p>- Patrick. I have known the prisoner a great many years; and as to his lunacy, he has been so six or seven years. Sometimes I was afraid he would go out of his senses. I think it was occasioned by the fire at the White Swan, at Holborn bridge. Some goods were lost there, which was the occasion of his brains being turned.</p>
               <p>Jury, to Mr. Fraser. You say you have seen him to be disordered in his senses sometimes?</p>
               <p>Fraser. He has been so in my sister's time, and has not gone home for a whole eight days.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your opinion as to the condition he was in when he was at your house with the cloths?</p>
               <p>Fraser. I did not look in his face, but he spoke very well.</p>
               <p>Jury. Mr. Lamb, how was he when you bought the goods of him?</p>

I got a search warrant, and found part of my clothes at Mr. Smith's, a salesman in Monmouth street. There was a cloth coat, a cloth waistcoat, a velvet waistcoat, and two shirts. These are the clothes, the remainder of the things Mr. Smith had sold; but he could not tell who he had sold them to, for he had sold them to different people, who came to his shop. Mr. Smith had taken the ruffles off these two shirts, because he intended them for his own use.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did you doubt his honesty when you turned him away?</p>
               <p>Fox. No; but he was given to drinking, so that he would be absent for three or four days together, and would get so drunk that they would turn him out of gin shops at three or four in the morning. He confessed before Justice Poulson, that he sold the clothes, and was employed by a person unknown to sell them. That he was employed to carry them into Holborn, and the next day to carry them into Monmouth street to sell them. When he was before the Justice, there was a paper of accounts, and a pair of knee-buckles found upon him, which I could swear were in the trunk.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you mind whether his trunk was safe?</p>
               <p>Elton. It was safe .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the door?</p>
               <p>Elton. I turned the key, but I can't pretend to say the door was locked. When I came up stairs between nine and ten in order to go to bed, I found the door unlockt, which surprised me very much. I asked the chamberlain if any body had been there, he said no body at all; I told him Mr. Fox's room, (the room which I was in possessession of,) was broke open. The prisoner gave such a slender account of the cloths which he had sold before, that I suspected him; I went on Wednesday night to take him, but could not; and on Thursday about six o'clock in the morning, I took him in bed, he broke from us in Chiswell street, and we took him again, and carried him before Justice Poulson . There was found upon him this pair of steel knee-buckles, which I believe are Mr. Fox's , and this paper of accounts, which is my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Fox . These are my knee-buckles, this is my paper, which was in the box, and his receipt is upon it which he gave me, when I paid him off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner had been about the house that night?</p>
               <p>Elton . I saw him at six o'clock in the evening, I did not see him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. On Wednesday the 13th or 14th of March, the prisoner brought some wearing apparel into my shop; and said, he had got some to sell: they were in a box tied round with a rope, I took them out of the box, and asked him how he came by them; he said, they belonged to a young gentleman that was dead, and the old gentleman the father was willing to sell them, and desired him to take them away, for they made him cry when he saw them: he said, he had been three weeks selling cloths and shalloons for the old gentleman, and these were the last of the things; upon which I bought them and paid him for them?</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay him for them?</p>
               <p>Smith. I paid him 4 l. 8 s. I believe I paid him 4 l. 12 s. but I am positive to 4 l. 8 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner's the person you bought them of?</p>
               <p>Smith. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met a tallish man with them upon his shoulder, and he asked me what I must have to carry them into Holborn; and he gave me a shilling to carry them to the Crooked Fish in Holborn; he bid me come again, and then he ordered me to sell them for what I could get. <rs id="t17450424-19-verdict119" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Wood. She forced me to do it, she used to beat me very much.</p>

               <p>Wood. She burnt the coals.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do with the napkins?</p>
               <p>Wood. She laid them upon the table to eat her victuals off - She used the plates, and knives, and forks when she eat her victuals.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any instance of her selling any of these things?</p>
               <p>Wood. I never knew that she did - I have seen her put them up in a box, when she came home.</p>

             . [A girl about fourteen years of age] The prisoner lived with my mother and I, [the prisoner is Stamper's own aunt] one morning, the 6th of March, she asked me to go to Billingsgate with her, and when we came back, she said she had made a very good day's work; I asked her what she had got, she said, they were handkerchiefs: and she said, if I make as good a day's work every day, as I have done to day, I shall come very well off.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say this?</p>
               <p>Stamper . It was in an ale-house by the Monument. I asked her where they were, she said, they were in the basket (the basket that I carried) I asked her if I had been taken, whether I should not have been hanged, and she said no, I should not have been hurt. There was a piece of lead which was wrapped up in a piece of blue paper, and she said G - D - n you, I hope I have got a piece of cambrick worth 10 s. Then I went to my mother, and my mother said, where have you been; I said I had been with my aunt; my mother said, you little impudent jade, I'll kill you, and she sell a licking me, and the prisoner said, don't be angry, for I have got some handkerchiefs. Said my mother, what have you been carrying my girl a thieving.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do with the handkerchiefs?</p>
               <p>Stamper. She sold one in Shoreditch for 13 d. two to two bakers for 2 s. and she said, she had sold half a dozen for a crown. I sold the piece of lead for two pence halfpenny, and gave her the money. I was taken up and carried before a Justice, but I would not say any thing to the Justice about the handkerchiefs.</p>

I was very much surprised, but I saw no body that did it.</p>

            . I was with the prisoner, there were four Justices of the peace, and they cleared him. Hardey said he would hang his own brother rather than he would be hanged himself. He was accused of this very thing then and discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this done?</p>
               <p>Holmes . The latter end of last summer. I believe Hardey only does this to screen himself.</p>

            . On the 27th of May - I can't tell the name of the month, it was the month before this, between 7 and 8 at night, as I was going along Leicester-fields, there were some people singing of ballads, and I stopped to hear the ballad singing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner singing of ballads?</p>
               <p>Turner. No, I stopped, and the prisoner stopped too; there was some talk of her being a <rs id="t17450424-31-deflabel193" type="occupation">ballad singer</rs>

               <p>Q. You say she cut your apron off?</p>
               <p>Turner. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was done privately, was it not?</p>
               <p>Turner. It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she did not assault you?</p>
               <p>Turner . Yes she did, and put me in fear of my life; I run after her, and cried out, stop thief ; and she threatened my life, if I followed her.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you follow her?</p>
               <p>Turner. I followed her to Monmouth street, and took the things from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body see her take the things from you?</p>
               <p>Turner. No, nobody but my self.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sing ballads for my living, I don't deny it, but, my Lord, how could she come so far as from Leicester fields to Monmouth street, and not cry out stop thief before?</p>

            . About eight o'clock at night, I heard a hurly burly and came out; the prisoner had a bundle in her lap, and hearing the prosecutrix say, she had got her bundle; I asked the prisoner whether those things belonged to the person who said she had lost them, and she said no. I asked Mrs Turner what was in the bundle, and she said such and such things, but there was a cap and a handkerchief missing, and it was thought the prisoner had taken them out of the bundle before Mrs. Turner came up to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she stopped?</p>
               <p>Juratt. She was stopped at the corner of Grafton street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Leicester fields?</p>
               <p>Juratt. About a quarter of a mile. When the prisoner was taken, she said, The b - h wants to take my life away. She said, the things were her own; I said , I dare say, they are not yours, how can you say the things are yours? said I, I have seen many a ballad singer, and I never saw one with two aprons. She wished the blessed God Almighty would shut heaven's gates against her, and as her mouth was open, she wished it might never shut again, if the apron was not hers ; and she said , d - n her eyes, she should not have the apron.</p>

             . I stopped the prisoner at the corner of Grafton street, but she said, she would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174504240023"/> not be taken away till a proper officer came: she pulled her breasts out, and spurted the milk in the fellows faces, and said, d - n your eyes, what do you want to take my life away? She licked the prosecutrix before the Justice, and said, the longed for it; and she said, she would spit upon the Justice's seat, and she did so. The Justice said, he would send her to Newgate, she said, d - n my eyes then I shall have a ride for the money. Then the Justice ordered her to be fettered and handcuffed; and she said, if he would take the handcuffs off, she would tell him her right name, otherwise she would not.</p>
               <p>Another witness said, the prisoner was stopped with the things upon her, and that the prosecutrix said, these are my things, and was likely to fall into fits.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Turner asked me to drink a dram, and I told her, I had rather have a pint of beer, and she tied the apron upon me herself, and said, she wanted to tie her garter; so I run away with the things, and she run after me, and cried out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to drink with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Turner. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her before?</p>
               <p>Turner. I never saw her in my life, before that night.</p>
               <p>Jury. If this robbery was committed by the Prince of Wales's back gate , it is a wonder she had not been stopped sooner. Was the blow given you before the prisoner got the goods?</p>
               <p>Turner. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. What sort of a blow was it?</p>
               <p>Turner . It was a violent blow, my mouth was in a gore blood, and she knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did she take the goods immediately after she knocked you down?</p>
               <p>Turner. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire to know whether the apron strings are cut. [The apron the prosecutrix had on at the time she was robbed was produced, and one of the strings was a quarter of a yard shorter than the other.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The other apron is that which had the strings cut.</p>
               <p>Turner . This is the apron that the things were tied up in, the strings of this are not cut. <rs id="t17450424-31-verdict194" type="verdictDescription">

I said I was not the person he took me for: upon that he said, G - d blast my eyes, called me b - h, and took my cloak off my back, and gave it to the prisoners. There were four women together, and they all ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they take from you besides?</p>

               <p>Q. Why, you say you was sitting down at a door, did they knock you down there?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I run after them, and they returned, knocked me down, and dragged me along the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go after them?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I run after them about half a quarter of a mile.</p>

Cobb took her cloak off and run away, and we all run after him up Prince's street. We turned about again, knocked her down, gave her a slap on the face, and cut her head, tho' I did not see the cut, and took her hat and cap, then we run to Peg Kirby's mother's. We thought they were but trifles to pawn or sell, so we gave the cloak, hat, and cap, to Peg Kirby's mother; and I had the ribbon. We went out again the next night with the same intent; but did not do any more since that. The cloak is to be produced, but I don't know any thing of the hat and cap. This is the cloak I am sure, Mrs. Harrison had not much about her, but it was all God have mercy to us.</p>

I saw 3 or 4 women, and a man together.

               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his hitting him in this manner?</p>
               <p>Cole. Because he did not do his work well. He did not hold up his lash and missed potlaths. I believe he was not well before, because he had not done his work: and the next morning he came down to do his work, and he could not stand, and my master sent him up to bed again, and he died on the Sunday morning between three and four o' clock. - There was a mark on his side.</p>

               <p>Elks. I have seen him strike him with a whip now and then, but not any thing to hurt him. I did not see any thing of this blow that the boy speaks of, either with his fist , or with the brush.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason he did not do his work?</p>
               <p>Elks. He was either lazy, slothful or weak; I I could not get my bread with him, and I told him I must have another drawer.</p>

            . About eleven weeks befor e the deceased died he came to see us: and said, Oh uncle! I am killed, I am killed, I am murdered; I said to him, I never heard a dead body speak; and he said aunt, I am perished and starved and beat to death. I gave him some beer and he drank it, and his ordure came from him he was so weak. There were marks in his face of the prisoner's thumbs and fingers, that he had pinched his jaw with; there was a blackness under the jaw. I stripped him, and lookt at his body, he had some blood started out of his shoulder, and he had eight or nine marks of violence about his side, and back, and was bruised in a violent manner: his left side was turned yellow and green.</p>

            . About eleven or twelve weeks before the deceased died he came to my house; I thought he might be run away from his master, and he said, Oh uncle, I am dead, I am killed, I am murdered ; my wife said, I never heard a dead person speak ; he said, his master had beat and abused him, and starved him, so that he could not live; he drank part of a pint of beer; I asked him to eat some cold beef, but he could not eat any; he drank a second draught, and as soon as he had drank it, his ordure came from him: as he complained so of being beat, my wife stripped him, and looked at his body; he was very much bruised, and his left side was turned yellow, and about his lower rib on the right side it was as black as my hat, and in some places yellow. I went to the prisoner's house with the boy, and his wife opened the door; the boy was afraid to go in: I said to the boy, don't be afraid to come in, and she said, what is this the rogue your uncle, you called so many names. I went up to the prisoner, and told him how he had abused him, and he said, he had never beat him, but with such a thing as that, and shewed me one of these; and said he never did him any more hurt; I said, that could never make those bruises about him; I said, Mr. Gilbert, I hope he will prove a good boy: so I came away and never saw him after till he was dead.</p>

             . I live in a room underneath Gilbert's. About eleven or twelve weeks before the boy died, I heard Gilbert beating him most unaccountably on a Sunday in sermon time; I said for the Lord's sake, don't beat him so; and the boy said, don't beat me so, if you do you will kill me, and he said, d - n you, you dog, I will kill you; and he said, if beating would have killed him, he should have killed him before now, and it was a pity he had not killed him. The boy had a sore leg, and he beat him upon his legs; the boy cried out to him, not to beat him upon his legs, and he said he would, and the more the boy cried out, the more he beat him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say?</p>
               <p>Tinsell. I have heard him beating him since two or three times in a day, and on the Wednesday before Salter died he beat him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him beat him?</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner did he cry?</p>

            . I was desired by the surgeon of Bethnal Green Hamlet, to assist him in opening the body of the deceased, upon a supposition that his death was occasioned by the cruelty and severity of his master: and upon taking a view of the body, I observed several bruises upon the trunk and limbs, and one upon his face. There was a very large bruise on his right side under his lower rib.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you apprehend that might come?</p>
               <p>Day. I apprehend by a blow. Seeing this very large bruise, we judged it advisable to have the body opened, we opened the body five days after his death, and upon examination, I found the internal viscera found; only there were two very large adhesions, one of the lungs to the pleura, and the other of the liver to the diaphragma. Upon farther search it did appear by other symptoms that the boy had an inflammation in the throat, which I apprehend brought on convulsions, and put an end to his life; for his fingers were all contracted, and his nails were black: his lower jaw was locked up, and the lower maxillary glands were larger than common; and that was the antecedent cause of this inflammation in his throat. Whether this came merely and absolutely from that cause without some other cause, or whether it was attended with other circumstances, is doubtful. But my humble opinion is, that this violent inflammation brought on a symptomatic fever, and this got the ascendancy over him, and occasioned his death. Violent blows do always occasion symptomatic fevers, and these fevers do occasion inflammations. And the boy suffered a great deal by cold, for it was a most severe season, and there was a succession of illness from the time of beating to the time of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you think there was a symptomatic fever occasioned by the blows, and that occasioned the inflammation in his throat?</p>
               <p>Day. I say, that, together with the cold the boy endured, might occasion it. But in my humble opinion, the case is something doubtful, whether it was the cold absolutely, or the symptomatic fever which concurred with it, that occasioned this inflammation; for this examination of the body was five days after his death, and a corps may alter very much in that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the immediate cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Day. The convulsions were, and they were occasioned by the inflammation; but whether the inflammation came absolutely from the cold, or from the symptomatic fever, I cannot positively say. There was the adhesion of the lungs to the pleura; which proceeded from some other inflammation , and the adhesion of the liver to the diaphragma, and that might be occasioned by some former inflammation, that had seized this person, and terminated that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Might this inflammation proceed from violent blows?</p>
               <p>Day. It might proceed from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think this boy's death was occasioned by the blows he received from his master?</p>
               <p>Day. The boy was a poor emaciated creature, and not fit to be used as he was, if he had been a person of an athletic body, he might have bore this. I will always make a difference in subjects; but he was a poor emaciated subject, and was not able to bear it. I never saw him when he was living.</p>

            . I received an order from an officer of Bethnal Green Hamlet, to view the body of Salter, on account of its being supposed that he died by the severe usage of his master. There were several bruises on the trunk of the body, and the limbs: there were some bruises upon his face, and there was a bruise under the lower rib on the right side. I wanted to know how far the bruises had affected the internal viscera, and upon opening the body, I found the internal viscera to be found; but there were two adhesions, one of the right lobe of the lungs to the pleura, and the other of the liver to the diaphragma, which I apprehend proceeded from some former inflammation, and there was an inflammation in the throat, which might be the occasion of the boy's death: but it is a difficulty with me to determine whether this inflammation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174504240029"/> proceeded from the fever only, or from the cold, or some other cause , or concurring causes; such as frequent violent beatings; and I do think they might occasion the symptomatic fever; and that with the coldness of the season, might have produced such an inflammation that occasioned the boy's death.

There was a great stick lay upon the side of the loom, and that boy, Cole, struck the deceased several blows with it, and I took the stick away, and did beat him pretty well for it; and I understand by my wife, that he beat him every day that I was out.

               <p>Woolveridge, to Elks. Who beat the deceased on the Wednesday night before he died?</p>
               <p>Elks. His master did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Who beat him that night?</p>
               <p>Elks. You did, and I lighted you. I would not tell my master what little work the boy had done that day, because he was a little in liquor; and I told him how ill the boy was; but however, he went up stairs, and hit him two or three blows with that one lashed whip; but not blows that could hurt him I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you tell that?</p>
               <p>Elks. Because I lighted him to do it.</p>
               <p>Woolveridge . I ask you whether, when the apprentice beat him, it was not by his master's order?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wonder you don't swear it.</p>
               <p>Elks. Yes, I have heard him bid Cole beat him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see Cole beat the deceased , but when his master bid him?</p>
               <p>Elks. No, and I have heard my master say, when he went out in the morning, rib him.</p>
               <p>Cole. I have seen my master pinch him, and hit him such blows with the handle of a hammer on the head, enough to knock him down. He never let us go out; and when he went out, he would lock us into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What clothes had you?</p>
               <p>Cole. We had only our old clothes in the house. which would hardly hang upon our backs.</p>
               <p>Q. What covering had you to the bed?</p>
               <p>Cole. We had only our own clothes, and an old blanket upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever want victuals?</p>
               <p>Cole. Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Justice Ricards. When the prisoner was brought before me, there was no other witness to examine, than that boy who is his fellow apprentice. I examined him very carefully, and bid him not be afraid of his master, or any body; and told him he should suffer nothing from any body. I asked him whether the prisoner beat the deceased with any unlawful weapon; he said he beat him with a little stick. I asked him what was the reason of his beating him; he said, because he would not work. I asked him again what he used to beat him with, and he said, only with a little stick, and that only when he would not work. I found he was very unwilling to discover any thing, and that he was in a terror. I would have persuaded him to have spoke more freely, but I could not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That honest man I suppose, has been tutoring my apprentice.</p>
               <p>Woolveridge. I saw the body on the Thursday and viewed it from head to foot, and it was such a spectacle, as I never saw in my life; I gave orders for the coroner to be sent for, and he ordered the body to be opened. I got two surgeons, Mr. Day and Mr. Cobb, to open the body, and I desired Mr. Gilbert to get another surgeon for him, that nothing might be thought to be done in a clandestine manner, and he got a gentleman, who is in court. I carried the prisoner before Justice Ricards, and the boy was examined; and in order for the security of the boy, that he might be forth-coming as a witness upon the trial, by the approbation of Justice Ricards, I took him home to my workhouse: I told the Justice that I would take care of him, that no body should say any thing to tutor the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174504240030"/> boy. And I have taken as much care of him as I could, to do justice on both sides.</p>

             . I was sent for, on Friday the 1st of March, to be present with the two other surgeons, to examine the body of the apprentice, who it was supposed had lost his life by bad usage. There were several bruises on the outside of the body, but none of these bruises were the occasion of his death; the principal bruise was on the lower part of the right side, under the lower rib. I examined the interior part of the body, and found all the viscera found, and in good order. There was an adhesion of the lungs, which I impute to some former inflammation: and I apprehend the boy's death was not occasioned by the bruises on the skin, which was demonstrated not to extend farther than the flesh.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that any of the bruises were the occasion of the death of the boy?</p>
               <p>Wathen . By no means, for they extended no farther than the skin, as I demonstrated to several on the coroner's jury.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you take to be the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Wathen . He had laboured under the disorder of a quincey, and all the glands were greatly swelled above the common size; and in my opinion this quincey, and the inflammation which was occasioned by it, was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Woolveridge. I desire to know upon your oath, whether you did not say at the opening of the body, that the bruises the boy had received accelerated his death.</p>
               <p>Wathen. I believe the bruises and blows might have hastened his death, but the quincey was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not say these words, that these blows accelerated his death?</p>
               <p>Wathen. I did say those words; but I do not think that those blows had any effect upon the interior part of the body, so as to occasion his death.</p>

            . About three weeks ago, between 11 and 12 at night, I went into a house to drink a pint of twopenny; and being out later than I used to be, I went and sat down in a shed in the yard, and fell into a slumber. I was a little in liquor. I felt somebody's hand in my pocket, and caught hold of the Prisoner's hand while it was in my pocket. She jerked her hand out of my pocket, and run away directly with my money in her hand. I had received the two guineas that afternoon about five o'clock, and was to have received eleven more. I felt them in my pocket about a quarter of an hour before I went into the house, and buttoned them into my pocket.</p>

            . My mistress's cousin opened the closet, and told the money over; but they would not let her take any, so she went away without it. The Prisoner and the man went up stairs directly. When I came to the stairs head, I saw them at the closet door, with a piece of an iron bar. I run directly into the room, and said, For God's sake, don't rob my mistress. With that the Prisoner struck me, and the man knocked me down. She had a knife in her hand, and swore, if I came near her, she would rip me up with this knife [the knife was produced, a common table-knife] and when they had got the money and things out of the closet, they run away. Before my mistress's cousin went out of the house I saw the man put up four gold rings, nine guineas, eleven shillings, and a pair of silver buckles, &amp;c. into the closet.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the money?</p>
               <p>Smith. When my master sent his cousin for the money; I saw it about a quarter of an hour before I saw them at the closet, with an iron rod, attempting to break the door open.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what he died of?</p>
               <p>Harrison. He died of a wound he received upon his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the wound?</p>
               <p>Harrison. It was on the fore part of the head, a little above the right ear.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other wound upon his head?</p>
               <p>Harrison. There was a wound on the back part of the head, which was very trifling, and did not at all contribute to his death.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think as to the wound by the right ear?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I think it was the occasion of his death. The bone was laid bare, and he had all the symptoms of a concussion of the brain that could be, which was the reason of opening the head; and between the dura mater and the brain there was a large quantity of matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that follow a concussion of the brain?</p>
               <p>Harrison. very frequently, and when it does, it is generally fatal.</p>

There was an outcry of watch, and one Diamond run down Chequer yard, and some of the watchmen came to their assistance Mr. Burchall passed by me at the end of the yard, and drew his hanger , and said he would fight for his King, and his country*; but he did not go down the yard.</p>
               <p>* Burchall was a sergeant of marines, and went out with Commodore Anson to the South Seas, and is the only marine that survived that voyage, and came back with the Commodore to England.</p>

               <p>Rawlinson. I did not see him go down while I was there. He drew his hanger , but I did not see him cut any body, the mischief was done in the yard.</p>

            . [apothecary] On the 2d of March last, about six in the morning, I was knocked up to go to the deceased; I found him exceeding full of pain, and he could not make water; he had all the symptons of a mortification upon him, and seemed in a dangerous way; I asked him, where the seat of his complaint was, he said it was about his bladder, and believed it was occasioned by what happened the day before; he said he was in company with one Smith, and they had some words, that he went out to make water, had got his penis in his hand, and was knocked down and pulled back; that Smith obliged him to fight, and in the middle of their fighting he begged to make water, and it was refused him. This he told me, he was as honest a man, and as industrious a man, as any in his capacity.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not probe the man?</p>
               <p>Astley. I went for a surgeon, and I felt of the parts, and found there was no retention of urine, and the surgeon said, he had no great quantity of water in the bladder; and the surgeon did endeavour to cause him to make water; the next morning Mr. Presgrove introduced the Catheter, but there was no water came.</p>

             surgeon. I was desired by Mr. Astley to pay a visit to Mr. Worthington, and I found he had a violent pain in the abdomen, which I took to be upon the neck of the bladder; he ordered a somentation in order to relax the parts, and I think Mr. Presgrove was called, and he endeavoured to introduce the Catheter, but could bring away no water. Mr. Presgrove advised him to the warm bath, as he was going there he saw Mr. Cheselden, and he introduced the Catheter, and he brought a little water off his bladder, I believe about three or four ounces. I opened the body, and there was some water in the bladder, and something of an inflammation that extended itself near the bladder. I could not see any bruise on the parts, but in taking off the outward skin, I found there was a mortification on the upper part of the bladder, which I apprehend was occasioned by the retention of urine; his having something of a desire to make water, and holding it so long as he did, must be the occasion of a violent inflammation of the parts, which occasioned the mortification, and I believe that was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend any of the blows he received in fighting, was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Heathfield. I don't apprehend that any of them was the occasion of his death. I put my probe into his nose, and there was but a trifling wound; and I found the bone of the nose fractured, which was a surprising thing to me, but I don't think that was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. What other bruises were there upon the body?</p>
               <p>Heathfield. None that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a retention of urine before?</p>
               <p>Heathfield . I asked him that question, and he said he had not.

I said, I did not chuse it, as I had a house of my own to go to: she said, I should lie behind her back. She kept me till between four and five in the morning, and I grew drowzy; then she bid me go to bed; the prisoner was in bed a good while before I went to bed: she took my gown and one of my petticoats off, and put me to bed with two petticoats and my stockings on; and I went under the blanket that the prisoner lay upon; as soon as I got under the blanket, he began to grow impudent.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you?</p>
               <p>Swain. He pulled up my two petticoats - I am ashamed to speak what he did to me; but I would not take a false oath for the world; I would not go to take his life away for a wrong thing .</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner's wife in the room all the time?</p>

               <p>Swain. He put his impudence into me. [The girl with a great deal of seeming unwillingness and reluctance expressed herself in such terms, as were sufficient to prove the fact.]</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath was that done with your will or against your will?</p>
               <p>Swain. It was done against my will. He struggled with me, and was too many for me. I cried out murder, and he said if I cried out, he would do me a mischief, and his wife bid him be rude with me; and I begged and prayed of her to help me, and she would not do it. And afterwards she said, you b - h, I'll tear your handkerchief off your neck, because you have lain with my husband, and then she beat me.</p>

            . On the 1st of March, between 9 and 10 in the evening, my wife and I went to bed; I slept till about four o'clock, and was sadly surprised with the cry of murder. I listened to the crying, and thought it was the voice of my own girl. I listened again, and presently I heard murder cried out again. I felt in the bed, and missed my girl, (for I have but one bed, and she sometimes lies at the head, and sometimes at the feet.) I listened, and there was murder cried again, and my wife said, for God's sake, get up, it is Polly. I went to the window, and there was murder cried again; and

            , I believe it is my girl; and then the prisoner's wife opened the door and let her out; and as there had been a quarrel between them before, I began to beat the girl, because I had bid her not to go there. She began to open her complaints, but I did not care to hear her, but beat her the more. She was very sleepy, and I believe about 5 o'clock she went to sleep, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174504240038"/> went out about 6 to get a place of work, and desired my wife to go to Black John and Mary, to know why they used the girl so, and kept her out. When I came back, I was surprised with the account of this story. Said I to my wife, this rogue, Black Jack, has debauched Polly. (I did not believe he was such a villain , and though he has told me so frequently in publick, I did not believe it.) Said I, you villain , how could you use my girl in this manner? he said, she came to bed to me; I said, how, and in what manner? he said, she undressed herself , and came to bed to me. I said, if she came to bed to you, did she ask you to use her in this manner ? he said, she did not; but he argued a point of law with me. and said, if any body was to come into my bed, and I was to lie with them, the law could not hurt me; but afterwards he said, he would make it up at any rate. No, I said, I will not put this up for a pot of beer, or any such thing. Then he said he would marry the girl; said I, how can you marry her when you have two or three wives already? (for he is not married to this Mary) I would rather chuse she should be a whore all her life time, than be a wife to such a rogue as you, for then she will get something. Then he told me the reason why his wife beat the girl; that it was because she caught her in bed with her husband; but when he came before Justice Poulson, he said he was drunk, and did not know any thing of the matter.</p>

               <p>Mecum. We had twenty eight shillings for the whole, the next morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever sell this man any stolen goods before?</p>
               <p>Mecum. Yes, several times, and he has dealt with an hundred thieves.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have witnesses to prove, that I have not spoke to him, for a year and an half: the gentlewoman knows I was sick in bed at that time; I lived next door to her.</p>

             . I am a hatter by trade. I live in Creed-church lane . I have known the Prisoner about six years: he buys and sells old clothes. My men were drinking at the Taylors arms in Duke's place, and I went to call them.</p>
               <p>Mecum . That is a house which used to harbour all the thieves .</p>
               <p>Jackman . That is nothing to me, my character can be cleared.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Jackman. I believe about last May or June. Mecum was rapping it out prodigiously, and swearing in a most vile manner, that if he met with the person he was swearing about (who I did not know) he would shoot him and chop him to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that appear to be?</p>
               <p>Jackman. The Prisoner at the bar; and this was (as I heard afterwards) because the Prisoner had arrested his wife, or his supposed wife. I made answer, and said, Young man, I don't know you; but if this was a friend of mine, I would take care of you; for you should not say such vile words as these.</p>
               <p>Mecum. How came you here for a witness?</p>
               <p>Jackman. The Prisoner's spouse came to me, and desired me to come.</p>
               <p>Mecum. You would perjure yourself to swear against me, when you know nothing at all of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Jackman. He was servant to a gentleman I serve with hats, Mr. Levi in Lime-street .</p>

Mecum swore a great oath, and said, If I rob the whole world, I'll be revenged on you, and bring you to the gallows; and Mr. Jackman was angry with him for saying so, and was ready to beat him. I believe he had arrested his wife; the officer that arrested her is in court.</p>
