I am a shawl manufacturer, and carry on business at 21, Friday-street, in the parish of St. Margaret Moses—I believe no one sleeps in the house—on Friday morning 22nd April, I came to the ware-house at a quarter past 9 o'clock, and found the police in the passage, and the witness Dean at the door—I had left the warehouse at half past 4 the evening before, leaving Dean to shut up—I was not there when he shut up—in the morning I found the outer door had been opened, as if by a key—the inner door was forced—I went to the station, and found thirty-two shawls—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are mine, and my brothers—I know them by the pattern, and by the cloth, and the way they are made—there are not other patterns of the same sort—they are not made by ourselves—I had seen them in the warehouse the evening before—when I examined the warehouse I discovered nothing different from what I had left it the evening before, with the exception of some shawls having been taken from below the table and put on the top of it—I had a desk in the warehouse, which I found had been forced; it was safe the evening before—I missed nothing but the thirty-two shawls.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 130, Aldersgate-street—my nephew is a baker there. On 17th March the prisoner came to my house with a check between 6 and a quarter before 7 o'clock—he said he came from Mr. Ruther<lb/>ford, a baker in Barbican, and he wanted change for the check—he said it was for a very particular customer, and Mr. Rutherford would be very much obliged to me if I would change it—this is the check (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is dated 17th March, 1852, for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., drawn by Thomas Cureton on Messrs. Praed and Co.—my housekeeper was in my shop at the time—I saw her take the check out of the prisoner's band, and she handed it to me—I took it in the parlour, looked at it, and brought it in the shop, and told him Mr. Rutherford ought to put his name to it—he said Mr. Rutherford would have put his name, but he was not certain that I had the cash—I went up stairs, and brought down nine sovereigns, two halt sovereigns, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and gave him the ten guineas for it—I sent it to the bankers'—the prisoner was dressed as a baker, with a flannel jacket, and a white night cap, such as bakers generally wear, and his face was <hi rend="italic">dabbed</hi> with flour, as if he had left work without washing himself—I took particular notice of him, because I thought I might know him, being a baker—I had not seen him before—I saw him afterwards, when I went with the officer to his lodging—he came down in his shirt sleeves—I identified him—the 17th was on a Wednesday, and I think it was on the Thursday week following that I saw him again—I had given a description of him before I saw him again—the officer called on me, and I gave him a description of him.</p>

On Friday morning, 30th April, about 11 o'clock, I saw the prisoner in St. Mary Axe, with two parcels, one in a paper, and the other in a handkerchief—he went into the Blue Pig in St. Mary Axe, and a few minutes afterwards a Jew went in—I then went in, waited a few minutes against the bar, and heard the sound of money in the parlour where the prisoner and the Jew had gone—I went into the parlour, and saw three coats lying on the table; the Jew snatched up some money from the table—I collared them both, and the Jew escaped by slipping out of his coat—I retained the prisoner and took him to the station—he there said he had purchased one of the coats, and he knew nothing of the other two—the three coats were all new, and were lying on the table in the parlour—the prisoner was sitting down and the Jew standing up with a coat and pair of trowsers on his arm, which he had carried in with him, and which he left behind him—I have not seen the Jew since—I found a handkerchief in the prisoner's pocket which was like the one which formed the outside of one of the bundles he was carrying, and I found the paper on the table which had composed the other bundle—both the bundles contained something, the handkerchief parcel was the largest—they were struggling with me ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. On 13th April I received this mixture and chaff from my master—about a quarter to 9 o'clock at night, I stopped at the Green Man, at Ealing, baited the horse, and laid down on the sacks under the manger in the stable—I got up about a quarter before three, and gave the horse some more corn—I then went out of the stable to the horse, and in a quarter of an hour my master came and told me there was no corn there—I went into the stable where I had put it, and it was not there—the horse could not have eaten it—the prisoners were then there, and were just starting with their carts; they were close against our horse, and I made inquiry about our corn, and Clark said they knew nothing about it—I had not left the stable</p>

               <p>between a quarter to nine and three—there was another man asleep there, and when I went back he was still asleep; I woke him up, and he said he knew nothing about it—I found the empty sack and the cut open sack which we make a cloth of, in the hay bag of Goodyer's-cart, just behind the horse—Clark drove that cart—when I found that, Clark said, "I know where your corn is," and said it was in the stable; and when I went it was not there—the prisoners drove away their two carts, and there was another man driving another—I afterwards got a policeman, and went with him after the prisoners; we searched the first cart we came to, and there was nothing there—we then went to the next cart, which Clark was driving, and there found the two bushels of chaff, and the half bushel of mixture, and the sacks—the sacks are my master's, and the mixture and chaff were similar to what I bad had—Goodyer at that time was on the top of the load which Clark was driving, and he had hired another man to drive the other cart—when we first tried to search the cart, Goodyer would not let the constable get up, and asked what be wanted there.</p>

I received information, and a description from Wood, in consequence of which I found the prisoner and two other men in Little Chelsea—I said, "Which of you has got the <hi rend="italic">swag</hi>?"—that is a cant phrase, those sort of people know what it means—on my asking that, the prisoner commenced running—I ran after him—he ran in the direction of the workhouse, down by a wall, and when he got near there I saw him take a purse from his trowsers pocket, and throw it over the work-house wall—he continued running, and ran nearly half a mile—I then took him, and told him he could not have thrown the <hi rend="italic">swag</hi> into a safer place, it was secure there—he made no answer to that, and I took him to the station, went to the workhouse, and on the way there met the sergeant with the purse—it had been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon by profession. I was a partner in the late firm of Varnish and Co.—that partnership was dissolved twelve months ago—the business was that of silvering glass—the process is, depositing pure silver by a chemical process upon glass; the glass is blown double hollow—the silver was put in between the two surfaces and hermetic<lb/>ally sealed, and that makes it permanent and perfect, not to be injured either by the atmosphere, erasure, or by any other means, except by destroying the glass—after the dissolution, I carried on the business on my own account conjointly with another gentleman—I engaged the prisoner Mellish in the autumn of 1849—he was recommended to me by Mr. Powell, of the White-, friars glass works—he was to have six guineas a week—there was an agreement—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it before the firm was dissolved that you engaged Mellish? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I engaged him for the firm—I was in partnership with a Mr. Cock after the dissolution of the firm (<hi rend="italic">The agreement was here read</hi>)—this agreement refers to one of 15th Oct.; that was a verbal one which I made with him—it was that he should superintend at the glass works where I wished the glass to be made, and that he should also superintend the workmen for the purpose of cutting and polishing the glass—he stipulated, on coming into my service for that object, that he should have the sole control and manage<lb/>ment of the men, and not be interfered with in any way; he added that he had been long conversant with glass cutters, that he knew the merits of the different men that were required, and that, if he might take them entirely under his own control, he would be answerable for the work and responsible for the result of the business I proposed to carry on.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember Douglas coming into the service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, Mellish hired him; after Mellish had been some months in the firm, he stated that he was desirous of having a clerk to assist him, and that he knew a young man at Birmingham that he could very strongly recommend, that he had known him many years, and that he should like to have him—it was agreed that he should choose his own clerk, and Douglas came—he fixed the rate of wages for Douglas, and had him as completely under his own charge as he had the other men—he had from 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at first, but I believe that was afterwards raised slightly—as soon as Douglas came a wages book was kept, and the names of all the workmen, both in door and out door, were entered weekly—their names were entered in columns, and the rate of wages and their attendance was entered every week, and a sum total made, and they were paid once a week—the wages book was entirely under Mellish's management—it was kept in his desk—he had to fix the wages and to regulate them entirely—it was his duty every Saturday to see that the wages book was correct, and to send it to Mr. Dean, the cashier, for the weekly amount that was required for the workmen—I know that, from seeing the book nearly every day on Mellish's desk, and his talking to me about the wages, and seeing the names of the men in the book—it is in the handwriting of Mellish's clerk—I have seen it lay before Mellish on his desk, he perusing it, with his pencil, looking over it fifty times at least constantly—I did not know of any double vouchers being kept until within about six weeks previous to Mellish leaving the firm—I very frequently spoke to Mel<lb/>lish as to how the business was going on—I was in his room two or three times every day, and of course frequently conversed with him on the whole subject—I did not discover that frauds had been committed on the firm until Mellish had left three or four months; he left in May, 1851—I made the discovery in consequence of receiving a letter from one of the workmen—Mellish was given into custody, I think, in Oct., 1851—there were men en<lb/>gaged as glass cutters and glass polishers—they worked on the premises; at one period there were, I suppose, thirty men working on the premises, and perhaps seven or eight outdoor workmen—Mellish paid their wages—he had the sole management of both outdoor and indoor men—when I say Mellish, he and his clerk, Douglas, had the management of it—I was not present when the wages were paid—they went to Mellish's room, and they were paid by his clerk and by his authority.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you been carrying on this business of silvering glass before you were introduced to Mr. Mellish, or Mr. Mellish to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twelve months; he was not first introduced to me by Mr. Lund, of Fleet-street—Mr. Powell first spoke to me about him, and I then saw Mr. Lund—I rested entirely on Mr. Powell's knowledge as to his respectability, and I knew he was acquainted with Mr. Lund—they are both gentlemen of the highest respectability.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first became acquainted with him, had he not an inkstand which belonged to Mr. Lund, which he was desirous of having silvered on your plan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some inkstands were sent, as I understood, by Mr. Lund, for me to try the process of silvering on, which I did—I cannot say whether Mellish brought them, but he knew of their being there—I believe he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100023"/>
               <p>busy about them for Mr. Lund before I engaged him—it was found that that inkstand, which was not a double hollow one, could not be so silvered as that the silver should resist the operation of the ink within it—Mulish did not then invent the double hollow inkstand which was afterwards silvered—I sug<lb/>gested it myself, in consequence of silvering Mr. Lund's inkstands and finding them fail—I suggested the idea of the double hollow to Mr. Mellish, and he, after a considerable period, did get one made at Messrs. Powell's by my direc<lb/>tion—I then silvered it over; that answered—I believe Mellish was working for me at the time—I believe it was not before—I cannot quite recollect, but to the best of my belief he was working for me, carrying out this at Messrs. Powell's—I hired him to go to Messrs. Powell's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was your first introduction to him by Mr. Powell? A, In the autumn of 1849; I had never seen him before—it was after that that this conversation took place about the inkstand—I believe it was after I had entered into the verbal agreement with him—I took him for the very pur<lb/>pose of making the inkstand and other things—I have no doubt in my own mind it was after, for I hired him especially to go to the glass house—before he came, I had been in the habit of silvering glass, but not enclosing it in the glass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first engaged him, was he to do work for you at his own premises in Great Portland-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some things were to be carried on there because he had workmen already there, but the business he was to do for me was to be carried on at my own premises at the back of Burners-street—Mellish attended daily—he always attended for some portion of the day—he worked on his own premises for a very short time indeed—it was stipulated that when he entered into my service he was to give up great Portland-street, and devote himself entirely to Berners-street—that was understood between myself and Mr. Varnish—as soon as he could get glass cutters to come on my premises, which was within a few weeks, be came—the workmen were on my premises as soon as we could get the rooms ready—he brought his tools on my premises—he sold his tools to me, and his own carpenter fitted them up in my premises—I paid him several hundred pounds—that was a very few weeks before he came to me; he was paid by cash—it was after the written agreement—he spent the eight hours a day immedi<lb/>ately after the-signing of the agreement—he spent as much time at my pre<lb/>mises as it was thought necessary for the work that was in hand—I believe he took possession of a room and desk there as early as that: the rooms were fitted up immediately for him—he stipulated that he should have the entire control and management of the workmen, and the fixing of the rate of wages—I did not know what wages the men ought to receive—he told me he had known the men many years—in the course of his employment, I sanctioned the opening of a shop in Regent-street to be kept by his wife, in which my goods were to be sold; that was in the spring of 1850—a con<lb/>siderable quantity of goods was sent to that shop to be disposed of by Mrs. Mellish on my account; I should think more than 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods; but Mr. Dean, the cashier, can tell you exactly—I believe Mellish entirely fixed the cost and selling prices of those goods, and they were invoiced to his wife by us at his price—that course of business continued until he left in May, 1851—I believe stock was taken at various times during the interval between April, 1850, and May, 1851—I never suspected him of anything incorrect in that part of his dealing with me—I cannot say now that I have no reason to believe there was anything incorrect; I have the greatest doubts in my own mind that he did deal fairly by me with reference to the shop—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100024"/>
               <p>have reasons for my doubts; those reasons are, that an enormous sum of money had been paid for goods, to the amount of several thousands; and that in looking over what that money had been paid for, I do not see sufficient grounds to believe that I have been honestly dealt with, even in that department—it has not turned out profitably—I sent there from time to time 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of goods—they have not paid their expenses under his management—when he left there was certainly no profit in the concern, not a shilling—I have great reason to doubt that all the goods sent there were fairly accounted for by him—I cannot state any goods that were not fairly accounted for; I can only look at the goods sent in, and the money returned, and, judging by the result, I am a great loser—that is not my only reason for judging that he did not act fairly by me; but also from seeing that so many acts of dishonesty as I believe, have been committed by Mr. Mellish, as I have found out; I mean with respect to these receipts—that is my reason, conjointly with finding that a great deal more money has been laid out, than I can at all account for now should have been laid out—those are my principal reasons—I believe Mr. Varnish is here; he was entrusted with the commercial part of the business—it was not his business to direct what goods should be sent to the shop in Regent-street, Mr. Mellish selected them himself, and had the entire management of the selection; Mr. Varnish did not overlook that; his department was what I should call the out-door commercial, calling upon merchants of different classes to see whether the goods could be introduced for general sale; but of the goods manufactured and sent to Regent-street he knew nothing, because they were entirely in Mellish's sole custody and management—I am not aware that he ascertained what goods were sent in, and what the returns for them were; I have great reason to doubt that he knew much about it, because an account was to be day by day returned to us by Mellish of what was really bought; but it accumulated from time to time, and we had to take it as a whole—I think stock was first taken of the goods in the shop in Regent-street at Christmas; I am not quite sure—I am not aware that any complaint was made; there were complaints that the thing was not answering the purpose, as had been represented to us; that the returns for the money were not so good as I expected—there was no complaint made to Mellish of any deficiency in the stock, or as to any article sent there not being accounted for—I used to say repeatedly, that it did not appear to me, from the money we were expending, that there was a sufficient return, or even a guarantee that there would be—I never called his attention to any ground of complaint, as to the manner in which he or his wife had dealt with the articles entrusted to them; nor did I t any subsequent stock-taking, nor when he left in May; stock was then taken, I believe, by Mr. Varnish and Mr. Dean—I believe no complaint was made then—I stated at the police-court, in Mellish's presence, that I had great misgivings on the subject, that was in Oct., 1851—I had no means of making inquiries as to how the stock had been disposed of, further than by looking over the invoices; I did look over the invoices, and I went to Regent-street and saw the stock; but I did not myself go over it; I never took stock myself—I took no other steps—I have no means of stating any single article that was sent to the shop which he did not account for—I have no means of proving a single article—I doubt extremely that every article was accounted for—I never called his attention to any article—I merely called his attention to what I thought an extravagant expenditure, without any apparent adequate return; I never went farther than that.</p>

               <p>exercise sufficient vigilance yourself about this matter to be able to say with certainty whether something wrong was done or not, in any individual instance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not; but I have the strongest impression on my own mind, and have had ever since Mellish was first taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this shop taken for Mellish by your firm, or did he take it himself. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really cannot answer that question—Mr. Varnish had more to do with it than I had—I really do not know whether Mellish took it, or Mr. Varnish—it was done by my afterwards consenting to it—I went there sometimes—there was a regular stock book kept—I cannot of my own know<lb/>ledge say whether when be left, the stock was checked by that book—Mr. Varnish and Mr. Dean can tell—in Aug. 1850, Mellish and I became joint patentees of an invention for improvements in cutting, staining, and silvering glass—it was understood if I look the patent out and paid for it, that he merely as my workman should assign it for a consideration—I asked him to fulfil the engagement he had made, and he declined to resign his interests in the patent—I may perhaps state that the patent was never completed, for the machinery to carry it out bad never been made—I believe I asked him to sign a paper, which had been prepared by Mr. Cookney, and be refused to do so—I was displeased at his refusal to do that which he had agreed to do—I did not express my displeasure strongly—I said very little about it—there was no coolness between us on that account at all—there was no coolness at all until within a very short period of his leaving the service—I do not recollect a coolness—some two or three months previous to his leaving me, I had spoken to him of the necessity of having a person who could take the higher grade of work, and that I should be obliged to associate such a person in the work, and that raised a great coolness—that was the only dis<lb/>agreement we had—my impression is that he left, in consequence of my telling him that I intended to associate a person with him who would super<lb/>sede him—he told me he should go—I cannot say whether he said be wished to leave on the next Monday—he said, he should go immediately—he gave a week's warning—he was a weekly servant—I am not aware that be came afterwards, and said if his going then was inconvenient to me, be would stay a week or a month—I never heard of it—no doubt something took place between him and Mr. Varnish, before he left—he did not when he left leave his papers behind him—there are a great many bills wanting, and many receipts that we cannot find—while he was in the service he bad a wages book, and a pattern book, and he had books of his own which I cannot enu<lb/>merate—I believe he had a cost price book—I am not quite sure whether he had the sole management of the cost price book, or conjointly with the cashier, but it was his pricing—it was his business to ascertain the cost price of every article—I believe the cost price book is here—I do not remember what other books he had—I cannot say whether he had a petty cash book he left the wages book and cost price book behind—after Douglas came, I believe it was his duty to keep the time of the men who were employed on the premises—I cannot say how he did it—this is the wages book—it con<lb/>tains the names of everybody employed on the premises with the number of hours each person was employed—with respect to the outdoor men, it was Douglas's duty to do what Mellish told him—he was to act as his check—this is Douglas's writing in this book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the course of the outdoor work, did it at one time become the course of business that there should be two bills of parcels made out, or two accounts, one stating the detail of the work, and the other merely the amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Such a circumstance took place, but it was totally unknown to me for many months—I knew nothing about it until within a very few weeks of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100026"/>
               <p>Mellish leaving the concern—Mellish had the entire control—I had no power over him—Mr. Varnish did not suggest that mode of conducting the business—it only came to his knowledge at the time it came to mine—I know that—I believe Mr. Varnish is here—Mr. Dean is my cashier—I made constant inquiries as to the mode in which the business was conducted, between him and Mellish and Douglas, but I did not go into Mr. Dean's books, as that was Mr. Varnish's particular department—since tin's prosecution I have learnt that the system of double vouchers commenced immediately on Douglas coming—I have ascertained what the system was then—it was this—Douglas obtained from Mr. Dean every Saturday a certain amount of money, to pay the workmen—he sometimes gave an I O U, for that money—I am not quite sure what acknowledgment he gave Dean—I know that Dean gave the clerk money every Saturday to pay the workmen, and early in the next week he produced vouchers to Dean for it—I have since seen some of those vouchers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it the duty of Mellish to inspect the prices of the outdoor men, as well as the amount of the wages of the indoor men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; and by inspecting the wages book weekly, ascertain that they were correct, before the payments were made by the cashier—that was what he was hired for—the keeping of the wages book by Douglas was under the daily superintendence of Mellish—Douglas was a totally irresponsible person as far as I was concerned: Mellish was the only person who employed the clerk.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>.) I was a partner of Mr. Thomson—my department was more the counting house department, the opposite side from the manufactory—the manufactory was in Wells'-mews, and the counting house, and warehouse department, was in Berner's-street—I was not acquainted with the course of dealing between Mellish and the workmen—we left it entirely to Mellish—before I went to join Mr. Thomson we were bound hand and foot to Mellish—he had made an agreement with him to leave him the whole and sole control, therefore I could have no control in the matter—I had the means of knowing generally what the course was, but not particularly—I do not recollect what the course was, before the system of double vouchers commenced—it did not come under my notice—money was advanced by me, for the workmen, in check to Mellish, before Douglas came—I gave a check every Saturday, to pay the sums required—I remember Mr. Dean, the cashier, desiring that he should have the vouchers given to him for the moneys which he disbursed, and I was told by Dean that Mellish in the strongest language refused to give them up—directly after I heard of it, I went over to Mellish and said, "Mellish, I understand you refuse to give up the original invoices, which I have been requiring from time to time, to check the accounts"—I had been passing accounts, for which I had no vouchers, and I objected to go on so any longer—he did not exactly give any reason for objecting to give up the vouchers, but immediately I asked him he seized up a roll of papers—I said, "I must have these things to assure me that such and such sums have been paid"—he went with me to the front of the premises, threw the roll of papers on the table, and said, "There, Sir, I have been in the habit of handing to Mr. Dean these vouchers from month to month, and he has steadily refused ever receiving them"—I asked, "What are these," and so on; and then I found for the first time that there had been a system of duplicate invoices—till that day I never knew of it—I do not think I had learnt it from Mr. Dean—the invoices that Mr. Mellish took up and brought into the front premises with me were not the detailed ones—I did not lock at them—Mr. Dean said those were not the things he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100027"/>
               <p>wanted, he wanted the original invoices—Mellish told me his reason for keeping the detailed accounts was for reference—he did not say it was to make up the cost price book; but in case of need, if he wanted to see that the men did not over charge this month for what they had done last month, he could refer to the invoices to see what the price was—it was then that I for the first time ascertained that a system of duplicate accounts had been introduced, and I said to Mr. Dean, "Suppose we compound the thing in this way, to take the duplicate invoices, you first seeing that they agree with the original invoices?"—I do not think I can tax my recollection as to the date of this—it was not very long before I left—it must have been several months after Douglas came—I was the party to propose the compounding for the dupli<lb/>cates as we could not have the originals—after I had proposed that, the system of double vouchers commenced, and continued as long as I was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you proposed that they should have two sets of invoices? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; when I found two sets were in existence, I proposed that if Dean would put his initials with those of Mellish, I would, in that case, accept them as being correct; and if they were not correct, I blamed Mr. Dean for not seeing that they were true copies of the originals—I consulted Mr. Thomson, and we ultimately acquiesced in that arrangement, that Mellish should keep the originals, and that Dean should have examined copies—I understood it was Mellish's desire to have the originals for reference with respect to charges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why would not the copies have done as well for Mellish at the originals? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should have thought they would have done quite as well—I do not think I suggested that to him, as he so strongly declared he would not part with the originals—it did not occur to me, for when I agreed that Dean's initials should verify them, I thought that would do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not perfectly well understand that the duplicates, as you call them, were not exact copies, but what I call a per bill merely, not a detailed bill with items? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly, merely amounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So you assented at that time to that course of business being continued, that a duplicate, as you call it, but the mere amount of the detailed bill, should be sent with the wages book to Dean, in order to satisfy him that the amount claimed by Douglas was the right sum for the wages, and that Mellish should keep the detailed bills which the tradesmen brought in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was then so agreed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean a bill containing only the amount, "Smith's bill, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" "Brown's bill, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and so on?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so, that sort of bill-Dean ought to have compared those with the originals, and see that they were correct statements of the accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then there was a very good reason, of course, for those duplicates not doing so well for Mellish's purpose, as they did not contain the items? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> certainly, there was a good reason for his holding the originals.</p>

               <p>correct, and then the accounts were adjusted for each week between Dean and Douglas—from what My Lord has just now observed, I should say that Mellish certainly could not have made out the cost price book without keeping the detailed bills, containing the items—that was certainly a good reason for his keeping them—I left the concern just after Mellish—I think he left the item accounts behind him—I think he left almost everything, but I was very little in that department—he left the books—he must have left the item accounts, because they were discovered in his drawer—I can hardly say that he left on bad terms with Mr. Thomson—Mr. Thomson and Mellish did not agree—I do not know that Mellish insisted that some of his drawings should be destroyed before he left—when he left, he went back to his place in Great Portland-street—he remained in the neighbourhood, and was backwards and forwards in the trade as before—in the course of his employment I went with him three times to Paris—we were absent rather less than a week each time—I also went with him to Stourbridge, and he was at York for some time—that was after Douglas came—I have no doubt that all the stock of the shop in Regent-street was properly accounted for—it was not my department to attend to the taking of the stock, but I examined the accounts from week to week of money paid, and when the stock was taken I examined it twice, and it strictly agreed—I have no reason now to doubt that it was fairly conducted—I have no doubt that he conducted himself honestly and fairly in our employment in the transactions at Paris and elsewhere—he was constantly employed for us, from the morning till late at night frequently—in the evening he would go down to Messrs. Powell's glass works, and be there perhaps half the night, getting things made under his own inspection—they were things which he had designed, made drawings of, and carried out—that was perhaps three or four times a week—he was also obliged to examine every article which had been made under his direction by the outdoor workmen, and see that it was properly made and determine the price to be properly charged for it—he was constantly occupied in the business—his employment was quite general—he had the sole management—Mr. Thomson and myself had no control; we left it entirely to him—I had no knowledge of the trade myself, nor had Mr. Thomson—I simply brought in capital, and was not bound to he there at all, but I used to attend to the counting house department—Mellish saw the persons with whom we had to deal with respect to articles wanted to purchase—he was the only person that could answer—his time was quite occupied, I think a great deal more than the eight hours which he had engaged to devote to it—he had to superintend between thirty and forty workmen on the premises—he also, to our knowledge, carried on his business in Great Port-land-street during the time he was so employed by us—we objected to it, and wished him to get rid of it as soon as he could—I think it was somewhat inconsistent with our arrangement—it was agreed that he should go on for some time in order to see if his arrangement with Mr. Thomson suited him—that was, I think, up to June or July—we never made it a point that he should discontinue that business—we did not like it, but connived at it—we tried to get rid of it as soon as we could—at the time Douglas was employed, I was satisfied that Mellish had more business to attend to than he could manage—it was suggested both by myself and Mr. Thomson that he should have assistance long before Douglas came, and from time to time his answer was that he could not find a person to suit him, it was difficult.</p>

               <p>have the originals before me"—Dean said, "I cannot get the originals; Mr. Mellish will not give them up"—Dean had merely taken a memorandum of the accounts, which I passed—afterwards, I made them more authentic by causing Dean to examine each of them with the original voucher, and see that the amount was correct, and causing Mellish to put his initials upon them—that was the compromise; as we could not get the originals, we took them so—Mr. Thomson and myself were quite ciphers as to the mode in which money was expended—we had the means of examining the books and inquiring, but we had such confidence in Mellish that we left it to him—if I or Mr. Thomson interfered it was unpalatable to Mellish, therefore we kept aloof somewhat in consequence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier and book-keeper to Messrs. Thomson and Co. These per bills have passed through my hands—the initials "T. R. M." on them are, to the best of my knowledge, in Mellish's writing—one of them, of Sept., 1850, has no initials—the body of the bills are, I should say, in Douglas's writing; I have no doubt of it—I have seen him write very often—up to a certain date in July or Aug. I should not have passed these bills for payment to Douglas but for Mellish's initials being to them—I paid the money to Douglas in a lump—after July or Aug. I should not have passed the bills without Mellish's initials, without making some inquiry—I have gone through the wages book, and find that in all the instances the amounts of the per bills are entered as the actual payments made; that is, the increased or false amounts—the wages book passed through my hands every week—I find in the cases of Perry, Kay, and Home, the larger amounts are entered, and for the weeks during which they were absent.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you cashier when Mellish went there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went on 2nd April, 1850; I believe Mr. Varnish attended to my duties before that—for some time after I went there the system of payment of money to Mellish for wages continued the same as it was when I first went—on a Saturday a certain sum was asked for, which I paid, and for which I received vouchers, and settled the difference on the Monday or Tuesday following generally speaking: they gave me an I O U for the amount I paid, which I put into the cash box, and returned, when I was satisfied that the vouchers were correct—Douglas was there shortly before me—it was Douglas who asked for the sum on the Saturday, and afterwards accounted for its disposal—he then brought to me the wages book, and the per bills receipted by the workmen—almost all those bills had Mr. Mellish's initials, with some few little exceptions—I inquired into those comissions very particularly after July or Aug.—I insisted on seeing his ini<lb/>tials to the per bills before I passed them—I cannot recollect whether in July I expressed a wish to have the item bill as well—there was some question</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100034"/>
               <p>raised about the initials at that time—I have tried to recollect the circumstances, and I cannot; I cannot say whether my employers knew of the system of bringing the per bills with the wages book, but they were always presented—after I had compared the per bills with the wages book, I returned them in the book, on the Monday or Tuesday, to Douglas—I kept them perhaps till Monday or Tuesday—I would have them for a few hours to balance my cash—if, on comparing them with the <hi rend="italic">wages</hi> book, I found the sum he had received was too much, he would pay me the difference; if it was not enough, I should pay him the difference—as to the correctness of his statement of the amount he had expended, I had no security except the initials of Mr. Mellish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any explanation given to you at any time why there should be per bills as well as item bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think on one occasion it was said, that as the items were charged, they were able to check the work from them—if I had had the item bills brought to me, with the signature of the workmen to them, I should have been more satisfied—whatever bills were brought to me were not retained by me, but returned to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What I want to know is, if they ever explained to you, or are you able yourself to explain, why they should go through the form or ceremony of having the per bill as well as the item bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not know, more than they were brought to me to check the book with—if the item bills had been left with me, as the per bills were, that would have been no impediment to the use of them by Mellish, for the purpose of pricing the articles to be sold, they would have been returned by me on the Monday—the time I kept them would not interfere with the use of them—the per bills were sent back by me to Douglas—I do not know what was done with them after that any more than with the item bills; after Mellish left, the per bills and the item bills were found in his room.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What bills are you speaking of now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The item bills, or any bills—I do not recollect that it was suggested that the per bills should be pasted in a book by me, and kept by me—the per bills afforded no information which there was any occasion to have recourse to, except checking my book—the item bills did, and those I thought might be conveniently pasted in a book, so as to be seen with less trouble than if they were filed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were they, while you kept them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In my room, in Berners-street, a different part from the factory altogether; it is under the same roof, but some distance off—if there had been a pressing necessity to see them they could have been seen in five minutes—sometimes, during the time when Mellish's initials were put to the bills, I kept them a day or a day and a half—I was not particular to an hour or so—it is so long since, I cannot recollect—I never beard Mellish assign that as a reason for objecting to my having the original bills—I do not recollect that he said I kept the bills longer than was convenient—I do not recollect his making any objection, no more than he wanted to keep them to make up his price book—I think I must have been only informed of the result of the discussion on the subject between him and Mr. Varnish, without any reason being assigned to me—I could go to Mel<lb/>lish's office when I liked—I did not go to his private room unless he was there—if I had any difficulty respecting the bills, I could go down and insist on seeing the original bills; I never did so—I considered I was entitled to do so if I saw any reason—if I had had an idea anything was wrong I certainly should have done so—I never knew where the item bills were kept until the last trial—I heard at the last trial that there was a file in the office where Mellish and Douglas sat, on which accounts were placed—I do not know it of my own knowledge—I paid Mellish's wages—I was not present when any<lb/>thing passed between Mellish at the time he left and his employers—I never saw him on the premises after he finally left—I have seen him once or twice</p>

I recollect 4th Oct. when Douglas was taken—I know the room that was occupied by Mellish on the premises—there was a library table there, and two boxes—the boxes were opened with a key found on Douglas; the same key fitted both boxes—the drawer of the table was opened by a lock<lb/>smith—some of these vouchers were found in the table and some in the boxes.</p>

I have pleaded guilty to this charge—I have also gone by the name of Henry Simpson, which is my real name—I have been in prison before, and came out on 16th March—on 18th March I met Lawrence in King-street, Covent-garden—I bad seen him in Coldbath<lb/>fields prison—he asked me what I had been doing since I left—I said I had done nothing; I had been at home with my aunt and sister—I had told him in prison what I had been charged with—he said I was a foolish fellow, and he could tell me things that would bring me more money, with less danger to myself—I had never seen him before but in the prison—he told me a public-house be used of an evening, and the hours he was at home at his own house; and, also, that he always bad 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by him; and if I brought anything, he would buy it of me—he asked me to come to his house next morning, and go out with him—I went about half-past 10; and we have made appointments since that time, and, unless I have been too late for him, we have been out almost three days every week since, and always shared the same purse—on 29th April I met him about half-past 10, and was with him the remainder of the day, excepting at dinner and teatime—we passed the prosecutor's shop, in Fleet-street; and he told me to go in, as there was no one of any conse<lb/>quence there—I went into the shop, parting with Lawrence next door—I have heard the statement made by Shelford as to what took place in the shop, and I took three antique rings clandestinely—I came out, and joined Lawrence at the corner of Bell-yard—he pulled out his watch, and said, "What a long time you have been in there! I think it is an hour and a half; have you done</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100045"/>
               <p>anything?"—I said, "Yes," and showed him the rings, with the prices on the tickets—he said, "Give me the rings; it will not do for you to have them about you, if they come after you, and destroy those," meaning the tickets—I went with him towards Carey-street; and when we got to the corner of Bell-yard and Carey-street, he said to me, "Walk on the other side of the way;" and I did so, and joined him at the other end of the street, and he had the rings in his possession till we got to his house, in Bridges-street—he then asked me if I would have any dinner, and I said, "No"—there was a person living with him, whom I was not very good friends with; and I took the three rings, went and had my dinner, and went back to him when I thought he would be ready—we then went out together, direct to Mr. Young's, in Princes-street, Soho—I took a ring into Mr. Young's, while Lawrence waited outside, and offered it for pledge—they offered me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I would not take it, and brought it out again—I then took it to another pawnbroker's. higher up, while Lawrence waited outside—I did not take what they offered, brought it out again, and went to several other places with it—about teatime we went towards Lawrence's house again—he asked me to have some tea—I said, no, I was going home—he asked me to give him the three rings, as he thought he knew a place in the City where he could sell them, and he would meet me at half-past 9—I then borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him—I did not meet him at half-past 9; I did not go; but I met him after 12, at the Sheridan Knowles, and he then bad two of the rings, one on each little finger, the best one, and the one he was afterwards stopped with—these are them—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two of the three I stole from Mr. Thearle's—I asked him for the other one, and I put it on, and wore it that night—I kept that one all night, and he kept the other two—he showed one of the rings to the conductor of the rooms, and said he had been offered 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—we were to have met next morning, at half-past 10—I did not go, and he came to my place at 11—he then had the two rings on—he said, "Give me the other one, and while you are dressing I will take them into the Waterloo-road; I think I can get rid of them"—I gave him the ring I bad, and when he came back I had it back again, and the other two—the one I had is not here—he came again after dinner, and said, "You may as well go back to Mr. Young's, and get the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the ring that was offered to you"—I went back to Young's, said I would take the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was offered for the ring yesterday, and the ticket was going to be written out, when Mr. Young himself came into the shop, and said, "Let me look at it," and said he could not give me more than 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would take it—Lawrence was waiting outside—I told him, and he said I was a fool for taking it—I had borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him at the Sheridan Knowles, and I gave him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the 80<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we then came back, and at the back of the Church Lawrence pointed out a gentleman, and said he had sold him a pair of spec<lb/>tacles, and most likely he would buy the rings—I did not know his name then, but I believe it is Hermann—Lawrence showed him two of the rings, and asked him if he would buy them—that was this one (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>), and one which is not found—he looked at them, and said he was not exactly a judge of that sort of thing—Lawrence told him one had been pledged across the road for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and asked him to go and look at it—he said, "No, not now," and told him he had removed from where he did live to 92, Great Russell-street—if it had not been for that, I should not have been able to bring him as a witness—we then parted from Mr. Hermann, and Lawrence said, "Come along this way; I want to get a scent bottle out of pledge I have got in for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I want to sell it"—we then both, but not together,</p>

               <p>asked roe whether I would buy them; he asked 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I just looked at them, and said they Were not in my line—I did not know Lawrence, but he reminded me that I was once with a friend, a foreign gentleman, in a dining room in King-street; Lawrence was there, and offered several articles in sale, and among them a pair of spectacles, which my friend bought of him for a guinea and a half—I then recollected I had seen him—I do not think I should recognise the rings he showed me if I were to see them (<hi rend="italic">looking at the rings</hi>); I cannot say whether these were them—I have no doubt that Lawrence is the person I met.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a varnish manufacturer, and live at 28, Poole-street, New North-road. The prisoner was in my service up to 17th Jan., 1852, when I discharged him—he had been with me under an agreement from 20th Jan. 1851—it was an agreement for a year—his position was as clerk and traveller, when required—he understood English very well—he is a native of France—it was his duty to correspond with some of my French customers—on 20th Dec. 1851, I left home with Mrs. Schweitzer, about half past 4 o'clock in the afternoon; I was going out with her—before leaving I told the prisoner that two letters would come in during the day, and they were to be answered by return of post; one was from an agent of mine, named Fellme, in Paris, and the other from a customer named Audient, of Verdun—I gave him, on rough paper, a sketch of what was to be the purport of the reply—I intended to remain until he had completed the letters, but my wife came in just at the time these directions were given; she beard part of them, and she urged me to go out—I said, "I cannot go at this moment, because the foreign post is not off"—she said, "Is there much to do?"—I said, "No; not particular, except letters, and the instructions are already detailed"—she said, "Can you not sign them at the bottom and be off?" and at her instance I committed this nonsense; I put my name to the bottom of the two papers, in blank—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I believe to be one of the half sheets of paper I so signed—it was a similar paper to this—I signed two blank sheets, and directed the prisoner to fill them up with the letters to my correspondents—I then went out with my wife—I returned about six in the evening—I saw the prisoner, I asked him whether he had dispatched the letters in time for the post of that day—he said he had—his pay was up that day, he asked for it, and I gave it him—it was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., his salary was 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I did not authorise him to write this letter—the body of it is his writing, the signature is my own; it is addressed to my bankers at Rouen, Messrs. Jullien—the prisoner was aware that I did business with them—I remember saying at the police court that I did business with them, and that the prisoner was aware of it; upon which he said, "You need not call that wit<lb/>ness,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Lambton-mews, Notting<lb/>hill. On 12th April, about 6 o'clock, I went to a beer shop, 49, Marylebone-lane, and had half a pint of beer—I saw the prisoner there talking to other men—Mr. Barley, the landlord, was in the bar—he said, "I will turn that man out; open the door, Foxall"—I opened it, and the prisoner was turned out—in about twelve minutes or a quarter of an hour he returned; there was another man with him—he came up to me, and said, "I hope I have not offended you?"—I said, "No, my good man, you have not"—the moment he spoke to me, the prisoner sprang on me with this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), struck me on the head, and cut it open—it bled, and I saw nothing more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the beer shop, 49, Marylebone-lane. The prisoner came there with another man, and they had some beer together—the prisoner was very violent, and said he would have beer if he thought proper to pay for it—I refused to draw him beer as he was a little <hi rend="italic">gone</hi>—the floor was taken up for some beer to be sent down, and one of these men pushed a man through the trap—he went in up to his waist, and I put my hand and prevented his falling any further—it was not the prisoner who pushed him in, it was another man in his company; there were two besides the prisoner—there was no quarrel—the man that was pushed down gave the prisoner a pot of beer for assisting in removing some scaffold poles across the street, and when the prisoner had partaken of it he demanded two pots more, and the man said he would give him no more—after that, Foxall opened the door at my request, and I turned the prisoner out—in about ten minutes he returned with another man—one of them had a spade in his hand and some iron chisels in his waistcoat pocket—the prisoner had his hands secreted in his waistcoat—the man who had the spade went up to Foxall, and said, "Have I offended you in any way?"—Foxall said, "No, my good man, you have not offended me"—the prisoner came in with his hand concealed in his waistcoat, went up to Foxall while he was talking to the other roan, raised his hand with the hammer in it, and struck him violently on the top of the head without uttering a word—a more diabolical deed I never saw—I am perfectly sure it was the prisoner that did it, and not the other man—this is the hammer—Foxall did not fall, as a man sitting next him caught him in his arms—the prisoner then made for the door that he came in at, taking the hammer in his hand—he went out, I pursued, kept him in sight, and overtook him—I was afraid to touch him with the weapon in his hand—he ran against a truck in the road, which gave him a check—the hammer dropped from his hand, and then Allen and I closed on him and secured him—I saw Allen pick up the hammer—the prisoner said to me, "Oh, Mr. Barley! you know that I did not strike the blow?"—I said, "You villain! you know better than that; and I much question if the man is not dead"—I took him to the station—I did not hear the prisoner and Foxall speak to each other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a writer, and live at 17, Little Marylebone-street. On 12th April I was at Mr. Barley's, and saw the prisoner in company with some other men—I saw the prisoner push a man backwards; he would have gone into the cellar, but Mr. Barley caught him—two other men were near the prisoner at the time, but it was not them that pushed him but the prisoner—there was a dispute, and Foxall told the prisoner he was no man to knock another man down into the cellar—Foxall then held the door open while Mr. Barley pushed the whole three out—in about ten minutes the prisoner and the younger man who was with him returned together—the other man, who had a shovel in his hand, said to Foxall, "Have I offended you?"—Foxall answered, in perfect good temper, "No," and while he was just saying that, the prisoner stepped from behind the other man and struck him a knock on the head momentarily with the hammer—the prisoner then <hi rend="italic">shuffled</hi> out of the house as quick as he could, taking the hammer with him—I cried out, "Murder!"—I was present when he was stopped, and saw the hammer fall from under his jacket—Foxall's head bled very much.</p>

I am sorry for it; I hope he is not hurt"—I said, "That I cannot account for"—he said, "It is all owing to the b—y drink"—I took the hammer from Allen, examined it, and found blood on the end of it—it weighs nearly three pounds.</p>

On 12th April, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, Foxall was brought to me bleeding profusely, from a contused wound on the head, produced by a blunt instrument, such as a common hammer—it was a contused wound, not a cut—it had bled very profusely—the skin was divided and torn—a blow from such a hammer as this would be very likely to produce concussion of the brain—the wound did not heal kindly—it was not healed at the examina<lb/>tion, before the Magistrate—I have not examined it to-day—concussion will frequently come on three, four, five, or even six weeks afterwards—that would be very dangerous, and very often fatal, but I think the profuse bleeding relieved him—it was a wound of a very dangerous description—he was quite</p>

On 30th April, about half past 7 o'clock in the evening, I left home—I returned about half past 8, and saw lights on the first floor—I went to a neighbour, then returned to my door, and the prisoner came out and pushed me down on the pavement, then another man passed out—I cried, "Thieves!"—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, at the London and North Western Rail<lb/>way. I was passing, heard a cry of "Stop thief!"and saw the prisoner running—I got before him, and stopped him—he struck me with a short crowbar on my cheek—it cut me to the bone—I took it from him, and secured him—I have a plaster on the wound now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Knight, a City policeman. We are the housekeepers at Mr. George Heiron's, 152, Leadenhall-street; he is a tailor, and rents the whole house—Mr. Heiron's shop is on the ground floor—there is a shop door, but when the shop is closed, there is a private door into the passage of the house—if a person came in at the private door of the house he would turn to the side to the shop—Mr. Heiron has also a bedroom on the third floor, where we have a kitchen and bedroom, and the rest of the house is let out in offices—on Easter Tuesday evening Mr. Heiron closed his shop from 8 o'clock to a quarter past; he was up stairs before half past—when he closes the shop he is in the habit of leaving the key under the mat at the foot of the stairs, by the shop door, for the apprentice who lives in the shop—the street door was fastened by a common lock, which could be opened from the outside by a key—my husband was coming home about ten minutes past 9, and I came down about five minutes to 9, and looked through the offices in the first floor, and about 9, as near as possible, I went to the ground floor; I had a light with me, and I was going to the street door, as I expected my husband home—the shop door and street door were both shut—I thought I heard a noise in the shop, looked for the key, found it in its usual place, and tried to open the shop door, but I could not—I put the key under the mat again, put the light on the stairs, and waited in the passage about five minutes, when the shop door was opened from inside, and a man came out loaded with what appeared to be rolls of cloth and ready<lb/>made clothing—he seemed very much surprised at seeing me—I accused him of being a thief, and asked him who he was—he said, "Leave me alone;" I had got hold of his coat, and was between him and the street door—I said, "Let you alone, indeed; you are a thief!"—I still kept my hand upon him; he rested some time with the load on his head and shoulders—I hallooed</p>

               <p>"Thief!"as loud as I could, and he threw down the bundle in the passage, and made for the street door—I tried to get at the bell, and while doing so he escaped out at the door—I ran after him on to the kerbstone, and called out "Thief!"again—all this may have occupied five or six minutes—I had no opportunity of observing the man's features, he was so loaded—I noticed his bulk, and his dress, and cap—the prisoner is the person—he was brought back by the policeman in about five minutes—I rang the bell, and Mr. Heiron came down and examined the shop, and the bundles that were left in the passage.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee house in St. Mary Axe. I know Mr. Heiron's shop, it is seven doors from Gracechurch-street—on the evening of 18th April, about five minutes past 9 o'clock, I was coming past Mr. Heiron's shop, and when I got to the door a person rushed out of the premises, so close to me that I was obliged to <hi rend="italic">stop back</hi>—directly after, a female came to the door, and called out "Stop thief!"—the person turned across the road, towards the East India House; I followed him, and kept a side view of him, and when he got towards the East India House he crossed the road back again, towards St. Mary Axe—he went a few steps on that side, and then crossed, and went down Lime-street—I crossed again, and went behind him, and never lost sight of him till I saw Chambers, the policeman, and gave him into custody—the prisoner is the man.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you close to the door when the man came out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he would have knocked against me if I had not made a sudden stop—when the woman came to the door I did not turn to look at her—I caught a side view of her—I just cast my eyes round and saw it was a female—she called out "Stop thief!"and I followed the man—there are generally a good many people about Leadenhall-street and St. Mary Axe—there was not more at that time of day than usual, it being Easter Tuesday; but there were a great many—I was not above six yards from the prisoner when he started—he crossed the road immediately, and went down the pavement on the other side—I crossed over, and kept in the road, and when he got to the extremity of the East India House he crossed again; he went about a dozen yards on that side, and then re-crossed into Lime-street; there was then no one between me and him—I did not see a person till I met the policeman—when he crossed the road to Lime-street he looked to see if any one saw him—there were no turnings from the time he started till he was taken, he crossed the road directly opposite Lime-street—when we brought him back I told the policeman he had come from one of those houses, and he rang at</p>

On 13th April, I was going home, just about 9 o'clock, and when I got to Mr. Heiron's I heard a female's voice cry something which I did not distinguish, and I saw a man come out of Mr. Heiron's—I was about five yards off—the man came out rather quickly, not running very fast, and ran across the road towards the East India House—I should not have noticed him but for the cry—I lost sight of him; but before that I had caught a view of his side face, enough to form an opinion about him—I believe the prisoner is the man—I stayed at Mr. Heiron's door, and in five or ten minutes the prisoner was brought back—I believe he is the same man—I said at once, "That is the man"—he said, "Oh, not!"</p>

On 3rd May, about 5 o'clock in the evening, I was passing through Smithfield, and saw the prisoner close by me—I am sure she is the person—I saw a man fall down before me, and he was raising himself when I felt a tug at my pocket, and missed my purse—it contained a sixpence, a halfpenny, a receipt for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and, to the best of my belief, a shilling also—the prisoner walked away, and afterwards ran, and while she was walking before me, she pulled the purse out—while I was endeavouring to follow her, ano<lb/>ther man, not the one who had fallen down, attempted to interrupt me—the two men ran after the prisoner; she went through a court, and I saw the man who had fallen down pass something to her hand as they crossed the path, and the woman passed her hand to him, and I saw something pass which looked like a purse—I cannot swear it was mine; they were about a dozen yards off me—before the prisoner passed the purse to the man, I saw her look into each corner of it—I followed her for a quarter of a mile into a public house, where I was told she had gone, and I found her there.</p>

In consequence of some communication with my employer, I kept a sharp look-out upon the prisoner; he was employed in the cutting-room of the establishment, on the first floor; I am employed in the same room; between 10 and 11 o'clock yesterday morning the prisoner was cutting a coat from a piece of cloth; he was marking a coat, preparatory to its being given to the party who makes it up; I think the prisoner got a yard and three quarters of cloth to make the coat; I saw him cut a coat from that piece; he did not use the whole of the yard and three quarters to make up the coat, and the piece which was left he put into the window; the two pieces of cloth produced I saw him put in the window; the value was about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the piece of cloth remained in the window the whole of the afternoon; about half-past 8 in the evening the prisoner went to the window, and removed the piece from the window to the cutting board, adjoining the window; he then took his pocket handkerchief from his pocket, and threw the handkerchief</p>

               <p>carelessly over the piece of cloth which was then on the cutting-board: he came away a few steps, and I distinctly saw a small piece of cloth projecting from under the handkerchief; about a minute afterwards the prisoner took the handkerchief, with the piece of cloth, and placed them in his hat; he put his hat on, and walked away to leave his work; I walked close after him, (it was then about 10 minutes to 9 o'clock), and I communicated what I had seen to Mr. Adolphus, the manager at Mr. Moses's." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>—"The prisoner cuts out goods which are bespoken; the bulk of cloth is kept in the Aldgate shop; the piece of cloth is given out to suit the size of a customer: a good cutter would decidedly be able to cut it closer than a bad cutter; I have never had any of the pieces whatever of any description, and never gave any away; I gave the prisoner a piece of silk velvet from Dr. Fergusson's waistcoat, but not for his own use; I thought he wanted to use it in the firm; there were five of us in the room altogether where the prisoner was cutting the coat; I never saw cutters taking away scraps, except one man, and he was discharged; I did not get the man discharged." <hi rend="italic">Re<lb/>examined</hi>—"hey were very small pieces of silk velvet which I gave the prisoner, not fit to use in the trade; the cutters are not entitled to the pieces of cloth which are left; after coats are cut out, his duty is to keep them on the board, and deliver them to the deputy manager, Mr. Dearbert; they are usually collected every evening, but invariably on the Saturday; this cus<lb/>tom is known to the prisoner; this practice has always prevailed in our busi<lb/>ness since I have been there, and I have been there about two years; the cutters and persons employed there have commission to purchase goods; they always purchase for cash, and do not have any account; I never recollect an instance since I have been with Mr. Moses in which the cutter has been per<lb/>mitted to take any of the savings; there has not, to my knowledge, been given any notice that the cutters should not take what is left of the cloth; what is left is usually made into waistcoats; the two pieces produced would make a small boy's waistcoat." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>—"There is a rag-bag kept, in which pieces are kept; I have had words with the prisoner; he has a better salary than I have." <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>—"It is not usual to put such pieces as these produced into the rag-bag.")</p>

On 9th March, about 11 o'clock in the morning, I watched the prisoner, and, after cutting out a coat, I saw him place a piece of cloth on the corner of a window, close to his board—it was a piece of cloth that would make a small waistcoat for a boy, and was the remnant of what he cut out—that was all I saw of it—I left at seven o'clock, leaving Sampson there—we are not allowed to take away pieces of cloth of any description.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Valentine-place, Blackfriars. On a Sunday morning (I did not put down the day of the month) I was in Trafalgar-square with Elizabeth Hayes—we met a man, who I afterwards saw dead at the Hospital—he was half tipsy and half sober—it was, as near as I could judge, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning—we all three went to the Hop-gardens, to a room on the first floor—the servant refused to let us have the room, and we left that house together, and went to a house at the corner of Banbury-court, and at the corner of a street also, kept, I believe, by the prisoner—we went up to the first floor, the landlady asked for a couple of shillings—the man said he had not got the money to pay it—she said it would be one shilling if he had one girl, but two shillings if he had the two—the pri<lb/>soner was not there then—the man went and lay down on the sofa, and said he was sleepy—two or three women, servants I believe they were, and the land<lb/>lady, came up, and said he should not sleep there unless he paid, and they were pulling him out—I said, "Don't do that, I can get him out quietly"—the landlady called him Irish—he said he would strike anybody that aggra<lb/>vated him, or called him Irish, or dragged him out of the room—I said it was of no use aggravating a drunken man, quietness would be the best; with that I took hold of his arm, and got him nearly to the top of the stairs—I then saw the prisoner—I do not know where he came from—he said what did he come into his house for without any money—I do not remember that there was any answer—then the prisoner gave him a push with his hands in the middle of his back, not very hard, but sufficient enough to push him down stairs—he did not go down stairs very quick, he went step by step; he fell on his face—there were fourteen or fifteen steps; the first two or three at the top were not straight, they were larger stairs, and went three-cornered <hi rend="italic">wise</hi>; the others went straight—I saw him fall on his face; he went from the top to the bottom, sliding, headforemost, so slowly that every step must have touched him, and with his face downwards; it was more like a slide down—he did not fall head over heels—when he got to the bottom his head was on the mat, and his legs up the stairs—when he was at the bottom Belasco struck him three or four times on the neck, and the top part of the head, with his fist, nothing else—one blow was on the neck, and the rest were about the head—I said it was shameful treatment—he said, "You are a woman of the world, and ought to know better; and if anything occurs from this you must say he fell down stairs"—I said, "No, I shall not"—he turned the man over, and looked in his face, and his wife went into the parlour, brought out the gin bottle, and gave us a glass of gin each—he had then got hold of the man at the foot of the stairs; he was dragged out by the collar of his coat by two or three, the wife was one; but I could not take particular notice which of the servants did it—he was dragged all the way along, not lifted; and was laid all along in the court, flat on the ground, on his back—some one said,</p>

               <p>"Don't leave him so, as he has had a little drink, put him sitting up against the wall"—a policeman afterwards knocked at the door, and said, "There is a man lying dead outside your door, you must answer for this, for I saw him come in not long ago with two females"—Belasco said, "There has no man been in my house to-night of the sort; how do you know who has been in my house? I am the master of my house, and I think I ought to know best who has been in and out of it; he has not been in here to-night"—I went away, and the very first policeman I met I mentioned it to.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you do not know who dragged this man out of the house with Mrs. Belasco? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, two servants; I should know them if I were to see them; I know both of them; I do not know their names—Mrs. Belasco and another woman were taken up with the prisoner; I do not know that woman's name, but she was one who helped to drag him out—if she was in bed at the time, she got out of bed; she looked as if she had got out of bed; she had put on her clothes, I should say, she had a gown on, I could not tell what it was—she had not her night dress on; she had some clothes on, but I could not tell what, for I did not look—I swore to her on a former occasion; she was discharged by the Magistrate—the man had been drinking when we met him, we perceived that—I had not been in this brothel for some time—I did not know the people of the house; I knew the place—we did not learn whether he had got any money or not till we got to the brothel—we were not angry with him when we found he had not any money; we did not take him there for love—it was the people of the house who were angry, not us—I behaved and looked as quietly as I do now—the man did not appear angry when Mrs. Belasco said he should not lie on the sofa, not till she called him Irish, and a very insulting word—he did not put himself in a fighting attitude particularly, he flourished his hands, and said he would strike any one; that was not at any one particularly, it was at the women—he never struck any one; he was not nearer Mrs. Belasco when he flourished his hands than any other female—it was me who got him to the edge of the stairs—I was quite quiet all through, and quite gentle; I spoke as gently as I speak now—I said, "Come along with me, they are very insulting, we will go somewhere else"—I knew he had no money—I was close by him, not quite at the edge of the stairs—I swear Belasco was up stairs—I had never seen him before—I was by the side of the deceased when Belasco gave him the push—I have not said Belasco was a b—Jew, and I should like to have him transported; or that I could never get anything out of him but a glass of gin; I never said anything of the sort—I never said, "I should like to hang all the b—Jews in the country; all you can get out of them is a glass of gin"—most decidedly not; I never used that sort of language—I know a person named Elizabeth Fulcher, but I have never seen her since this occurrence—we could not go and get any drink with the man, it was too late; we did not try; we went straight to the Hop-gardens—I have gone by other names, but Alice Tillett is my right name—I was charged once, but it was very false—a gentleman went with me to a place, and gave me a pocket handkerchief, which he afterwards wanted back—I walked with him to the station, not knowing he wanted to lock me up—he gave his name and address; Williams, a tailor, in the Poultry—I was examined, and committed to New<lb/>gate; but the gentleman had given a wrong address, and did not appear on the trial.</p>

Q.</hi> Was Collins the girl who you say took him by the collar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a girl; not the girl who was charged before the police Magistrate; it was a dark girl with dark eyes, who squints—I did not notice which one in particular dragged him out—I saw the girl shake him, but did not see him afterwards, till he was in the middle of the stairs—the door opens inside the room—the man had had a glass or two, but was not much the worse for what he had had; he could walk, and he could speak—I thought he had some money—he was dressed like a mechanic—I was not drunk, nor was Tillett—we did not inquire of him whether he had any money—it was a brothel we went to at the Hop-gardens; we got in, but the servant would not allow us to stop—she said she did not let anybody in who had been drinking at all—it was the man who had been drinking—the servant at Belasco's asked him to go out of the room, and called him some Irish name—he struck no one; he hit at one of the women, but I do not know which one; and as he made the offer to hit, the servant immediately caught hold of him—I then went into the room, as I was frightened; and not a moment elapsed before he was tumbling down stairs—he would have gone out quietly enough if the girl had not interfered.</p>

I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the deceased—I found some slight bruises about his body, one on his right eye on the upper lid, a slight bruise on the white of the same eye, and a little fluid came out of his mouth, slight bruises on the upper gums, a slight bruise on the right breast, a slight bruise on the outside of his left elbow, and on his left knee—on examining the brain, I found blood effused on the surface, and a small quantity at the base, and in the ventricles; and the lungs were congested—I attribute his death to concus<lb/>sion of the brain—that might have been produced by a fall such as described—it might have been produced by blows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a vessel on the brain broken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Several vessels; I attribute that to concussion—it would be very likely to occur from a tumble down stairs by a drunken man; drunkenness is a very predisposing cause, it renders vessels much more likely to rupture—there was not suffi<lb/>cient external injury to account for the concussion which caused his death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married; my husband is a commercial traveller. I have known Mr. Belasco some time, and previous to his keeping a house of this description—I called to ask his wife a particular question on this night—it was about 11 o'clock, as near as I can recollect—I remained, as near as I can remember, two hours—I have a child, eleven years old, who is very ill, and I went to get an address at Gravesend from Mrs. Belasco—previous to Mr. Belasco coming home, there was no noise, excepting that there were people coming in and out—he came home about 12, with the man who came into Court with me just now (Turner); they came into the room where I was—afterwards, it might have been after 1, the parlour door opened, a person came and called Mrs. Belasco out, and said she was wanted up stairs—shortly after she went out I heard a noise; there seemed to be a contest up stairs—Mr. Belasco was in the room, and the other man—I heard Mrs. Belasco go up stairs, and heard her say distinctly, "Don't, don't!" and shortly afterwards there was a rumbling noise, as if some person had fallen—while that noise was taking place, Mr. Belasco was sitting in the parlour smoking his pipe, or he had been smoking, for there was his pipe on the table—he jumped off his chair, and went to the parlour door; I went with him and saw a man lying doubled up, all of a lump, with his head down, as well as I can remember, and his heels, I think, were towards the top of the stairs, as if he had fallen head forwards down the stairs; at that moment several females rushed down stairs, and I heard Mr. Belasco say, "What is the meaning of all this? I will have none of this nonsense in my house;" or something of that sort—he took the man by the arm, made use of a vulgar expression, such as "Old fellow, what is this?"and one of the females made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100075"/>
               <p>use of a vulgar cant phrase, meaning that it was all right—he said, "It is not all right; I am surprised at you, as a woman of the world, bringing a drunken man; you might get the house indicted; if you don't all go out, I will send for a policeman, and have you all put out"—he was not with the man as long as I have been speaking; he, merely for one moment, put his hand on his shoulder; and when the woman used that expression I said, "Mr. Belasco, you had better come in, and let the women settle it;" and then he shook him for a minute, and came into the parlour—he did not strike him in my presence; if he had struck him at the bottom of the stairs I must have seen it—he did not kick or strike him in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he shake him violently? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not; he put his hand slightly on the man's shoulder, and was in the act, as I suppose, of raising him, when I said, "You had better not interfere, let the women settle it among themselves"—he did not raise him, but imme<lb/>diately followed my advice—I did not see the man fall down stairs—I imagined Mrs. Belasco had fallen down stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then when you found it was only a man who had fallen down stairs, you thought it was a woman's affair? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought it was a drunken, disgraceful affair; and thought the women had better settle it—I staid till nearly 2 o'clock—I did not hear the policeman, or any voice at the door—I heard no voice saying, "Don't answer him"—I made no inquiry as to what had become of the man; it was not my business—I saw two women take him, one by each shoulder, and lift him towards the entry—I never saw Mr. Turner before; I think he left a little before I did—it was last Saturday week—I do not know which of us went away first—I went out of the room to go into Hart-street—we did not go out together; I do not know whether he left before me—I went there first; he came about half an hour after me, with Mr. Belasco—it was Mrs. Belasco that I went to ask the question of, and I asked her; that did not take me long—it was merely where she had been residing at Gravesend last summer, and she said that when her husband came home he would give me the direction—it was Everett, the town crier, of Gravesend; that was very soon given; but he had removed from there; and she said Mr. Belasco would give me the right direction—he came home at 12, and I asked him, and he answered me.</p>

On Saturday night, 10th April, the prisoner came to my brother's shop, about 9 o'clock—he asked for a leg of mutton—he was shown some—he said they were all too large for his family, and he chose a leg of lamb instead—it came to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said the leg of lamb was to be sent to 27, Worship-street—I said, "The boy shall take it directly"—when he gave me the note, I told him I was afraid my brother could not give change—I gave my brother the note, he gave the prisoner change, and he left—the leg of lamb was given to the boy, George Cunningham, to take home—I should think the prisoner was in the shop ten minutes, I cannot exactly say—on the Monday week following I went to the House of Detention, and there saw and recognized the prisoner—he is the person that came for the leg of mutton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of 108, Curtain-road, Shoreditch. My sister was at my place on Saturday, 10th April—in the course of the evening, about 9 o'clock, I think, a man came in for a leg of mutton—it was the prisoner—he at last selected a leg of lamb to be sent to 27, Worship-street—my sister, who was taking the money, handed me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for change, and I gave the prisoner 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of it—I put the note into my purse and placed it in the till—I had no other note in the house—the prisoner said, "The boy can go with me"—I gave the boy the lamb, and told him to take it to 27, Worship-street, and he went after the prisoner—Worship-street is the next street—the prisoner went that way when he left the shop—I think he was in the shop altogether rather more than ten minutes—I noticed the</p>

Pocklington and Lacy, in Smithfield, and showed it to Mr. Lacy—it did not go out of my sight—I then put it into my pocket, and at 6 the same evening I took it to the police station in Featherstone-street and gave it to Evans, the policeman—before doing so, I put my name at the back—on the Thursday following I went to the House of Detention—I there saw twelve or fourteen prisoners, and among them was the prisoner—he was the last one I saw—I did not want to see any more—I believed him to be the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a German physician, and live at 4, Ovington-terrace, Brompton. The female prisoner was in my service; she entered it on 11th Feb—I met with her, in consequence of an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, at the Yorkshire Grey Coffee-house, in Lower Thames-street—I asked her if she had put the advertisement in the paper—she said yes—I thought she was a superior woman, and said a place of all work was not fit for her, she was more fit for a lady's maid—she said she had been accustomed to work from her infancy, and did not mind it—I said I lived alone with my wife, and she could try the place if she liked—I took her into my service on Wednesday, 11th—the next day, between 4 and 5 o'clock, she asked to go out to make some little purchases, and she was gone about an hour, but in the mean time I found she had left the street door open—on her return, she asked me if I or my wife had been in the kitchen—I said no, but reprimanded her for having left the door open, and cautioned her I had been robbed twice before, and that it was not like Germany—she was then in a great <hi rend="italic">flurry</hi>, and said she had lost a valuable brooch which had been given her by her brother-in-law—she said a beggar had come to the window, and she opened it to drive him away, and must have left it open and the brooch lying there—she then reminded me that there had been three coats hanging in the passage—I only found two, and then we missed a teapot and some forks—the next day my wife missed a sovereign from her purse, and a great part of the bills on the file were taken away and burnt—on the 16th, five days after the female entered our service, I saw the man standing at the end of the terrace where I reside, and my wife pointed him out to me as a friend of the woman's, who had called several times at my house in my ab<lb/>sence—he had a parcel under his arm—I then went home, and saw him come to the house and have some conversation with the female, who then asked me for some paper to write a letter to her mother, just to say she was com<lb/>fortable and happy, as her brother-in-law was waiting outside and was going that very day to Germany; that was between 11 and 12—between 12 and 1 I sent her out to fetch some flour, and she never returned—she went out rather heavily dressed to go just round the corner—my suspicions were roused, I went up stairs, and missed my wife's jewel case and its contents, some of my wife's dresses and shawls, and some spoons—there were a great many rings in the jewel box, and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I gave information to the police—the female told me she had been living six years with a counsellor on the Continent, and gave me this written character with a seal to it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which is very satisfactory—the house is my dwelling house, and in the parish of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon of Westminster Hos<lb/>pital. On 12th March, about 10 o'clock, Collins was brought there bleeding from the abdomen, and from the left arm, produced by a large number of shots which were scattered all over his person; one shot was in one of the veins of the left arm—I removed all I could; here are some which I found on the floor of the ward, and some came away from his bowels two or three days afterwards—some had entered deeply, some are in now—I found fifty or sixty shots in him, he was spotted all over like a pudding—it was a very serious wounding; he was in danger of his life for at least a fortnight—I have continued to attend him ever since—he remained a month or six weeks in the Hospital, he is an outpatient now—he has a good deal of irritation yet—I found some shots near the heart, that is, under the skin opposite to it; but there were muscles and ribs to get through before the heart could be reached.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at West-green, Tottenham; I am single. About 13th or 14th March last I sent some furniture to the last witness's premises for sale—I did not require a sum of money in advance, nor did I receive any—I did not receive 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not after the sale receive 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the prisoner, nor any sum at all, on the sale of those goods; I have not received any money for any part of them—this receipt is not my handwriting—I remember the last witness coming to me with this receipt—I complained to him on seeing this receipt that I had not been paid the money—I did not authorise any person to put my name to this receipt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On Saturday night, 24th April, I closed my house after 12 o'clock—I had then an iron chest in the back parlour, containing 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and about-3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in halfpence, and two or three florins—the coppers were in the lid of a large tin grocer's tea canister—I came down next morning between half past 6 and 25 minutes to 7, merely to see the time, not to get up, and on looking at the shop clock, I cast my eye through the glass in the parlour door, and saw the back parlour window open, and the two back doors—I went to the front door, but could not see a policeman—I went up stairs and dressed myself—I had been awake about a quarter of an hour before I went down, but did not hear any noise, nor yet during the night—I waited about a quarter of an hour before the policeman came by—I did not even open the doors till he came, so that there should be nothing disturbed—I then found the chest was gone altogether—it was twenty-four inches square each way, across, depth, and length, and the chest itself weighed about 2 cwt. without the contents—I could not lift it myself—there are two back doors—they were both open—one leads from the bakehouse into the back yard, and the other closes the back yard up, and then there is a long yard, ninety feet long—the bakehouse has a window, that is never fastened—a person coming in at the bakehouse window might have opened the doors, and got into the back parlour—that was the way they came in, but not the way they went out—my people come in at the</p>

               <p>front door to do the work of the bakehouse—Woolnough worked for me as a baker on the premises, and had been in my service up to Easter Tuesday, when he absented himself of his own accord—he called on the Thursday after for his money, which amounted to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and again on the following Wednesday, which was the Wednesday before the robbery—he then said he had answered an advertisement in the newspaper for an engagement at Coventry, and would I give him a character—I told him I had no objection, and in the evening he said he was d—d <hi rend="italic">hard up</hi>, and was fit for anything, it did not matter what—he said he had removed either to East Ham or West Ham, and he intended to <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> the baking business, and go into the milk trade.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, K</hi> 21). On Sunday morning, 25th April, I went to the prosecutor's house about 9 o'clock—I traced footmarks from the back part of the house across a large garden ground at the side of the fence to some new buildings leading into Grove-street—there were a great number of footsteps; the distance was from 150 to 200 yards—they were the marks of two persons, going towards the premises and returning from them—I traced them to the back gate of the prosecutor's premises—the ground be<lb/>tween there and the new buildings was garden ground, recently dug up—there was a fence on the western side of the field—the footsteps were in that direction, as if they had made, as well as they could, to the fence, and then kept under the shelter of the fence to the termination of it—the fence sepa<lb/>rated the garden ground from some ground which is intended to be built on—the footsteps went partly along the fence on the garden side—I was pre<lb/>sent, and assisted to draw this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is correct—the garden ground is here described as Mr. Lake's garden ground, and the fence and unfinished houses are there marked—there is a cart put down at a certain spot; I did not see a cart there, but I saw the tracks of a cart there—at the turning of the fence I observed a somewhat square mark on the ground, about eighteen inches by eleven or twelve inches, as if something very heavy had rested there, and six yards from there I saw marks of a cart's wheels—the space between the termination of the footmarks and where the cart stood was covered with lime rubbish—I traced the track of the cart wheel into Grove-street, and then into North-street, in a direction towards Bow-common-lane—as soon as I got into North-street I lost the track among a number of other cart tracks; it was then going in the direction of Bow-common-lane—I afterwards went with Huxtap, a constable, to the place where I first saw the track of the wheels, and he and I traced them again as far as orth-street—I afterwards went with him to Holmes's yard, in Bow-common-lane, and saw a cart there which he identified as the cart he had seen—I saw the name of "William Holmes, cow keeper, Bow-common-lane," on it; it is about a mile and a quarter from the unfinished houses, and nearly a mile from where I lost the track—I went to that yard in consequence of information from Huxtap—it is near the canal bridge—I think it is called <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Jonson's-bridge—it was about 10 on the Sunday morning, when I got there—I went again on the Monday morning, about 11, saw Holmes, and asked him if that was his cart, pointing to it—he said it was his cart—I said, "Did you lend it to anybody yesterday morning?"—he said he had neither lent it or let it—I said, "Where was it at 6 yesterday morning?"—he said, "Where it is now"—I said I should be able to prove to the contrary; I do not think he made any reply to that—I told him I was a sergeant of police, and that there had been a heavy robbery committed, and that the stolen property was conveyed away in his cart, and unless he could give me a more satisfactory</p>

               <p>account of it than that, I should take him into custody—he said if the cart was out it was without his knowledge; it might have been taken out and brought back again without his knowledge, as the gates were not fastened—I said, "What time did you get up to milk, yesterday morning?"—he said, "Six o'clock"—I said, "What time did you go out?"—he said, "Seven"—I then said, "If the cart was as you say, it would be impossible for you to come out as you did without seeing whether the cart was there or no; you must have passed within two feet of the shafts of the cart," and I said, "If the cart was taken out without your knowledge, it would be impossible for it to be put back without your knowledge"—there are gates to the yard, and the cart was opposite the gates at the further end of the yard—a person coming out at the back, door, and going to the barn where the cows were, would have to pass within two feet of the shafts, unless he tried to avoid it—I then took him to the station—we went through North-street, and I pointed out the tracks of the wheels to him; he said he knew nothing about it—he was examined next day before Mr. Yardley, and remanded—after he was remanded he sent for me, and said, "I am very sorry for the lies I told you, I feel myself in a very awkward position; I will tell you the truth: I did lend the cart to <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Jacobs; Jacobs and another man came to me about 5 yesterday morning, and asked me to lend them a horse and cart, as they wanted to go out for a ride; I told them I had not a horse; they asked me if I would lend them a cart, and they would get a horse"—he said Jacobs returned with the cart at a quarter before 7, without any horse—he said they took the cart away, and he did not know the other man—I have known Jacobs some years; he is known as <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Jacobs—on the Monday evening I met Jacobs in Northampton-street, in the custody of sergeant Smith—I asked him if he knew a person of the name of Holmes, a cowkeeper, in Bow-common-lane—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you borrow a cart of him yes<lb/>terday morning?"—he said, "No"—I said, "He is in custody, and he says you did"—he said he knew nothing about it—after the charge was taken at the station, and he was about to be locked up, he said, "Where is Holmes? can I see him?"—I said, "No, you cannot; for he is either in the van or about to start"—I knew Woolnough when he worked for Mr. Humphries—on the night of Sunday, 26th, I was watching his house and saw him go in—I had previously been to the door and inquired—on Monday evening I went to the house and searched it—I found it in a very destitute state, and his wife assured me I should find nothing there—there was no food in the cupboard; there were chairs to sit on—by "destitute," I mean without food—I afterwards saw Woolnough in Puddifoot's custody on Bow-common—on Monday, about 7, I asked him how he accounted for the money he had in his possession, his family being in such a destitute state (the constable who had taken him had found money on him)—he said he had saved it while in Mr. Humphries' employ—I asked him when he was in Poplar last; he said, "Last Saturday"—when I examined Holmes's cart, there was a <hi rend="italic">dent</hi> on the top rail as if something heavy had been placed on it, and about an inch and a half below that there was a piece chipped off the panel about an inch and a half long, and from that there was a graze as if something heavy or sharp, or the corner of something, had grazed down to the bottom of the cart; that was in the front of the cart, inside, down into the body of the cart—in my judgment, the corner of the iron chest described was a very likely thing to have caused that graze.</p>

On Sunday morning, 25th April, about 6 o'clock, I was on duty in North-street, Poplar, at some distance at the back of Mr. Humphrey's house—I have seen this plan, and believe it to be correct; there is a cart marked upon the plan—I saw a cart at about that spot, at a few minutes before 6, the shafts were on the ground; there was no horse to it, but I saw one feeding in a field close by; it was loose and not harnessed, the field was fenced in—I saw two men near the cart, Jacobs was one, I do not know the other—I have not seen him since, they were both standing by the shafts of the cart—Jacobs took a piece of hay out of the cart, and took it across to the horse that was grazing, the horse was about fifteen yards from the cart—Jacobs spoke to me—he said, "Good morning, Sir, it is a fine day, I am waiting for a party, and we are going out for a ride"—I went across to the cart, and said good morning to the man who standing at the cart—I noticed the name on the cart, and cast my eye into it, but saw nothing but a piece of oilskin, or an oilskin coat—I cannot say whether there was anything in the cart; if there was it must have been under the oilskin; the oilskin was lying with one part over the front of the cart, and the other</p>

               <p>not form any judgment about it—suppose you tied up your shirt in a hand<lb/>kerchief, it might be the shape of that—I afterwards saw Holmes come out of his gate with his milk cans in his hands, as if he had just come from milk<lb/>ing; he emptied some water out of them, and asked me the time—I told him as near 7 as possible—Jacobs walked up the lane—I did not see whether he and Holmes spoke to each other, they were near enough to have done so—Jacobs turned back, and went to the gate, and walked within a few yards of Holmes; he did not stop a minute—Perry was with me, and we walked with Jacobs up the lane into the Mile End-road—we stopped by the Canal Bridge, while I went down a court to see after a man, who ought to have gone to work with me—a policeman passed us on the bridge—Jacobs was then standing at the wall, with his hands leaning on the wall—he had the handkerchief in his hands—it was not hanging at the water side of the bridge, but between him and the wall—he did not conceal it in the least; he carried it openly—I then bid him good morning, and left him.</p>

I was standing outside my own shop door—I heard the screams of "Murder!"—I went to the corner of the street, and went down—I saw Terry and two other men <hi rend="italic">hustling</hi> Miss Coffield in what you call a very rough manner—they took her, and tried to throw her out of the window, but she got on the call—she had one leg inside, and they brought a shutter or door, and put it across the window, and put it on her thigh—they tried to nail it; but the persons outside tried to push it down, and I believe they did do it, and pulled her out—she was in a fainting state, and I believe she was carried away—the conduct of Terry and the persons inside appeared very violent.</p>

I know the prisoner—on 24th March I let the prisoner a cart—he agreed to pay me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month for it—he said he had taken a business at Bexley, and he wished to transact business with the cart—no time was fixed for him to keep it—three weeks after that I received information, in consequence of which I went to the police-station, and gave information—on 3rd May I saw the cart again—Mr. Flicker then had it—the prisoner had no authority to make away with it—I did not see him again till he was at the police-station—I had not been paid anything for the loan of the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's uncle. I consider that for the last fire years he has been a lunatic—symptoms of insanity were first observed by his family immediately after his return from South America—that was in the year '48—he said he had lost all his energy; he had got no inside left, and that he always required something in his hands to support or balance him—in March, 1849, I conveyed him to Bethlehem Lunatic Asylum—he remained there till Dec. of the same year, and was then discharged as uncured—he was then taken home by an aunt—she persuaded his mother to take him out, and said she would make an experiment by keeping him at her house, to see if she could not do something for him—I saw him frequently at Bethlehem, and afterwards at his aunt's, almost daily; certainly every week—the state of his mind seemed to get worse; and after a week or two his aunt was very glad to get rid of him, and his mother procured an order for his admission into the County Lunatic Asylum, at Wandsworth—he went there in Feb., 1850, and remained about twelve months—I think he was discharged in Feb., 1851—he was discharged uncured—from then up to the time of this unfortunate occurrence he lived with his mother—I have been in the habit of seeing him almost weekly during that time—his mother was my sister—I was constantly urging her to put him again in confinement; that he was not fit to be at large—on the very Tuesday previous to this occurrence he came over to me for a small allowance which I was in the habit of making him; and then his manner was so very strange, that I sent a message the following day to my sister, to urge her by all means to put him in confinement—I was satisfied something would occur; she sent me word that she would do so; and it was arranged that he was to be placed in confinement the very night this took place—I have not the least doubt that he is insane at the present time—I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he attended by any medical man after his discharge, in Feb. 1851, from the County Lunatic Asylum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not—I saw him on the Tuesday, previous to this occurrence—I have frequently seen him since he has been in prison—I last saw him last Friday—I have had conver<lb/>sation with him there—I consider that he has never had lucid intervals since he came from America—when I saw him last Friday, in Newgate, he was more composed and sedate than I had seen him for years—I had seen him at Horsemonger-lane, on the Thursday previous, in the presence of Mr. Keene, the governor, when he was in one of his bad fits—he was sullen, and did not care about seeing me, and wanted to leave the room immediately—when I saw him in Newgate it was not in the presence of any medical man—it was in the presence of Mr. Cope.</p>

I know the prisoner—he lived with Mr. Burmister six years ago—on 26th March I went to bed at 10 o'clock—my fellow-servant, George Reynolds, was the last person up—in the morning the clock struck six as I came down stairs—I found the door at the top of the kitchen stairs, the breakfast-room door, and the larder window, open—any<lb/>body could have got into the house by that window—some wire had been pushed aside, and the bar taken away—it was shut at 9 on the night before—I found my master's cash-box in the breakfast-room, open, and a bag and a bunch of keys—I called up Reynolds and my master—I found a lamp in the larder, which was usually kept in the pantry cupboard.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Roehampton, in the parish of Putney. On Wednesday evening, 21st April, I left Roehampton about 9 o'clock, or a quarter past, to go to town with my family—I returned about twenty minutes after 2; the carriage drove up to the door about that time—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100141"/>
               <p>I went into the drawing room a few steps for the purpose of getting bedroom handle sticks—everything was perfectly safe then—there were no signs of fire, nor, that I could see, of robbery—about an hour afterwards, I was alarmed by a maid knocking at my door—I got up, went into the drawing room, and found it filled with suffocating smoke, and the opposite side of the room was in flames, which extended to the window—an ottoman occupied a recess between the fireplace and the window, and there were curtains opposite which go the whole length of the room—the curtains up to the coving of the ceiling were on fire—the coving is a sort of wooden canopy fastened to the window; it is part of the wall, I think—most likely the architect built it—it is not part of the curtains, it is boards nailed against the wall, and fastened in the ordinary way—those boards were on fire—the principal body of fire was in the corner in that part of the room, but there was also fire in that part some—what nearer to the fireplace at the back of the ottoman—it extended from the window round the corner partly to the fireplace, limiting itself to those parts which were wood—where there was skirting board it was on fire; the skirt<lb/>ing board was only partial at the back of the ottoman—the heat was intense—I did not go in, but shut the door, and gave orders to my wife to save the lives of the children first—it was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before we managed to get the fire under—a large picture, which was above thirty feet from the fire, was entirely charred and destroyed—there is a fire-place at each end of the room—there was a clock at one end, which stopped at 18 minutes to 4—I also missed a pendulum clock from the mantelpiece on the other side, which stops directly it is moved—I saw it after it was found—it had stopped at 29 minutes past 3, which was about ten minutes before I was alarmed—the clocks kept very exact time indeed—the legs of the otto-man were entirely destroyed, and the floor was destroyed at the further corner—I missed a large quantity of valuable property, some of which I have not recovered yet—I had seen most of it the evening before, on two tables at the further corner of the room—they were some seals, a silver gilt snuffbox, and some instruments, some of which were as far as could be from the fire, quite at the opposite corner—I missed nothing from that part of the room where the fire was; that part was entirely hedged in by furniture, two arm chairs, a sofa, and a small table—the sofa and chairs were within an inch of touching; a man must have gone round them, or stepped over them to get to where the fire was—the nearest point to the clock, which was carried off, at which I ob<lb/>served the fire to have gone, was six feet from where it had stood—the candles used in the drawing room are all wax, and cut to fit the candlesticks—stearine candles are used in the school room, and only in that room—several things were missed from the school room, which I have since seen—from the school room you can get round from the drawing room by a door; you can get round in two ways—a stearine candle was found on the same console table as the silver bedroom candlesticks bad been on—a policeman showed me a wax candle found in the shrubbery, which was precisely like the others—it was cut, and fitted the silver candlesticks—my family were very much alarmed—I have been informed that the prisoner lived there with Mr. Thomson, before I took the house of Mr. Thomson, seven or eight years ago, but I have seen him on two occasions only; the first time was when I arrested him at the India House for a burglary—I do not know his writing—I received a letter on 28th April, six days after this transaction.</p>

To the Commissioners of Police, Great Scotland Yard, Charing Cross—Sirs, I beg to state I heard this morning the awful news of Mr. A. J. Hankey's residence being robbed and afterwards set fire to, and that suspicion at present lights on me. God is my judge I never did entertain any malice or revenge for that gentleman, or any one allied to him. I must certainly confess that my peace of mind has been much unsettled since he was so very anxious to prosecute me for Mr. Day's burglary. I was innocent of that, but guilty of receiving it. Through my former conviction, that prevents roe from facing my accusers, and I have no other means of finishing a life which has been a burden to me ever since I first stepped on my native shore after an absence of twelve years. Since the first week of my leaving the Hospital, I refrained from coming to Roehampton; family quarrels was my sole reason for so doing, and I hope God will forgive me and others. I have been wrongly judged by those in power, and sooner than be remanded, even on suspicion, I will end that life so eagerly sought for by the bloodhounds and perjuries that beset me; but let me, ere I conclude, remark the sole cause of my untimely end I lay to Mr. A. J. Hankey, and my only wish and last prayer is for him not to let revenge follow me beyond the grave, or to any of my parents or relations. May God forgive him, as I hope forgiveness at the last day of judgment, where rich and poor, guilty and innocent, will meet their true acquittal. Farewell, Gentlemen, and all the world; I leave this innocent. May God have mercy on my soul.

I went out with beer to Mr. Stanley, a cus<lb/>tomer, about a quarter past 9 o'clock in the evening of 20th of April—as I was returning I met the prisoner—he took me by the collar, turned me round towards a gaslight, a little way off, opposite the fence belonging to the work-house, and said, "You are the person I have been looking for for five or six years; you are one of the parties amongst others that have had connection with my wife"—I said, "My good man, you are mistaken; I neither know you or have seen you before, or your wife either"—that was true; I had never, to my knowledge, seen him before, or his wife—I declare, most solemnly, he was an entire stranger to me—he struck me on the bridge of my nose, knocked me down on my back in the road, and began kicking me—he kicked me on the jaw, on the eye, right over the eye, and on the other side of the face, and the ribs—I could not see whether he had boots or shoes on—the last kick that I remember receiving was in the mouth, and my teeth were loosened—he continued kicking me, as far as I know, till some one came up—I became nearly insensible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Flynn, of 8, Nelson-street; the last witness lodged with us. On 27th March, between 6 and 7 o'clock I saw the prisoner opposite to our house—I went out to close the shutters, and she called me a by Cork w----e—I had said nothing to her—I went to her, put my hand on her shoulder to put her away, and she fell down—I did not see anything in her hand—as she fell, she drew her hand across my fore<lb/>head, and afterwards I found I was cut—Sheen came out, went to her, and she took Sheen, and held her by her clothes, and drew the knife right across her nose—I saw Sheen offer a blow at her, but cannot say whether it hit or not.</p>

On 12th May, about 4 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Trafalgar-street, Walworth, and saw Mr. Revel, who called my attention to the prisoner—I took him into custody, and took him to Mr. Williams's shop—the shutters were then in their places—a piece of beef of 17 lbs. was shown me—I have known the prisoner by sight-two or three years ago he was then in the service of Mr. Head, a butcher, at Walworth—he denied having been at the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever heard anything against his character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I know that a great number of witnesses were here to give him a character, but are now gone—I saw the shutters tumble down when we went back.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of a blow was requisite to knock them down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A pretty <hi rend="italic">stiff</hi> blow; they fell immediately—it seemed a particular way of striking them that made them fall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Williams, of 5, York-place, Walworth; it is his dwelling-house, and in the parish of St. Mary, Newing<lb/>ton. About 4 o'clock on the morning of 12th May I was called up, and found two of the shutters out of their places; one hung on the rail, and the other stood before the other shutters—they were put back in their places—I am in the habit of putting up the shutters—they were not, in my opinion, in such a position as to have been brought there by a tap from outside; they appeared as if some one had put their band at the bottom and pulled them out—I had fastened the shutters myself the night before—there was a piece of beef at the back of the shop when I went to bed, and in the morning that was lying on the block in front of the window—it had been removed about five yards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you the last up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I cannot say who was—I left the shop about 10 o'clock—the shutters have been blown down twice—I was the last person who had anything to do with the beef—I fastened the shutters in the usual manner.</p>
