                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Alexander Stow, who keeps a cigar shop in Barbican. About a quarter before three o'clock in the after-noon of the 24th of July, the prisoner, with two others, came into the shop—they purchased one pennyworth of tobacco—there was a contention which should make use of it—I turned my back, and the prisoner lifted up the lid of a box, took some cigars out, and put them into his pocket—I turned, and asked him to take them from his pocket, which he did, and said, did I mean to say they belonged to me?—I said, yes, I did, as I saw him take them—he said, "I know the lady will forgive me, as I took them through dis-tress"—I called ray husband, who was in the parlour—he came out and took hold of him—he sent for a policeman—the other two had left previous to the prisoner's taking the cigars.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Packard Clements, of Judd-street. At half-past one o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th of July, the prisoners came, and Williams asked the price of some frock-bodies—I showed them some, and Melgrove bought one—she then bought a pair of gloves—after that they jointly purchased a remnant of Irish linen—they afterwards saw some table-cloths hanging on the top of the shop—Williams asked the price—I showed her one, and she thought it too high—I showed her some others—there was one that was soiled—Melgrove was sitting by her side—I then showed a table-cloth that was on the counter—I went to ask the least I could take for it, and as I was turning round I saw Wil<lb/>liams take this table-cloth from the counter, and deposit it under her shawl—I told George Wilson she had taken it; and as soon as she saw me tell Wilson she appeared very much agitated, and left the shop—Wilson fol<lb/>lowed her, and took the table-cloth from under her arm, and she was brought back to the shop—Melgrove said to Williams, "Don't flurry your<lb/>self"—this is the table-cloth.</p>

On Saturday, the 17th of July, about nine o'clock in the evening I went to No. 9, Plumtree-court, Shoe-lane, with Fink, Farrow, and Humphries, police-constables—the street-door was open—I went to the front room, second floor—the room-door was fastened by a small table being against it—I forced it open, went in, and the prisoners were there—Beckwith was sitting on a chair in front of a clear fire, with nothing on but his trow<lb/>sers—he had no shirt on—he had what appeared to be a white mould in his left hand, made of plaster of Paris—immediately that I went in he threw it on the floor, jumped on it, and broke it into several pieces, then laid hold of an iron spoon which was between the bars of the fire, the bowl of which was red hot and full of white metal in a fluid state, he threw the contents all about the floor, and at the same time, with the other hand, swept a quantity of counterfeit sixpences off the table—part of the metal which was thrown from the spoon was picked up—I took up nine sixpences myself, two of them quite hot—I picked up several pieces of the plaster of Paris which he threw down, but they had no impression on them—the prisoner Foot was standing up, with her gown off, washing at the table—she cried out, "You b—r, <hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> you b—y b—, you have sold us, but we will tell, you b—, where you make"—she said this to several prostitutes, who were at the door, which was open—there was no man there—<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> is a man they know among themselves—Beckwith made use of similar language several times, saying, "It is that b—y b—r, <hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> that has sold us."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Beckwith</hi>. I was standing up when you came in, did you find the spoon in the fire? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, you pulled it out.</p>

I went with Penny—I entered the room at the same time as him, and saw Beckwith sitting in a chair in front of a very clear fire, about three feet from it—he had something white in his left hand, which he threw down, jumped on it, and broke it into se<lb/>veral pieces—I laid hold of him—at the same time he took from between the bars of the grate an iron spoon with metal in a fluid state, and threw it up, the contents of which I took off the floor, and at the same time he swept off the table a quantity of counterfeit sixpences with his hand—he was sitting between the table and fire-place—I afterwards picked up some of the fragments of what he threw down—two of them have letters on them—I produce a counterfeit sixpence, and part of a <hi rend="italic">get,</hi> separated from a sixpence, I have a sixpence which it fits—I took up the sixpence myself—it was quite hot, and so was the <hi rend="italic">get</hi>—I picked up some of the white metal which he threw from the spoon, and produce it—I searched him, and found a knife in his trowsers' pocket—it has some white spots on it similar to plaster-of-Paris—when I entered the room, Foot was standing at a small table, washing—it was the same table as the sixpences were on—the tub was at one end, and the sixpences at the other—Foot said it was that <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> had sold them, and she would sell him, for she knew where he made them—Beckwith used similar expressions—they were both taken into custody.</p>

I was called up about half-past seven o'clock, on the morning of the 7th of August, by Isbell—I went immediately into my study, and found it in very great confusion—papers which I kept in my drawers were strewed about the floor—I had five or six desks in the study, all of which were broken open—a box of bronze medals, of the victories of the Duke of Wellington, was gone from my brother's desk, which was not locked—two gold seals were taken from my desk, which was broken open—a letter, which I had left sealed over-night, was broken open, and some money which it contained taken out—I also missed a pencil-case, a gold ring, and a pair of cloth boots which I had left at my bed-room door when I went to bed the night before—a pair of shoes were found near the parlour-door, which did not belong to any of the family—the value of the articles I lost is rather above 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the tops of the candlesticks, the snuffers and tray, were gone from the parlour—they were not silver—they belong to my father, whose name is Robert—it is his dwelling-house—I do not pay the rent, but reside with him—a hat of my brother's, Robert Charles Brown, was also gone—I examined the staircase window, and it appeared to have been opened from the out<lb/>side, at the bottom—it appeared to have had great force applied to it—a new brass fastening had been put to it a few days before, and that was broken short in the middle, without breaking the glass—I saw it fastened overnight, when I went to bed—I observed two clothes-props, one against the back door, and one above, as if they had been used to climb up by—I have since seen the boots and medals at Queen-square.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the B division of police. I re<lb/>ceived information of this robbery—in consequence of something I learnt I went on Saturday morning, 14th August, at half-past sis o'clock, to a front room, first floor, at No. 9, in the Almonry, Westminster—I knocked at the door—the prisoner got out of bed and opened it—he was undressed—I told him I came there for the purpose of taking him into custody on another</p>

               <p>charge, and told him to dress himself, and accompany me—while he was dressing I searched his clothes, and found in his waistcoat pocket this box of bronze medals, and in his trowsers pocket two duplicates, one for a hat, pawned at Mr. Roberts's, in York-street, Westminster—I found this pair of cloth boots by his bed-side—he said they were his—I looked into a drawer, and found several keys, and among them this, which I showed to Isbell—I examined the prosecutor's house on the Saturday morning, and found it had been entered by the staircase-window at the back—I have not the slightest doubt of that—some blunt instrument had been used to prize it up—it had broken the bolt—the back of the house looks into the New Road, Chelsea—there is a back wall, which can be got over—I received this pair of shoes, found in the house, from Isbell, and also a hat—I found some foot-marks in the garden at the back of the house, leading to the itaircase window—I compared the shoes Isbell gave me with those marks, and they exactly corresponded—I have not the slightest doubt those shoes made those marks—I afterwards showed these shoes to the prisoner, and he wore them from the station to the office, where he claimed them as hit own—he wanted the cloth boots to put on, which I would not permit, and he claimed these at the office—they appeared to fit him precisely.</p>

In consequence of informa<lb/>tion, about five o'clock on Thursday, the 19th, I watched the back of the prosecutors' premises—I did not see Rice come out of the warehouse—I saw him at the top of Bow-lane, about forty yards off—he crossed to Lawrence-lane, and went up to Blossom's inn gateway, where there is a public-house, and I lost sight of him for five or six minutes—when he came back Hughes was in his company—they turned out of the gateway, and on the left hand there is a court which goes into Milk-street from Lawrence-lane—they went up there together—I ran round Milk-street, and came up the court—they were just entering a dark court called Mumford-court, which goes under a house—I passed them, and returned in about a quarter of a minute—as they stood in the court one said to the other, "We must have a drop of something"—I ran to Lawrence-lane, and saw Hughes in company with a young woman—I followed them to the end of Moorgate-street, where he put the young woman into an omnibus—I followed him—as he was coming back I felt his pockets, and felt something in both of them—I took him by the arm, and said, "What have you got here, you have got something weighty?"—he said, "No, I have not, who are you?" —I found three of these packages in each of his two hind pockets, and two in his waistcoat, making these eight—I after that took Rice at the warehouse—I asked him for the key of his lodging—he referred me to his sister—I went to the place where he told me, and his sister turned out to be the woman I saw go with Hughes to the omnibus.</p>

                  </hi>. I occupy that cottage. I was awoke about three o'clock in the morning, on the 12th of July, by a noise on the roof—I came out, and saw some one on the chimney of the next cottage—I said, "Hoy," and he let himself down, I suppose into the other yard—I went to bed again, and a little before four, heard a noise again—I got up and saw the prisoner down just by the privy—he ran away and left this lead, which I gave to the policeman—the lead was then on the ground, and the prisoner was treading on it, and the lead was gone from off the house—the prisoner is the same man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wharfinger at Carpenter Smith's Wharf. I remember a truss being found on the wharf, for Penzance—I do not re<lb/>member the direction on it—nothing had been paid for that truss, as no entry had been made in our books of it—I have he bottom was not written bill has come from our office, but the writing at the bottom was not written by any one authorised thorised by us—I am quite sure of that—there is no one in the concern whose initials are G.H.—it would appear that a blank bill was given to some person, and they have fabricated this recipt—any per<lb/>son could obtain one of these bills authorised applying at the wharf—I can say this is not the writing of any person authourised by us, from a knowledge of their hand-writing and signature—I think there are half a dozen per<lb/>sons authorised to sign receipts, clerks and pricipals—their names are, Richard Wilson, myself, Thomas Dare, Richard Martin Wilson, Thomas Wilson, and John George Dare—no one else is authorised to sign or such a receipt, and the money would in the regular course be paid to one or other of those parties, but to no one else—I found this truss in the warehouse—it might be deposited in the warehouse without its being perceived, or a car<lb/>man might pitch it down and go away, and the men on the wharf might take it into the warehouse, expecting he would return to pay the wharfage—it is usual when men bring goods to have a note—the man on the wharf receives the package, and signs the note in pencil, the note is brought into the counting-house, and from note the wharfage is paid.</p>

I saw the de<lb/>ceased on Thursday evening, the 5th of August—she appeared to be dying from the effect of concussion of the brain—her breathing was un<lb/>easy, and the pupil was fixed—in consequence of what I heard, I made a particular observation of her head and face—I noticed a slight contusion on the outer angle of the right eye—the left eye was severely blackened—there was a bruise on the upper lip, and an extensive contusion on the left temple—she had a great deal of hair for an old woman, and it was difficult to ascertain the limits of it—the right side of the body was wholly paralyzed—there was no fracture or dislocation of either shoulder—I only saw her that evening—my impression was she would not live till the next morning—the prisoner was present—there were a great many people in the room—an observation was made in his presence, that she had been pushed down and fallen against the mangle—I cannot say who said that—I assisted at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and agree with Mr. Burch's evidence—the quantity of extravasated blood was very large—I suppose the clot of blood and the <hi rend="italic">serum</hi> which had separated from it, must have been at least six ounces; and the clot of blood was so florid, and the separation so perfect between the solid and watery parts, that I think the effusion must have taken place very rapidly, and must have pressed so much on the brain as to put a stop to her power of speech and motion—the effusion on the brain</p>

I was at Wilson's public-house on the 3rd of August, between one and two o'clock—the prisoner and his wife were there quarrelling about a hat—I saw her make a blow at her husband, and knock his hat off—she made use of very bad language—she appeared to have been drinking, but neither of them were to say tipsy—he went away from her into the back tap-room —she followed him—I followed, fearing they might have blows—she made an attempt at his face again, and his hat fell off—she then stumbled back and fell against the table—the kit side of her head, near the temple, fell against the table—she hit against the table—nothing more happened—she went home with the prisoner—I went to the house again between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, with my husband—the prisoner was then sitting alongside John Campbell, on a barrel, and in about ten minutes his wife came in—she flew at him again—he put his band to keep her away, and said "Take her away from me"—she made towards him again—he put his hand against her breast, and she fell on the floor—she was picked up by a man named Farmer—she was then senseless—it was full twenty minutes before she came to herself—she went away—I saw no more of her—I did not see Mrs. Wilson there at the time, but she might be there.</p>

On the 19th of July, about twenty minutes to one o'clock in the night, I was in the City-road, going home—as I was coming by Windsor-terrace, towards the Angel, the prisoners met me—there was another in the gang—I only met two who I identify—I did not see any other person particularly—I saw nothing of them before they came up—they rushed on me momentarily, and Evans hit me a very powerful blow on my right hand, which was very bad with the gout—I had an oppor<lb/>tunity</p>

               <p>of seeing the person who struck me at the time—it was a very fine night—I swear it was Evans—I had never seen him before—I had a large silk glove on my hand, and a silk handkerchief lightly folded round it, and momentarily they were taken off my hand by Evans, and passed in<lb/>stantly over my right shoulder to Lewis, who stood behind me—I had no opportunity of seeing the face of the third person, but these two I saw—the instant my handkerchief was taken, I turned round, and being a very fine night, I then had the opportunity of seeing Lewis—Evans then seized me inside my neckcloth with one hand, and gave me a blow on the sto<lb/>mach with the other—I had a guard round my neck, with a gold eye-glass attached to it—the guard broke, and the glass fell between the waistband of my trowsers—I then hallooed as loud as I could, "Police, and thieves," and Hewitt came up to my assistance very readily—Evans had hold of me when I called out, and he said, "Now is the time to trip the b—r up"—when the police came up, the prisoners ran away—Lewis ran towards the Vinegar-yard, and Evans towards Crowley's wharf—the policeman tried to pursue Evans, but he could not run so fast—I saw him running after him—I did not see any one pursue Evans besides the policeman, at that time—the policeman sprung his rattle—a person named Daley saw the whole transaction—I first saw him when I turned round after I was nearly choked—he was behind me—he came up to me while the two prisoners were running away—he came before the policeman came up—he did not run after the prisoners—he stopped with me while the policeman was in pursuit of them—another policeman caught Evans, not ten minutes after he ran away from me—I have never seen my handkerchief and gloves since—it was a very'fine night—I cannot say positively that it was moon-light, but I think it was—there are plenty "of very large gas-lights just there—I swear positively that Evans is the one that struck me—Lewis did not strike me, but I am positive he is the person who was with Evans.</p>

On the night of the 19th of July I was in the City-road, about half-past twelve or twenty minutes to one o'clock, and saw the prosecutor—I followed him nearly out of Fins<lb/>bury-square—when near Windsor-terrace, I saw the prisoners go up to the prosecutor—I did not see them before they got up to him—I was not above two yards from the prosecutor at the time—I saw Evans twitch the handkerchief off the prosecutor's right hand, and throw it over his shoulder—Lewis took it, and ran towards the bridge—Evans ran across the road, and went down by the side of the wharf—he was stopped by Reeve—I did not see Evans strike the prosecutor—I ran after Evans, and sang out, "Stop thief"—I followed him about a dozen yards across the road, down by the side of the wharf—Reeve brought him back, and asked if that was the man—I said, "Yes"—the prosecutor was then across the road, standing just by the end of the toll-gate—I saw both the prisoners' faces perfectly—there was a gas-lamp, and a little moon-light besides—I saw their faces before they ran away—I swear positively to them—I had never seen either of them before.</p>

On Monday, the 12th of July, a little after ten o'clock, I was sitting in my shop, and saw two per<lb/>sons looking in at the window twice—I shortly after got up, put out two gas-lights in the window, went round the counter, and told the boy to put up the shutters—after he had put up two or three, and was gone down stairs for another, I heard something fall on the pavement—I went out, found a pane of glass broken, and some scent-bottles removed, and eight gone—I had looked at the window several times, and it was not broken before that—I had seen the scent-bottles there that evening—I looked round, and saw a policeman crossing the road with the prisoner Clark—the police<lb/>man had four bottles in his possession which were four of what I lost—I went to the station with the policeman, and found out where the prisoner lived —I accompanied him and another officer to his house—his brother and sister who he lived with were out—Sanders went away with me, leav<lb/>ing Edis to wait till they came home—next morning I found the other four</p>

               <p>bottles at the station, and the other prisoner in custody at the station with the man and his wife who keep the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 12th of July, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was on duty at the bottom of Hackney-road, near the prosecutor's house—I heard a crash of glass, and saw two per<lb/>sons crossing the road—Clark was one—I do not know the other—he was a short person, exactly of the same stature as Brinjcsworth—it was not a boy—I followed them in the direction of High-street, Shoreditch—when they got on the pavement, Clark stopped suddenly against the railings of the churchyard, and deposited something—he then turned back in a con<lb/>trary direction, and I found these four bottles in the place where I had seen him deposit something—I secured Clark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the night of the 12th of July, I received information, and about two o'clock in the morning I went to the prisoner Brinksworth's house—I know it was his house from infor<lb/>mation I received—I knocked at the door, and inquired if he was at home—a man put his head out of window, and said something—he let me in—I went up stairs and commenced searching, in company with my brother constable—I then went down stairs in company with the man and his wife who keep the house, and found in the second drawer of a chest of drawers four scent bottles, a nail, and a religious tract—I took the man and his wife to the station, leaving the other constable in charge of the house—I then came back again, and stopped for several hours—about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, a knock came to the door, and a female voice, as it appeared to me, asked me something—I answered her from within in a feigned voice, and she went away—about ten minutes after the prisoner Brinksworth came to the door and said, "You, <hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> is any body here?"—I answered, "No"—he said, "Are you sure there is nobody here?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Open the door"—I told him I could not, he had got the key—he did not speak for a moment or so—I then opened the door, seized hold of him, told him what he was charged with, and took him into custody.</p>

On Monday evening, the 2nd of August, I lotted out this property for sale next day—I went to bed about a quarter to ten o'clock—this property was safe then—I was the last person up—my wife and family also sleep in the house—the doors and windows, and every thing, was secure, both up stairs and down—the window Hart speaks of was shut down and fast when I went to bed—there is an upper and a lower sale-room, and there is a communication between them by means of a circular office—this window being opened would give access to the second-floor sale-room, and any one could easily descend through that hole from the upper sale-room to the lower by means of a rope—I was roused up by the officers about twenty minutes before four o'clock—I went into the lower sale-room, and found all the property stated gone from it— every thing was gone except three or four articles—I had seen it all safe the night before when I went to bed—among other things was a great-coat, which I had ticketed for sale next day—next morning I went to Giltspur-street Compter, and there saw the prisoner, in the presence of Gooch, the turnkey—I put my hand into his pocket, and pulled out some watches, a gold brooch, a diamond ring, and other things—Gooch afterwards put his hand into his other pocket, and then he said, "You have not got them all," and he gave us three or four watches and chains out of his waistcoat pocket—I gave Gooch what I found—(<hi rend="italic">Gooch here produced the articles</hi>)—these are all my master's property—here is my own hand-writing on the tickets—this gold watch I took from the prisoner's person—I know it by the make and the chain, and it has my own numbering on it on a piece of paper, "Lot 305"—I placed that ticket on the watch on the Saturday or the Monday before the robbery, and it was safe with the other property in the lower sale-room when I went to bed that night—the whole of the pro<lb/>perty was in the lower sale-room—here are a great many other things which I took from the prisoner, with tickets on them made by me—I have looked at all the other property, and have no doubt it is all my master's—some of the watches I know by the maker's name and number, as well as by my tickets—the value of all the property is between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found no doors open in the morning, nor any windows, except the one I have mentioned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Tottenham. On Sunday, the 1st of August, I noticed a brick or stone had been taken out of the wall of my cellar, from the outside, and I missed about two dozen of old claret, which I value at about 84<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—I had three dozen in that particular part of the cellar a few days before—the hole in the wall was just about large enough to admit a man's arm and hand to remove it—it was all gone from that part, except four bottles, which were out of reach—one of those four bottles was broken, and three were whole—the prisoners had been working on my premises for about a fortnight before, and had whitewashed the coal-cellar, which adjoins the wine-cellar, the night before—they are bricklayers' labourers, in the employ of Mr. Fiddler, who I employed—I do not believe there are any chalk-marks at the bottom of my claret bottles; if there are, they have become quite obscured by age—I have since seen four bottles, which I believe to be part of the lot—I tasted a small quantity which remained in the bottles, and the flavour and colour were precisely the same as mine—this wine-glass corresponds with a set which I had, one of which had been missed by my servant—this wine had been at least fourteen or fifteen years in my family—it is a quality I can speak to—it was very excellent—it was made a present of to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bryant Hills, a corn<lb/>dealer, in Red Lion-street, Holborn. The prisoner was in our service for about four months, and left without notice, about twenty minutes before six in the morning, before I was up—I missed from a room up-stairs, in which nobody slept, two sovereigns, a shawl, 2nd other articles, from a drawer—I have since seen some of them—I had missed the keys of the drawer where the sovereigns were, and one key was found under the prisoner's bed, which opened a drawer where the other keys were kept.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Fitzpatrick, and live in New-passage, Falcon-street, Clare-market. On the 4th of August I was at the Crown and Still public-house, Clare-street—I got drinking with the prisoner there, I treated them—I pulled out my purse, and paid for a pot of porter—there was a half-crown piece, a few coppers, and a bit of metal in it, which I know—I put my purse into my bosom—I was not drunk—Gosling pushed me down, when I refused to pay for any more drink—I was picked up by the landlord, and then I missed this purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Union-place, New-road, and am a bottle-mer<lb/>chant—Birch had been in my employ a long time—Skarrett had been my porter but was discharged. On the 10th of August, in consequence of in<lb/>formation, I and my wife placed ourselves at a bed-room window which commanded a view of the premises—there is a dirty bottle-warehouse there—a little before six o'clock in the morning Birch came to his work—he went into the washing-room and came out again—we then saw Skarrett at the corner of Nottingham-place—he ran across the road to our place—I ran down to the door which was then being fastened, and Skarrett was gone down the New-road—I ran after him till he stood to rest—he had this hamper filled with bottles, which I believe to be mine—I missed a hamper when I returned—I did not see the prisoners together—Skarrett could not have got in without Birch letting him in—this hamper and bottles could not have got out without Birch's assistance.</p>

On the 16th of August the prisoners came to our refinery, and were heading up some cases, which their master had sent in to hold sugar, which was to be shipped—as they came out I met them in the yard—I said to Davidson, "What have you got there?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Are you sure you have nothing"—he said, "Only a bit of sugar"—I took them both into the counting-house, and they delivered up this sugar—there was 4lbs. on Davidson, and 2lbs. 2oz. on Price.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a working-jeweller, and live in Benjamin-street, in the parish of St. Sepulchre, Middlesex. The prisoner called on me on the 19th of July, and solicited work—I did not set him then—my lad went down to him, and he wrote this note in my parlour—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Mr. Davis's compliments to Mr. Onions, and begs to say, that could he give a little employment, at a weekly small salary, he could introduce him to a good ready-money trade of jobbing and orders. 10, John's-row, near Bath-street, City-road, July, 19th, 1841"—I engaged him on Wednesday, the 21st—no wages were mentioned—I never men<lb/>tion wages till I have tried a man one or two days—he came about half-past nine o'clock on the 21st—he said he had a letter to write, he went away, and returned about ten o'clock—he worked till four o'clock very well—he then said he would go round to some of his customers at different parts of the town—I knew he had been several years in the manufacturing line, in a respectable way, and said, "As you are going round, you may know a great many persons," and I let him have a quantity of goods, to show to customers to sell—he went away with them—he returned at half-past six o'clock, bringing all the goods back—he said he had had an offer of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the diamond pin—I had put 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—he then took three cameo brooches out, one at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and two at 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he said he had an offer for, at nearly the price I had put on them—I was surprised he had not sold them—he then selected two pairs of ear-rings, and said he had been offered 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I had said 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would sell them for 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if the parties would give the money—he said he was sure they would give the money, they were men of respectability, and he would be sure to bring back the money—he then selected a turquoise and a garnet-keeper, which he said he had been offered 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for—I wanted 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him he could take that, and was very sorry he had not sold them, being so little less than I wanted—he said, "I could not do that without your con<lb/>sent, being only one day in your employment"—he also took a twin pin, with a chain, which he said he had been offered money for—I at last said, "Go out again directly, and I will give you a diamond cluster ring, worth 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides, as you have got such good customers"—I said, "What time will you return?"—he said, "I don't think I can return before ten o'clock, for I am to wait at some hotel for a gentleman, a shopkeeper at Davenport"—I said, "I wish you could get back by half-past nine o'clock"—he said, "Then you must let me have 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and I will be back by half-past nine o'clock"—he took out the articles stated, amounting to 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he did not return that night—I was very much alarmed, and next morning I sent my youth, Churchyard, up to his lodging, to see what had become of him—he got a policeman—I saw the prisoner at the station on the 22nd of July.</p>

I was called in to see Sul<lb/>livan on the 15th of August, about three o'clock in the morning, at Bur<lb/>ford's court—I found him seated on a chair in his house—he appeared to be very much excited—a wound was inflicted on the left side of the neck, five inches long, about half an inch below the ear, extending from the side of the neck on to the cheek—it was more than one inch in depth—there had been considerable hemorrhage, from the appearance on his clothes; but when I arrived it had ceased—he appeared considerably excited, as if he had been taking liquor, I should think beer—I did not smell any spirits—he was not intoxicated—he was quite capable of knowing what he said and did—he appeared to be agitated by passion—I dressed the wound, which had extended through the carotid glands under the ear, and the external carotid artery was laid bare, but not divided; if it had been, I consider he would have been dead before I could have arrived—he has been under my care ever since—there is now every appearance of his doing well—I should say decidedly it was what is termed an incised wound, such as a knife or razor, or some sharp-cutting instrument would make—it could not hare been inflicted by any thing else—it was quite a clean cut; the edge was not jagged at all—I put four sutures into the wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might not that wound have been caused by a broken piece of glass, if he was thrown violently on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not think it could—a wound of that description could not be inflicted by a point of glass—if the edge of the glass against which he was pushed was proportionate to the length of the wound, that might account for the appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it have done so if the edge of the glass was of the common thickness of a pane of glass, or must it be sharper than that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think a piece of glass would have cut the wound so clean, the edge would be more ragged, and I should have found some small pieces of glass adhering to the edge—I should say if the prosecutor had fallen down on glass in that position, it might have produced that wound, but not by falling against a pane of glass in a window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tea-dealer, and carry on business in High Holborn, in the parish of St. Andrew. The prisoner Tuckwell was in my service about six weeks ago, as town-traveller—he was not with me quite a month—he did not suit me, and I parted with him—Perkins was in my employment from the time of my commencing business, which was at the beginning of April, and continued so till this of<lb/>fence was committed—on Saturday evening, the 14th of August, I had property to the amount of 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my cash-box—there were three</p>

               <p>5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, twenty or thirty sovereigns, and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. parcels of silver, made up in brown paper, and marked—I took my cash-box to my bed-room on retiring to rest, and on Sunday morning, about ten minutes to eleven o'clock, previous to going to church, I left it safe on my bureau in my bed-room—it then had that property in it—Perkins went out on Sunday morning about ten minutes before me—I went to church, returned home about half-past one, immediately went to my bed-room in consequence of my mother giving me information, and found the cash-box broken open, and the whole, with the exception of two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, missing—a fire-escape ladder which was put on boxes immediately under the trap-door of the roof, was gone—I searched the premises with an officer, but was not able to find any body—there is a loft on the roof, belonging to Mr. Booker, a fishmonger, a neighbour of mine, similar to my own—I merely looked into that loft, but did not discover any thing—Per<lb/>kins came in about five on Sunday afternoon—I let him in—I said nothing till he got to the drawing-room—I then named to him the circumstances of the robbery—he turned very pale—I went out with Perkins about seven that evening to look for the light-porter who carries out my parcels—I asked Perkins some questions respecting Tuck well—I made him no promise or threat—I merely put the question to him in con<lb/>sequence of a suspicion which crossed my mind—I did not say it would be better for him to tell, or worse if he did not—nor any thing of that kind—I did not at that time suspect him—I asked what he knew about Tuckwcll's character—I told him he had stated to my mother and sister that Tuckwell was a very bad character, that he thought him capable of any thing in swearing away a man's life—he said he knew nothing more of him than that he was addicted to smoking cigars—I asked him when he had seen him last—he said he had not seen him for some time—I questioned him further, and after some time he said, in a careless sort of manner, that he had seen him on the Saturday morning, and had not seen him after that time—the police inspector came about half-past twelve on Sunday night—that was after Tuckwell had been taken into custody—Perkins then remarked, "I should not wonder if Tuckwell said I had some concern in the robbery"—the keys of the inner and outer shop-door on Saturday night were taken to my bed-room, and hung on a nail inside the door—I found Tuckwell at the station about a quarter to twelve on Sun<lb/>day night—next morning I was standing near Tuckwell at the police-court —I did not make him any promise or threat.</p>

               <p>I went to dinner—Perkins was then to admit him through the shop to the sugar-vault at the back of the shop below stairs—that he was to be there, concealed till I came down from dinner—Perkins was then to go down to him, and cover him up with the sugar mats, to effectually conceal him, and he was to meet Perkins on the Sunday afternoon at four o'clock—they were then to divide the money, and he believed Perkins was to come back to his employ as usual—that he (Tuckwell) had come at the appointed time, that Perkins had admitted him through the shop, had been with him three times during the afternoon in the vault, that he came to him after I retired to bed on the Saturday night, took him to his own bed-room, and they slept together—that he concealed him in the cupboard on the Sunday morning, and Perkins then went out—he also said that while he was in my bed-room committing the robbery, he heard the lock tried twice—he did not say any thing more—he did not give me any account of what he did in the room, or how he got out of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live in High Holborn, next door to Mr. Hawthorn. On Sunday-night, the 15th of August, I went up stairs, and looked into the loft at the top of my house, about half-past ten o'clock, and saw a man there, concealed at the further end of the loft, lying with his hat at his feet, and his face towards the wall—I called somebody—the man did not come out directly, but when my brother came the man made his escape out of the loft, and got away from me, out on the roof of the house—I did not see him come out—Jarvis and a po<lb/>liceman, and my brother, went in pursuit of him over the roofs, into Red Lion-street—I remained at the top of the house—I could not follow with them—I afterwards saw Tuckwell in the custody of Jarvis, in George-street, and heard him say there was all the money just as he had taken it—it was in his pocket when he was searched—he said he was in the loft when Mr. Hawthorn, the policeman, and I were looking over the premises—we had been searching that afternoon, about half-past five o'clock, without any light—if we. had had one we should no doubt have seen him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I beard Mr. Booker at the top of his house on the night of the 15th of August—as I was going up the stairs of his house I heard him call me—I went on the top of the house—I followed Tuckwell over four or five houses, and there found him—I took him into the first window I came to, put the handcuffs on, and took him to the station in Red Lion-street—he was searched there, and the whole of the property found on him—I have part of it—I have a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, four sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns—I gave the remainder back to Mr. Hawthorn—thirty sovereigns, ten half-sovereigns, eighty half-crowns, fourteen fourpenny-pieces, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three hundred shillings, and one penny in copper, was found on him altogether—as we were going from the station to the police-office, on Monday morning, Tuckwell asked me whether I thought he should get off if there was any one else concerned in the case, and he was to <hi rend="italic">split</hi>—I said I did not know, perhaps Mr. Haw<lb/>thorn might be more lenient to him—I afterwards took Perkins into custody—when we got down to the police-court he said he let Tuckwell through the shop at one o'clock, and concealed him in the sugar<lb/>vault, and visited him two or three times in the course of the afternoon.</p>

On Saturday after<lb/>noon, the 14th of August, soon after one o'clock, I saw a man come on the stairs, about three stairs down the kitchen-stairs, leading from the passage to the shop—the kitchen is lower down than the shop—the sugar-vault is at the back of the kitchen—I saw Perkins three times that after<lb/>noon go to the sugar-vault—he asked me if I was going to clean the back<lb/>area—I told him I was.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 15th of August, I saw Perkins about half-past nine o'clock—he brought the milk to me—he had the keys of the inner and outer shop doors—he took the milk in, and brought it up to me—it was a very unusual thing to bring it to me—it should be taken into the kitchen, or left on the stairs for the servant—I let him out about ten minutes to eleven, and said, "Will you dine at home, Mr. Perkins, to<lb/>day?"—he said, "I think I will, ma'am"—I said, "Recollect, we dine about half-past one"—he said, "I thank you, ma'am, I think I shall"—he did not come home to dinner—he came about half-past four—he saw his master first, I afterwards saw him—he told me he lad got the head-ache, and had come home, intending to ask for a cup of tea, and to lie down af<lb/>terwards; that he had been to Knightsbridge, and passed our house about two o'clock, but thought it too late to come in to dinner—I said, "You cannot lie down, Mr. Perkins, for we have had a sad robbery"—he said, "Good gracious! I hope it will be found out; who do you think it can be?"—I said, "Of course we can have no suspicion, but on the servant"—(I did not know any thing then about Tuckwell being in the house)—he said, Have you had the house searched?"—I said, "Yes, we sent for the constable and police immediately"—we went down into the kitchen; and as we went down, or before that, he said, it must be the ser<lb/>vant, he thought, for nobody else could get into the house, as I had the inner and outer door keys—when they are both locked, nobody can get in or out—there is no area in front, but a small grating—a person from the kitchen might hand a small parcel up—when he went down stairs, he said, "There can be no suspicion but of the girl; but how could she get the money away? have you had the house searched?"—I said, "Yes, thoroughly, but can find nothing"—he said she might have an accom<lb/>plice, and hand the money up through the area—I said, "We are afraid that is the way it is gone"—my daughter was present part of the time, but not at that moment—we then said, somebody had gone out through the fire-escape, but could not conceive how it was possible they could get into the house to get out—my daughter said, "They have taken up the ladder of the fire-escape, and that, I think, makes the girl clear;" and Perkins said, "That is the worst thing against her."</p>

               <p>of Messrs Warner. I remember, on the 3rd of August, Ford taking the brass weight out of my breast—I had stolen it out of the warehouse—I had some conversation with Mr. Warner about it, and went to the station—I afterwards went with the weight to a marine-store shop belonging to the prisoners—I had been there twice before—I saw them both—I took the weight to them, and they said they did not give so much for new weights as they did for old—they did not both speak at the same time—I spoke to the female prisoner—the man was at the door—I showed the weight to the female prisoner—she asked what it was—I said, "A four pound"—she said it was not a four pound, it was but a three pound—the male prisoner was near enough to hear what she said—she gave me 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave the weight to a girl who was in the parlour—there is a partition put up between the shop and the back room—the girl was in the back room, and the woman too—I did not observe what the girl did with the weight—nothing more passed between me and the female prisoner—I said nothing to the male prisoner at all—they knew who I was, because I had been there before—they knew I came from my masters, and that I took such things from my masters—they had asked me when I was there before why I did not bring more than one or two pounds at a time—I told them where I came from the first time I went—they asked me where I came from, and I told them I came from Messrs. Warners'—I told the man and woman both—when I sold this weight she owed me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the last time I went, and she gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of it, which made 13 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave the money to the policeman when I came out—there were three policemen at the comer house all but one from the prisoners, about twelve yards from the shop—when I gave them the money they went into the shop, and I followed them in—I heard what was said—the policemen asked where the weight was they had just bought of me, and they denied it, and said they had never seen me—I was in the shop at the time, so that they could see me—the female prisoner said it one time, and the male prisoner another—the female spoke first—she said she had never seen me before, and that she had just come from over the way from buying a herring, and that I had never been there, and never taken any weight—the male prisoner told the policeman to search about the place, and said he never saw any weight come in—the policeman searched about the place, but could not find the weight—the policemen then went up stairs into the bed-room, and they took the prisoners and me to the station.</p>

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not at first give a different, account of this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I know of—I was in Dow's custody at first—I told him I had sold the weight to a boy that sold cherries—Dow asked me where the boy was to be found—I told him by Hoxton new church—I did not say how much the boy was to give mo—I afterwards told him I was going to take it to Petticoat-lane—when I went into the prisoners shop the officers were about twelve yards off—I am sure there were three together—I think there were two City policemen, and No. 11, from Spitalfields—two went one way, and I and one the other, and they met one another before I got to the shop—the male prisoner was standing at the shop-door, talking to a butcher who was outside the door, leaning against the side—I passed by him, and went in—the female prisoner was behind the shop—after I sold the weight I went in with Barker and the other officers.</p>

I saw Dedross on the 3rd of August—he went to a marine-store shop in Petticoat-lane—I was about four yards from him when he went into the shop—I saw him go in—he had a 4lbs. weight—I saw it the minute before he entered the shop—I could see into the shop—I saw Mrs. Lyons in the shop—I am sure it was her, and her husband was standing at the door—I am certain Dedross had no money when he went into the shop, for I had searched him at the station in Moor-lane about three o'clock—it was about half-past six when he went into the shop, but he was never out of my sight during that time—he remained in the shop about two minutes and a half—he gave me 13 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when he came out—I searched him when he came out, and he had not the weight about him—I and Barker then went into the shop, and found Mrs. Lyons there, and her husband standing in front of the door— Dedross was with me—we accused the parties of buying the weight of the lad—the female prisoner denied ever having seen the boy before, and said he must be an impudent young rascal for so saying—the male prisoner said we were welcome to search—we did so, but could find nothing of the weight—they offered willing search—as we went into the room I saw a girl go into a side passage—I told the male prisoner I was directly oppo<lb/>site, and saw the lad go in—I did not know the prisoners before—I told them the boy had no money in his possession when he went into the house, and he had 13 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when he came out, and I was certain he had the weight when he went into the shop; and then the female prisoner said he was an impudent young rascal far so saying, they bad never seen him before in the shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are there not several marine-store shops about there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not acquainted with the neighbourhood, and did not notice—I went with Dedross and another officer to within a rod of the shop—we were two doors off on the same side of the way—I saw Dedross go in—he did not speak to any one as he went in—I saw a butcher and Lyons standing in front of the door—I was in private clothes—Barker was at the adjoining corner—he had left me about five minutes before Dedross went in—Dedross and I were left alone for a moment or two—we three policemen were not all standing together when Dedross left us to go in—I crossed the road on to the opposite side of the way when Dedross went in—when we went in there was another female there—she was not behind the counter—as I went into the room she went into the side pas<lb/>sage—she was just entering into the passage—she was not in the shop, but in the adjoining parlour—when I went into the shop I saw a glimpse of her going into the side passage, making her way into the shop.</p>

On the 3rd of August I was with Dow—I saw Dedross go into the prisoners' house in Petticoat-lane—there are a good many marine-store shops about there, but I have not the least doubt it was into the prisoners' shop he went—I was next door but two from the shop when he went in, about ten yards off—I was not able to see into the shop—I searched the boy before he went in, and</p>

               <p>he had a weight with him—he remained in the shop about five minutes, at least that was the time from the time I parted with him till he came back—I searched him when lie came back—he had no weight then, and he had 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had not that money about him when he went in, because he was searched at Spitalfields station in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> presence—after he came out, I, Dow, and Perrin went in—the Magistrate did not bind Perrin over—Lyons was standing on the threshold of the door—I said, "You have just received a weight of this boy"—he said, "I know nothing about any weight," and he called to his wife—she was standing in the parlour, lead<lb/>ing out of the shop—as I went into the shop I saw a female leave the parlour by a door into a passage, which leads into a yard, and comes again into the shop—when Mrs. Lyons came out she said she knew nothing about a weight—Dedross said, "I have just sold you a weight"—she said, "You must be mistaken, for there are other shops in the lane besides ours"—he said, "No, I am not; I gave the weight to a girl, and you were, standing at the table: she brought it to you at that table, and you gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—she denied it, and repeatedly said she knew nothing about any weight—she denied all knowledge of the boy—we were af<lb/>forded every facility in searching the house—we could not find any weight—I went out in two or three minutes, but could not find where the girl had gone to—she was not in the house.</p>

The prisoner was in our service about three weeks—I missed eight or nine dozen pencil-cases, on Friday night, the 26th of July, from under the counter in the counting-house, which was not the place his employ took him to—on Saturday morning, the 7th of August, I saw him, and told him I had got a pencil from a person named Roach—he said he knew nothing about it—I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a diamond merchant, living in Bury-street, St. Mary Axe. I have had dealings with the prisoner about two years—I have known him three or four years—I have entrusted him with diamonds to sell—he came to me, in the morning of the 17th of June last, between nine and ten o'clock—he said he wanted some certain sized diamonds for Messrs. Nock and Williams, between two or three grains each—I told him I had not got three grains, I had two grains—he said they would do—Nock and Williams are jewellers in Firth-street, Soho—he said he saw the clerk, who gave him an order to bring some diamonds of the size for Nock and Williams—in consequence of that I gave him an order to Blogg and Co., and told him the diamonds were not in my possession—besides that, he said he had an order from a party coming from abroad, for some</p>

               <p>rose diamonds, and he had got to meet the party at the Swiss Coffee-house—I let him have the rose diamonds—he had twenty-five carats of dia<lb/>monds, worth about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were not sold to him—the arrangement was, that when he got any goods of me, they were entrusted to him as a bro<lb/>ker—he received 2 1/2 per cent, commission on what he sold—he had another lot of diamonds of me—I did not see him again that day—he promised to call back in the evening, and said he would bring me a good deal of money—he said, Messrs. Nock and Williams wanted some credit, would I let them have it—I said, I knew them very well, he might trust them three months—between twelve and one o'clock the next day, a boy brought this letter to me—the prisoner was taken into custody last Friday morning, between two and three o'clock, at his own house—he said he lost the diamonds in Leadenhall-street—I heard him afterwards say, in the office, that he lost them at Charing-cross, between three and four o'clock—here is the box that he used to carry the diamonds in, with a chain round his neck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. On the 8th of July, in the evening, I went to the prisoner's shop, with the prosecutor and Fiskin—the prosecutor asked for those things to be produced which he had seen before—these mouselin-de-laines and some cap-crowns were produced, which the prosecutor identified—the marks on the cap-crown a were nearly rubbed out—the prisoner said he bought them of a man going round—he was asked if he had invoices—he said, "Yes"—he went with me into his parlour, examined his files, and said he had not got them—he said he did not know the man he bought them of—Mr. Barnes gave him into custody—I took him to the station, and there searched him well—I found on him two papers—one of them he said he had been writing out to endeavour to see what he had given for the goods—this other is a note—there were no other papers about his person—he was locked up in the cell, and the next morning, from information, I searched him again, and these other two pieces of paper were wrapped up, and put into his left-hand waistcoat pocket—I said, "What are these?"—he said, "These are the invoices."</p>

On the 23rd of May I was sitting drinking a glass of grog with a friend—the prisoner came in, and called for a glass of ale—I served him—he then went out backwards, and returned—before he went he hung up his hat—when he came back he took the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's hat, and wiped bis face with it—he then doubled up the handkerchief, put it on his forehead, put the hat on, and went out—I looked up soon after, and saw an old hat in the room of it—I am certain he is the person—the prosecutor went out, but could not find him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at Limehouse. On Wed<lb/>nesday afternoon, the 4th of August, between three and four o'clock, I went to the Robin Hood and Little John beer-shop, the prisoner was there when I went in—I remained there till between ten and eleven o'clock at night—between seven and eight we were in the parlour, the prisoner, my father-in-law, one Dixon, and Jewell and myself—the prisoner had some words with Thomas Dixon, and said he would punch his b—head in pieces —I replied, "No you won't, because he is not able to stand before you;" as Dixon was a cripple—I said if he bit him, I would hit him again, as he was not able to stand against him—he said he did not care for any man in Poplar who was 9 stone 3lb. weight—after this a wrangle took place between him and me, but it was dropped for some little time, and we afterwards went from the parlour into the tap-room—we still kept wrang<lb/>ling for some time afterwards, and all in an instant he jumped up, and swore d—his eyes if he would not have revenge on me—he got up, and made an attempt to hit me with his hand—I did not notice whether it was shut or open, but I kept it off with my left hand—I then struck him with my right hand, and hit him on the nose, which bled—I afterwards hit at him with my right hand, and I received a <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> in my side—the prisoner struck at my side before I felt the pain—at the time I thought it was with his fist—I felt a little pain in my side—after that my father-in-law got up and said, "Don't strike him any more"—I said I would not—we were still quarrelling—I afterwards went out backwards to ease myself, and felt myself very sick—I then returned into the tap-room—he began still rather to wrangle—I drank out of the pot with my father-in-law—he and I went out the front way, and we had a few words out in the street—I went directly to my father-in-law's house, and when he came home I told him I felt rather <hi rend="italic">queer</hi> in my side—I remained in an arm-chair, resting, until the morning (I did not live with him) between four and five o'clock I felt myself a great deal worse—I had no waistcoat on, and I looked down, and saw the blood on my shirt—I asked my father-in-law to look, and there was a wound in my side—I looked at it myself, and saw a hole in my side, and a hole in my shirt, and in the waistband of my trowsers—my father-in-law dressed,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184108230153"/>
               <p>and went for a policeman—the parish doctor came down and looked at me—they took me to the hospital directly—I remained there until now—no body else had struck me a blow in the course of the day—when the prisoner struck me I felt the pain in the same part as the wound is—I had not got the wound when I went into the Robin Hood and Little John—I had not seen any thing in the prisoner's hand—I had seen him once or twice before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at the London Hospital. I remember the prosecutor being brought to me on the morning of the 5th of August—I examined his left side, and found a wound of about half an inch long, or rather less—it was just below the ribs—it was a part likely to inflict a serious injury, if it had been as deep as the symptoms led me to suppose it was—the symptoms were those of inflammation—he is still under my care—he has not yet perfectly recovered—I saw this knife at</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not take any means to ascertain the depth of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I apprehend a wound remaining a considerable time not attended to would be rendered more difficult to cure, the in<lb/>flammation would increase, and make the wound very much worse, the symptoms would be aggravated—a blow inflicted with full force would have made a much worse wound—the prosecutor was intoxicated, and had lost some blood—I believe he fainted—it might possibly have been cured earlier if it had not been neglected—a wound inflicted when a person is intoxicated might have a more serious effect than otherwise.</p>

On Saturday week, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was in the bench lobby near the treasurer's office—I heard a great screaming in the passage, and a cry of "Murder," repeated two or three times—I went to see what was the matter, and about two paces from the boy I saw a man in a blue coat running—I immediately ran after him—I lost sight of him, at he turned round a corner—there are several corners there—I only lost sight of him once, and I never regained sight of him till I found him in a coal-hole, not far from the staircase—there were some gentle<lb/>men standing on the top of the staircase—he must have been twenty paces from the staircase when I lost sight of him—he would have two corners to turn to get to that staircase—there was no way for him to get out of the Custom-house but by that staircase—in consequence of some<lb/>thing that passed with those gentlemen, I came back, and looked in the coal-cellar—I had ran past the coal-cellar to get to the top of the stairs—the coal-cellar is about eight or ten paces from the top of the stairs—after passing the coal-cellar I should have to pass one of the corners I have mentioned—a person going into the coal-cellar would be concealed from a person on the top of the stairs by the corner—a man named Salter ran as far as the prosecutor, who was lying down when we passed him—no other per<lb/>son went on with me—I then went to the coal-cellar, and found the door was not as it generally is when I have occasion to go there—I pulled the door open, went in, put my foot in behind the door, and felt a man—I then fas<lb/>tened the door back so as to keep him behind it, and hallooed out to Mr. Salter, who was coming up, that I had got him—the person I seized was the prisoner—he had on a blue coat—I had not heard at that time any thing from the boy about the person who assaulted him—I secured him, and said, "I have got you"—he said, "I know you have"—I then handed him over to Mr. Brunet, the constable—he was taken into a little lobby near the coal-cellar, and there kept some time—the boy was brought to him and shown to him—I did not hear him say any thing then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I attend at the London hospital—the deceased was brought there on Saturday, the 5th of June—he was in a state of insensibility—I examined his head, and found a quantity of blood flowing from his ear—I found no mark of any blow outside—he was in the hospital till the 13th of June, and then died—he continued insensi<lb/>ble the whole time—I afterwards examined his body—his skull was frac<lb/>tured, and the brain torn considerably—there was a quantity of blood in the base of the brain—before I opened the head, I examined to see if there were any external marks—I attribute the immediate cause of his death to pressure on the brain from the blood—the appearances I saw might un<lb/>doubtedly have been occasioned by a blow or fall—it was the lower part of the skull that was fractured, behind the ear—it would very likely be occasioned by the head coming in contact with a stone—I should think it almost impossible it could have been caused by a blow from a man's fist—it was no doubt a recent injury—I do not remember seeing the wit<lb/>ness Hagerty at the hospital—I saw him before the Coroner when Con<lb/>nor's body was there—it was the same body I had examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in China-place, St. George's. My house stands in a yard by itself—I have a bench and other things in that yard—I came home on Monday night, the 5th of July, a little after twelve o'clock—I found my yard gate open, and the house door also—I sent for my son to fetch a light, and found the prisoner, Thomas Sullivan, under the bench—I pulled him out, and asked what brought him there—he said his father had been beating him, and he came to sleep there—I was going to give him a shaking, but in coming through the passage I stum<lb/>bled over a stove and a blue dish, and I gave him in charge of a policeman—he at first denied having touched the things in the passage—he afterwards said he had moved them out of the yard to take over to his mother—I missed a saucepan that night—I asked him about it, and a kettle—he said he did not know any thing about it—I missed the plane in the morning—I had used it the evening before at dusk.</p>

On Wednesday fortnight I saw the prisoner in Ball's-pond-road, about half a mile from Mr. Flight's, driving a white sow towards Kingsland-road—it was a very particular kind of sow—it was all white—I cannot say that I had ever seen any of that breed—the sow dropped down twice—I have seen the dead sow—it was somewhat similar to the size of the one I saw the prisoner with.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a glass-shop in Bedford-street. On the 14th of August the prisoner came and asked for a smelling-bottle or scent-bottle—he was a stranger—I showed him a number—he said there was none would suit him; he would go to the lady and ask if she would allow me to make one for her; he would go and be back in a quarter of an hour—he left, and by his running across the road 1 had suspicion—I looked at the tray, and missed this smelling-bottle—on the Monday following my son found him in Charles-street, Middlesex Hospital—I am sure he is the person—the smelling-bottle was found at Mr. Denny's, in Oxford-street.</p>

I am a widow, living in Albany-street, Regent's-park, I am subscriber to the Metropolitan Convalescent Institution—last Sep<lb/>tember I paid the prisoner my subscription for that year—on the 9th of July, my servant, Dinah, came to me for another subscription for this year—I went with her into the dining-room—I saw the prisoner—he said he called for the subscription to the Metropolitan Convalescent Insti<lb/>tution—I said it was a very short year—he looked at something, and said it was within a day, either before or after the time that I had paid the sub<lb/>scription last year—I offered him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which he could not change—I borrowed a sovereign of Dinah—I added 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave it him—he wrote this receipt (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I looked next day to my former receipt, and I found the last was paid in September—if I had known the prisoner had been dis<lb/>charged, and was not a collector of subscriptions, I should not have paid him the guinea in July.</p>

On the 2nd of July I was at Fairlop fair—I was returning with my brother Thomas, about a quarter-past ten o'clock in the evening, and when we got about a quarter of a mile from the fair I saw a small party collected toge<lb/>ther, fighting—a person named Cutts was stripped, ready to fight—I spoke him, and after I spoke to him he went on fighting with the prisoner—they both fell, and when they were down the prisoner's wife came and kicked Cutts—I said it was unfair, and my brother went and took the pri<lb/>soner's wife away, picked the prisoner up, and afterwards picked up Cutts—the prisoner immediately came to me, and stabbed me twice in the back Part of my thigh, with some sharp instrument—I felt the blow, and felt</p>

               <p>behind, and felt the blood in my trowsers—I had not interfered in the fight at all—I he stab did not disable me at the time—about five minutes after the prisoner stabbed me, he came to me and hit me with his fist in the forehead—my brother came up, laid hold of him, and I did so also—I let him go—I sent for Mr. Bowers, a surgeon at Romford, as soon as I got home—I was obliged to go to bed, and it was five or six weeks before I was able to do any kind of work—I was under the doctor's care about that time—I was confined to my bed seven or eight days.</p>

On the afternoon of Wednesday, between five and six o'clock, the 11th of August, I met the prisoner near Mr. Abbott's—I here was a boy near him but not immediately by him—I noticed that the prisoner dropped two spoons, and took them up again—in consequence of what I observed, I went in the same direction as he went, and afterwards met him with the same lad—I asked the prisoner if I had not seen him just now at Mea-dow-croft—he said, "No," and I suffered him to go on then—and after going a few paces, he started off across the field, making a motion to the boy to run too—I hey ran in parallel lines, but one <hi rend="italic">diverging</hi> from the other—I was alone—I met a painter, who joined me, and we saw the pri<lb/>soner in a hedge—I had not lost sight of him till I found him in the hedge—he was crouching down—after I came up, I was on one side of the hedge and the painter on the other, and he started up from the hedge and ran in a different direction, and I saw the painter scuffling with him—I afterwards pointed out the spot where he had been crouching down, to the officer.</p>

I know the prisoner, and knew his wife—we lived in the same house—I think if the man had had a wife accordingly, he would have been as good a husband it ever was—she kept very bad hours—I never saw him hit her—she used to come in at all times in the night—she used to come up to our room, and greatly to annoy us—at times she was perfectly sober, and I have seen her quite tipsy, not often—I saw her once up at the turnpike after twelve o'clock, quite tipsy—her late hours were frequent—I they did not live in our house at the time this happened, and I know nothing of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oilman, and live in Charlotte-terrace, New Cut.

               <p>went through the shop into the parlour, and I saw the prisoner come out from the parlour in about five minutes—I said, "What do you do here?"—he said he came to speak to Mr. Knight about the oil, as he thought I seemed to suspect all was not right—I said he had no business to do that, I did not complain about the oil—I had not expressed any suspicion up to that time—I told him to go home—he then said he came to boy some harness polish, which he had in his hand—after saying a few words to Mr. Knight, I got a policeman and gave him into custody—The prisoner asked why I did so—I said it was on a charge of felony—he said, "I know, sir, that I have done wrong respecting the oil, I assure yon that I bought a gallon about ten days back, that I ought then to have men<lb/>tioned it to Mr. George; I know that it is very wrong that I did not"—I said, "Well, John, but you have charged 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gallon, and only paid Mr. Knight 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he replied he certainly did pay Mr. Knight 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then alluded to the box at the Irongate Wharf—I said, "Well, you will put on your coat and go with the police," and I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Kensington-square. On the 16th of August I was fishing in company with the de-ceased and some other friends—I had known the deceased about two years—his name was Edward Lewis—he was twenty years old—I began fishing with him about half-past ten o'clock—he had been fishing about two hours</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184108230214"/>
               <p>previously—it was in the river, near Richmond, opposite to the Duke of Buccleugh's, which is on the Surrey side, above Richmond-bridge—I, the deceased, and two others, were in a punt, about midway, moored by stakes at each end across the punt—we were sitting on chairs—there were two other gentlemen, friends, in a skiff close by—the skiff was on the Surrey side of the punt—while we were there in the morning I remember two steamers passing up towards Richmond, on the Surrey side of the punt—that is the side on which the current is—where we were is comparatively shallow—when the steamers passed up to Twickenham in the morning there was a little swell—it did not interrupt our fishing—about half-past five o'clock I was sitting with my face towards Richmond-bridge—we were all in that position, and fishing in the same place—I looked round, and saw a steamboat coming from Twickenham—it was not more than thirty yards from the punt when I first saw it—I cannot say at what rate it was coming, but it appeared to be coming rapidly—the tide had turned about an hour, and was running down—I am unable to say if it was a strong tide—I observed somebody in some part of the boat, but I cannot say where, waving his hand as if to the man at the wheel—he was in an ele<lb/>vated position, or I should not have seen him—I have seen steamboats navigating, and a person on the paddle-box making a motion—it appeared to be done in that way—I was standing up—I could not see the person at the helm—the steamer continued to approach towards the Surrey side of the river—I cannot say whether it altered its course after the waving with the hand, for I sat down, thinking I should be thrown down, as I thought it would either strike the punt, or we should be upset by the swell—I had scarcely sat down a moment when we were struck by the steamboat—I had not even time to call out—I was about the middle of the punt—I know I was not on the Surrey side of it—the deceased was near the extreme end, on the Surrey side—there was a little boy sitting beyond, or nearest the Surrey side—I did not observe whether Mr. Lewis was standing or sitting at that moment—the end of the punt towards the Surrey side was struck by the steamboat—I cannot say what part of the steamer struck us—we were all knocked down into the punt, and the punt, particularly the end which was struck, went under water—that caused the punt to ship a deal of water—it did not right itself—that end remained slightly under water—directly I got up I looked round, and saw Mr. Lewis struggling in the water—the punt was driven from both its moorings, and carried down with the tide—I threw out two chairs to Mr. Lewis, and other efforts were made to save him but he sunk—I did not then observe the steamer—I afterwards saw her below the bridge—I think I saw her about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after then, between us and the Surrey shore—I afterwards saw her below bridge, stopping—I rowed about for some time to endeavour to find the deceased, but did not succeed—I afterwards went with a policeman on board the steamboat—it is called the <hi rend="italic">Richmond</hi>—the prisoner Undey was pointed out as the captain—I cannot say whether he was the person I had seen in an elevated position making signals—the policeman who was with me told him he was come to take him to the station, or something to that effect, I did not hear him say what for—Undey said he had not charge of the vessel at the time, and objected to go with the policeman—he pointed to Dakers, and said that he had charge of the vessel at the time—I did not hear Dakers say any thing—he made no objection to go—ultimately they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184108230215"/>
               <p>both went with the policeman to the station, where I preferred the charge—Undey appeared to me to have been drinking—he was not actually drunk, but I am confident he was in liquor—I afterwards saw the body of my friend—he had just been taken out—he had been in the water between half an hour and three-quarters of an hour, and was quite dead, bat he had been taken out once before that—we did all we could for him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were yon sitting in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An ordinary-sized punt, as long as from me to his Lordship, and about three or four feet wide—it was a flat-bottomed one, and I should think drew no water, but I do not understand it—I have fished there many times before in the same situation—the punt was moored stem and stern above the bridge, right <hi rend="italic">athwart</hi> the stream—one of the poles to which the punt was moored had given way, and she turned and lay with the stream; but the fisherman came up again, and set her exactly in the same place as she was before, as one of the poles had not moved—it was done by pushing the pole in the river, and making a piece of rope fast to her—there were three chain in the punt, there were no sculls or oars in her—she was not moved by sculls, hut pushed along, in shallow water, by means of a boat-hook—she was square stem and stern—I know the place where the <hi rend="italic">Vivid</hi> moors, when she comes up to receire her passengers—I have seen boats lying there—it is about 150 yards from where we were moored—I cannot say whether there are shallows about there—we had only been fishing about an hour when the accident happened—we had been fishing before, but in consequence of the tide not suiting, we were obliged to discontinue fishing, and then resumed it again at about four o'clock—I do not know whether it was about flood—we resumed it when the fisherman told us we might do so—the fisherman put us on board—I cannot say whether the punt was injured at all—I have not seen it since—if I had had the curiosity to look, I could not have done it, for I was taken out of the punt a very few minutes after the accident happened—she was filling with water—she did not go down—I cannot say whether she would not go down—I did not then observe any mark on the punt—the steamer's striking her dragged her from her moorings—there may have been some injury done to her, but I do not know whether there was or not—I have not looked—the chairs we were sitting on were only a few inches above the level of the water—I should not think the ripple of a sailing-barge would place us in very great jeopardy, sitting in that position—several steamers had passed us in the day—there was a little swell with them,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184108230216"/>
               <p>but I did not consider there was any danger—the chairs were standing in the bottom of the punt—the part on which we sat was above the water—I should think the side of the punt was not more than four or fire inches from the water—I have been fishing there at all times of the tide in the same way—several other persons were fishing in the river—there had been a boat about thirty yards from us—I do not know whether it was there at the time—I saw one afterwards about 150 yards off, and my impres<lb/>sion is, there was one between that and us, but I cannot say—they were all in the same line in the river, down the stream, exactly in the same way—I cannot tell the width of the river there at high water—I cannot say whether Mr. Lewis was standing or sitting at the time we were struck by the steamer—the last time I saw him before he was in the water, he was standing—I am sure he did not fall in the water before the steamer struck the punt—I did not see him till he was in the water—I did not see how he went into the water—none of us were in the water beside—a little boy, I believe, was thrown into the water—he took hold of the punt—I do not know how he saved himself—he was wet through—I cannot say whether the stream is deeper on the Surrey side than the Middlesex, but I presume, from all the boats passing us on the Surrey side, that it is deeper there—I cannot say whether or not the steamer had any motion of the wheel when she touched the punt—I have always seen captains of steam-boats waving their hand to the man at the wheel—but I do not understand which way it means to direct him—I never went to Richmond by a steamer.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean you only drank one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I only drank one as far as I remember—I had drank no more than was rational to drink on such occasions—I had been taking a glass of wine and some ale—no more than my proper quantity—it was in the skiff I rowed about to see if I could find the body.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did Undey say or do, which made you suspect him to be in liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His manner was as if he had been drinking, and his breath smelt very much of liquor—he did not make any low remark, but it was his demeanor altogether which induced me to think so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artist, and live in Berners-street. I was one of the fishing party in the pun—I have not been in the habit of fishing there—I had been ashore in the course of the day, and went on board again about four o'clock—we had been to the house of Mr. Lewis's father, at Richmond, and taken some refreshment—none of us were in the least affected by what we drank—about half-past five, while sitting in the punt, I heard a noise of a steamer approaching—I looked round, and saw a steamer coming from behind—she was about thirty yards from us when I first saw her—she did not appear to be bearing on the punt at first—the bow of the vessel was going in a direction towards Richmond-green, about parallel with the Surrey shore—I think if she had kept that course, she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184108230217"/>
               <p>would have cleared the punt, but the Ride of the paddle-box struck the punt—she appeared to come more towards us before she struck the punt—that appeared to be from altering her course—I did not perceive any thing be<lb/>tween her and the Surrey shore which made it necessary for her to alter her course—I had observed two or three steamers going up in the morning— their passage between us and the shore made the punt rock a little, from the swell—I did not notice any thing done on board the steamer before the blow was struck—the punt was very much shaken—I was thrown down—the punt tilted, and shipped some water, and was separated from her moor<lb/>ings—when I got up I observed Mr. Lewis in the water—efforts were used to save him, but he was quite dead when he was got out of the river afterwards—the steamer was going at about the ordinary rate when she came up to us—she bad the tide with her—my impression is, that her I wheels were in motion, but I cannot be certain—she was stopped as soon after the collision took place as she reasonably could be—I did not notice whether the action of her wheels was reversed—she stopped, and remained there some ten minutes, then went back towards Richmond bridge—I af<lb/>terwards saw another steamer lying at the landing called "the Pigeons," above Richmond bridge—that is about one hundred yards from where our punt was moored—I did not notice whether she was in motion or lying there, nor whether she was close to the shore.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and have been so about eleven year. The deceased engaged a punt of me on the morning of the 16th of August, which I moored off the Duke of Buccleugh's premises, about forty yards from them—it was athwart the stream—the Surrey end of the punt was not quite forty yards from the Duke's wall—I was present when the distance was measured—I am sure the spot where the measurement took place, was where I moored the punt—I have been frequently in the habit of mooring punts for the last eleven years—I can tell the place where I moor them from signs on the bank—the current is on the Surrey side—where we fished that day is three feet two deep at low water—the channel of the river is between that spot and the Duke of Buccleugh's—the large boats, the west country barges, and steamers, pass between the Duke of Buccleugh's and the punt—I have observed that in my experience as a waterman—there was a wherry with the punt—it was not fastened to the punt, it was fastened to a chain attached to the stake the punt was moored to—I have moored punts at the same place for the last eleven years—I left the gentlemen at half-past nine o'clock in the morning—I was not there when the accident happened—I went on board just before four, and left the punt moored secure in the usual way, athwart the stream—about five was returning to the punt, and met it coming down the stream with her stern down, and the head cocked up, and water in the stern—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Richmond</hi> steamer—steamers always take the course between the punt and the Duke of Buccleugh's, coming to the channel—I saw the steamer below the punt when the accident was over—the wheels were not in mo<lb/>tion —she was swinging down—Dakers, the mate, was at the wheel—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, and live at East Moulsey. I have a brother, George William Andrews, who is a corn and flour dealer, and lives at Brentford—I grind his corn for him. On the 24th and 25th of June I saw some sacks of pollard and flour counted out and delivered from my mill—I counted sixty sacks of pollard myself, and saw them put on board a lug-boat, called the <hi rend="italic">Dreadnought,</hi> belonging to Mr. Page, a lighter<lb/>man—Wood had the charge of the boat, and Blagdon was the boy attend<lb/>ing it—it was partly laden on the 24th, and finished on the 25th—there should have been 120 sacks put on board for one customer, eighty for another, and fifty sacks of flour, which were to have been left at Messrs, Rayment's wharf, on our own account—I was not aware that any other sacks were taken from the mill than those I have mentioned, and they all reached their destination—I made out two of the delivery tickets for them myself—I employed Mr. Page, as a lighterman, and he employed Wood—I have seen a sack of flour, a sack of middlings, and a sack of pollard—one</p>

               <p>of the sacks is mine, one my brother's, and the other is a sack that was on my premises—I can swear to my own sack and my brother's, and the pol<lb/>lard the middlings, and the flour which they contain, are such articles as I had in my premises, and I believe them to he mine—the middlings is in an unmanufactured state, it is too light for a sack of flour, and too heavy for a sack of pollard—it could not have been taken by mistake—the pri<lb/>soners had not the opportunity of taking this property unless they had got into the mill, or the man in the mill had let them have it—the sack of floor is worth about 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the pollard about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the middling about 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my man Hurdle counted the remainder of the sacks after I left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wharfinger, at Pickle Herring wharf, Tooley-street, in the county of Surrey. On Wednesday, the 30th of June, I saw Page's lug-boat, the <hi rend="italic">Dreadnought,</hi> alongside of my premises, at a little after, ten o'clock in the morning—Blagdon was on board of it alone—I de<lb/>sired him to move the lug-boat from alongside of my premises, and he said he was waiting for his mate—about an hour after that I saw Wood in company with Savage, who passed on the land side of my wharf, walking in the street together—I knew Savage before, and my suspicions were ex<lb/>cited—I saw Wood get into the lug-boat—some porters were standing by, and some of them got into the lug-boat with him—Wood then pulled the tarpaulin off something that was in the boat—I saw him and one of the porters <hi rend="italic">up-end</hi> a sack, which I supposed was a sack of flour, and they <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> it on another porter's back—immediately after, before the porter was out of the boat, another sack, which I supposed to be flour, was <hi rend="italic">up-ended,</hi> and placed on another porter's back—I then walked to the land side of my premises, and saw the "first sack come from off the slip way into the street,</p>

               <p>on the porter's back; and shortly after that the second sack came—I then went and took the names on the sacks, and followed them to the end of Stoney-lane—Savage was following the two porters with the sacks, and they went to a van, which was standing opposite to Stanton's wharf, about 120 yards from the place of landing—I took the name of the van, and sent my son for a policeman, and desired him to come down Stoney-lane—a lad named Collins was with the van—a third sack was then brought and placed in the van, by the porter who brought the first sack—Savage as<lb/>sisted the porter in putting one of the sacks into the van, and he stood there superintending the loading of it—the sacks that were put into the van are now in a cart, outside this court—the name of "Collins, Vinegar-yard," was on the van—Savage is a professed dealer in marine stores—he lives by the water side, very near my premises—when the van had driyea off about fifty yards the policeman came—I then asked the boy Collins, who was driving it, where he was going with the flour—he said, "I don't know; that man (pointing to Savage, who was on the foot-path) has employed me"—I then turned round to Savage, and he said, "I know nothing at all about it; I have not employed him"—he was about to go away, when Collins desired the policeman to stop him—the policeman said be would take the van and Collins and Savage to the station, and he desired me to come—I said I would, but I would first go and secure the two men who landed the flour—I went, and the boat was gone—I called the police-bolt, and told the inspector—he told me to get into his boat—he rowed some distance, and got alongside the lug-boat—I pointed out Wood as the man who assisted to get out the flour—Wood said he had not been at pickle Herring at all, but he bad been at Bank-side delivering flour; but while the boat was rowing up, he said it was no use denying it, he had been at Pickle Herring, but Blagdon knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the Thames-police. On the 30th of June, I saw the <hi rend="italic">Dreadnoughts</hi> lug-boat coming from Pickle Herring, and soon after I received notice from Nash, and went in pursuit of the lug-boat—it was then about a mile off, near to Rotherhithe—I found Wood and Blagdon in it—I asked them what they had been doing at Piekle Herring—they said they had not been at Pickle Herring at all—I asked where they had got the three sacks of flour that they landed there—they said they had landed no flour there—I took them into custody, and brought them up the river—on the way to the station, I said, "I know you have landed the flour there; where did it come from?"—they said they brought it from the mill—I said, "If you had it over, why did not you take it to the mill again?"—they said they were afraid of getting the people at the mill into trouble.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames Police-inspector. Jones brought the pri<lb/>soner to our office, and charged him with having stolen his jacket, waist-coat, and two shirts—the prisoner said he had not taken them, and had not seen them, nor knew nothing about them—one of our men said to him, "I saw you before the Lord Mayor yesterday morning, with these things on"—I said, "Then lock him up"—he said, "The jacket is all safe"—I said, "Where is the waistcoat?" and he gave me the duplicate of it from inside his stocking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was going along the highway, and fell in with two shipmates. I did not feel myself satisfied with the schooner I was in, and they told me of a vessel going to Shields—I took the jacket and waistcoat in the room of my own.</p>
