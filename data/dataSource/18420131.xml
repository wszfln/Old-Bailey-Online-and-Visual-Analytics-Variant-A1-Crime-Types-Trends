               <p>and the prisoner said, "We hare taken very near to the amount; you must not stand hard with the man for a few shillings, because he wants money"—he said they had taken to the amount of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a few shillings short of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Now how much money do you want to-night? because I shall not give you all the money to-night, before you go up to-morrow morning to the Commissioners to have the power properly registered in my interest"—(I said so to the pair of them—they were both sitting in the parlour at the time)—the prisoner said, "Give the man 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to-night"—I said I would not give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to-night, I would make it up to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, clothes and cash—I gave him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash altogether, including the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had given him before—some of the money was in sovereigns, and some in silver—I said, "To-morrow morning go up along with Mr. Josephs, my friend, to the Commissioners, and satisfy the Commissioners that you have sold your claim to me, and have the power registered in an official way, as it ought to be done, and then Mr. Josephs will pay you the balance of the purchase-money"—the prisoner said, "You have no occasion for all that, Mr. Hart; you don't think I will deceive you"—I said, "I will have it done in a proper manner"—I did not let them have any more money that day—I sent Mr. Josephs next morning, but did not go myself—I most forget the goods which they got—my recollection is not very good—there was a jacket, two pairs of trowsers, six white shirts, two waistcoats I think, a coat, handkerchiefs, and stockings—altogether I paid them in money and clothes 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Lower Chapman-street, St. George's. I was at Mr. Hart's when the prisoner and Bouch were there—an offer was made to dispose of a certain claim on the Portuguese government for services rendered in the war of liberation—the prisoner said he knew the man was entitled to certain monies—an appointment was afterwards made to go before the Commission on Friday, the 24th of December—I saw the prisoner and Bouch that day—Bouch went in with me to the office of the Mixed Commission, and the prisoner followed me in shortly after—I produced this power of attorney (No. 4) to Mr. Younghusband, one of the clerks, (the prisoner was in the office, and near me,) and requested him to be kind enough to register it—Mr. Younghusband requested me to lay it on the table, and it would be registered in due course—I then requested him to tell me if it was all right—he asked me the name—I told him William Bouch—he immediately said he did not recollect that name—I then handed the power of attorney to him—he referred to the register and said there was no such name as William Bouch—he then asked me the number of the claim—I told him 254—he referred to that number and said it was wrong, there was no such name in 254, and requested I would produce the award paper, which I did—this is it (No. 1)—he said there was some mistake in it, he could not find any such claim—the pri<lb/>soner then said that he knew Bouch had a claim, that Dr. Blundell bad made it out, and sent it in for him—the prisoner proposed that Bouch should go to Dr. Blundell's, and get the letter that conveyed the award paper to the doctor, to which I objected, and said he had better remain till the matter was cleared up—Mr. Younghusband then left the lower office, went up stairs, and returned shortly after with Mr. Barrow—Bouch had then gone—while I was talking to a gentleman in the office, my back was turned, and he left—I have never seen him since—Mr. Barrow said, in the pri<lb/>soner's presence, that he felt this a case to be laid before the Commissioners, and Mr. Younghusband said there was no such claim in the office—after</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister, and am British Secretary to the Mixed British and Portuguese Commission—the office is No. 94, Mount-street, Grosvenor-square—the title of the commission is, "The Mixed British and Portuguese Commission, for investigating and determining the claims of British subjects, who served in the war of liberation, on the Government of Portugal;" (and the commission is constituted under a convention of the ministers of the two governments)—"for services performed for Donna Maria II., Queen of Portugal"—it is a mixed commission, partly British and partly Portuguese—(<hi rend="italic">looking at paper No.</hi> 1.)—this is one of the forms of a notice to claimants, to come in and hear the award—it purports that the Commission have come to a certain determination, subject to any objection which the claimants on coming in may make—the sum in the margin is the award which the Commissioners have determined to be due to the claimant, subject to objection, which is the privilege defined in article 40, alluded to in this form—this would intimate that the claimant was entitled to the sum in the margin, if he was content to take it—he might possibly get more, but he would certainly be entitled to that sum, if he did not object to it—I never saw the prisoner, to my knowledge, except at the time when I was called down, and saw him at the office—we have a claimant of the name of Peter Click—I hold his original power of attorney, and his subsequent appointment of a person named Leslie to be his attorney—the number of Click's claim is 154—the original amount of the claim was about 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the award was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—if Click appeared by agent, the award paper would, in the usual course of business, be delivered to his agent; and if he appeared himself, it would be delivered to himself—this power of attorney would authorize Leslie to receive the award paper—this is the power constituting Leslie his attorney, subsequent to the revocation of the first power—I have examined this paper (No. 1,) and can distinctly discover an alteration on the face of it—the party to whom it is addressed is placed in the wrong part of the paper, and there is decidedly an alteration in the sum itself.</p>

On the 11th of January I helped the wagoner to take the horses out—the two prisoners were in the tap-room, and had been there as much as an hour before the wagon came—the wagoner asked me for alight, and I took it him—Maddames afterwards called for a light—I took it him, and asked him what he wanted with a light, as he had no horses there—he said he did not want it above five minutes—I told him I was wanted somewhere else, I could not spare it for him, as he had no horses there, and did not want it—I took the light back—I afterwards saw Maddames in the tap<lb/>room—I asked him what he wanted with the light—he said be did not want it, a man of the name of Charles Lawrence wanted it, but I am well assured that Lawrence was not there.</p>

Sir,—Having lately been favoured with a report relating to the School for the Indigent Blind, and anxious to render aid to that afflicted and truly deserving class of our fellow-creatures, it is therefore my intention, and Lady Filmer's wish, to subscribe two guineas per an<lb/>num. Having occasion to send my steward to London, I have directed him to wait on you respecting the subject in question, and he will pay you the amount alluded to, and receive your receipt. Yours, &amp;c. <hi rend="smallCaps">M. W. FILMER</hi>."—I opened it myself, and this order on Messrs. Drummond for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed "M. W. Filmer," was in it—I observed to the prisoner that the cheque was for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said, "Does Sir M. Filmer intend to subscribe 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each, or is it two guineas?"—he stated that they were two two-guinea subscriptions, that he had something to purchase, and was to take 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—I di<lb/>rected my clerk to make out two receipts—while they were making out I had some conversation with the prisoner, and remarked that the signature was "M. W. Filmer," that I knew something of Sir Edmund Filmer being member for West Kent, and was he dead?—he said the present baronet was Sir Matthew, that the late one was Sir Edmund, but he was dead—the clerk then brought the two receipts; and just about that time I asked the prisoner if he was Sir M. Filmer's steward—he said "Yes"—I then went to my tin box, gave him half-a-sovereign and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, and the receipts for two guineas each, and he left the office—we have an account at the Bank of England, and finding the cheque was payable to Charles Dodd, and not or bearer, I waited till my father returned to the office—his name is Charles Dodd—he endorsed it in my presence—I paid it into the Bank myself, with other cheques to the account of Dodd and Son—it was after<lb/>wards returned from the Bank.</p>

I am cellerman in the employ of Mr. Richard Lill<lb/>wall, a wholesale cheesemonger in Lime-street—the prisoners were in his employ, Smead as warehouseman, and Putman as carman. On Friday, the 7th of January, I assisted Sraead to load a cart from the lower ware-house in Lime-street—six Cheshire cheeses were put into the cart from the lower warehouse—the cheeses lay in separate dairies—three of those came from one dairy, and three from another—while assisting in the loading I observed another cheese standing on an empty packing-case in the Cheshire cheese floor, about ten or twelve yards from the door—it was not a proper place for it to be standing—all the other cheeses were in the cart—at the</p>

               <p>distance I was I could not see exactly whether it was the same sort of cheese which were being loaded—Smead gave me the cart-note to go op stairs, for the men up stairs to put the goods specified in the note down into the cart out of the loophole—it was not usual for me to do that in so small a transaction—it was usual in large orders—this is the order Smead gave me to take up—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—all the goods that were to be packed from the lower warehouse were then in the cart—I went up into the Dutch cheese warehouse with the order—there is a loophole there, which com<lb/>mands a full view of the door of the lower warehouse—Putman was at the door with his cart—I looked out of the loophole, and saw Smead roll the Cheshire cheese into the cart, Putman being in the cart at the same time, and he must have put it away in the cart—I did not see him do so—Putman received the cheese, and he was in the cart at the time the cheese was rolled in—the cart had a tilt to it, but I saw him in the cart notwithstanding the tilt—I could see his legs and so on—I had seen him before with the cart—the packing below was completed when I went up stairs—the cheeses that were up stairs were Dutch—I then followed the cart, spoke to a policeman, and gave Putman into custody—this is the cheese that was taken, (<hi rend="italic">produced,</hi>) and here is one each of the other two sorts—they are all out of separate dairies—the one taken is thicker than the others—there was more coat on it at the time than there is now—it has been shifted about a good deal lately—it was found about the middle of the cart, but on the side—the person driving the cart could not avoid seeing it.</p>

I don't wish to hurt you; if you will give it up I will let you go"—I was coming along further—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed some money—I said, "You have got some money as well"—she denied it—when we got near to Fleet-street I saw the officer coming—I said, "If you will give me what you have, I will not give you in charge"—she said she had not got any thing—the officer said, "What is the matter "—I said, "This woman has taken some things from me, and won't give them up"—he took her—we went to the station, and did not find any thing on her for a long time, and we were coming away—the inspector said, "Stop"—he opened her mouth, and found one pin, and the chain, and some money in her mouth—I had some half-crowns and shillings among my silver.</p>

I hope you will forgive me for absconding with your money; but you are a bad man, and I shall never forgive you for trying to, cheat Mrs. Slaughter. If you let me alone, I shall never trouble you more as you have been a tyrant to me."—I heard no more of the prisoner till the 5th of January, when I gave him in charge—he stated before the Magistrate that ill usage caused him to do this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Cannon-street, City. About half-past six o'clock, in the evening of the 11th of January, I was sitting in the parlour, at the back of the shop—on turning, I saw eight or ten persons in the shop—among them were Bradcutt, Toe, Wilson, and Allen—they helped themselves to 2 1/2 lbs, of cake, 'six buns, six pies, and two half-quartern loaves—I raw each of those four with something in their hand—while giving the charge at the station, about eleven more men were brought in, and out of them I recognized Gardner and Cornish, as having been standing outside my shop, and receiving part of what the others stole—there was a gang of thirty or more outside the shop—I never saw either of the prisoners before—I missed some biscuits and other things.</p>

On Thursday, the 20th of January, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw his fowls alive and safe, and the hen-house locked—it stands in my master's premises, and is enclosed within the same fence as the dwelling-house—Mr. Hull's foreman, Richard Strut, lives there—he himself lives at Hillingdon—I traced some blood and feathers across a field, about sixty yards, to a barge lying at the Grand Junction Canal.</p>

On the 5th of January I went to bed at ten at night—I saw the doors and all the windows of the house fastened before I went to bed—I was awoke about two by a noise in or about the house—I got out of bed, went to the front window, looked into the street for a policeman, and almost immediately heard a rattle spring—soon after there was a knock at my door—I went down and found the policeman knock<lb/>ing</p>

               <p>very loudly—I found the street-door unlocked and unbolted—I had locked and bolted it before I went to bed—I let the policeman in, and found the box-staple wrenched off the back parlour door, which was open; the sash of the back parlour window was thrown up, and had a pane of glass broken, so that a hand could be inserted to undo the hasp—I found every thing in disorder in that room, the escrutoire and book-case broken open, and every drawer ransacked and disturbed—I missed three coats, which hung in the hall the night before, a table-cover off the back-parlour table, salt and mustard spoons, which were on the back-parlour sideboard the night before—they were gone altogether—I missed a locket, and a case of mathematical instruments, from a drawer in the book-case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. William James Chap<lb/>lin, coach proprietor, of the Swan-with-Two-Necks Inn, Lad-lane; I have the management and superintendence of the money in the office. On Monday, the 10th of January, there was a cash-box in the desk in the counting, house, containing three bills of exchange, not due—one for 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were four others which were of no value, as the parties had been bankrupts—three of them were for 12<hi rend="italic">l,.</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and one for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they had been lying in the cash-box several years, as far back as 1837 or 1838—I think there were eight cheques on our bankers, Messrs. Glynn, and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-notes, and four sovereigns, my own money—there was also a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three sovereigns and silver, making 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the property of my employer—I missed the box about eight o'clock, on the evening of the 10th—I had seen it safe about one o'clock, when I had occasion to use it, to go to the corn-market—I was sitting in the counting-house till near seven o'clock, and had occasion, from pressure of public business, to go into our public office, and left the keys in my desk—on my return, I went to the desk, and immediately missed the box—the desk was open, and the keys were in the lock—on the evening of the following day, the 11th, I saw part of the property again, in the possession of the policeman Hunt—I do not know any thing of the prisoner, he was not in our employment.</p>

Bank of England note—I saw no other property that he had—he said, while he was at the bar, he must have change of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, for he had just lit his pipe with one—he made quite a smile of it—he appeared to be sober.</p>

On the 10th of January, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I was on Tower-hill—there was a great crowd of people listening to a man sing<lb/>ing—I saw the prosecutrix standing close by me hearing the singing—I saw the prisoner go and lift up the bottom of her gown, put his hand in, and pull out a bag—he directly started, and ran away—I immediately ran after him, and said, "You rascal, you drop that"—he threw the bag down,</p>

I was on duty on Tower<lb/>hill on Monday, the 10th of January, about twenty minutes, or half-past two o'clock—I saw the prisoner running from Postern-row towards Tower-street, and a number of people after him, crying "Stop thief"—I ran, and came up with the prisoner in White Hart-court, into which he turned out of Tower-street—I took him into custody, and as I was taking him towards the station, the prosecutrix and Sadler came up—the prose<lb/>cutrix had this black bag in her hand, and said, "This is the money that was stolen"—Sadler said, in the prisoner's presence, that he saw the pri<lb/>soner take the bag from the prosecutrix's pocket, and run away—I do not know what reply the prisoner made, but when I first took him, he said he had done nothing—I examined the contents of the bag at the station—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Kensington—the prisoner Payne is my nephew, and has been living with me about seven months. On the 24th of December I left town for a few days, leaving five sovereigns behind a glass case—I returned on Wednesday the 28th, and missed the money—my nephew absented himself on the 5th of January—I found him next day, and I questioned him about taking the money—he said he had not taken it—the policeman was passing by at the moment, and I told him to question him—I thought he might get it from him if he was guilty —I said to my nephew, "Now James, tell me candidly, whether you know any thing of this money?"—he said, "I do not," and burst out crying—I then promised him forgiveness.</p>

               <p>me he had been robbed of five sovereigns, and that the boy had absented him<lb/>self the night before, which gave him strong suspicion that it was him who took the money—I said, "Very well, I will tell the sergeant to come down"—he said, "You come in and see him"—I went in—Payne saw his uncle call my attention to him—I asked if he knew anything of the money—he said "No"—I did not promise him forgiveness, I only questioned bun—I afterwards apprehended Swain at his father's house in Sutton-street—I told him, that Payne had said, he gave him the five sovereigns—he aid that Payne gave him part of the money to buy pistols and pies with, that he had bought four pistols, the first was a horse pistol, which be gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for, that he burst that in firing it off, that he then went and bought three more, one he gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for, and the other two 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then took Spokes into custody, and told him that Payne had said, he and Swain had the five sovereigns—I did not say what five sovereigns—I said it was Mr. Rhodes's money—he then said, that he had part of the money, and that be went with Swain to buy the first pistol, the horse pistol, and that Swain went and bought the other three himself—he said that of his own accord—I had got Swain with me at the time—he said that in Swain's presence, and Spokes was present when I was talking to Swain—it was when they were both together, going to the station with me—I then asked Spokes what he had done with the pistols—he said they had been out shooting with them that day, and they were all three covered up with clay in Addison-road field, and all three loaded, and that Swain hid them there—I took them to the station, and Spokes went with me to the field—I found the pistols there, all three loaded with powder and shot—neither Swain nor Spokes said where the money came from—they said they had part of it from Payne, that Payne brought it and gave it to them—-they did not tell me whose money it was—they both said they knew it was Mr. Rhodes's money.</p>

I stepped on it, and picked it up. I did not see any one look at me: my parcels came down; I put them into my apron all together. I paid for my things. I went out of the shop some distance; the young man came after me, and said I had got a gown in a mistake. I said I did not know that I had. I went back again into the shop; he took my apron aside and took the gown out. He called Mr. Thompson; he told him to call a policeman. 1 begged of Mr. Thompson for mercy; I told him I did not know what it was. I asked him if I might take my bundle home, or leave it with him; they said I must take it with me. As I and the policeman were going to the station, I looked to see if my parcels were right, and I found a pair of stays, which must have been with the gown, as I did not know what it was until</p>

               <p>I was in the shop again. When I was searched, they called my articles over; I said there was a pair of stays. I could not say any more then; I was overpowered. In a short time after, Mr. Thompson's young man came to the station, and said Mr. Thompson had missed a pair of stays. They did not know whether I had got them, but asked if there was such a thing in my articles; then I said, 'Yes;' they said I stood charged with stealing a pair of stays also: I could not speak to them. When I was before the Magistrate, they said a woman in the shop said I was pulling the pin out of the gown; but that is false, the pin caught in my cloak, as they pushed me, I then put my hand, to loosen it from my cloak. I never was before a Judge till now."</p>

I live in the house, and no part of it is occupied by any other person—the property that was stolen was mine—the prisoner Thomas had been an apprentice of mine, but had left me about two years—I do not know that I ever saw the others—on the night of the 31st of December my house was perfectly secure—the doors and windows were closed—we all went to bed at one time—my mother-in-law always pays attention to the doors and windows—we retired to bed about a quar<lb/>ter before eleven o'clock—about six the next morning, I found the kitchen was very much ransacked, the drawers taken out of the table and dresser, and different sorts of linen strewed about the floor—I then ex<lb/>amined the back kitchen window, and found two upright iron bars had been forced out, with a part of the window-frame—such an opening had been made as a person could get in at—I tried that by my appentice—I missed two pairs of boots out of a cupboard, and a pair of shoes, and my mother-in-law gave me a statement of some other things that were lost—I had seen my boots and shoes a day or two before—I lost six silk hand<lb/>kerchiefs, and a case of razors—the spectacles and shoe-brushes were missed the following day—I had a canary bird and a cage—the bird was taken—the bird and boots and shoes are found—the other things were gone—I cannot tell how the things went, or when—I only know that the clock in the kitchen was stopped at five minutes to one—the weights had not gone down—I thought it might have been stopped by putting the cage on a chair near the pendulum, where we found it standing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm; my shop is next door to Messrs. Hitchcock's. Between three and four that day, I saw Lowe and Wil<lb/>liams in the shop—I did not hear them ask for any thing—my attention was called by Morgan—I looked through the window of my shop, and saw Griffin looking in at the shawls—Lowe and Williams left, and I still re<lb/>mained watching—they went round to Griffin who was looking in at the window—she did not look at them, or take any notice of them—they went round to Paternoster-row—I went in an opposite direction, but did not observe them—I went to Newgate-market, up Ivy-lane, and there saw the three in a court tying up something in a silk handkerchief, which was open, each had hold of a portion of it, and one of the three put something into the centre of the handkerchief—I went to the market, and passed into Ivy-lane again—they went to a meat shop in the market—I drew the attention of the beadle to them—I went after a policeman—I brought him to the market, and pointed out the prisoners—they were then in a public-house—I stood at the door while they went in.</p>

Whenever I am out of work and low-spirited, I take more than usual, which causes quite an aberration of mind, so that I do not know what I am doing. I was in the act of fetching my own beer, and took these two pots in my hand, seeing them lying there. I was going to place them on the bar, which I was frequently in the habit of doing, when the landlord seized me by the collar.</p>

Last Monday I was in the Regent's-park—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the witness Foley—I saw the prisoner running from the cry—I pursued him till he was taken in Caroline-place, and did not lose sight of him, with the ex<lb/>ception of his turning the corner of Caroline-place—he was running all the way, and as he ran I saw him turn round once—I did not see him part with any thing—I picked up a spoon in the course that he ran, and a servant gave me a mustard-pot at the corner of Caroline-place—I produce them.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 11th of January, I was at home with the witness Allen, and Caroline Summers—the prisoner came into the room about half-past one o'clock, and asked for a young woman living in the house, named Harriet Smith—she was not at home—I told him so—he then asked for a light—he took one for a cigar which he took out of his pocket, and in pulling the cigar out, he pulled out a pair of sugar-tongs, which he offered to Allen for a sovereign—he said he had a load in his pocket which he wished to get rid of—Allen took them into his hand and looked at them—I did not see the crest on them, I was not near enough—the prisoner then produced some forks and spoons, done up in a linen cloth or rag—Allen took them into his hand and looked at them—he did not buy any—the prisoner was tipsy—I did not notice any thing but the spoons and forks among what he produced—I cannot say how many there were—there was more than one or two of each—I had none of them in my hand—next morning I told my landlady of this—she gave information to the police, and brought the police there either the next night or the night after—I saw Allen again on the Sunday, told him of the robbery, and that the landlady wished to see him—I had seen the prisoner once or twice before with Harriet Smith in the first-floor front room up stairs, where she lives—I am sure he is the man that came in.</p>

On the 24th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop alone—she first pulled this holland, which hung over a rail, about half a yard within the door, and then walked away—she pulled it as if she was going to pull it off the rail—I saw her come in at the door—she did not ask for any thing—I was five or six yards within the shop—there were persons between me and her—she went out of the shop—she returned in about three minutes, pulled the holland right off the rail, and walked away about three yards from the door with it—I went after her, and stopped her as she was just</p>

On the 15th of January, about nine o'clock, as he was coming to work, I told him Mr. Spence wished to speak to him—I afterwards went with the prisoner and Mr. Spence to the prisoner's house—we searched it, but found nothing on the premises.</p>

I am a chemist, and live in Stanhope-terrace, Hyde-park-gardens—the prisoner came to my shop on the 5th or 6th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon—it was on the 6th, I be<lb/>lieve—she asked for two Seidlitz powders—they came to fourpence—she gave me a crown-piece—I gave her the change and she went away—I put the crown-piece she gave me into the till—I am sure there was no other crown-piece there—my attention was drawn to it again in about an hour—I still found it in the till, and there had been no other drown put in in the meantime—I took it out, examined it more minutely than I had done before, and put it into my desk, separate from all other money—on the 10th of January, the prisoner came to my shop again, for an ounce of Epsom-salts and a Seidlitz-powder—(I remembered her the moment the came into the shop, as the person who had come before)—she gave me another five-shilling-piece—I saw directly it was a bad one—I called my boy into my shop—I went to my neighbour's and asked him to send his boy for a policeman—I came back, and the policeman came and took the prisoner into custody—when she gave me the crown on the 10th, I told her it was a bad one, and it was not more than three or four days since she had given me another—she said she had never been in my shop before—I asked where she lived—she would not tell me for some time—at last she said with Mrs. Allen, No. 21, Albion-street, which is not far from where I live—I marked the two crowns and gave them to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's daughter. The prisoner came to me either on Wednesday or Thursday, the 27th, I think, to have a seaman's advance note cashed—the seaman who was with him produced the forged note—I cannot say the seaman's name—it is on the note, I be<lb/>lieve—the prisoner said, "I have a note to cash for you"—I said my mother was not within—the prisoner asked me if I could oblige him by doing it before-my mother came in, as he and the seaman had been on board the ship the whole morning, waiting for the note, and that he saw the captain give the seaman the note—I said to the prisoner, "I hope it is right"—he said, "It is quite right indeed"—I said, "Sign your name, if you please"—he did so—I asked the seaman also to sign his name—he could not write, and the prisoner wrote it instead of him, and he marked it—the prisoner told me to get down two pairs of drawers for the seaman, which I did, and he said, "Don't you want some trowsers?"—he said, "Yes." and I got him two pairs down—he picked out other little things to make out the amount of the note, except 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I laid on the coun<lb/>ter—the note produced is the note which was given me—I know it by the day of the month on it, the 27th—I have known the prisoner about six months—I have cashed about three notes for people at his house before, which were right.</p>

On Saturday, the 22nd, after nine o'clock, I was standing at my master's door, and saw the prisoner in company with two others, come up and lurk about Mr. Fryett's and my master's some time, watching for something, looking in towards Mr. Fryett's shop particularly, all three of them—I am sure the prisoner is one—I had never seen him before—I saw one about the same height as the prisoner inside Mr. Fryett's door—he looked about, and I saw him come out again—the prisoner was standing outside at that time—one of them had an umbrella, which he held sideways to prevent my seeing any thing—this was a quarter of an hour before the robbery—I saw Garrett seize the prisoner, who was talking to a countryman a few minutes before—after the scuffle I saw the foreman come up, collar the prisoner, and pick up the trowsers underneath his feet, about the middle of the pavement—the prisoner was trying to get away, and cried out, "Let me go, you know my mother"—I did not see any blows struck.</p>

Coming up Whitechapel I met three young men looking about the shops, and watched them; one, thinking I was watching them, came and struck me. I followed them to this shop. I went to a gentleman and said, "There are three young men after thieving something." I went in at the door to tell the master of the shop, but before I could get to tell him they took the trowsers from the door. I immediately ran out, and had almost got hold of him, when the boy seized me, and said it was me; he is mis<lb/>taken in me..</p>

I live at No. 3, Lamp-alley, Sun-street, Bishopsgate—I am fifteen years old—I was in Newgate-street, opposite Mr. Edwards's door, and saw the two prisoners take two coats off a block, and drop one—one of them took the two, I cannot tell which, they were both together—they dropped one on the floor, and went off with the other—a little boy picked up the coat that was dropped, and took it into the shop—I went in and gave information, and then I ran after them—the prosecutor followed me, and on turning into Giltspur-street, I saw both the prisoners—Smith went up against St. Bartholomew's hospital, and was found just within the gateway—Brown followed him, and joined us when Smith was taken—I pointed him out—I am sure they were together when the coats were taken, and they both ran away together.</p>

In consequence of informa<lb/>tion from my inspector, I went to Mr. Carpenter's, and examined these duplicates, and seeing "No. 2, Tarling-street." on them, I went and found, Welsford there, in a bed-room in the front-parlour—when she saw me she said, "Oh, I thought it was Rickards, have you seen him?"—I said, "No, I have not, I came about these handkerchiefs which were pledged at Car<lb/>penter's—"she said, "Oh, I have got the duplicate of them, you can have it if you please"—she then gave me these eight duplicates—amongst them was one for the handkerchiefs and the broad-cloth—I said, "You must come with me"—she said, "I hope not, I hope Rickards has not been doing any thing wrong; he gave me the handkerchiefs, and I pledged them"—Mr. Peggs came to the station while I was entering the charge against Welsford—up to the time of my taking her to the station, she did not produce or deliver to me any thing but the eight duplicates—I went with Mr. Peggs to her lodging, to the same room in which I found her—I there found a silk dress, a piece of new Irish linen, four new veils, twelve new</p>

On the 15th of January I went into a pork-shop in Tottenham Court-road—as I stood at the counter I felt a drag at my pocket, turned round, and found my pocket outside my dress—I charged the prisoner, who was behind, with robbing me—he said, "I have not," and called, "Mother"—I said he had no mother, and held him till the policeman came and took him—I had felt my pocket just be<lb/>fore I got into the shop—I then had a crown-piece and a quantity of shil<lb/>lings and sixpences—only two shillings and a sixpence were left.</p>

Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, on the 27th of December, I heard a ring at the bell—I answered it—the prisoner stood at the door of No. 14—I asked him to come to the door of No. 13, which I had opened—he had a box with a rush mat over it—he told me he had brought it from Mr. Stewart M'Kenzie for Lord Stanley, and there was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay—he had a paper in his hand at the time—he read it as he came in—the direction was on it—he read the direction—the office-keeper was not at home—he asked for a pen, and said something about seventy-two bottles of wine, but I took no farther notice of it—he asked for a pen to write a receipt—I went down, and told my fellow-servant—the prisoner was in the hall—he said the box con<lb/>tained a chandelier—I told him to put it on the ground—he said it had bet<lb/>ter go on the chair—he put it on the chair—he said he had brought it from the Docks—I told my fellow-servant what had passed, and she went up stairs—I did not see the prisoner again till New Year's-day, when I saw him opposite the Custom-house, in Thames-street, when I went with the officer—I said I could identify him better with his hat off—he was taken into a room, and his hat taken off—I said I was sure he was the man—he went with me and the officer to the Colonial office, and there he was shown to Maling, the other servant—she looked through the glass door first, and said that was the man—the prisoner said he was at the Ship tap, in Water-lane, from five till half-past eleven o'clock—he said he could bring witnesses to Drove he was eating and drinking with them.</p>

I examined my desk in his mill at Stanwell on the 31st of January, and found there was 160 pence, 320 halfpence, and 20 farthings in it—it was safe at two o'clock—I did not leave till six in the evening—I was there all the time from two till six o'clock—there was an ink-bottle in the desk—I re<lb/>turned about twelve o'clock the same night, and unlocked the mill—I found the books and papers strewed about, the desk broken open, and the money gone—there was, among the rest, a particular penny-piece—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I had it in my hand at two o'clock that day—I went at one o'clock with the police-sergeant to Woolford's house—the officer</p>

               <p>shook the door, and said he wanted young Woolford—they were nearly half-an-hour before they would open the door—when he got in I went and found this penny-piece in the possession of Humphreys—both the prisoners were there—there was some silver, and about 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, found there—there was some ink on the money—the bottle of ink in the desk was thrown down, and the penny-pieces were marked with ink, which had been dried on them, when some had been spilt before—I told the officer that he would find a mark of flour on their shoulder, as the place where the persons got in at was a separater, which laid in an inclining state, and the person who got in would probably touch this place with his right shoulder.</p>

I took them to the station I found the mark of flour on Woolford's shoulder—he would probably mark it in getting in—I could not get into the house for some time—they were in bed, but there was plenty of time for them to get rid of money—there was ink on this penny, and on another penny and one halfpenny, found on Humphreys, but the ink is worn off now.</p>

I was an acquaintance of Mr. and Mrs. Snow's, of Portland-place—I have been an old friend of the Snow family many years—I visited Mr. and Mrs. Snow at Portland-place—we were on very intimate terms—my daughters also visited there—in December last I had heard that unplea<lb/>sant differences had caused a separation between them—on the 18th of December the prisoner came to the War-office—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge—he introduced himself as Baron de Behr—I had never heard that name or title before, to my recollection—be gave me his card with that name printed on it—he said he came to me from Mrs. Snow, as her friend—he supposed I had heard what had happened—I told him I knew nothing, but I was very anxious to hear—he said there was some letters in Portland-place which Mrs. Snow was particu<lb/>larly anxious to have—that he could obtain those letters through the housekeeper, whom he had seen—they were to be obtained through brib<lb/>ing the housekeeper—that she must be bribed by either 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot exactly swear which he mentioned—I said I would have nothing to do with the letters—he then said it would be very unkind to her, as she wished particularly to have them, and as she had no money I must assist her—he asked if I could not advance 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Decidedly no, I had it not"—he then said, "250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said I had it not—he then said, "What can you advance?"—I replied, "Perhaps I could find 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—(he had said before that he had advanced all he had in Mrs. Snow's service—130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was mentioned—he said he had advanced 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his own)—I then got five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and gave them to him—he then left, saying he would go immediately to the housekeeper—I parted with the five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from a belief of what he told me—I took no security or acknowledgment—he did not offer me any—the 18th was on a Saturday—he came to me again on the following Monday, the 20th, at the War-office, and said the house keeper was not satisfied, and must have more—I told him I had not more to spare—he said, "You must find 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more to serve your friend"—after some hesitation I gave him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, five 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and five sovereigns—he said, striking his breast, "You may trust a nobleman and a man of honour," and that he would procure the letters that day—I saw him again some days after—he called several times—I cannot remember any particular day, and he told me all the letters were safe, that he had pro<lb/>cured them—he came to the War-office on the 30th of December, and said again that he had come from Mrs. Snow, that she was distressed for money, and I must advance her some for her own private use—I said he had taken all I had—he then proposed drawing a bill of exchange for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I did not understand bill transactions, and declined to do it—he eventually persuaded me to accept the bill—he said it would be extremely unkind to Mrs. Snow, who looked to me to assist her—in the belief that that was true I consented to accept the bill—he produced the stamp—he went and fetched the stamp, and the bill was then drawn.</p>

You, who can command so many "thousands, cannot have any difficulty in returning me, according to your "promise, the sum of money you obtained from me for your temporary ac-"commodation, which sum is to me a very large one, although a trifling one "to you.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you cease to correspond with Mrs. Snow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By her desire—my letters to her were frequent at times—it is quite impossible X can state what number—I have no idea—sometimes they were ten a month, and sometimes not one a month—twenty a month is a good deal more than I can swear to—I cannot swear as to fifteen—I wrote a great many.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, or not, on that occasion express great anxiety about the letters you had written to Mrs. Snow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not—I expressed anxiety for her—I did not express anxiety about my letters, for I re<lb/>member saying to the prisoner, "So far as I am concerned, I don't care that for the letters" (<hi rend="italic">snapping his fingers</hi>)—the letters were the subject of conversation, so far as to say that—I certainly did not say that I would not for all the world that any of those letters should fall into the hands of Mr. Snow—no one was present at the dinner—the letters described by the prisoner were from me and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you anxious to get up your own letters and the letters of other persons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only by the prisoner telling me that Mrs. Snow wished for them—I was anxious only from what the prisoner said, that Mrs. Snow was anxious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not anxious that the letters should not fall into the hands of Mr. Snow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Merely from that circumstance—I cannot positively say what time the dinner at Long's broke up, but I believe it was about ten o'clock—it began about seven—I think I saw the prisoner between the 20th and 30th of December, but I cannot say positively—he called on me several times at the office, but I do not remember any particular date—he came over to my house at Sydenham on Sunday, the 2nd of Ja<lb/>nuary—he did not come there by invitation, that I swear—I was not ap<lb/>prised of his intended visit—I do not know exactly at what time he came, but it was before I returned home from church—I found him there on my return from church—he dined with me on that occasion—I dined between the morning and evening services, and he partook of my dinner—I have been a widower between fourteen and fifteen years—my family consists of two daughters and a son—the prisoner had introduced himself to them be<lb/>fore I came home—I think he left about three o'clock, or between three and four—Mrs. Snow was the subject of our conversation on that occasion—I have no recollection of the next time I saw the prisoner, but he called on me at the office—he came to Sydenham twice—the second time was on the 16th of January—he dined with me and my family then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, did you on that, or any other occasion, desire the prisoner to wait on Mr. Snow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not, not for any purpose whatever—he told me he was frequently in the habit of seeing Mrs. Snow—I did not on any occasion direct the prisoner to wait on Mr. Snow relative to some provision for Mrs. Snow—my son did not on any occasion accompany the prisoner any where to my knowledge—I have heard my son say he had once been with the prisoner—I believe my son is not here.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your age? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Fifty-three—my eldest daughter is twenty-one, and the other seventeen—some short time since I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why were some of those letters destroyed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I destroyed them as soon as I read them—there were no letters in the hands of any other person in the house, that I am aware of—I have written to Mrs. Dixon, the housekeeper—I am not aware that Mrs. Dixon had any letters of mine—I did not correspond with Mrs. Dixon.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 29th of January, about six o'clock, I looked into my shop, and found every thing in confusion—I missed from the window two pairs of Blucher boots and one pair of shoes—I have seen them since—the two pairs of Blucher boots I applied to the prisoner about, being informed he had left my place—I asked him about them—he said he knew nothing about them—I said, "If you don't give them up I will get a policeman"—his sister went to the foot of the bed, and gave me one pair—the prisoner went to a cupboard, and gave me up these other pair—he told me that another boy told him to take them, and he would make away with them.</p>

About two o'clock on Friday, the 21st of January, I was on duty at Greenwich-hospital, and saw the prisoners in company with another person—there was a crowd as the King of Prussia was coming—I had seen the prisoners and the other before standing by them<lb/>selves—I am sure they were acquainted—just as the band was coming out, the whole mob rushed up to the gate—I saw Dixon feeling a gentle<lb/>man's pocket—I then directed a policeman to watch them—be went, and in eight or ten minutes they shifted their places, and I saw Norton take this handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket—Dixon and Thompson were then one on each side of him, close to him—he took it out with his left-hand, and had hold of the tail of the coat with his right—I was not able to find out who the person was—policeman No. 190 seized Norton, and Thomp<lb/>son got away—I caught him with my right hand with the handkerchief—Norton had handed the handkerchief to him—he held it up, and said, "Who has lost a handkerchief?"</p>

               <p>appeared to me as if an attempt had been made to force it both from the outside and inside—it could be opened from the inside by forcing the lock back, but in no other way without the key—the window fastens with a sort of snap, which by tapping at the outside would fall down, and the window could then be opened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, employed on the prosecutors' pre<lb/>mises, and have a little workshop there. On Wednesday, the 19th of January, about half-past five or six o'clock, the prisoner came to my workshop, and asked for a chisel to ease a door—I asked what for, and said he would spoil any door on the premises—he took me to the folding<lb/>doors, which are on the flooring of the soap-factory, in a line from my shop to the coppers, and said, "This is what I want to ease"—I told him if he did such a thing, he would injure the door, and I would not allow it—he then left me, and went to work at the coppers—in about half-an-hour I went down stairs to get a pail of soap-ashes, and found him against the counting-house without a light, between the copper and the counting-house—I asked why he was there without a light—he said he did not want one—I said it was very wrong his being there without a light, and then, left him—I had not been up stain above a quarter or half-an-hour, before he came up and wished me good night—that was about a quartet-past six—he then left, and never spoke to a soul there—I followed him with my light, but he shut the folding-doors, and I saw no more of him—the folding-doors are generally open till we all go away, that we may see persons come up the passage, but he shut them, which would prevent my seeing into the passage—we cannot see the counting-house from our door without coming outside—next morning I came to work just after seven, and found the position of two of my screw-drivers altered, placed different to what I had left them when I went away the night before—I went to the counting-house door and found marks on the desk and on the door, ex<lb/>ternally and internally, which might have been made by either of those screw-drivers—the door must have been opened from the inside—it could not be opened outside—it throws back—I know the counting-house win<lb/>dow well—it is large enough for me to get through.</p>

               <p>the yard—I was washing in the kitchen, and I hung the things in the kitchen to dry—I do not think I went a dozen times into the yard—I will not swear it—there is only one flight of stairs in the house—one lodger lives below and one above—the two witnesses have the other room up stairs—I never saw the prisoner there—the key hung on a peg in the kitchen, and I mostly hang a cloth over it, but not always, or a shawl or a bonnet—I never missed the key from the time it was given me till he came for it—the Magistrate did not require the other lodgers to attend—the one that let Hofmire and the prisoner in, went with me, and the Magistrate said she was not wanted.</p>
