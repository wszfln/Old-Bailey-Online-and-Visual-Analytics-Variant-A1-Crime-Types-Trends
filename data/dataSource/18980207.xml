                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective A</hi>). I was on duty on January 14th, in Poland Street, Oxford Street, with Sergeant Bowden—I had seen Gyseman with Lear at six p.m. and had kept watch—about seven I saw Gyseman going into a house, I stopped him and told him I was a police officer and was going to take him into custody for being concerned in forging and uttering a cheque for £50, at 14, Victoria Street—he said,. "I do not know anything about the forgery; why don't you look for the thief"—I told him I had done so that evening and that I should search his room—he said "It is no use your going there, the cheques are burnt"—I went with Bowden, and searched the place, but found nothing—we took Gyseman to Marlboro' Street, and then to Rochester Row, where Lear was, to whom he said "Halloa, you here? had it not been for that telegram I should not have been here"—they were detained and subse<lb/>quently charged—in answer to the charge, Gyseman made no reply—I found on him nothing relating to the charge, only a pawnticket of a revolver pledged at Birmingham, which I first mentioned to him, and he said, "That is where I should have been now, and I should not have been here."</p>

I was employed by Mr. Field—I have known Gyseman about six weeks—I was entrusted with the key of my master's drawer in which his cheque book was kept—on January 11th I opened the drawer with the key—I found a cheque book and some cheques which had been used—Gyseman before that had told me if there was a good chance to find anything to let him know—I had met him at a cycle club—he asked me if my master ever posted any money in envelopes, he wanted to meet me and take it—I told him I did not know, and that it would be no good if there was one, because it would be registered, and I would have to bring back a receipt for it—I gave him the cheque book—I took a leaf from the cheque book, and copied a cheque from one that had been used—he told me to copy one, and the way to do it—I gave it to him, and I gave him the cheque book in the evening—he was present when I filled it in—he said it would be all right, he was sure he would be able to change it—he said he had been to the bank with the one I gave him and they would not change it, and I had better write "Tucker" on the back—I did not know Tucker—it was on one of the cheques that had been used—he came back with the cheque twice to 14, Victoria Street, where I had filled up the cheque—I had made a mistake in the initials—I saw him in the evening at Charing Cross—there bad been an accident to a 'bus—he asked me how I had got on—I said I had not</p>

I live at 31, Fitzroy Street, and have a shop 41, Beak Street, Soho—I am a castor of gold and silver—I know the prisoner as a customer—he has been a customer since December last—I have done casting for him since then—I did not know where he lived at first, I did afterwards when I sent some goods home for him—that was in December from the 6th to the 8th—he never told me what his business was and I never asked him—to make these things I had to use a mould of sand in an iron frame—that leaves an exact impression—the sand is worked damp—it then takes the impression very readily. On December 6th, I delivered some articles to the prisoner I had them from him a day or two before—I received nix spoons to cast, two from each mark making 12 in all—the spoons he gave me were silver and I was to cast them in silver—there were some marks on the back of the spoons, I did not know what they were—I know now that they are hall-marks—the castings I produced also bore the hall-marks—the prisoner called for them himself—I was paid 19s. 5d.—I charged him for the metal—a few days before the 18th, I received six small fruit-forks from the prisoner, and also one bread-fork—the fruit-forks were in silver and the bread-knife was in brass—he asked me to cast four from each of the fruit-forks and six from the bread-fork—but I only delivered five at that time—I was to cast 24 altogether from the fruit-forks and six from the bread-fork—that was in silver also—he said the six forks had old Dutch marks on them—I knew nothing about hall-marks at that time—the castings I made had the same appearance as the originals—there were no marks produced on the castings of the bread-fork there was some wax over the marks—I do not know what they were—I did not take it off to see what was underneath—I had never seen hall-marks on such a place before—the mould showed the mark of the wax—I delivered these articles on the 18th—I was paid £2 14s, 5d. for them—I cast them from the same silver pattern as I got the silver forks from—the forks in gilding metal and the forks in silver were all the same pattern—the mark came out as we see it there—those forks are the same pattern as those I cast—they are not in the same condition as when they left me—they were very rough and black when they left me—when he gave me the patterns to cast, he said "get them out clear"—there is a way of getting them out clear with extra care—I did my best to bring them out clearly—on the same day, December 16th, the prisoner gave me some caddy spoons—he asked me to cast two from each of the patterns, making four in all, in silver—they bear some marks on the back, I know now that they are hall-marks—I cast them—before doing so I wiped the hall-mark out—I did that because he did not ask me</p>

B., that is the maker's mark—the bowl of this spoon is silver—the hall-marks are on what we call the lip—there are no marks on the bowl—if the spoon was complete the marks would appear on the stem, above that part which is broken off, meeting the bezil round the ewer, it would be marked in the way in which the bezil was marked—looking at the unfinished ewer, that is silver with a square bezil, it is formed of four sides, on one of which is a hall-mark—I am able to trace it—that is quite a modern mark—in 1814 there 'had been a maker's mark, but I have not been able to trace it—I have assayed that, it is made of four different assays—this little circular strip of metal bears a genuine hall-mark of 1800—I think that has been part of a cover, it might have been of a coffee pot—that strip of itself would not be hall-marked by the Company, it must have been taken out of something—this little bowl bears genuine hall marks of 1801; I think this has been the bottom of a tea or coffee pot, it has been deepened by hammer<lb/>ing or beating—this body is of modern make, this bowl part will fit it perfectly well—this large bezil bears a genuine hall-mark of a date between 1670 and 1880—it is impossible to say what sort of article that has been taken from—it fits the bottom of a cup—it represents a date of 1680, which would be very valuable—these two sets of caddy spoons bear the genuine hall-mark of the lion, the date letter, the leopard's head, and the date of 1800, and the letter W. of the maker's name—we have the maker's name registered as W. T., 1880—that might be the initials of W. Tweedy—there is a great difference in the value of old silver and its, intrinsic value—two of this bundle of 12 silver teaspoons have been finished by the Company as specimens—they represent the lion and the maker's initials, W. T.—when finished and polished they represent antique spoons—three of these six gilded metal forks bear the lion, and the other three bear the lion and the king's head, also the maker's initials, S. M., Samuel Molton, registered from 1784 to 1878—the registers of the Goldsmiths' Company are open for inspection to ascertain the date of an article—these marks are not genuine—they resemble genuine marks—the Company would not register them—these forks have been gilded by the Company—these marks would be looked upon as</p>

               <p>genuine by an unskilled person, who would not see any difference—some of these 12 silver forks bear the lion and the king's head—they are silver cast, they also bear the initials S. M.—they are exactly similar to those I spoke of before, but they are not genuine—they are marked with the lion, and the maker's initials W. T.—the lion is not a genuine mark—it resembles it—these four spoons have been finished—the number of articles which I say are not genuine hall-marks are more than 60—17 of these caddy spoons bear the marks identical with the other spoons I have spoken of, except those have been finished and these have not—this article, number 17, is composed of two silver teaspoons—they are marked with the lion and the initials W. T.—they are not genuine—none of these marks are Dutch—they are totally different from ours—foreign plates in this country are not lawful unless they are assayed and marked—these have no appearance of being so marked—I know the defendant—I have seen him at the Hall once or twice—I believe he has brought foreign plate—my knowledge is only derived from books—most of the foreign plate comes to us through the Customs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't know what reward is offered by the Goldsmiths' Company—I never heard of it—I am not an expert of old marks—I have had experience of them—old silver is brought to the Hall sometimes for the experts—I am not the official who gives advice as to old marks—I was apprenticed to a silversmith, and afterwards employed in the trade—that does not especially show any knowledge of old silver—it certainly requires an expert to distinguish between the different marks—I don't think that dealers in the old trade would mistake Dutch marks for old English marks—before the Magistrate I did make a mistake as to the maker's initials, but I corrected it at a further hearing—if these spoons and forks had on them the English marks there would be no need to take them to an assayer to say that they were standard silver—if a dealer believes them to be English marks, that would be sufficient for them—I know the firm of Johnson &amp; Mathay—they are one of the first firms in this respect—after being what is called "pickled" and "annealed" they would not appear to be new pieces, there would be certain marks of wear on the ridges—those would not be lost in the fire—there would be certain signs by which you could tell—the hall-marking now is done with more particularity than it was 100 years ago—I have never seen one marked on the foot or on the base—I think I have seen one on the bezil, that is uncommon—I have, on several occasions, marked articles for the prisoner—his name is on our books at the Hall—I don't know anything about Birmingham, I believe they do mark there for less than we do—I have looked at all the articles produced—I have not found a single article of base metal—if there were any of foreign make I don't think it would be any offence to duplicate them in a fresh pattern, it would be an offence against the Customs—I suggest that this mark comes from the bezil of a cover, to all appearance the mark on one of these both is better than the other—they could be filed to the same thinness or thickness—it could be converted into a wine taster, that would be an offence against the Act of Parliament; this bears the date of 1800—as old plate it would fetch 15s. an ounce—the mark would have to be on the head—on a mere glance the mark deceived me, but not on a closer examination.</p>

What about the money?"—he took a ticket out of his pocket and handed it to me, and said, "Don't bother me"—this is the ticket. [<hi rend="italic">This stated that A.

Maudsley, Waste, Manchester—I noticed next morning that the envelope bore on the face of it the address "Sporting Luck, 6, Bouverie Street, Fleet Street, Strand, London—there were signs of erasure on the face of the envelope—I put it under a magnifying glass and could detect erasures on it, and on the back of it the delivery post mark had been destroyed by the envelope having been opened and refastened—I noticed the post-mark on the front, the date was July 26th, 9.30 p.m., and the next is S.M.P., that is St. Martin's Place—I formed my own conclusions with regard to that, Bouverie Street is in the E.C. district and there is no such post mark on it—the flap of the envelope seemed to have been opened and fastened down again—there was a postal order in it which came out with the coupon—I do not remember whether at that time this-written memorandum was on it—it remained some few days in my custody—to the best of in my know<lb/>ledge this memorandum was there at the time I received it—if it was crossed it must go through a bank—I was not at the office on Wednesday 28th, I stayed with the coupons, I first examined them at 6.30 on, Wednesday evening—I opened them and put them on one side—the examination of the coupons to see whether there was a winner did not commence till seven o'clock—after I had examined the envelope and its contents on Wednesday evening I sent off this telegram, "To Maudsley, your coupon not allowed as it was sent off after the race was run"—On July 29th I received this letter in this envelope—(<hi rend="italic">This was from the prisoner at Manchester stating that it was not until that morning that he received notice of any competitor being successful, &amp;c., and stating that the envelope teas addressed to the 'Sporting Luck Co.,' 6, Bouverie Street, London.</hi>)—on the same day I received this telegram purporting to be a reply to mine of the previous evening—"Telegram just received, fail to understand, unless satisfactory, proceedings at once, Maudsley"—in my next issue of <hi rend="italic">Sporting Luck I</hi> inserted this—(<hi rend="italic">This was a paragraph stating that</hi> £1,000 <hi rend="italic">had been attempted to be obtained fraudulently, and that sharpers would never get the best of the newspaper, and that warrants would be applied for for their arrest.</hi>)—the next I heard was a letter from Mr. Jones, a solicitor of Manchester, on behalf of Mr. Maudsley, but I had in the mean time instructed a detective on Thursday.

I am the wife of Samuel Roberts, of 2, Liverpool Street, Eccles Road, Wieste—I know the prisoner—he lived in Derby Road near me, last Jul), with his wife and a little boy called Bertie, aged about six—I have a shop—Mr. and Mrs. Cotterell were customers there—there is a tram just at the bottom of the road—about eleven a.m., just before dinner, I saw them pass with the little boy, going towards the tram which goes to Manchester, near the London Road—I do not know whether that is the London and North Western Railway, but they can come up there from London—this was on the Monday before the August Bank Holiday—I noticed that the little boy had on a new suit—I had heard something about that suit before—I did not see the prisoner again till the end of that week, but I saw Mrs. Cotterell each day—I saw nothing of Bertie—Mrs. Cotterell used to come into the shop each day—she made statements to me—I saw the prisoner passing in the day time about Friday or Saturday—he owed me some money for goods I had supplied to him, and after I saw him I wrote a letter to him, and received this letter in his writing, "August 6th, 1897. Your letter to hand. We can't see our way to let you have £1 to-morrow unless something turns up J. Cotterell. I am at home now"—I went and saw him on Friday night, the same day I got that letter—his wife was present; she said, "I suppose you have come about the money I owe you?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "I have no money, but I am expecting some from a parcel, and I am also expecting some about November, about,£1,000"—I did not get my money, and I sued him in the County Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not been disappointed by many other persons—I have only repeated these words to Mr. Sagar once, to the solicitor, and, of course, to my husband—I know them by heart—my shop is in Wieste, it is about three miles from Manchester, the London Road is half a mile off, so it is three miles and a half from my house to the station—the tram stops once on the road, but it can pull up—it stops at Cross Lane—I do not suggest that I saw the prisoner get into the tram.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service of the Post Office at St. Martin's-le-Grand—the suspected envelope came to me in the course of my duty; I have examined it—I see indications that the flap of the envelope has been raised and re-closed subsequently to the impression upon it of the Bedford Street post-office stamp—I have measured the impression on the back of the envelope and the stamp itself; the diameter of the impression on the back of the envelope is larger than the diameter of a proper impression by 1-32nd of an inch—there are also marks which show plainly where the flap rested when it was first closed down, and there are also indications that some foreign gum was used when the flap was closed a second time, which is quite distinct from the character of the gum by means of which the first closure was effected—when I examined this envelope on July 27th or 28th I was of opinion that there had been erasures before this address at present on the envelope was written—excepting that the envelope is enclosed between two pieces of glass to preserve it, it is in the same condition as when I first examined it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> An envelope such as the one in question, containing this sheet of coupons and a postal-order would present a more bulky appearance than an ordinary letter—the flap of the envelope could be raised without steaming, and yet remain intact; it could be raised with the nail, or gradually worked round—I have examined the front of the envelope with a microscope, and I am not prepared to swear that it had had another address—the most marked erasure is under the word "Fleet"; the erasure at the top of the letter "L" was clearly after the word "Luck" had been written.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The examination before it was enclosed in glass was much easier; its inclosure in glass renders close examination difficult—when I say the most marked erasure was under the word "Fleet" I am speaking from memory; it was the most marked at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in hand writing of consider<lb/>able experience—I have examined the envelope enclosed in glass; it has always been so enclosed while I have had it for examination; I have never seen it otherwise—having regard to its present condition I am of opinion that there was originally other writing on the envelope than that which appears there now, but it is impossible to make a proper examina<lb/>tion through the glass—(<hi rend="italic">Removing the glass</hi>) I can now much more clearly see indications of erasure on various parts of the envelope; the surface has been disturbed forcibly with the effect, I should judge, of removing some writing which previously existed there—the examination I now make in Court with the glass removed, confirms the opinion I had already formed—there are indications on the back, of the envelope having been opened and reclosed; the flap receded an eighth of an inch when it was refastened on the second occasion, which was caused apparently by some internal pressure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It does not require any special training or an expert in handwriting to detect erasures; but the eye of a man who was con<lb/>stantly examining doubtful documents would naturally detect a thing of that kind more easily—it is not a suggestion on my part that the flap has been opened and refastened; it is an absolute fact that it has been removed from the position it occupied first, and refastened at a much</p>

               <p>higher position—the appearance of the envelope might have been caused by a person taking out the original enclosure and reinserting it in a more bulky form—if the gum was not properly fixed it would draw the flap backwards, but the spring would have to be strong, it is simply a ques<lb/>tion of resistance—I do not think it possible to get the sheet of coupons produced into the envelope, without folding it in four doubles—if that had been abstracted and reinserted folded in a different way, and the postal order added, it might account for the spring in the flap.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re examined.</hi> The erasures are more apparent now the glass is removed—my attention has been called to Coupon No. 7—the writing of the first two names appear much fainter than the lines below.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAX</hi>. I mentioned the fact to the solicitor for the prosecution—the first two letters of No. 8 "Americus" are identical with No. 7 "Amphora," but the main body of the word is heavier; the "ericus" is heavier—there was less pressure upon the "Am" than there was upon the "ericus"; it is more faint; the colour is not so pronounced—it is not a matter from which the absolute certain deduction could be drawn that it was written at a different time.</p>

If this sheet of coupons had been placed in the envelope originally, I do not believe that the flap would have gone down as far as it originally did; I have tried it and that is my belief—if a small substance like a postal order were placed inside the envelope it would fasten down to the utmost limit of the flap; if such a bulky thing as this coupon sheet had been in it when it was first fastened down, the flap would not have gone down so far as it undoubtedly did; and there are abrasions of the flap—the condition of the envelope is not consistent with the theory that it may have been drawn back when originally fastened, owing to the gum being damp or wet, because it would not have left small pieces of the flap itself on the envelope—the envelope was re<lb/>opened by some pressure and parts of the flap were torn away.</p>

                  </hi>. On November 23rd, I received a warrant for the prisoner's arrest, and went with Inspector Edwards to the Salford Docks Ship Canal, Manchester—I saw the prisoner—I said, "Is your name Cotterell"—He said, "Yes"—I said, "I am a police inspector from London, I have a warrant for your arrest in connection with <hi rend="italic">Sporting Luck'</hi>, shall I read it here?"—he said, "No; not here"—I explained to him that in August last a warrant had been applied for, but in consequence of civil proceedings then pending it was not granted—I handed him the warrant, which he read—he said, "I do not understand the <hi rend="italic">'alias</hi> Maudsley'; that must be a mistake"—I arrested him and brought him to London—I showed him the exhibits, the envelope, the coupons, the letter of the 28th, and two telegrams—he said, "They are all in my handwriting, except the telegrams—I gave that (<hi rend="italic">The envelope relating to the competition</hi>) to my wife to post"—referring to the coupons, he said, "I see it is No. 7"—he handed me nine letters which he said had been brought to him by his wife—he told me he had a solicitor who had some important documents, and he wrote a letter to a Mr. Jones, which I posted for him—on November 26th I received a letter from Mr. Jones, and some documents in a registered parcel came after the letter—it contained this scribbling diary, several copies of <hi rend="italic">Sporting Luck</hi>, two telegrams and one defence in the High Court—in the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector H</hi>). On December 21st, about 3.30, I went to 104, Cable Street, a tobacconist's shop, "with Wensley, Smith, and two other officers—they went to Princes Street, and I went to the main entrance and naw the prisoner Henry—I told him I was a police officer—he went into the back room, and I saw Samuel come into the back parlour, but before I could go to him, and as soon as he saw me, he ran back to the factory, and Henry also—I pushed through the shop after Samuel, and Henry passed me in the passage, went through a doorway, and up a step into a room, which is used for drying snuff—when they had both gone I spoke to Samuel in the passage, which is outside the factory—I told him I was a police officer, and said, "Have you any papers, I have reason to believe you have a quantity of papers in these stables; where does that door lead to?"—he said that he had no stable, but when I said, "Where does that door lead to?"he said, "Into the stable yard"—I said that I believed he had stolen tea on the premises—he said, "I will tell you the truth, I have some stables, but they do not belong to me; they belong to Isaac," and pointed and said, "That is my stable"—I got him across there, and the two other officers came into the stable yard—I asked him where the key of the stable was—he said, "My son has got it"—the sons were brought up, and Henry said, "I have not got it"—I looked through the stable window and saw some tea, and I told them if they did not open the door I should force it, which I did, and found six chests of tea—I said to Samuel, "How do you account for this tea"—he said, "I acknowledge that they are my stables; I cannot account for the actions of my son; you brought the stuff here,. I told you you would get us into trouble; why don't you speak the truth? and save me in my old age, I wish I was dead"—Henry said that it was brought by a man named Morris and said, "Why don't you shut up"—I took a note of it and said, "Do you know where this man lives"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Where"—he said he did not know—I said, to the whole of them, "This is a very unsatisfactory account of this tea, which, I believe, has been stolen, I shall have to take you all to the station"—</p>

               <p>was we went out of the stable yard in a cab, Isaac said to Samuel, "Keep your heart up, don't fret, I will take the responsibility"—Samuel said, "I am an old man, 75 years of age, Isaac knows all about it, why don't he tell the truth?"—the six chests, were full of tea—I also found another chest, No. 23097, empty—at the station I told them that I had found an empty chest which I had taken possession of, they made no reply—I afterwards went into the loft and found 1cwt. 3qrs. 6lbs. of Trinidad cocoa beans, I saw them weighed—they were in two bags, but not cocoa bags—I went back to the station and told the prisoners I had found the cocoa beans, they said nothing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GILL</hi>. I have been in the district some years. and have known, getting on for 20 years, that there was such a person as Samuel Solomons—he was apprenticed to the cigar business and was afterwards employed in the Commercial Road—his business is grinding up tobacco stalks into snuff—he collects the stalks—he does not live at Cable Court, he lives at No. 96, Lancaster Road, Hackney—I do not know where he keeps his pony and trap—he gave evidence for the excise in a case of smuggling—104, Cable Street is some distance from the corner of Princes Square—There is a small shop there, you pass through this shop and parlour, and there is an engine house and stable used as a store; then there is a large yard and a place where the snuff factory is, and the drying room, where the stove is—Mr. Beaumont keeps a horse in the first stable in Princes Square—there is only one stable in the yard—Mr. Leicester has a place there, and then there is a wood factory and then the stable where the tea was—the premises join—a cart or a van must go through the entrance in Princes Square—I have not ascertained that the stable is used by a man who passes by the name of Morris or Brown—I have endeavoured to find Brown, one of the officers has seen him—I have no evidence to arrest him upon—this case is not being prosecuted by any solicitor—there is a protection society of the carmen and con<lb/>tractors—only one complaint has been made of my conduct in connection with the Hartley matter—I have had plenty of cases of the Carmen's. Association—the complaint was made by Mr. Kebble, the solicitor to the Association—I do not know whether questions were asked in the House about it—I heard that there was going to be—a man named Baker is the owner of this property—I saw one gentleman of the protection society about this case, but not the solicitor—I was asked about the elder prisoner and about the stable before the Magistrate—I have not taken the trouble to enquire whether he has a stable in Lomston road—when I was asked before the Magistrate my answer was that he had been mixed up in several cases—he gave evidence in a smuggling case; I do not know whether he volunteered it—I only know that he said that one of his sons had brought some snuff home, and that he would not have anything to do with it—when I first spoke to. Samuel I was alone in the passage of the factory—the beans were found in a loft which Isaac went to—the elder prisoner appeared much distressed afterwards, but not at the time—some of our subordinate officers have retired recently, Brogden is one—Lapsley is not the man who took me into custody for being drunk, but he made a complaint against me—he was degraded and left the force—other officers who were under my control have been degraded.</p>

On December 21st, I was with Smith—we went into Princes Street and saw the three prisoners standing in the doorway of the stable where we found the tea—the door was open—it was between one and two o'clock—I went to Inspector White and made a communication to him—I afterwards went to the Princes Street entrance, and waited there till White came out with Samuel—he made a communication to me—I went to the drying room, and saw Henry there, I asked him to come out—he said, "What for? What is the matter?"—I said, "Where is the stable you have got the tea in?"—he said, "I have got no tea, I know nothing about the tea, and we have got no stable"—he came down, and in the mean time Isaac came out, and we all four went to the stable—White was there with Samuel—the door was shut—Inspector White said, "Is this your stable?"—he said, "Yes, but it does not exactly belong to me, it belongs to the family"—White said, "Where is the key?"—nobody gave it up—White said, "If it is not given up the door will be forced, and the door was forced—I took a note of the conversation—as soon as we got the door opened, White said something, and the elder prisoner said, "This place does not belong to me, if there is anything wrong, it is the fault of my son"—he turned round to Isaac and said. "You brought this stuff here, you know you did, I wish I was dead; why don't you speak the truth and save me in my old age"—Henry said, "Why don't you shut up"—Isaac said, it was brought by a man named Brown, and the other said, by a man named Morriss—Henry said, "If you had let me go away when I wanted to I should not have been in this lot"—I put them in a cab and waited till Inspector White came back and found the key.</p>

How would you like it? bought this knife to-day for half-a-pint of beer, and I intended to cut both their throats to-night. If I get 14 years for this I will do for them when I get out"—the prosecutor followed to the station with a handkerchief round his neck, and was attended by the divisional surgeon immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I trade in partnership with my brother as Lombard Brothers, cabinet makers and house furnishers, at 48 and 50, High Road, Willesden Green—Brooke was last year and the beginning of this a commission agent of ours—I had known him in connection with a building society and he offered his services—we gave him a letter agreeing to pay him five per cent, on goods ordered through him when paid for—he paid his own expenses—amongst other customers he introduced Mr. Frank Fleming about February, 1897, as the proprietor of the Athenaeum Club, 50, High Road, Kilburn, to whom we supplied goods in February and March to the invoiced a" mutant of £34 9s. 3d.—we sent</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189802070051"/>
               <p>in the account I believe on April 6th, the last goods being supplied on April Second—the account was not paid and we spoke to Brooke about it—the account was to pass the committee and to be paid by Fleming—we wrote to the Club—the letter was returned through the dead letter office about June 10th—we spoke to Brooke about it—he seemed very much surprised, and said he would make inquiries—he afterwards gave us Fleming's address as 7, Princes Road, West Kilburn—about June 18th, Brooke suggested that we should draw this bill on Fleming [<hi rend="italic">For</hi> £38 10s. <hi rend="italic">at two months and accepted, payable at</hi> 7, <hi rend="italic">Princes Road</hi>]—the difference was offered as interest—the bill was presented—it was never paid—we had paid it away and were debited with it—I have never seen Fleming nor the furniture—Brooke introduced a Mr. Mayman to whom we supplied furniture to the amount of about £33—we received a cheque for £33 5s. 11d. on May 11th—Mayman was discharged by the Magistrate—Mowle was introduced by Brooke about June 9th, at the wholesale warehouse of Bailey Sloper, in Curtain Road, by appointment, as a well-to-do and substantial man who had an allowance from guardians, and was going to be married and wanted to furnish his house—a lady with Mowle was, I believe, introduced as Mrs. Mowle, or the future Mrs. Mowle—I believe Mowle had a list, like this produced, in his hand, he selected a number of articles to the amount of about £250—they wanted carved oak and we went to Kahn's where about £80 of oak furniture was selected, then to Nightingale's and bought bedding and bedsteads to about £47—the goods were to be delivered at 11, Royal Avenue, Chelsea—a day or two afterwards Brooke called at our place, at Willesden Green, and ordered for Mowle £21 worth of gas brackets from a catalogue—this is the invoice—the total is £387—some of the gas fittings were to be used in a billiard room—my arrangement with the wholesale houses (where there is a larger stock to select from) is that I buy the goods and resell to my customers—I have to pay in any event—I am liable for this £387—on June 11th I wrote to Brooke this letter, [<hi rend="italic">Stating that the whole<lb/>sale people would not deliver without cash, and Mayman and Fleming's cheque laid not been received though they had been written to, and that they named a week</hi>]—some gas-fittings and furniture, to the value of about £68, had been delivered—I wrote this letter of June 19th to Brooke, [<hi rend="italic">Staling that the goods could not be delivered on Monday owing to the Jubilee, and asking for Mowle's address</hi>]—Brooke got us the address 13, Cheltenham Terrace, and some other information—Brooke told me Mrs. Runcieman was the mother or mother-in-law of Mowle (I know her as Mrs. Runcieman); that she had bought one lease and was buying another of the house, and a billiard room was being built at a contract price of £270; that Mowle was engaged in the musical and theatrical profession; and that he was partly independent—on June 24th I wrote this letter to Mowle <hi rend="italic">[Stating that goods ordered on June 9th were ready for delivery and asking for cheque for</hi> £300 <hi rend="italic">on account of the order amounting to</hi> £390]—between the time of the order and June 24th Brooke had told me Mowle was away on the Continent of Europe on his honeymoon and that was why there was delay—about June 28th I saw Mrs. Runcieman at our premises, having written her the day before—she spoke about the goods and we asked whether she would be responsible, in fact she offered in one case to be partly responsible</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189802070052"/>
               <p>for the goods—I could not say whether we asked or she offered but she said she would be responsible—she called to make an arrangement—we asked her about Mowle's position—she said Mowle had been a friend but was no relation of hers—that was on the occasion I told her Brooke had said she was Mowle's mother-in-law—I wrote her this letter of June 28th [<hi rend="italic">offering if</hi> £200 <hi rend="italic">was paid to take a bill for two months for the balance</hi>]—I got the reply from Mowle on June 30th; [<hi rend="italic">Stating that he could not accept the terms offered to Mrs. Runcieman, that he understood three months' credit was to be allowed, that she had offered to guarantee tlie order, and offering three months' bills for tile balance at five per cent, interest, or inform him when they would send van for the goods already delivered, and expressing sorrow that a better understanding did not exist.</hi>]—I got these three bills dated July 17th—£18 and £25 payable six weeks and £25 one month after date—they were renewed by one bill for £68—that was dishonoured—I have never received a farthing in respect of that £68—I believe the gas fittings were sold—I have seen one of them in the possession of the police—I have not seen any of the bedding—Brooke also introduced a Mr. Price, Mr. Johnston, and a number of others, to whom I sold goods to the value of £900, in respect of which I have received £18—in most cases the furniture had been removed—I have seen some of the furniture in the possession of Minter and of Mayman—Johnston has been committed for trial—about the beginning of October I gave information to the Treasury, and enquiries were made—afterwards Brooke offered to collect the whole amounts, as he was the only one who knew where these men were, and we should never get the money except through him—he said he should procure warrants for their arrest—an arrangement was made by which he should receive furniture in lieu of his commission, which was supplied him to the amount of £61 17s. 11d., as on this list—we paid him 10 per cent., or about 36s. on the £18, and on some small accounts, and advanced the rest, we never got any payment for any of these things—these are the two invoices making up the £61 17s. 11d.—the receipt is not ours, nor by our authority—the signature is not like mine—I should say it is Brooke's.</p>

I believe the receipt was found by the police on Brooke's premises—I have heard the goods had been distrained on, and that Minter paid the brokers out—we have stored some of the goods for the police—we credit him in this account with £47 10s. for commission, which would have been correct had the goods been paid for—we wrote him this letter of March 4th, agreeing to increase his commission to 10 per cent, on our approving the orders before supplying the goods—we took his word that the customers were substantial people—absolutely we did not make enquiries about Runcie<lb/>man—we and the wholesale people did about Mowle—that is why more goods were not delivered—after inquiries we did not send £60 worth of goods to him—we may have sent him £4—I took shares from the Building Society from Brooke—I said before the Magistrate, "We did not make inquiries before the first lot of goods were sent in; it was our system to make inquiries through Protection Societies"—we inquired of Trade Protection Societies after Brooke introduced customers, not before, because we believed Brooke—my brother went and saw Fleming—I do not know whether he saw Mayman—he told me he saw the Club before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189802070053"/>
               <p>anything was delivered—when Brooke offered to collect all the monies he sent an agreement by post in which something was mentioned about security or a guarantee—he came and mentioned a guarantee office, I think in King William Street—I saw Mayman—he told me he had financed the Athenaeum Club in Melbourne—he wanted a carpet and other things—I did not press him to buy more—I may have asked him in the usual way—he brought a list—some of the gas fittings were supplied after a report from Bailey &amp; Sloper, but we did not know they had not been delivered or we should have stopped the order—we have not been paid by Miller—he kept dining rooms—I was satisfied from the appearance of the place that he was doing good business and would be in a position to pay.</p>

I did not know Mowle when I met him—I was prepared to trust him on Brooke's recommendation—I do not remember Mowle saying that he was engaged or was going to be married, nor about his honeymoon—goods were supplied two or three days afterwards—Mowle had not suggested before our inquiries that he was in a position to pay cash down—when Mowle wrote "Kindly inform me when it is convenient to send your van for the goods already delivered"—I have had reason to believe he was not in possession of them from knowledge since obtained—I did not know they were not parted with till July 15th—my brother went about the goods, and some arrangement was made that I cannot speak about—we did not get the goods—we did not send the van—a club was not mentioned—I thought the furniture was for a private house, and that the people would have a billiard room.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 45, Cloudesley Road, Islington—for five or six years I have been acquainted with Mowle—I lived with him as Mrs. Mowle, first at 43, Hartland Road, then at 11, Royal Avenue with Mrs. Runcieman, whom I have known about six years—she kept a boarding house at Quex Road, High Road, Eilburn—at 11, Royal Avenue I did not pay her anything, I did all the domestic work and waited upon the lodgers—at Quex Road I pawned articles for Mrs. Runcieman three times—I am married—my proper name is Mrs. Clark—when at Royal Avenue, Mowle asked me and I went with him to Curtain Road to help him to select some household furniture for a club in Cheltenham Terrace—Mrs. Runcieman was taking the house and Mr. Mowle was to rent it for her—Mr. Fleming had first to do with it, and then Mr. Mowle said he would rather not have Mr. Fleming—Brooke visited occasionally at 11, Royal Avenue—bedsteads, bedding, gas<lb/>fittings and other things came to and were stored at 11, Royal Avenue till the following morning when they were removed by Mr. Neighbour's cart because Mrs. Runcieman thought there was not room for them—they were taken to Cheltenham Terrace—they never came back to Royal Avenue—there were no alterations at the Royal Avenue—Mowle lived by waiting at the clubs and collecting money at times owing to him by several people—part of last year he had pupils—his friends in Manchester sent him, I believe,£1 a week—Mrs. Runcieman had money sent to her—I kept myself as there was not always food in the house—the boarders provided for themselves—I saw the brokers in at Royal Avenue—there were difficulties about the rent and living at Hartland Road—we left without notice and went to Mrs. Runcieman's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder and decorator, of 301, King's Road, Chelsea—early in 1897 I had the letting and selling of the lease of 13, Cheltenham Terrace, for the landlord, Mr. Falcke—I saw Mrs. Runcieman, as Mrs. Mowle, about it on May 14th, first—I addressed her as Mrs. Mowle, and she did not deny it till after a Mrs. Mowle called, when I was not in—I told her the lease was for 21 years, the first 14 years at £40 and the last seven at £42, and the premium asked,£300—she asked me if I thought it was worth it, I said "Yes," and then she said "I will take it"—an arrangement was made to go over the house, and I went over it with her—she said she wanted if for herself to let as a lodging-house and furnished apartments—I went over the house again with her, Brooke, Fleming and, I think, Mowle—after the conversation and Brooke had gone, she said Brooke was going to put £100 into the concern—they asked me if there was room for a billiard room in the garden—I measured it, and said, "Yes"—when I told her that she said, "You see the surveyor and get plans out, and let me have a specification—after that they decided to use it as a non-political or social club—the price of building the billiard room was to be £270, and £5 10s. for steps outside the front door—she agreed to pay that—she said it was a lot of money—Brooke said it was a very fair price for the work, and "I should advise that Mr. Neighbour had the work"—afterwards he said he hoped I would make a good job of it, "because I have got money in this"—the contract for the purchase of the lease was not completed—an agreement was come to, and there was to be a deposit of £30, the rest to be paid on July 15th or 16th—the agreement for lease was sent to Mrs. Runcieman, who signed it—on May 27th the deposit was not paid—she gave me £5—she said, "The name is Mrs. Mowle, my name is not Mrs. Mowle"—I said, "I have called you Mrs. Mowle up to this time, how is it you are Mrs. Runcieman now?"—she said, "Well, I have left Chelsea a good many years, and I do not wish people to know I have cloud back again"—I understood she had lived there as Mrs. Runcieman—shortly afterwards Brooke and Fleming came to look over the house, and I went with them to see what furniture was required for the different rooms, and I took measurements—Brooke and Fleming made a list—in small instalments I got about £19, the last £2 in December—on June 12th she asked me and I moved some bedsteads, bedding, and other furniture, from Royal Avenue to Cheltenham Terrace—I afterwards saw it there, and some gas fittings which came in a crate—a billiard table had arrived before that—the goods were stored there—Fleming said that Mr. Falcke had consented to their being tenant at will, pending the completion of the contract—I noticed that part of the furniture dis<lb/>appeared—the billiard table went first, and then the bedsteads and bedding—I asked Mowle about the billiard table, and he said, "I should make you laugh about that, it is a laughable story; Brooke had arranged with a man named Mayman to get the billiard table away Fiona Fleming, Brooke sent a telegram to Fleming at Cheltenham Terrace, he went to 11, Royal Avenue, where Mowle lived, and he said, "I have a telegram from Brooke to meet him at the Serpentine.

(<hi rend="italic">Asking for astist<lb/>ance and giving well-known names as references</hi>)—I wrote a circular letter to each of the references and handed the replies to Inspector Brock well—Mowle told me he was a married man not living with his wife—on another occasion Mrs. Runcieman said she was going to the North and that she believed if I went to see Mr. Kendall at Cheedle, in Cheshire, with Mowle, he would possibly get cash, of which I should have some to help her off my debt—I understood that Mrs. Kendall was Mowle's first cousin and allowed him £1 a week for life—I took the journey and saw Mrs. Kendall—Mrs. Runcieman paid the fare and gave me an introduction—Mowle waited outside—I came back without any thing—I afterwards told Mowle what she said, that "I have told Mrs. Runcieman I do not wish to see her, nor have any negotiations from her at all, nor do I wish to see Mr. Mowle."</p>

               <p>"As regards our ultimate tasks we are Socialists, and in this respect we<lb/>adhere frankly to those traditions which have elaborated by a series of generations of Russian Revolutionists, beginning with Tchernishovsky and ending with Jeliaboff and Heemann Lofatin, traditions to which the Russian Revolutionists have always been faithful, never doubting their truth for one moment—traditions which have been elaborated by the Socialist parties of all other countries. For the attainment of these ends we recognize all affective methods for the struggle with the present Russian Government, from the most peaceful and civilized to harsh revolutionary measures, according to the conditions of place and time. We may say in the words of the late Stepniak—"We are revolutionists not only to the extent of a direct rising of the people, but to the extent of military conspiraces, to the extent of nocturnal invasions of the Palace, to the extent of bombs and dynamite. The device under which we shall fight will be the re-establishment ofthe Narodnaya Volia party. With this call we address ourselves to the revolutionists acting in Russia and shall warmly exhort them to take as decidedly and as quickly as possible the course followed by Jeliaboff, Perovsky Halturin and their friends, and to attend to the precepts which they have bequeathed to us. Our programme is to be found in their precepts. On the question what is to be done, Alexander III. reigned happily for fourteen years and this is already the third year that Nicholas II. has reigned not less happily, and that at a time when reaction ought, it would seem, to have given rise to the strongest resistance on the part of the revolutionists, and to have caused their plan of campaign to be summoned up in one point, regicide, and if it appeared necessary a whole series of regicides and a systematic poli<lb/>tical terrorism. We shall devote all our strength and faculties to the revo<lb/>lutionary struggle. We shall make the service of the revolutionary cause the first and principal occupations of our lives. We shall remember the boundless</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189802070067"/>
               <p>devotion to the work and the extraordinary energy of the whole constella<lb/>tion of workers of the Narodnaya Volia Jeliaboff Perovsky Halturin and their friends. May their activity be an example for us. They perished firmly believing that we should follow in their foot-steps. "We have addressed ourselves to all Revolutionists whom our organ may reach with the earnest and friendly advice to give a new direction to their activity, and we are anxious above all that our views may be heard by our companions in Russia, and that the revolutionary organisations may adopt the conscious and firm "resolution" to enter upon the path which was trodden by our standard bearers—Jeliaboff, Perovsky, Halturin, &amp;c. The fearful mistake which the Terrorist party made was that after their victory of the 1st March, they for a moment, stopped systematic terrorism, for a moment put their sword in its sheath. If they had prepared everything beforehand and had stricken down Alexander III. on the day of the funeral of Alexander II. one of two things would have happened in Russia; either a revolution would have broken out, or a liberal constitution would have been declared."</p>

               <p>not understanding Russian, he asked Wierzbicki if there was anything the matter with them, and that Wierzbicki assured, him there was not—Wierzbicki upon that said, "Yes, I am the printer, I am entirely responsible"—I brought away the 12 packages and examined them—the pamphlets in them were unstitched—I found 493 complete copies of Nos. 1 and 2; there were 256 of No. 1, and 237 of No. 2—there were also a number of incomplete copies of Nos. 1 and 2—there were 324 copies of No. 3, all incomplete and unstitched—on December 21st a warrant was placed in my hands for the arrest of Wierzbicki—I executed it the same day at 82, St. Stephen's Avenue, Shepherd's Bush—I read the warrant to him—he said he was very sorry for the sake of his poor wife and chil<lb/>dren—he had three young children, all British born—he said, "I have nothing further to say than what I told you on Friday evening, and on Saturday morning at the printing office, I admit printing them; I printed 1,500 copies of each, all was done for Bourtzeff"—I took him to Bow Street—in reply to the charge there he said, "I have got nothing further to say than that I printed the pamphlets"—when I arrested him he repeated that the type for the pamphlets came from 15, Augustus Road—the conversations I had on these several occasions with Wier Zbicki were all in English.</p>

Sampson, Low, and Marston, of the pamphlets, and the second relating to No. 126—I found a form of delivery receipt by Messrs. Mudie, with this written across, "Not ordered," with initials—I made a further and complete search of that bedroom on the second floor, and found a large quantity of manuscript, letters, postcards, books, pamphlets, newspaper cuttings, mainly in Russian, but also in French, and a little in Polish—I found some cuttings from English news<lb/>papers there; the extracts are here—I found a piece of permanent set<lb/>up Russian type, and I found on comparison it was page 91 of No. 3 of <hi rend="italic">Narodovoletz.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale stationer, of 24, Pear Street, Manchester Square—on January 28th, about mid-day, I went into a sale of show-cases in London Street, Mark Lane—there was a gang of five or six roughs, one of whom said, "Here you are"—two or three of them pushed against me, and the prisoner turned round and put up a pocket-handkerchief and put his back to the auctioneer—there was a very great crowd, but I stood on the fringe of it—at that moment one of the men elbowed his way through the crowd, pursued by another man, and I felt my pin taken—the prisoner was going out at the door—he said, "I don't know anything about it"—nobody else was near me, I was a yard behind the crowd, and the prisoner was between me and the crowd—there was nobody within reach of me—it is a very narrow shop, and everybody was concentrated near the auctioneer—I saw that there were thieves about and buttoned up my coat, but I forgot my pin—a man came up and said, "It was not this man who took your pin, it was a little man who went off that way."</p>

I am the wife of William Chaplin, of 44, Commercial Road, Lambeth—Brown and Hunter came to lodge with us a fortnight before Christians—they paid 6s. a week for a room on the top floor—I gave Brown the key—they were very quiet—when they had been there a fortnight Hall came—I first heard his voice as near as I can say between nine and ten one morning—I asked them who he was—they said that he was their father, and that they were sisters, and that he was in the habit of drinking—I afterwards saw him in the gateway, and saw him go down the area once—I have seen him in their room—he said, "Do my children annoy you?"—I saw them go up and down the street, and one night I heard a noise, and saw them going down with a pail of thick whitening which they threw down the sink—I never saw anything taken up to the room—there has been a fire in their room—they got the coal themselves, about one hundredweight at a time—I only went into their room on January 5th—that was about 11.15 a.m.—the door was unfastened and there was nobody there—I went to the window sill and saw a paper bag—I looked inside it and found several two-shilling pieces—I took it to a friend—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I brought it back and put it in the same</p>

On January 5th I went to 44, Commercial Road, Lambeth, and saw Mrs. Chaplin—she showed us up to a room on the top floor where I saw seven counterfeit florins in this bag—I replaced them and kept observation till 4.30, when the prisoner Brown and another woman went in—we went up and said, "We are police officers and want to see about some bacon"—these things were shown to Brown, who said, "I don't know what the man does when I am out, I don't live here"—Mrs. Chaplin then came up and said that Brown and another woman took the room—I searched and found three moulds between the bed and the mattress—there was a loud knocking at the door, the landlady answered it and I followed and saw Hall run from the opposite side of the way—he passed me, I followed him—he then ran back, saying, "I don't live here"—I arrested him and then found the moulds—I told the two women that they would be charged for having moulds for making base coin—Brown said, "I am not responsible for him, he is a stranger to me, I have never seen him before"—Mrs. Chaplin was then on the landing—next morning at the police-court I saw Hunter and said, "I am going to arrest you for having moulds for making these base florins"—she said, "Very well"—I saw Wright making a search.</p>

Hunter stated that the landlady told far that she had better go out of the house as soon as she could, as something serious was going to happen.</hi>
