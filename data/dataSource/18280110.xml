It is a large shop; I had shut the door two minutes before, and gone out of sight- he ran out of the door, and I after him; he carried the cloth to the top of May's-buildings, about seventy yards from the shop, and dropped it there; I only lost sight of him for a moment or two, while he turned the corner, into Bedfordbury; I called Stop thief! and saw him stopped - I am certain he is the man: Mr. Myers picked up the cloth, and brought it back - I have a sample of each piece here; the whole is worth 20l. - it is my masters' property.</p>

I had left my house about five o'clock in the evening - every thing was perfectly safe when I went out; I went to my house next day, at one o'clock; I called for some cloaks, but did not go into the house - I remained at the gate. I called again at half-past three - I merely went for some clothes of my own and of the lady's with whom I was with in Duke-street; I did not go into the house - Aldridge, my servant, delivered them to me; I dined out. A friend came to me at No. 16, Duke-street, to tell me my house was robbed - I went there a few minutes after five o'clock, and found four or five officers in the dining-room; I found my wardrobe stripped, and the plate out of the dining-room gone; my wardrobe had not been locked - there was nothing left in it but an old pair of stockings; and some white dresses were left in a drawer. I missed a gold watch, worth 15l.; a pair of gold bracelets, worth eighteen guineas, four silk dresses, worth 16l.; a velvet pelisse, worth 21l.; twelve or thirteen shifts and about sixteen pairs of silk stockings; I also missed six silver dinner forks, which cost 21s. each; six desert forks; and eight table-spoons, worth 5l. or 6l. from the sideboard cupboard, in the dining-room; I had left the keys with my servant, and desired her to lock it - it was all my property. Some places had been unlocked, but not forced open. I suppose the property to be worth 130l. or 140l. altogether. but cannot be certain of the exact value. I did not tell the Magistrate that my wardrobe was forced - (looking at her deposition) I signed this - it says so here, but I never said it - it must be a mistake.</p>

Aldridge then went out, and I was left alone in the house - the prisoner came again in about half an hour; it was then about half-past two o'clock, I think; he knocked at the door, and I let him in; he came down to the kitchen; I told him the pudding was not done; he stood in the kitchen, looked round, and asked me if I could not get him a silver spoon - I asked him what for; he said to pledge for a trifle of money, for he was very much distressed; I asked where he thought I could get a silver spoon from, and said he would get me into disgrace, and the servant too; he then went up stairs: I went up with him, to let him out at the street door; as he went along the passage the parlour door was open - he went into the parlour, looked on the sideboard and about; I begged of him not to touch any thing that was there; the sideboard cupboard door stood a little open, and he took out a basket of plate: I begged of him not to do any thing of the kind; I saw him take the basket out, and saw there was silver in it, but do not know what kind of plate it was; he told me to keep all silent, and it would be all for the best; he told me to remain in the passage, and that if any one came not to open the door, and said he would have a good sweep; he went up stairs, and came down in about five minutes afterwards, with two bundles, and went out of the house. I never saw him any more till he came to the prison; when he went out he told me when the servant came in, to clap my hands together, and say, "Oh! Bella, I am sure there are thieves in the house, for there is such a noise up stairs;" the servant came in in about ten minutes after he went out, and directly after she came in the prisoner came up, and knocked at the door; the servant was very much frightened, and told him her mistress' wardrobe was stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her what he mentioned when she came in? A. Yes; I said, "Oh! Bella, there is such a noise up stairs - I am sure there are thieves in the house." She went up stairs directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come down before be came to the door? A. No; he knocked at the door directly she came in - she came down directly, and told him her mistress' wardrobe was stripped; he told her to keep all silent, and to go for an officer; she went, and one came - she asked him where to go for an officer - he told her to go to Benson's butter-shop, at the corner of the New-road; she went, and the prisoner went away before the officer came; I never saw him again till he came to Clerkenwell prison, where I was taken on suspicion of being concerned in this. When I saw him there he begged of me to keep my own counsel. I have known the prisoner ten years - he was a shoemaker. I used to go out to work, as I could get it, but have no regular place of service.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner employment at this time? A. Yes- I used to see him every day; I cannot mention the date on which this happened, but I remember Mrs. Kelly coming in a chaise about two o'clock on the Thursday - the prisoner was in the house at that time; Mrs. Kelly did not come in: the prisoner was in the kitchen, and went to hide himself, because she should not see him, and I went with him, as I did not wish to be seen - I do not know what Mrs. Kelly came for - she did not come again till after the robbery, to my knowledge; I do not know of any dress being taken to her.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner do with the basket of plate? A. He put it into his pockets, I believe; he carried two bundles out, but I did not see what was in them.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA ALDRIDGE. I was servant to Mrs. Kelly in October last; I remember seeing Green at Burchett's lodgings; I think it was on the last day of October - she went home, and slept with me that night; Mrs. Kelly did not sleep at home that night - it was on the Wednesday that she went out. I have known the prisoner about a twelvemonth - I did not see him on the Thursday till two o'clock; I saw him then in the New-road - Green called him, and asked him to come in - he came into Mrs. Kelly's house; he came down stairs; I had got some damsons, and told him I was going to have a damson pudding for dinner- he said it was what he was very fond of, and he should like some; I said if he could stop he might have some - he said he could not stop; I asked if he could come in the afternoon - he said No, he had got some work to do, and could not leave work till about eight o'clock in the evening- he had a herring, and part of a roll which was left at breakfast - he ate that, and then went out; I did not see him again till after the robbery: I had gone out to No. 16, Duke-street, where my mistress was, about half an hour after he left - I was to have taken her a dress and a pair of shoes - I forgot to take the shoes; she sent me home for them, and when I got there Green said she heard a noise in the house, and that I had left the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but did your mistress come to the house in a gig? A. Yes; she came to the house about one o'clock, and about three; both times were before the robbery; I first heard of the robbery when I came home for the shoes, that was about five o'clock; I opened the door with a key, and called Green; she came up stairs from the kitchen, after I had called three times, and told me she had heard a dreadful noise in the house - that I had left the street door open, and she thought some one was in the house then. I had not left the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up stairs? A. Yes, and found the wardrobe almost stripped of all the clothes; I came down again, and when I came down the prisoner was at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the sideboard? A. No - I did not go into the parlour. I told him the wardrobe was stripped, and asked him what I should do; he told me to go and fetch an officer; I asked him where - he told me to go to the butter-shop at the corner of the New-road; I went, and they told me where to go and get one; Benson keeps the butter-shop - he did not mention Benson's name; I was to ask them where there was an officer. I left the prisoner in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100005"/>house; he told me he would stop till I came back, but he went away while I was gone; he told me to keep all quiet, and not to say that he had been to the house; I said No, I would not - I hoped God would strike me dead if I did, if he would stop till I got back, and he said he would.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to say you would not tell any body? A. Because he did not seem satisfied that I would not say he had been. and I thought if I said that he would stop till I came back, and if I did not say so he might go away; Green was by my side, and told me not to say she had been in the house; I said I wished her to stop with me, and she did stop.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 29th of November, at Clerkenwell prison; he came there to see Mary Ann Green - he said his name was Williams - I told him I knew it was Sutton, and he must come with me. As I took him to the office I told him I took him on suspicion of Mrs. Kelly's robbery - he said he was innocent - that he knew nothing of it, and was never in the house in his life, no farther than walking to and fro.

             - at his first examination he denied it, the same as he had to me; what he said was not then taken down: he was brought up a second time - I had no conversation with him; no threat nor promise was held out to him by any body; what he said was in the presence of the Magistrate, who took it down; it was read over to him, and he signed it; Sir George Farrant also signed it, and I witnessed it; I saw him sign his name - this is his statement (looking at it,) and this is Sir George Farrant's signature to it - here is my signature - the prisoner made no objection to signing it; (read) "I now acknowledge that I did take the property, as mentioned by Green, and gave the two bundles to a man named William Smith, who waited for them near Mrs. Kelly's house, but I never saw Smith afterwards, nor received any of the money the things might produce, - Henry Sutton."</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Thursday that the robbery was committed I was to have met Green at two o'clock, to give her part of my earnings, to help maintain her; when I got to the bottom of Brook-street she told me to come that way - I was not inclined to go, but the servant beckoned to me to come in; I objected - I was asked to come in several times - I at last went in, and took part of a herring and roll; I then said I must go, as I had been ill for two months, and should lose my work if I did not attend to it; I went to the corner of the New-road. I had a subscription made for me while I was ill, and Smith had subscribed for me; I met him, and asked him to go and take part of a pint of porter - we went to a public-house, and had a pint of beer, and afterwards sixpenny-worth of rum; he asked how the young woman was who nursed me when I was ill- I told him she was at the prosecutrix's house, and I was to have something to eat there, and what money I had I would spend on him, for his kindness - I stopped there with him for half an hour, and in our conversation he said I was to blame if I did not get some property from the house, and could I not do it - I said No, but after awhile he overpowered me; I went in, and brought the property.</p>

            . I am constable of the night of Hackney. In consequence of information I looked after the prisoner, who lived in the neighbourhood of Hackneybay; he had left for a month, at least, after the robbery; I looked for him there, and at many other places, and at last found him at Paddington, on Sunday, the 16th of December, and found on him this bill, offering a reward for his own apprehension; I found him in bed at eight o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100006"/>in the morning; he said, "I suppose I must get up;" I said, "You need not hurry:" he laid for half a minute, being rather surprised. I said he must go with us, and before he left the room handcuffed him; he said he would go quietly, and that he was surprised at being found there; he said he wondered how I came to know he was there. I did not either threaten or promise him any thing; he said,"I went on the marsh with Newman and the other, to catch the horses - that is all I know about it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you had spoken to him about the horses? A. Yes; I did not ask how he came on the marsh - I am not certain whether he said Holden had employed him to catch the horses - he might have said so; I told him not to commit himself before me: he said he helped to catch them, and that was all he did.</p>
               <p>CHARLES L -. I am a horse-patrol, and live in John-street, Homerton. I was employed to look after Hilt and some others. I went with Cowling - his statement is correct.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Holden came to me on the 15th of October, in the morning, and asked me to go and help him to catch two horses in the marsh; having nothing particular to do I went - I asked why he wanted to go so soon; he said he had brought them from the fair, and expected the marsh-driver might impound them, as they were not marked; I got off my mare when I had rode about fifty yards, and Newman went away with the horses - I went on with Holden to Lea-bridge-road, stopped with him two or three hours, and did not see him afterwards.</p>

I asked what room she occupied; she took me up stairs, showed me her room, and in a drawer there I found a duplicate; the prosecutrix claimed the clothes she had on: after her examination, I was taking her to Tothill-fields, and asked her what had become of a pelisse and Prayer-book - I did not threaten nor promise her any thing; she walked on, and in about five minutes said they were at Mr. Well's, a pawnbroker, at High-street, Kensington, and that the duplicates were all destroyed. I went to the prosecutrix's house, in Leader-street, Chelsea, and took her with me to Well's; they there produced three gowns, a Prayer-book, and one or two more articles.</p>

On the 1st of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in my shop; my dog went to the door, and began barking; I then went to the shop door - it rained very hard; I saw the prisoner standing against my private door, close by the shop window; I asked what he did there; he said he was standing out of the wet; I told him he was welcome; he had a basket in his hand with oranges, as if he was selling them. I went in, and in about half an hour, as the dog kept barking about the door, I went to look again, and saw the prisoner standing by the private door, but took no notice of him; I then went down into the warehouse, which is under the shop, and Mrs. Cobb knocked for me - it was then almost eight o'clock; I came up immediately, went towards the street door, and saw the prisoner taking a decanter out through a square of glass, which had been cut; as soon as he saw me coming he left the decanter half in and half out of the window, and ran away directly; I pursued him, crying Stop thief! a gentleman stopped him at the corner of Bulstrode-street - I had not lost sight of him once; I took him to the watch-house; the window was perfectly whole at four o'clock; I had been in the shop all the rest of the evening; I never heard nor saw it broken till then - it was a half circle cut out, and appeared to have been done with some instrument; a decanter could be taken through.</p>

She said she saw a suspicious<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100007"/>person walking backward and forward before the door repeatedly; that he had been to the shop door twice offering oranges to sell, and, suspecting him, she had knocked me up; I went into the parlour, and asked what she wanted, and when she told me this, I immediately went along the shop, as I have said; she said the person had been there the best part of an hour, while I had been in the warehouse; I did not see the prisoner cut the glass, but I saw him drawing the decanter out through the hole; my wife saw him next morning at the watch-house, and said he was the man, but I knew him myself; I never lost sight of him - I had seen him at six, and at half-past six o'clock, against the private door; I did not see the first decanter taken out, nor did my wife, for she was in the parlour - she was in and out of the shop, as I could hear her walking about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I understood you to say, your wife said he had twice come to the door to offer her oranges? A. Yes; I am quite sure I saw the same man stopped whom I had seen endeavouring to get the decanter out.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 1st of January I heard a cry of Stop thief! and found the prisoner in custody of Mr. Cobb, who gave him into my charge; he had no basket then; I took him one street from the shop - I had seen him myself an hour before, walking about Cobb's window with oranges - I am sure he is the same man; I found 8s. 5d. on him - I should know the basket again - I saw it produced before the Magistrate at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About what time did you see him with the oranges? A. Seven o'clock; Mr. Cobb's house is on my beat; I was only by there once, and noticed him as being a stranger; there were three or four oranges in the basket - I can swear to the basket - there were not many people about at seven o'clock - I will swear there was no one but him that I saw; I did not see Mrs. Cobb at the shop window.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Brown's, next door to Cobb's. On the 1st of January, about eight o'clock at night, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I went down stairs, and saw a basket on the step of our own door, which is the space of a shop window from Cobb's door; there was a decanter and two stoppers in the basket, with some oranges; I took it in to Mrs. Cobb - I saw it there again the next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you noticed the shop about an hour before? A. No; I had not been out - I was in doors all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Cobb tell you she had seen several suspicious persons about the window? A. Yes; and she said a man came in with oranges, and he was a very suspicious fellow; that she told him she wanted none, and she heard a noise, and knocked for Mr. Cobb to come up - I believe she did say there were several suspicious persons about the window.</p>

            . Here is the basket, with the decanter, stoppers, and oranges in it; when the window was broken, a person could not reach the decanter without putting his hand in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing the shop, going to my lodgings. I saw several persons running; I ran after them a great way; the prosecutor came and laid hold of me, saying I had broken his window, and at the watch-house he said I attempted to break it, and steal a decanter. Next day the constable of the night asked the watchman if he had any charge to make against me; he said he had not, but when before the Magistrate, the watchman said he had seen me walking before Cobb's shop. When Cobb came he said a little girl had brought the basket in with the decanter and stoppers, and it must be the one I had stolen.</p>

I ran down stairs, and tried to shut the street door, but could not - I held the door with my hand, to keep him in, but he seized me by the throat, struck me on the breast, and with the blow and a kick, which he gave me on the legs, I fell out of the door into the yard; as soon as I could get my breath I called Stop thief! and Cundle, my next door neighbour, ran after him - I went with Cundle afterwards to the watch-house, saw the prisoner there, and knew him again - I swear he is the man; my gown is certainly worth 5s.</p>

            . I live next door to Taylor. On the 24th of December, about half-past one o'clock, I had returned from the Police-office, and had not been in my house long, before I was alarmed with the cry of Stop thief! and Murder! - I instantly ran out, without my hat, and pursued the prisoner down to Market-hill; he was running before me. I did not know him before; Walker and Scott endeavoured to stop him at the bottom of the hill; he slipped on one side. I pursued him the back way, through the Three Compasses public-house, and lost sight of him for two or three minutes - I got sight of him again, and sang out to some watermen to stop him, but they did not - I pursued him into Dean-street, cried Stop thief! and one of them stopped him - I came up and collared him; he then said, "Don't stop me, it is only a lark, a piece of fun;" he wished to get from me - I, with great difficulty, got him to the watch-house, and gave him in charge - Deverell, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100008"/>night-beadle, came and searched him, and found on him the duplicate of a waistcoat; two skeleton-keys were produced - I got them off the bar of the Three Compasses - Mrs. Dean, the mistress of the house was there; nobody gave them to me - I went with Deverell to Mrs. Taylor's house; he applied one of the keys to her street door, which it opened very easily; he locked it, and unlocked it again.</p>

On the 14th of December, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in Stingo-lane, within two hundred yards of the prosecutor's house; he was running sharpish, with this cannister under the flap of his coat, but I could not see what it was at first - I said, "Halloo! what have you got here?" he stopped, and said, Oil - I said, "Nonsense, you cannot have oil;" he said, "Yes, it is" - I said, "What, in a cannister? I must look at it" - I took it out of his arm, looked at it, and said, "Why, it is tea;" he said, "I don't know what it is, a man gave it to me at the corner of Seymour-place" - I took him to the office, and found nothing but two keys on him.</p>

Yes; she used very bad words; he told her he had brought her some soup home; he said she ought to be ashamed of herself for getting drunk; she directly threw the fork at him, and he threw the saucepan at her; they had lived on affectionate terms; he offered to get her assistance, but she refused; she seemed very cheerful, when she went to work next day; she said she had one glass of gin, before the two which I saw her take; my father was very unhappy about the accident, and could not sleep night nor day; he cried very much; she had been out on Christmas eve, to buy things for the dinner; the doctor bled her, and my father went home with him for a bottle of stuff.</p>

I knew she was addicted to drink; a violent blow on the head of a drunken person might produce very serious consequences, which might not happen if sober.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Brock. On the 17th of December, about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the morning, I went out to beat the mat in front of the house, leaving the door shut, but not latched, and nobody in the shop - I returned in a minute or two, and found the prisoner alone in the shop, in the act of putting his hat on. I had left some combs in the window, which was shut - I found the glass case open; and the combs were in his hat; he asked for some rouge, when I went in; I shut the door, and said he should have some in a minute - I secured him, and sent for a constable; he tried to get away, but I kept him in the shop; the combs were taken to the Mansion-house with him - I found several outside the case, and he had ten in his hat; he said nothing to the charge; these are the combs - I gave them to Figgins.</p>

I and a friend called in at the Britannia public-house (where I had never been before) and had something to drink; I had six shillings, a half-crown, and a sixpence. I left the house with that money in my left-hand breeches pocket, having paid two sixpences at the house; we were not there above half an hour; I left my companion in the house, and came out alone. I got about one hundred yards, to the corner of Brackley-street, Golden-lane; I was there knocked down by a man, by a blow in my mouth; there were four women with that man; the prisoners were two of them; Nicholls held me fast while Law took my money out of my pocket; I could swear to the man if I was to see him; Law had been in the house where I was drinking, and I knew her directly I saw her in the street; I had a gas-light over my head, and am certain of them both I got up, and pursued both the prisoners, but did not call out, as my mouth was full of blood, from the effects of the blow - I could not call out much. I did not lose sight of either of them, till they got into a house, and the door was shut - I understood the house to be the back part of the Salmon and Ball public-house; I felt very ill, and did not get them secured - I went home, and next morning I went to find them out; I went into Cripplegate without, and got Wetherall; we went to the Britannia; there was no one there that I knew, but as we came out, we turned ourselves round, and Law was coming up the street, in company with another woman - I gave her into Wetherall's charge - I had no doubt whatever of her. In the evening of the same day I went, with Wetherall and Atterwell, to the spot where they got into the house; I knew the house, and went in: we found Nicholls on the stairs of that house - I was positive of her directly; I swear to her now, and did so before the Magistrate. My money was not marked; I believe no money was found on them. I sometimes work for myself, and sometimes for other people; I lodge in the second floor, and have a wife and four children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LAW. Q. Had you not been drinking with me for above an hour? A. My friend and I went in - there was certainly some liquor drank between us, and the prisoner helped herself, but without my permission; my friend certainly knew the house, but I was never in it before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did any familiarities pass between you, or did you invite her to join your company when you went out? A. By no means, nor did I intend any thing of the sort; she took the liquor without my consent.</p>

            . I am a constable of Cripplegate without. On Monday, the 17th, Panton complained to me of having been robbed on the previous night - I went with him to endeavour to find the party, about one o'clock in the afternoon; he described the persons to me before. I accompanied him to Golden-lane - we went into the Britannia- they were not there; soon after we came out I stood talking at the door with him - I looked down the lane, and saw two females coming up; I told him to look down, and he said Law was the woman who took the money out of his pocket; I asked if he was positive - he said he could swear to her; I took her, and locked her up - he knew nothing of the other woman. Brackley-street is all in the City - he met me at six o'clock, at the Britannia; Atterwell, he, and I went to the back of the Salmon and Ball yard; Panton pointed to the door - we went in; Atterwell waited at the bottom of the stairs; as I went up the first flight of stairs I heard somebody running up the second flight; the room door was open, and Law's daughter was there - and on the second flight of stairs I found Nicholls; Panton had not described her, but said he should know her if he saw her - the moment I took her down to him he said she was the person who held him while he was robbed. He spoke to her with certainty, and said he could swear it; he said, "You are the person who held me;" she denied it, and said he was mistaken.</p>

               <p>LAW's Defence. On the very same evening I came out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100011"/>and told Nicholls to mind my child and my place, while I went to the Britannia, as a man owed me a shilling, who used the house; I staid an hour - Mr. Panton came in, and called for a pot of beer; he said, "You seem very cold - will you have a pot of porter with me?" - I said I had no objection, and drank with him. He sent for a quartern and a half of gin, and I drank a glass; in ten minutes he called for another quartern and a half - he seemed intoxicated then- I had another glass with him; and in a quarter of an hour he called for another quartern and a half, which his friend and him drank; I objected to drink more, having been ill; I got up, and bade them good night: he wished me to have more beer. As I came out he said, "Have you got a place you can take me home to?" I said I had, but it was a good way off, near Bunhill-row; he said he did not mind. I took him home, and Nicholls, who was at my house, showed us a light, and went out of the room; I said, "How much money will you give me?" he said "I have only 1s. 6d. - I shall send for a quartern and a half of gin, and give you the 1s.;" he sent me for the gin; I got it from the Salmon and Ball, and brought it up stairs; Nicholls waited at the door, and I fetched it; we all three had a glass: she went away to her room with my child; in a little time the woman of the house fetched her over, and said there were words between me and the man; Nicholls came over - he said he was robbed of half-a-crown and 3s., because I would not let him lay on my bed; I said he might search my place; I had no money but the 1s. which he gave me: he tried to snatch it out of my hand- I said, "Don't ill-use me, send for an officer, and give charge of me;" Nicholls said, "Don't commit violence on the woman," and the woman who lived down stairs said,"Don't hurt her." I went to the door; he wrenched the shilling out of my hand, and said, "I will serve you out tomorrow;" he went out, and I was so agitated that Nicholls said, "Don't go out again to-night;" I went out next morning; I was hardly able to walk, and the officer took me. As to my being in Brackley-street, I deny it; I did not think him capable of swearing what he has.</p>

               <p>NICHOLL's Defence. I was not outside the door till half-past ten o'clock. I told the officers if they would go to a public-house in Angel-street, they would find that I had been there with a young man. I have written to the prosecutor, to say if he would go to the young man he could prove I was in his company from half-past three o'clock. I never saw the prosecutor till he came into Law's room.</p>
               <p>JOHN WETHERALL re-examined. Q. When you took Law, did she give this account of the transaction? A. No- she said something similar to it to the Alderman, on the 18th.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOHN PANTON. Q. Did you leave the public-house before Law, or after? A. She left before me, I suppose ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I did not observe any man go out with her. I am certain the man who knocked me down was not in the room where I was. I cannot say whether any other woman was there with Law.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know your way home from the Britannia? A. Yes; but I went from the public-house, to call on a friend who lived in Whitecross-street - I was in the way to Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>JOHN WETHERALL. The corner of Brackley-street was in his way to Whitecross-street.</p>

I looked and saw one of her hands in his waistcoat pocket, and the other in his trousers pocket. I told Green she was robbing the man; he directly looked at her, and we saw her take her hands out of his pockets, and drop money into her basket; she had no money there before, as I had examined her basket, on her saying some one had taken her money, and there was nothing but a handkerchief in it; I set the basket on the table, and called Willis, the landlord; he examined the basket in my presence, and there were two sovereigns, three shillings, 7 1/2d., and 1/2d. in it; she said she would have the money, and that it belonged to her; the constable was sent for, and she was secured; we went to the prosecutor's house, and fetched his wife, as the prisoner said he was her sister's husband; the wife said, in her presence, at the watch-house, that she never saw her before; we searched the prosecutor's pockets, and found only one farthing in them.</p>

I was at the public-house, and saw them drinking rum and water together; the prosecutor wanted to go out once or twice, but the prisoner would not let him - she kept saying she would tell her dear sister, his wife, how he had served her; she wanted the boy of the house to fetch a coach; I saw her hands in his pockets; I saw her take them out, and drop the money into the basket, Kenes took it away, and the landlord counted the money into my hand; I saw the prosecutor's wife at the watch-house, and she said she had never seen the prisoner before, and her son said he had never seen her.</p>

            . I am a constable of the night, The prisoner was brought to the watch-house by a watchman; she said she was the prosecutor's wife's sister. The wife came, and denied all knowledge of her; I asked her why she had said so; she said she was ashamed to be seen drinking with a man, and not own him as a relation. I found 3s. 9 1/2d. in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had 5s. 6d. in my pocket. We had three glasses of rum and water in Houndsditch, and three more at this house; I paid for one; two young women came in, and drank with him; he fell down, and was lifted up; I knew nothing about the money till half an hour after I was in the watch-house; they had put me out of the public-house, but I said I did not wish to leave him there in such company, for the landlord was heading one party which was playing at cards. If my hands were in his pockets, many more must have seen them. When I came in, he was bleeding; I was cleaning the blood off, but never touched his pockets; they put me out, and said I had nothing to do with him; I said he was a freind of mine, as he told me he had lived five years where I was born; I got some vinegar for him to get him sober. I am a poor distressed woman, with a fatherless child. If I were to die this minute, I know nothing about the money; his wife was told he had lost 8l., and gave charge of me, thinking all that money was gone.</p>

On the 21st of August I left town; I locked my door, and left all these articles safe; I did not return till the 12th of October - I unlocked my room door, and found my room nearly empty; all these articles were gone; they are worth about 10l. The prisoner still continued at the house; he left some few days after I returned. I asked if he knew any thing of it - he said he did not - that he was up and down ten times a day; I told him I thought those who were up and down ten times a day had robbed my room - and after this conversation he left the lodging; I do not know where he went to lodge. I applied at Bow-street, and was present on the 31st of December, when a search-warrant was executed at No. 3, Adam-street West, in a second floor room, and a great part of my property was found there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many lodgers were in the house? A. I do not know; I lodged there nearly two years - there might be five or six, but I cannot say; three or four rooms were unoccupied before I left town. I had given the key to my husband, who left town a fortnight after me. The prisoner left within a fortnight of my return; I called the landlord up the first night of my return, and complained of my loss; I believe the prisoner did not remain a fortnight after that - I will swear he was not there a month; there was nothing about the articles to enable a person who bought them, to know they were mine: he did not visit my room - I had not twenty words with him before I left town. I applied to the Magistrate after this conversation, and the prisoner returned a day or two after he left, and was detained by the officer, and denied knowing any thing of it. The officer said I could not have a warrant unless I swore I suspected the property to be in any part of the house, and a warrant was not granted till I found where he lodged; he was at home when we found the property.</p>

I took him into custody, and took the property to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say he had purchased the articles? A. No; he said he had taken them away, and if I would let him go he would make good all he had broken in removing them. I did not mention this before, because I was not asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not sworn to tell the whole truth? A. Yes, but an officer is often stopped for saying too much. I know nothing of his having eight children - I saw one child in the room.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS JOSEPH LAINE. I live on my own property. - I arrived in town from Paris on the 2d of January, and reside at the Gloucester hotel, which is kept by Mr. Thomas Dale; I do not know what parish it is in. I had arrived in London before, on the 20th of October, and was at that hotel in October and November last, and saw the prisoner there then, until the 13th of November; he was a lodger there like myself; I am a native of France, and formed an acquaintance with him, as being a countryman. We met in the coffee-room. I was very unwell in November, and on the 13th, in the morning, I kept to my room - the prisoner visited me in my room; he was in the habit of doing so; he visited me in my room several times when I was in bed; I had a pocket-book, containing four 5l. notes and sundry papers, and I had a purse, containing between 6l. and 7l.; on the 13th of November my pocket-book was on a dressing-table, and the purse on a chest of drawers in my bed-room - I had occasion to leave my room for a few minutes, about ten o'clock that morning; I was not then dressed; I did not leave the prisoner in the room, but he had been there two or three times that morning, to see me; the door has a spring, and shuts by itself. I missed my pocket-book and purse about seven or eight minutes after I came back to the room, as I was dressing - I instantly went down stairs, and gave notice to the landlord; the prisoner was not then in the house; I did not see him again till he was before the Magistrate, at Marlborough-street. I went to France on the 15th, returned on the 2d of January, and have seen my pocket-book and a 5l. note before the Magistrate; I had not marked my note, but I had the number of it. Here is a memorandum which I made the day I lost them, in order to stop the notes; the numbers are 16,642 to 16,645, inclusive; I received them from Mr. Salt not long before I lost them.</p>

            . I know the prisoner. I am waiter at the Gate-house hotel, Highgate. The prisoner came there on a Friday, about the the middle of November; I do not know the day of the month; he came there about four o'clock in the afternoon, to the best of my remembrance: he remained there that night, and for about a week; he paid every day for every thing, as he had it, till about the Wednesday; and on the Monday he asked for change for a 5l. note, which he gave me; I took it to Ann Rogers, my mistress, who gave me the change, and I gave it to him; there were four sovereigns and some silver. On the Thursday evening he was in the coffee-room below stairs; it came on a snow, and was very cold; he complained of its being very cold, much more so than in Paris; he pulled a paper out of a pocket-book, and said it was a small bit of paper, but it was worth 800l. - I saw the pocket-book; he then said he wanted to go to London, to get some money from Stevenson's, the bankers, to pay his bill and go to Paris, as it was so cold, he could not stay in town any longer, and should go next day. Some time after that he asked if I ever went to town - I said very seldom; he asked if I would go for him, as it was so cold, to get some money from Stevenson's, the bankers - I said, to oblige him, I would go; he went into the coffee-room, called for a sheet of writing paper; he wrote a letter, and put the piece of paper into it, after reading the letter to me; he said his name was Laine. I believe the letter was written in English - our conversation was in English; I cannot speak French. I took the letter to Messrs. Stevenson and Salt's, of Lombard-street, and in consequence of what passed between me and Mr. Salt, I went to the Mansion-house with him, by his desire, and answered what questions I was asked; I went with Mr. Salt immediately afterwards, to Mr. Dale's, the Gloucester coffee-house; Goddard, the of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100014"/>ficer, and Mrs. Dale, went with me to Highgate; the prisoner had then been gone some time. On the following Sunday evening I had information where he was, and went with Fitch, the constable, and took him, at the Bull and Mouth public-house, Kentish-town. I have the pocket-book here which he produced - he gave it to me that evening, with the letter, to bring the money back in; I have had it ever since.</p>

               <p>The whole of the evidence was communicated to the prisoner by an interpreter, through whom he stated as follows - I wish to know in what place I gave the witness that letter, and what I gave it him to read for. I have been five months in England, and two months of the time confined to my bed, and in that time it was impossible I could read a letter in English. I wish to know what I should write the letter for, and why I should sign it Laine. The evidence is not true.</p>

I think he said something about 1l. or 2l. which he had not spent; he was very tipsy indeed, and I said he should have nothing more at my house that night - I do not know that he had any thing at my house; he said, "Will you let me have a bottle of wine to carry to my friends in Mary-lebone-lane" - I said he was not able to carry it; he asked me to send it, and I sent my pot-boy with a bottle of wine, and a bottle of rum.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is he called Hollett or Mr. Hollett? A. I do not know - I do not speak to him once a week - I never heard what name he was called by - I never lent the prisoner a handkerchief; he once took one from my room, without my leave, and returned it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You never heard Hollett called William? A. No - I say his name is William, because the constable says so.</p>

The prisoner lodged in the same house, in a lower room; last Thursday he came into Mary Lyon's room, where I was, and said, "Are you here, Mrs. Hicks?" he seemed angry; I turned about, and said, "I am, Brown;" he asked if I knew any thing of his quartern loaf, butter and sugar - I said, "I know nothing about it, but wait till your wife comes, and you may get some intelligence of it;" he said,"You lie, you b - y thief, my wife was not there;" he did not charge any body with taking his loaf; we told him to be easy, till his wife came in; and that she was in the room at the time, taking out a bundle of clothes, as she was afraid he would pawn them; he went away, and I went down stairs directly, to get a jug of water up, and had occasion to pass his room door, which was open - I heard him, as he was going into his room, swear by the Holy Father, that he would stick me; when I came opposite his door he came out towards me, but I did not see him coming, till he ran a knife into my left breast - I only staggered - Mary Lyons was with me - I went out to a doctor - I was able to walk there; there was not much blood from the wound. The prisoner had called me down into his room that morning, before this happened, and treated me with gin - Lyons was not there then; we first had a quartern; he drank none of that; he went out for another quartern, and had some of that - I paid nothing for the gin - I never drank with him before; it was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning - I never quarrelled with him; he stabbbed me between two and three; he was very drunk - I was not drunk - I did not attempt to strike him - I took no sugar nor butter of his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you in my room, or out of it at the time? A. Out of it - I was on the stairs; he was never at variance with me. I never knew him behave ill to any body.</p>

            . I live in this house. Hicks came into my room with a pipe in her hand, and a bit of paper; she said something to me about being idle; she was going to the fire to light her pipe; Brown came in, and said, "Are you here, Mrs. Hicks?" she said Yes; he said, "Have you seen any thing of my loaf?" she said, "No; your wife has been in here, and, perhaps, she has taken it;" he said, "You lie, you thief; my wife has not been here:" I said, "Yes, your wife has, and brought a bag of clothes in her hand, and told Mrs. Hicks she was afraid you would pawn them;" he said,"You lie - you are a parcel of thieves." I said, "Brown, don't come here to give me any of your insolence; if you are drunk, behave yourself, or I will throw you down head foremost." He went down stairs; there are only five stairs from my room to his; Hicks followed him down, and said,"Brown, look about for your loaf, may be you may find it; or have patience till your wife comes in." He then walked back into his room; she stood on the landing-place, and I on the first stair; he walked about, and went to his workstool (he is a shoemaker); he took the knife off the stool, ran towards her, and said, "By God, you thief, I will stab you;" she slid round, and the knife came against her breast; when he struck her with the knife, she ran upon him, and said, "You villain, will you murder me;" he had struck her with the knife before she ran upon him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he strike her breast? A. Yes; he ran against her, and stuck her in the breast with the knife, and then she ran in after him into his room; as he ran in he dropped the knife by his working stool; I picked it up, and delivered it to one of the officers; there was blood came from the wound- I went for an officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How can you say I lifted the knife to that woman? A. I would not swear it if you had not done so; I never lifted my hand on him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I assisted in taking the prisoner; when I got him down stairs, I asked what made him use such violence; I did not threaten or promise him any thing; he said his reason was, because he had lost his bread, butter, tea, and sugar; that she was coming down stairs, and he was coming out of his door, with a knife in his hand, but he thought he was hitting her with the handle of it, thinking he had the point in his hand; he said he had struck her on the breast.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Part of the knife went into my hand, as well as on her breast. - Witness. He did not show me his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in his Majesty's service twenty-one years, and was knocked down for dead in an engagement in 1794: I afterwards fell down the hold of the Sultan, and am quite deranged if I take the least liquor. As to this affair, I am as great a stranger to it, as if I had never seen the light - it is their own faults; they knew my failing, and might have kept away from me, and my gin too; I found myself pennyless; my wife denies taking any thing: these two were together, and robbed me.</p>

I was in the shop at the time; I had been out, and returned home; I was standing at the side of my counter, and Mr. Hone, a neighbour, was standing in the shop with me; seeing the prisoner standing outside, I said, "Walk in, Mr. Henigan." - "Yes, I will," said he; when my neighbour was gone, I said to him, "What is your business with me this morning?" (he had come into the shop) he said, "Special;" he was in the shop, standing at my side, at the exterior side of the counter; and when he said,"Special," I felt myself struck on the side of my cheek - I did not know what it was that struck me; he then said,"That is my business." I put my hand to the side of my face; I found myself very much stunned, and saw like a flash of fire when I was struck; the blood trickled down my cheek; I then went towards the back part of the shop as well as I was able - I found myself in very great agitation; some of my neighbours shortly came in, and two persons took me from the shop into the adjoining parlour, and put me into a chair. Mrs. Taylor, as soon as she could, said, "Fetch assistance for my husband - he must have a doctor directly;" the prisoner was then gone: after I was struck, as soon as I could open my eyes a little, I saw a pistol lying on the floor, in the shop, about two feet from my feet.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from where the prisoner had stood? - A. About the same distance, or rather more, nearer towards the shop door. I have known the prisoner for many years; there had been a variety of disputes between us at different times, about the meaning of the articles of a benefit society, which we both belong to.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened on the last occasion? A. About eighteen months ago, a member, named John Wright, had got the situation of beadle of St. George, Bloomsbury; the prisoner considered he had no right to belong to the society any longer, and I considered he was just as good a member as before, he not having broken the articles; the prisoner brought the question before the club - it was put to the club whether he should continue a member, and decided by a show of hands that he should continue; the prisoner then summoned me to Bow-street, before Mr. Halls; I being president of the club, the prisoner said I ought to exclude him; Mr. Halls decided that. I was right in not excluding him; the prisoner expressed himself strongly dissatisfied with me on that occasion, and in a variety of instances; he brought forward a written protest on one occasion, but he took that away the same night, as the president would not receive it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 17th of December, about five or ten minutes after eleven o'clock, Mr. Henigan came to the shop; I was at the back of the shop; he either stamped with his foot, or knocked with the umbrella that was in his hand - he was at the door, which was open. I went forward immediately; he asked me if Mr. Taylor was within;" I said, "No, he is not - did you wish to see him?" he said, "Yes; tell him my name is Henigan - I will call again." I said, "Very well, Sir; he will be in, in the course of half an hour." He went away, and in about twenty minutes my husband came in; I was behind the counter when the prisoner came again, which was in about an hour; my husband was at the exterior of the counter, talking to Mr. Hone; I heard my husband say,"Walk in, Sir - walk in, Mr. Henigan;" he said, "Yes, I will," and immediately walked in; he passed my husband, and went a little backward in the shop, towards the window - Hone was then standing in the door way of the shop - he went away in five or ten minutes after Henigan came in; as Hone went out of the shop door, I turned from behind the counter, to go into the parlour, behind the shop, and, as I turned, I heard my husband say, "Well, Henigan, what is your business with me this morning?" I heard no answer from Henigan, but instantly heard the report of a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it very loud? A. Very loud; I turned round, and saw the smoke ascend towards the ceiling - my husband stood with his hands to his face, leaning towards the counter - his side was to the counter, leaning on it; he endeavoured to call out, but could not - he generally calls me mother; he said, "Mo - mo -</p>
               <p>"twice, but could not get the rest out. I was very much frightened, and could not immediately go round the counter, but did as soon as I could; finding my husband could not speak, I ran up to Mr. Henigan (not thinking it was him), and said, "Oh, Sir, what is the matter?" he said, "I have done it - there it is; I came on purpose." I looked down, and saw a pistol lying on the floor, and, in my agitation, I said, "Good God! Sir, what has induced you to do this? What has he done? Why did you do it? Will he die? will he die?" I do not know what his answer was, but I think it was No; in my hurry I picked up the pistol, and went to my husband; I gave the pistol to Mr. Feldwick, who came in.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mary-le-bone. On Monday, the 17th of December, I was sent for, and took the prisoner into custody; I found him in custody of two others, in the shop; as I was taking him to the office I looked at him, and asked how he came to do it; I made him neither threat nor promise; he said he should answer the Magistrate when he got there; I asked him no other question then, but when we got nearly to the office, (I had been looking at him for some time, and he asked what I was looking at) - I said it was a pity for a man of his years to do such a thing as that; he said a man that was born to be hung must be hung, and it could not be helped: some further conversation passed, when we got close up to the office - I almost forget what, for I have fallen from a two pair of stairs window since, and forget a good deal that passed; he said there was no ball in the pistol - that he had only fired with wadding and powder; he said he knew he had forfeited his life, but there was no ball in the pistol - he had only fired it with powder and wadding; this was in going to the office: when I got to the office, I found a ball in his waistcoat pocket; I recollect the conversation perfectly well, and swear to it. On searching him I found the visiting-committee book of the club, and a tin case, a comb, a knife, and the bullet, which was tried to the pistol, and fitted exactly; he had an umbrella.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you the bullet here? - A. I was taking something out of my pocket in the other Court this morning, and have unfortunately lost it; but I tried it - it was a perfectly new bullet, and had never been fired - he told Mr. Rawlinson, the Magistrate, that he had had it cast on purpose to shoot Mr. Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he used that expression? A. That is what he said in the office; I believe it was taken down in writing; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you to be a man of sound understanding? A. Perfectly so; he was perfectly collected.</p>

            . I lodge at No. 48, Upper Rathbone-place. I am a cobler, and have a stall under Taylor's window. On the 17th of December I heard the report of a pistol; I got out of my stall; went into Taylor's shop, and there saw Mrs. Taylor picking up a pistol from the floor - she gave it to me - I have had it ever since, and produce it- it is a new pistol - I saw Mr. Taylor in the shop, holding the prisoner; the blood was running down his face, and his eye was very black.</p>
               <p>Q. He was holding the prisoner, was he? A. Yes; Mr. Taylor said, "This man has been and tried to blow out my brains" - the prisoner must have heard that; I asked Taylor, who had tried to blow out his brains; he said,"This man," (the prisoner;) I immediately seized and held him till Patten came; Wright afterwards came - he and I took him to Mary-le-bone Office - I saw the tin-case and book found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you knew nothing of him before? A. No; when I came in Taylor was holding him by the collar.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and saw Mr. Taylor about ten minutes after the accident happened; his right cheek was scorched, there was a small portion of the skin grazed, and a slight inflammation of the eye on that side - I suppose that inflammation to have been occasioned by the explosion having taken place so near - there was some little congealed blood on the cheek, and a few grains of powder in the skin, about an inch from the wound, I think.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often did you attend him? A. Three or four days - it might be a day or two more - it was less than a week - he was then perfectly cured.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the skin have been grazed by the muzzle or cock of the pistol striking against his cheek? A. I should rather think it might be occasioned by that - it was nothing more than a skin wound; I live in Berner-street.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TAYLOR re-examined. No ball was found in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. In the position in which the prisoner and you stood when the pistol was fired, if there had been a ball, and it missed you, would it have struck on a wall, or gone out of the shop? A. It would have struck on the wall; no search has been made to see if a ball had struck there - no ball has been found, nor has search been made for one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the wall papered, or what, where the ball must have struck? A. There is paper on it - I have not looked for any mark on the paper, but if there had been one no doubt I should have observed it - my wife sweeps the shop - she has never produced any ball or shot to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this paper your hand-writing? A. (Looking at it) A friend wrote it for me - I have signed it; the body of it is not my writing - it was written by my direction, about two hours after the accident.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had there been any difference between you and the prisoner? A. On the 3d of December - I had not seen him after the 3d - this happened a fortnight afterwards - I continued on the books of the society for a fortnight all but three days, in consequence of this accident.</p>
               <p>The paper produced was here read, as follows:- I, Robert Taylor, being a member of the United Britons' Benefit Society, declare on the funds of the same, being confined from a wound received from Nicholas Henigan, by a pistol, at half-past eleven o'clock. ROBERT TAYLOR.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am accused of having acted with a malicious and felonious intent to disfigure or inflict bodily injury on the prosecutor, Robert Taylor. The malicious and felonious intent I solemnly disclaim: it is this that constitutes, in my humble opinion, the essence of my imputed offence: it is this, Gentlemen, to which I pray your attention: if this intent be not found, which I trust I shall be able completely to disprove, I humbly submit that I shall be entitled to your verdict. That malice or felonious intention I solemnly disclaim, as I hope for mercy at a superior tribunal. I never thought or dreamt of injuring the person of the prosecutor; the slight scratch on his face was purely accidental and unpremeditated, never intended or thought of as a possible occurrence. It must be perfectly clear to you, from the evidence, that no injury was contemplated to his life; and it must, I submit, be equally evident that no serious injury whatever to his person could have been intended. The alarm occasioned to Mrs. Taylor certainly never entered my thoughts either at the moment or before, or after, and I most humbly ask her pardon,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100019"/>and hope that no serious consequences may follow. My only object, in my attack, if it can be so named, on Mr. Taylor, was to afford a lesson to him and to others, how dangerous it might possibley prove, wantonly to trifle and sport with men's characters in such serious matters; much more from malice or revenge of real or supposed injuries, to invent or circulate atrocious calumnies. I see here some gentlemen of the highest respectability, who attend for the purpose of speaking to my character, who have known me, some of them from fifteen to thirty years; and I think I may say, with confidence, that not one of them, from their knowledge of me, could ever have imagined that I ever could be capable of acting as it is said I have now done, from motives of malice or revenge. Those members of the benefit society to which the prosecutor and defendant in this case both have belonged for seventeen years, will also, I have no doubt, in their minds acquit me of such motives. Gentlemen, after calling a few witnesses in explanation of circumstances deducted from the evidences produced against me, and a few others relating to matters, perhaps, of small advantage to me, and hoping your kind attention, I shall leave my case with confidence in your hands.</p>
               <p>Eight witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you would not have bought it, if you had entertained any suspicion? A. No; it was openly sold - I agreed for the price in the open market - I took him up the yard, and desired the ostler to bring a light, and I should see to pay him - I asked him whose horse it was; he said his own - I asked where he came from; he said it became his own, by the death of his father; he had a crape hat-band on, and I considered his story correct; he gave me the name of William Thompson, living at Totten-hill, near Lynn. I put it down at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. Might he not have referred you to Thompson, as the person from whom the horse came? A. I am certain he said that was his name.</p>

            . I deal in china, glass, and Staffordshire ware, and live in Goswell-road, opposite the Northampton Arms. I have known the prisoner from a child. On the 8th of December, when I came home, about eight o'clock in the evening, I found him at my house; I said, "How came you so far from home?" he said, "I was out of employ," and so I thought he had come to town, to look for employ; he slept at my house that night, and I saw him again on Sunday morning, the 9th; he breakfasted with me, and some little time afterwards, while I was dressing myself, he said, "I am not left without money; I can raise eleven sovereigns, and some silver;" I said, "I am happy to hear it: you have not left home in poverty?" he said, No; he left eleven sovereigns with me to keep for him; and afterwards, in consequence of a message, I went and saw him in Newgate - I held out no threat nor promise whatever to him - I said, "Matthew, I am very sorry to see you in this case;" he looked at me, and was fit to cry; I said, "I suppose some evil person has led you into this;" he said there has, and named William Thompson of Totten-hill; he said William Thompson broke the stable door open, and took the horse out, and gave him directions to bring it to London, and what house to come to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he was at the time? A. No; he said Thompson broke the stable open, and put the saddle and bridle on the horse, and told him which way to come.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. Twelve or fourteen years - I know his friends; they are very respectable, for their situation in life; he always bore the best of character.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to go that way? A. I had been home, found myself locked out, and did not know where to go - I was walking about the streets - I spent the evening in Frith-street, Soho; just at the top of Bouverie-street, I, received a blow from a fist, on the side of my head, which brought me to the ground - I had not observed any body near me. When I was brought to the ground, a man stood over me, and was pulling at my watch ribbon - I saw but one man; he pulled three times, and each time, the pull lifted my body from the ground, and after pulling me up three times, the bow of the watch broke, with the violence of the pull; he struck my head against the stones each time, and the last time it quite took away my senses; the man got away - I was not able to distinguish who he was; I lay senseless on the ground; I found the prisoner in the watch-house that night. when I came to my senses. I saw my two seals at Guildhall next day, and have not the least doubt of them - they are chased, and have an impression on them; part of the ribbon remained on them - it was the same ribbon as was attached to my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you been out all day? A. No; I left home in the middle of the day; I had been on business part of the time; I left my friend's house, in Frith-street, between eleven and twelve o'clock; I had no supper. I went down to Covent-garden after that, and saw two women under the Piazzas; one was a woman of the town; the other professed not to be so; they overtook me in Bow-street, about half-past eleven o'clock; I walked with one of them down to Wych-street- I was sober, and swear I had my seals safe then.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with yourself after that? A. I cannot say, for I received a blow in Wych-street, from two men, which took away my senses - I was sober then; I stood talking with the woman. I did not apply to the watchman, for I thought they did it out of a lark, as they ran off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the Magistrate it was a tall man who stood over you? A. He appeared taller than the prisoner; I cannot tell what happened after I received the blow in Wych-street; I drank part of a glass of brandy and water at one house with the women, and gin and water at another; the blow I received at the top of Bouverie-street restored my senses; I was not intoxicated, but the blow I received in Wych-street took away my senses. I said at the watch-house, that I had lost my watch, but I had not then discovered that it was left.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Whitefriars. About ten minutes after two o'clock, I was sitting in my box, in Silver-street, about ten yards from Bouverie-street - I heard two people scuffling at the corner of Bouverie-street and Fleet-street; I did not go up to them, but in a minute or two I saw the prisoner run by my box, and at the end of Silver-street he turned to the right, into Lombard-street, to get into Fleet-street again; I am sure it was him; I saw him turn to the right again, towards Bouverie-street: I then ran back into Silver-street, and came up with him at the corner of Bouverie-street, meeting him; when I came up I saw the prosecutor lying senseless on the ground; the prisoner was two or three yards from him; when he saw me and another watchman coming up, he calling Watch! and insisted on our taking the prosecutor in charge, for assaulting him; and about a minute after the prosecutor seemed to come to himself a little; he got up, and said to the prisoner, "You rascal, you have robbed me of my watch and seals;" he gave him in charge for the robbery, and the prisoner charged him with the assault - they were both taken to the watch-house; the prosecutor appeared to have all his senses knocked out of him: he had several blows on his head, and his coat was covered with mud. When the prisoner ran by me there was not another soul near, and when I followed him round I saw nobody but him, except the watchman and prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You heard a scuffle, but did not go up? A. No - I did not think any thing of it at the time; the prisoner made a circuit, and came round within three yards of the spot where the prosecutor lay; the prosecutor came to himself; but then his senses appeared to leave him again - he did not properly come to himself till he came to the watch-house. He said at the watch-house that the man who stood over him was taller than the prisoner - the prisoner insisted on the prosecutor being searched; the prosecutor certainly said that the man was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100021"/>taller, but when he came to himself he contradicted that; when he had been about five minutes in the watch-house he said he had lost his watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman - my beat extends from Lombard-court, round to the back door of the Bolt-in-Tun, Fleet-street. I was going towards Bouverie-street, from Lombard-court; a woman was calling,"Watchman, here is a man using a gentleman dreadfully ill;" I ran to the spot as fast as I could, and about ten yards down Bouverie-street I saw the prisoner leaving the prosecutor, who was down on the ground; he ran up to me, and gave charge of the prosecutor for insulting him in the street. I saw no one else in Bouverie-street, nor near; I never saw the street so clear: when he was telling me to take the charge, the prosecutor recovered, and got up; he ran up to the prisoner, who was about ten yards off, and said, "Charge! I will give charge of you, you rascal - you have robbed me;" he did not say what of, at that time; Grimwood came up, and said, "Take hold of him, and we will take them botl, to the watch-house;" on our way there the prosecutor put his hand up, and said,"Oh! my God; I would not have had such a blow for 5l." He every now and then looked round to the other man, saying, "Take care of him - don't let him go;" when we got to the watch-house, the constable of the night sent me on my duty, and I did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you your watchman's dress on? A. Yes. The prisoner ran from the prosecutor to me, and gave charge of him; I was going my rounds; he could see I was a watchman - I had my stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not both appear to be in anger with one another? A. Why we separated them; I took hold of the prosecutor - he appeared in a stupid state, not altogether sensible: we walked to the watch-house, which is about one hundred and fifty yards; I kept hold of him, for he appeared not able to walk, and the prisoner had given him in charge; I could not tell who was right - he appeared stupid - I cannot tell whether it was from liquor or injury; he walked steady: a tipsy man generally cannot walk - he did not tell me what kind of a man had robbed him, or what he had been robbed of; he seemed stupid, and out of breath.</p>

The prosecutor claimed them before the Magistrate, in the prisoner's presence.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. On the 2d of January, between two and three o'clock in the morning, the prisoner and prosecutor were brought to the watch-house; the prisoner said, "Here is charge for charge;" the prosecutor said he had been knocked down and robbed of a watch and seals; Grimwood then stated that he saw the prisoner come up, and go through Silver-street, round Lombard-street, into Fleet-street again. Nothing was found on the prisoner - but after the watch was relieved, Saunders came, and delivered me the seals, with the ring and key attached to a ribbon; the prosecutor had then gone home, and the prisoner was at the Compter. I had searched the prosecutor, and found his watch in his fob, broken at the bow. The prisoner said he was innocent, and said, "I don't think the gentleman has got a watch," and when he was going to the Compter be begged I would search the prosecutor, and see if he had, which I did; it was broken at the bow, where the ribbon fastens, and must have been done with considerable violence. The prosecutor did not know I had the seals till I produced them before the Magistrate - he then said they were the seals he had been robbed of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he had been robbed of his watch also? A. Yes; the prisoner said there was charge for charge when he came in, but he made no charge against the prosecutor; when the prosecutor first came in he seemed much confused; he said he thought a tall man had robbed him: he had an opportunity of seeing the prisoner at that time - he did not say it was a taller man; he accused the prisoner of it - the prisoner said, "Now, Sir, look at me - I am short, and am an innocent man; let me go about my business." The prosecutor appeared very stupid, as if he was bewildered.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did the prosecutor say in answer to that? A. He said, from the blows he had received, he could not swear positively to the prisoner; he did not say how the man was dressed.</p>

            . I am waterman at the coach-stand in Bridge-street. On the night of the 2d of January I saw the prisoner at the White Bear public-house, Bride-lane; it was nearly one o'clock when I first saw him - the last time was within a few minutes of two, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it gone half-past one o'clock? A. Yes. I saw him at supper there; when the house was shut up he came out of the door - I bade him good night; he went up Bride-lane, towards Fleet-street, and I went to the coach-stand; I left him in Bride-lane; I have known him fifteen or sixteen years - I cannot say what character he bore; I have not come about that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time would it take to walk from the White Bear to Bouverie-street? A. It is no great distance - I dare say I might walk it in two minutes; I know it was nearly two o'clock, because I could hear St. Bride's clock strike; it had not struck, but it only wanted a few minutes, for the house shuts up at two; it was more than half-past one, for it was one when I saw him at supper in the house; St. Bride's clock struck two just as I got to the top of Bride-lane, in Bridge-street - that was not more than three minutes after I left him - I live in Blackfriars'-road.</p>

            . I am a salesman, of Fleet-market, and have known the prisoner three years - I lodge in the same house with her. On the 8th of December I saw her at home before a quarter-past eleven o'clock, by that and half-past.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see her at half-past eleven o'clock? A. Undressed in her room, sitting in her chair, ready for bed - she had had her supper; she had her shawl over her shoulders; she had the same gown on as I had seen her with in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what part of her was undressed? A. Her stays were loose - she had a light gown on - I did not look so close as to tell the colour; I am sure it was half-past eleven o'clock, for I had to close the door for the night, as the landlord was ill in bed; I inquired if every body was in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you come home? A. At a quarter-past eleven o'clock; I remember it, as I was done very soon at market; I had a glass of liquor, and came home; she was undressed when I came home, all loose, ready to slip off her things, and her shawl was over her neck.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know she had a light gown on? A. She has a red gown - she had a light one on this night, not the red one - I cannot tell what time she came home on the Thursday or the Wednesday; she is an unfortunate girl - her door being open that night, I made bold to go in, which makes me remember it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What makes you so exact to the time? A. Because I got home so soon, and gave my wife my money; I always look at my clock, which is in my room; the prisoner was at home before me, and had had her supper; she could not have come home at half-past eleven o'clock, for I got home at a quarter-past, and she was then undressed.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear the watchman crying the hour? A. He cried half-past after I got home.</p>
               <p> - HOOD. I am the wife of the last witness; I will take my oath the prisoner was at home, in her own room, at half-past eleven o'clock, on the night of the 8th of December, because I had just come from market, and my husband at the same time; my husband had to lock up the house, as the landlord was ill; the prisoner came home at half-past eleven o'clock, rather sooner than later.</p>

               <persName id="t18280110-26-person263">
                  Richard

             at that time; my husband went out at church-time, and Moss went out about eleven o'clock; my husband went out first - I was left alone in the house - after Moss had been gone about half an hour, I was up stairs in my bed-room, over my parlour; a ring came at the shop bell; I went down to the shop door, opened it, and found the prisoner, Charles Melford, at the door; he said he wanted a piece of good Cheshire cheese, for Mr. Law, the surgeon: Mr. Law is a customer of ours - Moss knew that - I said, "We don't serve on Sunday, but I don't wish to disoblige Mr. Law;" Charles Melford walked into the shop; he passed me, and walked into the shop; the prisoner, William Melford, walked in after; I had not seen him before; when William was a little way in the shop, I said "I have not any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100024"/>one to send;" William Melford said "We must take it then, I suppose," or words to that effect; the shop door, when I went behind the counter, was shut, but I do not recollect who shut it - I observed that it was shut; when I got behind the counter I pulled a piece of Cheshire cheese from the shelf behind the counter, and, as I put it on the counter, I observed the prisoner Charles Melford coming round the counter after me; the prisoner William Melford stood opposite to me, on the other side the counter, and presented a pistol near my face.</p>
               <p>Q. As William stood opposite to you, did you observe any thing particular in his countenance? A. Yes; I observed a piece of his nose was gone; Charles touched me lightly on the left arm, and presented a pistol at the side of my head; they each had a pistol; the prisoner William said, "It is your money we want - if you make the least noise, you are a dead woman;" I was alarmed, but perfectly collected; I said, "Good God!" and I think it was William who said, "Don't be frightened - we won't hurt you, but we must have your money;" I stood a little, hesitating, and the prisoner Charles said, "Come, come, show us where the money is;" I walked from behind the counter, and said, "If you will stop here, I will fetch it;" Charles said "No;" I then went up stairs, followed by the prisoner Charles; he was close behind me; I went into my bed-room, and when I got there, Charles Melford said,"Where is your cash-box, and where is your plate?" I said I had neither; I then went into a small room, over the shop - it communicates with the bed-room; he followed me into that small room; I unlocked the top drawer of a chest of drawers which stood there, and pulled a purse out of the drawer, containing 5l. 4s. all in silver, and gave it to him; he said, "What is that?" I said silver, and gave it to him - it consisted of crowns, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences - I think there were a good many half-crowns, but am not certain of their number; I then pulled out a purse, containing 9l. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and gave that to him; he said that was very little - he thought there was more; I said I had no more; we came down stairs both together, to the parlour door - there is a cupboard in the parlour, and when I came to the parlour door, the prisoner William Melford was turning from the cupboard; I said to him, "You have taken my husband's silver spoon - it is a family relic - pray give it to me;" the prisoner William said, "What spoon?" and gave it me; one of them gave me back the purses, but I am not certain which it was; my husband had a watch, which he put in the cupboard when he went to church; I missed that watch when they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened afterwards? A. I stood in the parlour; the prisoner William stood on the mat, at the parlour door; he pulled a cord out of his pocket, and said, "We must tie you;" I said, "For God's sake don't tie me; pray don't tie me - I cannot do anything - I won't move;" he said, "If you move for a quarter of an hour, we have plenty outside." I was not tied. Before they went away, I heard one say to the other that the money was very little; they went away, and shut the door after them - they banged it to, hard; I stopped in doors till my husband came from church, and soon afterwards missed the watch from the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated you were alarmed by the production of the pistols, were you in a state to make accurate observation on what passed? A. Yes, as much as I am now; Charles Melford had a white handkerchief on his neck, and a blue coat, with metal buttons; the other had on a large drab great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, in your judgment, were the prisoners in your house? A. A very short time - about eight minutes, I suppose. On the next day (Monday) I was standing in our shop, and the prisoner Charles walked into the shop - I had previously described his person and dress to Hanley; Hanley followed him into the shop - he was with him; I lifted up my hands, and said, "That is the man that robbed me."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time see Hanley? A. I saw the prisoner first; I had not caught sight of Hanley before I made that exclamation. I had previously been to see several persons who were pointed out to me by the officers - there were a dozen or more; I told the officer neither of those were the persons who robbed me. I saw the prisoner William, I think, on the Wednesday week after - he was produced to me at Worship-street, in custody; I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, this is a most serious charge, affecting their lives, have you a belief of their being the men, or are you certain of them? A. I am certain they are both the same men.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain from a recollection of their persons, or what? A. It is the impression their countenances made upon me altogether at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You have mentioned the observation occurred twice, about their being but little money, had you more money in the house the previous week? A. I think we had hardly ever so little - we had more the Sunday preceding. Moss was employed in the shop, and could see what we took.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what o'clock was this? A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning - it was Charles who went up stairs; we went into a small room on the first floor, over the shop; I opened the top drawer of a chest - that occupied a very short time; I have said they might be in the house altogether about eight minutes; the stairs are very short, the bed-room very small, and the other room is close to it - it could not take many minutes; I had to open the drawer, but my keys were in my pocket ready - it might take about five minutes; William was not up stairs at all; I saw him when he came in at the door, and spoke to me about the cheese; I took particular notice of him; I did not count the money - I was as firm as I am at present; I was frightened, but quite collected - I was not much agitated - I was as much agitated at the rope as at the pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. You were agitated at both? A. Yes, of course, it made an impression on me, as I saw my life was in danger; but they told me they would not hurt me if I gave them the money; they did not commit any violence on me; one of them told me not to be alarmed; and they returned the spoon when I said I wished it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not somebody been taken up for William, who had the same defect in his countenance? A. I know nothing of who has been taken; I did not see any other person taken up; I have not a doubt of their persons; our shop shutters were all up - the shop was not so light as when opened, but it was a very fine bright day, and there was light enough to read the smallest print; there is a light from the back room - that is a borrowed light: the shop door was closed, but I do not know who closed it - that is the front door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100025"/>Q. When they were in the shop, your means of seeing them was by a borrowed light from the back? A. No; there is a good light over the door - it is a regular fan-light, but has no glass in it - it is merely irons, to let the air into the shop - it is as wide as the door, and the usual height - that, and the borrowed light from behind, was the only light I had.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Was it light enough for you to make accurate observation? A. It was - it was quite light enough to do any thing.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you a private door? A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I and Garton saw Mrs. Pring, at her house, on Sunday evening, the 9th of December; she described to us very particularly the persons of two young men; she also described their dress, and the particulars of the robbery; we went to the King's Arms public-house, in Charles-street, on that Sunday night, in consequence of her description, and sent for her, as there were about seventeen persons there; we desired them to put their hats on, but she did not know either of them. Next morning, about ten o'clock, I went to No. 24, Henrietta-street, Hackney-road, and saw the prisoner Charles Melford there; I told him, I suspected, from the description which had been given me, that he had been at a robbery the preceding day, and he must go with me to the City-road; we went there, and I saw Mr. and Mrs. Pring in the shop; I desired Charles Melford to walk in before me; he did so, and almost instantly that he went in, Mrs. Pring lifted up her hands, and exclaimed, "That is one of the men who robbed me;" I took him to the office, and also Moss, the servant, who was afterwards discharged. Charles Melford had a light coloured great coat on, when I took him; and when I took him to the shop, he had not a blue coat on then; I returned with Wilmot, the parish officer, to the house in Henrietta-street, where I had taken him, and, in a back bed-room, in a box, near the foot of the bed, I found two small bottles of gunpowder, six pistol bullets, and six pistol flints, and, on the mantle-piece, I found two other bullets, in the frame of a time-piece; I found a pistol bullet mould in another box, in the same room, and in the same room I found two masks; there was a box on the landing-place, near the door; I could not procure the key of that; a woman, who said she was Melfords' mother, was with me when I made the search; I broke the box open, and found this pistol, which was loaded with small shot, and primed - I have drawn the charge - the box in which it was, was about one yard from the room door; I found a blue coat hanging on the door of the room, and Charles Melford owned that coat - there was a white neck handkerchief in the pocket of it; there were several letters in the room, directed to William Melford, and one to Charles Melford; the blue coat was delivered to Charles, and I will not be certain whether the one William has on now is the same or not. On Monday, the 17th of December, in consequence of information, I went, with two other officers, to the Olive Branch public-house, in the Maze, in the Borough, and apprehended William Melford; he also had a light great coat on then. Mrs. Pring gave me this spoon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Charles claimed the coat at once? A. Yes; he said it was his; he knew I was an officer - I had apprehended him two days before; Mrs. Pring had been in a room with seventeen men, on the night of the robbery, and she knew I was an officer then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to hear her exclaim, "That is one of the persons who robbed me?" A. Yes; I was about three yards from her; Charles Melford stood between us.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a tall man - she was near enough to see you at the time? A. She might, or she might not have seen me - there was no door or bulk to intercept her view; when she exclaimed that he was one of them, Mr. Pring was angry, and took up a knife; I stepped between them, and said, "You must not burt the man." I know a man named Tibbs - I cannot, from my own knowledge, say whether a person was taken for William Melford - I do not believe that Tibbs is here to day.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Were the prisoners the only persons you presented to Mrs. Pring, except those at the public-house? A. There were no others. I apprehended the prisoners in consequence of her description; I cannot say whether Mrs. Pring had seen me at the time she made the exclamation - I saw her change countenance directly he went in.</p>

On Sunday, the 9th of December, I went to Gerrard's Hall (where a coach was going from), to keep a place for Moss' sister; when the horses where put to; I returned from the inn, and, about half way from Cheapside, I met Moss, his sister, and another person with them, who I believe to be Charles Melford - they were carrying the sister's trunk - this was near about ten minutes to two o'clock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Staples said instantly, that he had had that mare; A. Yes - I should not have known it if he had not told me; he said he had it from Godfrey and sold it to Watts, who is a horse-slaughterer, or something.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many legs were there at this place? A. I suppose sixty in that beap; there might be a hundred or two in all, but most of them were cart horses; there were a great many grey legs - I only looked for the two fore-legs of mine, as there was no mark on the hind ones; the legs had no shoes on.</p>

Yes; he said if I would go to Shepherd's-bush, he was sure the man could be taken into custody, as he had promised to bring him a blind horse there; and he would take him himself, if there was nobody else - I went to Staples' house, at Shepherd's-bush that evening(Friday the 28th); he said, "Oh! you are come - I expected some of you - I hope he may come to-morrow, according to his promise;" he said, if I slept at the White Horse public-house, he would detain him, if he came, and send for me - I asked if he had a book, in which he kept the name of the parties, as he had told me that he kept one; instead of producing the book; he gave me this bit of paper (reads), "I have received of Mr. Staples, the sum of 15s. Wm. Godfrey." I slept at the White Horse, and next morning, about eight o'clock, his little boy came running, and said Godfrey was there - I went immediately to Staples' stable, and found Godfrey there - I said, "Oh! this is the man;" "Yes," said Staples, "this is the man" - I said to Godfrey, "This is a bad job;" he said, "Yes, it is," and said he was very sorry for what had happened - I said, "You must go to town with me" - Staples went with us, as far as the White Horse - I took Godfrey to town by the coach, begging Staples to follow me, which he did; on my way to town, I asked Godfrey what he got for each of the horses - I did not threaten or promise him any thing; he instantly told me 15s. for each - I took him to the Compter, then to Guildhall, and from there to Bow-street - Staples attended at Guildhall, as a witness, voluntarily; he was there before me, and with us to Bow-street- I have since that been to Staples' premises - I found two horses in the first stable, and two or three men there- I found some carts which are used to carry dead horses to town.</p>

On Saturday night, the 15th of December, at a quarter-past eleven o'clock, as I went my rounds, I found the prosecutrix sitting on a step in Sydney-street; I asked what she was doing there; she said she had been robbed of her shawl and umbrella, and the young man had gone round the corner; I got her up with the assistance of another person who came by; she seemed very stupid - I cannot say whether from intoxication, or what - she did not smell of liquor; I took her as far as Bedford-square, Commercial-road, intending to take her to the watch-house; she then got perfectly collected, and said she had been to the other end of the town for her character, and was going to live at No. 18, Sydney-street - this was about ten minutes after I first saw her; she said she lived in Lady Lake's-grove, and I took her home; she said she should know the man who had robbed her again, but did not describe him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not a young man listening to part of your conversation, and helping you? A. Yes; I called his attention to her - he only stopped three or four minutes; he did not say he had seen her before that evening, and she had no shawl on; he was not a young man - he was rather elderly; he lives at No. 7, Henry-street; she said something about her shoes, which I could not make out - I understood her to say "shawl;" the young man remarked something about her shoes being on her feet - I never said she appeared quite drunk; I know Hale - I never told him so - he lives three doors from my box; I never talked with him on the subject; I did not ask what kind of a person had robbed her; she did not complain to me of any violence being used to her; she said never mind- she believed she had near a sovereign left - all she minded was the umbrella, as it was borrowed; I took her to the light - she examined her handkerchief, but did not unfold it - she felt satisfied that her money was safe; when she got home she fell into hysterics; it was found afterwards that 6s. remained in her handkerchief - the handkerchief was in her hand when I went up to her; she did not mention losing her money that night.</p>

            . I am a clerk to a gentleman in the City. I saw the prosecutrix on this night; I did not come up at the request of the watchman, but I gave her into his charge; I saw her lying down at a door in Sydney-street, and seeing her genteelly dressed, I stooped down, and shook her three or four times - while I was so doing, this watchman came up; I said, "Here is a decent person lying here, you had better take her to the watch-house;" he assisted me to take her up - as we went along, I asked her name - all I could get out of her was "Clutterbuck;" she pronounced that name three times, not very plain; she said she had lost her shoes; I looked down, and said, "You have got them on;" she said she had lost her shawl; she said nothing about her umbrella, nor complained of violence having been used; I went with her as far as my house, No. 7, Henry-street - we might be five or ten minutes going there- it was I that called the watchman's attention to her; I saw the watchman again on Friday night last; he said, "I have got into a pretty trouble" - that his brother watchman had told him she had accused him of taking her shawl; she appeared quite in liquor on the night in question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what way did she appear stupid? A. She appeared stupid, and could not walk straight; she did not tell me she had received a blow; not knowing that she had been knocked down, I concluded that she was in liquor; I did not smell any liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. Supposing she had been knocked down, would it have appeared the same as if she was stupid from liquor? A. It might if she had been knocked down a minute before - if I had heard she had been knocked down, I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100029"/>have looked for the blow; I should have attributed her appearance more to liquor, because she staggered.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Might not her receiving a blow have deprived her of her recollection? A. I should think a violent blow might.</p>

On the 15th of December I was going through Sydney-street, with my beer, about a quarter-past ten o'clock, and saw the prosecutrix lying on a step - I shook her, and asked her to get up; she made no reply, and I left her; I saw her again in about half an hour in the same place - she did not appear sober; I am certain of the time, as I was going home for beer, it could not be eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. She gave you no answer - what makes you say she did not appear sober? A. She smelt of liquor - I smelt her - I did not put my face near her mouth - she smelt of rum - I merely passed by.</p>

I know the prosecutrix by sight; on the Sunday after this robbery she told me she had been out and got drunk, and did not know where she had been, or what she had done, till she was found on a step in Sydney-street, by a watchman and gentleman - that she could not tell who robbed her, and that no violence had been used to her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you acquainted with her at all before this Sunday? A. No; she came to my house, to ask me to let her have a pair of pattens; I live about a quarter of a mile from her father's; she began the conversation herself- I looked at her, and asked if she had been ill-used - she said she had not; I never saw the prisoner before to day, to my knowledge; his brother has called at my house, to find some gentleman, who picked her up, and I then told him about it; Anster lives near me.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith. I know the prosecutrix, as a neighbour; I have known her nine or ten months - she was occasionally at service; she told me she had got tipsy on the Saturday night, and lost a sovereign, an umbrella, and a shawl, but could not tell how; I asked if she knew who it was - she said No, she was drunk; she said nothing about any violence being used. I never had any quarrel with her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to have this conversation? A. I was going on an errand, and met her by her own door, and she spoke to me; we were not acquainted, but I have spoken to her before; she did not say she could describe the person; she said she had lost these things, but did not say a word about being robbed; she said she was drunk, and did not know who took them; she spoke to me of her own accord - I mentioned it on the Wednesday, about one o'clock, as I was going to the public-house for beer, as I heard a young man had been taken up for it. I know the prisoner by sight, but never had any connection with him; I do not know what he is.</p>

               <p>ANTHONY ROBINSON. I have been employed by different gentlemen for the last sixteen years, to stow ships - the prisoner worked with me on the 10th of December, for about four hours; he came to me on the 13th, and asked if I had any thing for him to do - I said not at present, but perhaps in a little time he might go to work: he said,"D-n you, it is a pity such a fellow as you should be allowed to come into the docks to work, much more to employ others - I will take your life - I will disable you from taking work, or giving orders;" I looked round, not thinking he was going to strike me; a mate spoke to me - I turned, and saw the prisoner had got a shovel; he struck me on the head with it, and then on the shoulder: he struck me different blows, till Phillips took the shovel from him - he struck me in different places, two or three times - I believe one blow was on the head, but I was rather out of my senses. Phillips took the shovel from him; he then started and ran - I was taken to a doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this happened, did he ask you for any tobacco? A. Yes, and I gave him some: he asked me for 1s. 4d. which I owed him; I told him I could not pay him till Saturday, when I should draw money from the ship; I pay all the men on Saturday - this was Thursday, and he had done the work on Monday; I cannot say whether he struck me more than once on the head, as the first or second blow took away my senses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate, I struck you first on the shoulder? A. No - I am certain the first blow was on the head, for it stunned me a good deal, and I think the second was on the head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your deposition states the first blow to have been on the shoulder? A. I said on the head.</p>

            . I live in Albion-place, St. George's in the East, and am a labourer. On the 10th of December I was at work on board the vessel - and on the Thursday I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner coming along the docks; the prisoner was wrangling about 1s. 4d., which he owed him; they came on board the ship together - the prisoner asked if he was going to pay him; the prosecutor left the ship, and went on board the Juno; he returned in about five minutes - the prisoner was standing on the main hatchway of the Bencooley, swearing; and a man whom the prosecutor asked to go to work, said Knight might go in his stead; Knight said he would not go till he got what was owing to him, and immediately said to the prosecutor,"Do you mean to pay what you owe me? if you don't, I will have your life; I will disable you from work, or giving orders;" Robinson said he had no money, but would pay him on the Saturday; he then asked for a bit of to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100030"/>bacco - Robinson said he had none but what he had paid for, but gave him a piece to put into his mouth; the prisoner said, "If you would pay me, I should have no occasion to ask for tobacco - if you do not pay me now, d-n vou, I will have your life;" he flew forward, and looking round, took up this shovel in his hand, and made two blows at Robinson; they fell on the left arm, and knocked his cap off; he made two more blows at the head, one of which struck his head, and the other failed; Phillips wrenched the shovel out of his hand - I collared him, and we had a struggle on the deck; I threw him down; he got from me, and ran ashore; the mate, seeing the blood, told me to run after him, which I did, and took him in Lower Hermitage-street, and gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see the prosecutor launch me from him, with his two hands? A. No - I did not see him shove him at all; I was not there at the time, if it happened - I just came up when the blow was struck.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Wapping. I examined the prosecutor's head on Thursday, the 13th of December - there was a division of the scalp at the top of the head; it was about a quarter of an inch deep, and one inch and a half long; such a blow might have fractured the scull - it was an incised wound, and appeared to be made with the handle of the shovel; there was also a contusion on the shoulder. I attended him three weeks before he got well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was he hindered from his employment during the three weeks? A. No, only for the last two or three days, in consequence of indisposition; he went regularly to business at first.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. I received the prisoner in charge - he said he was very sorry he had injured the man, but he did it in the best of passion; I got this shovel from the Bencooley.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his Defence, stated that he had been three days without food, and, being much distressed, he had urged the prosecutor to pay him; the prosecutor was coming to press upon him - that he had kept him off with the shovel, - and was exceedingly sorry for what had happened.</p>

            . I attend the Paddington stages, which stand in Princes-street. On the 14th of December, about a quarter-past four o'clock, I was going to see what was booked for the stage, and as I came out of Founders' Hall-court I saw the prisoner; he asked if I wanted a job - I said Yes: he asked if I ever got a cheque changed - I said Yes: he asked if I would go and change one for him- I said I would. He had a cheque in his hand, and asked what o'clock it was - I said, about four: he stood about a minute, and then said, "Come along;" he walked a little way out of the court with me - he was in the court all this time; he came as far as the court next before you come to Tokenhouse-yard - he there gave me the cheque; I asked what I was to get for it - he said, two notes, and that he would wait up the court; I ran into the banking-house, and presented the cheque; the gentleman came out with me - I ran on before the gentleman, to Founders' Hall-court, where he said he would be; I did not find him there; I then went into the middle of the road, and saw him up the next gate-way - I went up to him, and said,"Sir, you have given me a wrong cheque;" he made a dash away from me directly, but I caught hold of him by the collar, and held him till the gentleman came up; I am sure he is the person from whom I received the cheque.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know him before? A. I never saw him before; when he darted from me, the gate was shut, and I shoved him right up against it; he shoved right away from me; he had told me he would be up the court, and I thought he meant Founders' Hall-court; he spoke plain English to me - I did not take him for a foreigner; the cheque was stopped at the banking-house - I did not get the money.</p>

               <p>MR. NEVILLE BROWN. I am a City marshall. An officer was sent for to the Mansion-house, and I went to the banking-house, about a quarter to five o'clock; I searched the prisoner, and found several papers on him, one of which I produce; he was then asked how he became possessed of the cheque, which was either in Mr. Gates'(the solicitor) hand, or lying on the desk; he said he had picked it up, I think, in Bartholomew-lane; he was asked in what part of the lane; he said, in the court leading to the Stock Exchange, near the center of the court - it was a damp mizling evening, and the streets were very dirty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say in what form he had picked it up? A. No - he made no remark about the paper; his answer was directed to the cheque, and nothing else; he said he picked it up about four o'clock - it is a paved court, but I should think it could not be clean, as so many persons pass up and down it - it is not a covered court.</p>

            . I am a stock-broker. I know the handwriting of Mr. Charles Fothergill, of the Stock Exchange - this cheque is not his hand-writing, to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>The cheque was here put in and read, also the paper found on the prisoner, which was as follows: - "Mr. Saldos to N. Nathan, - to two weeks' rent, from the 21st of November to the 5th of December, for shop and furnished room, 1l. 16s." On the back of this bill was the name of C. Fothergill, written three times, and the name of Fothergill once without the letter C.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I stand charged with uttering as true a bill, signed C. Fothergill, for 110l. Upon the 13th of December, being in the City, on business, and passing through Bartholomew-court, I found the instrument alluded to, enclosed in a paper, with the name of Fothergill written on it; in consequence of my being a foreigner, and not acquainted with the laws of this country, I considered I was fully entitled to the same, and, without consulting any friend, or giving it a moment's consideration, I employed a messenger to present it for payment, not entertaining the most distant idea of its being a forgery: the event of that step has unfortunately placed me in the situation I now stand before you. I am a native of Spain, and have been in this country only three years, and during that period have been in the employment of two most respectable firms in London, in the silk trade, independent of which I am in the receipt of 35l. per annum, as a Spanish Refugee, and therefore there could be no possible inducement for me to commit such an offence; by such a step I should deprive myself of every thing which is most valuable and dear to men, namely, my character, which will appear, by witnesses; and I entreat you to lay aside all prejudice against me: I beg to call your attention to these various circumstances, and trust, after the most serious consideration, you will come to such a conclusion as will restore me to liberty and my friends.</p>

I was on the watch in the parlour, just by the side of the parlour door, which concealed me from view; I am quite sure the street door was shut and latched, in the usual way; no one could have entered from the outside without a key: I heard a trifling noise at the door- it was repeated, and I was satisfied the lock was being picked; the noise was as if a key had been put into the lock - after an interval of two minutes, I distinctly heard the instrument taken out of the lock - I was about eight feet from the door; in about two minutes the same noise was repeated again - there was a cessation for a moment or two, as I could hear a person going by; and the very instant that person had passed, a person on the step of my door began to be moving again, with his heels and feet on the step, shuffling about; the second attempt did not succeed, and the key was taken out again: it commenced again in a few minutes - something was put into the lock, and the door was opened about an inch, as I could see the light from the street; the door was then again pulled back, close, but not relatched: they then went away for about three minutes - I heard footsteps go away, but could not say whether it was more than one person: in two or three minutes I saw two men come into the house - I allowed the prisoner, who was the foremost, to come within two feet of me - I then gave him a violent blow on the head, and instantly laid hold of him; I ran him back, against the other man, and shoved that man out, still holding the prisoner: I shut the door, keeping him inside- I beat him; he did not strike me, but I used violence to him, for, being in the dark, I did not know what subject I had before me: I hallooed out, "I have got him," and requested them to go backwards, to alarm the neighbourhood; the maid-servant came up with a light, and when I found it was a man I could manage, I ceased to use more violence. I kept him there till I thought an officer was outside to receive him. He said, "For God's sake, let me go," and desired me not to beat him; I forgot to state that directly the door was shut a man wanted to come in to assist me, but I said he should not come in: we opened the door, took him out, and, not seeing an officer, I pinned him up against the wall, and then removed him to a public-house; a crow-bar was kicked out of my house in the scuffle: there was a phosphorus-box and matches, and a picklock-key, which opens the door, picked up, close at the door; I found a match inside the passage of the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100032"/>and compared it with the matches in the phosphorus-box- it appeared to be one of that description: it is the same sort of box as is sold at chemist's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked me, when we got into the public-house, what I did there; I told him I looked at the door, and could find no name, no knocker, nor bell, and I was inquiring after Mr. Earl, my master; there was nothing but a brass knob to the door.</p>
               <p>MR. CUFF. There is a knocker to my door. I was on the alert, and if there had been a knock, I must certainly have heard it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner. This phosphorus-box has been in my possession ever since. I searched the prisoner, and found a knife and 8s. 6d. on him; this crow-bar, dark-lantern, and key, were brought to me at the door; I tried the key to the prosecutor's door, and it opens it; there appears to have been one match taken out of the bundle.</p>
               <p>MR. CUFF. These are the things that were found. I found only one match in the passage.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Could the door be opened without a key? A. It could not - it is a common lock, and requires the street door key to open it without.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He says he heard a noise at the door - that it was unlocked, and shoved open about an inch: as it was dark in the passage, I do not see how he could see it was shoved open about an inch. I went there to inquire after my master. If I had had those implements would they not have been found in the house? and if I had thrown them away, should I not have been seen? they were not brought forward for a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>One witness, who had known the prisoner three months, gave him a good character.</p>

            . On the 28th of November, I lived in the first floor front room, No. 9, Plummer's-street - I went out about five o'clock in the afternoon - I left my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100033"/>drawers and door locked - I locked them myself, and, as I had a lodger, who might come home before me, I left the key of my room, and the key of the street door, at a neighbour's, a few doors off - I had the key of my drawers in my pocket - I had left the street door fast - I tried it, to see that it was fast; it was not locked, but only shut on the latch; we have each a latch-key, to let ourselves in - I returned about eight o'clock, and found the street door wide open - I went in as far as the parlour door, and finding that open, I knocked and called to know who was at home; nobody answered me - I was afraid to go up stairs - I stood at the door till somebody came by; I got a neighbour to go in with me in about a quarter of an hour; he came with me, took a candle, and went in - I saw the rooms below all in a litter - I went up stairs, found my door open, and my drawers broken open - I missed a Norwich crape gown, a Norwich crape frock of my daughter's, a silk pelisse, and a new silk shawl. I have seen the shawl since.</p>

            . I am a headborough of St. Luke, Old-street. The house in question is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. On Wednesday evening, the 28th of November, a few minutes after seven o'clock, I was in Featherstone-street, about four hundred yards from this house - I saw the prisoner with a bundle in his hand; his hat appeared very heavy on his head - I knew him before - I went up and asked what he had in the bundle; he said two bonnets, which belonged to his sister, which he was to get cleaned - I said that might be, but I must see them - I took him to a public-house, examined the bundle, and found there were two bonnets - I then searched him, and found a quantity of trinkets, which I produce; he claimed the handkerchief the bonnets were tied in - I found on him two gold pins, a silver paste-brooch, a Queen Anne's half-crown, a silver 3d. piece, a copper 2d. piece, a scent-box, a diamond brooch, two scent-bottles, part of two watch-keys, a silver thimble, a small comb, a pen-knife, a large hoop ear-ring, and part of another, a small seal, a necklace of beads, a small chain, a small pearl brooch, and part of a pack of cards, the skirt of a green gown, a purple spencer, the body of a plaid silk gown, and a phosphorus-box - they were all in his pocket; and in his hat, was a silk shawl, and a China crape shawl; on going from the house, where I searched him, to the office; he told me to take the swag, and let him go, for he was sure, if he went to the office that night, the people would come against him - I asked why he should think so; he said because he had not been out of the house many minutes - I said I knew him to be a thief, and should take him to the office I did so, and then went round, and found about nine o'clock that evening, this house had been broken open - I examined the street door, and found it had been entered by force - I examined the room doors; the parlours had been opened apparently by the same instrument as the street door - I compared a chisel, which was found on the premises, and it exactly fitted; the chisel was broken: part of it was found near the front room, first floor, door-post, and the other part sticking in the back room door of the first floor; it fitted the marks on the doors, and the broken part of it fitted the marks in Buckthorp's drawers; about seven boxes were broken open in various rooms, and the remainder of the property strewed about.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The first smoke you observed was about six o'clock in the afternoon? A. Between six and seven; there was not so much then as afterwards, but it was enough to make us search the house - Smith went to the house before me, but could not get in - I went about ten o'clock - the fire must have begun about six - it is a very crowded neighbourhood - a fire breaking out at that time would have collected a number of people - the prisoner broke the sash as soon as he could - he fetched the water.</p>

After smelling this fire in my house, I went out about half-past nine o'clock, having perceived the smell first between six and seven - I had not got the watchman when I first went out - I knocked at the door several times, and kicked; I could see through the shutters that the gas was burning - I remained at the door a minute and a half or two minutes, knocking - I could not get in, and called a constable from the opposite side; I took the watchman into my house - he smelt the skirtingboard - I then sent for the constable of the night - it was nearly an hour after my first going, that I went to the door with them - I have heard Mr. Allport's statement about the door being opened - I waited till it was opened, and did not go in directly - the prisoner said it was locked, but he had not got the key, and could not open it; Mr. Roberts, the next door neighbour, had gone to the door, knocked at it, and told him to open it, for there was a fire - a voice inside said, "I can't, and I shan't - I don't know who you are;" I said, "Mention your name, Mr. Roberts, he will know it better than mine;" he did so, and the prisoner said he could not open it, and he should not; that it was locked - I said I would go and get a crow-bar, and break it open, for there was a fire - the shutter was afterwards taken down by the patrol; I did not go in directly myself; I sent for an engine, and when I went in I met the prisoner in a little room, and went with him to where they get the water from - he had a pail in his hand, and said there was no cistern, which was true - he put the pail under the water-cock; I went up stairs, and saw where the fire had been - it was then put out - the water had been taken up - I saw the riser of the stair was broken - a man was using the crow-bar - in the hole were several pieces of wood, part of them burnt - the parts not burnt appeared to be fresh split; some of them were long pieces; and there was a bundle of matches, with a little sulphur on one end, the other end was burnt; I saw some rags in a basket, but no wood in it; I do not recollect seeing any rags out of the basket - there were two pieces of cotton, something like the wick of a candle in the hole with the matches - the matches were tied together - there were five or six: when I went down stairs, after this, I saw the prisoner sitting on a flour-bin - Everiss came in at that time, and said to the prisoner, "There was likely to have been a pretty job;" I could not exactly understand what answer Castle made - he said, "There had," or something; I then thought proper to give Castle and Everiss, who is Rowley's foreman, in charge - they were afterwards allowed to go at large for the night; when the prisoner was getting the water I asked the reason why he did not open the door - he said he was not going to let a parcel of thieves in - I said they were neighbours, and not thieves - I then asked if he did not know there was a fire up stairs - he said, "No, I never was up stairs in my life;" I asked who had been up stairs; he said the last that were up, were the apprentice and foreman, and that they went out between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you knocked at the door, do you mean with the knocker? A. No; I thumped with my hands, and kicked - I do not know whether the patrol who came was sober - I had never seen the prisoner before; I had seen Everiss before; I once had an occasion to send for Rowley about a wall, and Everiss came in; some of the houses there are very old - the wall is only nine inches thick; I do not know whether it is called a party-wall; I know nothing of the prisoner having any ill-will towards me; I understand Rowley had another shop in the London-road - I cannot say whether he knew who was at the door, when he said he would not open it.</p>

            . I am a patrol of the district. On Sunday, the 9th of December, I just came up at the time the mob was at the door - I was quite sober; I broke the sash of the door, and got in; there was no glass in the sash, only frames; I had heard the prisoner say the door was locked, that he had not got the key, and could not open it; when I got in, I saw the door was not locked; I looked at both bolts, and found the bottom bolt bolted; I opened it directly - there was a brilliant light from the gas in the shop; a person could see it was not locked; I asked him for a candle; he said he had none; Mr. Roberts, of next door, said, "I will fetch one," and went to his house for it; whether the prisoner brought one before he returned I cannot say; when the light was brought I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100035"/>"Go back to the bake-house, and see if any fire is there;" the prisoner said, "There is no fire backwards; I have just come from the bake-house:" I said, "Then let us go up stairs;" he did not go up with me - he said nothing - he did not seem as if he knew the way up; I told him to follow me; I opened the sitting-room door, on the ground floor, but he did not come up at that time; when I got up, I said, "Here is the fire - don't be alarmed;" somebody said a pail of water would put it out; I afterwards saw the prisoner in the shop, and heard him say to somebody, that Jones (meaning me) had said he had unbolted the door; I replied, "I did say so;" I do not recollect his saying any thing particular to that; I think he said No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner assisted to break the frame in the door? A. That I cannot say, but he unscrewed the shutter inside; the staircase door leads from the private room - you go from the shop to the bakehouse, without going through the private room - the private room is on one side, and there is a kind of passage leading from the bakehouse on the other; the staircase is so concealed that a man might be there some time, and know nothing of the stairs; he did not misdirect us at all; I went into the bakehouse afterwards - the sponge was set; I do not know whether there was a fire in the oven; the bolt that was fastened was within a very few inches of the floor - he might have kicked it in the hurry, and fastened it, without his knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The lock was higher up? A. Yes; the light would show that the bolt of the lock was not in the staple - it was not even on the single catch; I understood from him that he had set his sponge, and fallen asleep on the board - he had his coat on.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went up stairs, and saw the top board of the landing burnt through, and about one foot from the place I saw a bundle of rags tied up together - it was about half as much as I could put into my hat; I saw the basket; there was nothing in it; I called for water, but got no answer at first; I do not know whether the door, at the foot of the stairs, was shut; as the water was not brought, I went down, and saw the prisoner in the shop, and a great many gentlemen talking to him - I said I wanted water; he instantly got a pail, put it under the cock, and turned the water on.</p>

            . I am a fireman. I went to this house, on hearing of the fire; I have heard the hole in the stairs described. I saw the basket the rags were in; when I saw it, there were some small pieces of wood; I sent for Rowley, who came about one o'clock; I said nothing to him in the prisoner's presence. Everiss came in soon after I was there; I saw the matches in the hole, with a very little sulphur on them - the wood appeared to be fresh.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went into the bakehouse, did you not? A. Yes, and left the prisoner there with one of my men, to go on and make his bread; I saw some sacks there, which appeared as if somebody had been lying on them; he said he had been lying there; I observed the patrol that night - he was not quite sober - he was in liquor; I did not notice the lock of the street door, but I noticed that the door sticked very much - it was as much as one person could do to open it; I know that, by opening it repeatedly to let persons in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you observe whether there was any fire in the oven? A. They had not lit the fire; if there had been, it could not have communicated to the staircase; after I released the prisoner, he went on with his regular work.</p>

            . I am a fireman. The fire was out when I came; I saw the matches and things; I put my arm farther under the hole, and pulled out two pieces of cotton, about a foot long - it was clean; I pulled out a bit of greasy newspaper, and some bits of wood, some of which were nearly a foot long, and apparently burnt - it might have been two or three hours in a smothering state without burning into a flame; one of the joists that went under the passage was very much burnt - the fire was not close to Smith's house; I cannot say whether it would emit a smoke into his house; I went for Rowley to the London-road, where he had a shop - it was half-past one o'clock before we got back to Shoreditch.</p>

            . I am Rowley's foreman, and am twenty-six years old; I was at the house on the 9th of December; I know the prisoner, by his working there only a fortnight; he was not a regular servant, but only put in by a man who was ill for a short time; Rowley did not hire him; I was at the shop from ten o'clock in the morning, as we have dinners to cook; I staid there till about five o'clock; Henry Briggs, who is an apprentice at the other shop, was there that afternoon; he is Mr. Rowley's brother-in-law; Briggs spent the evening with me; he came about four o'clock, and we went away together - I have lived about two years and a half with Rowley: Briggs went up stairs with me to put the remainder of my things on, as I had been lying down; I believe the prisoner was then asleep in the bake-house; I sleep in the house, and a little girl slept there - she is Mr. Rowley's sister; I did not sleep there on Saturday night, as I had been to a club-supper; the little girl and the apprentice slept there.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up stairs with this apprentice to put your things on; is your room on the first or second floor? A. The first floor back-room; I took a candle with me; I did not remain there a quarter of an hour; I brought the candle down; I observed nothing on the stairs; the rags which were found had been kicking about the floor for a week or two, loose, not in the basket; I never touched them; I did not perceive any hole in the riser of the staircase - if there had been such a hole, I must have seen it; I put the candle out, and left it on the parlour-table when I went out; I suppose I remained down stairs for a quarter of an hour, or more before I went out; we were talking in the parlour, and were going to have tea; but, finding none in the house, I proposed to go to the coffee-shop; there was a fire in the parlour; we left the gas burning in the shop - I saw the prisoner in the bake-house when I went out, and spoke to him - he was reading a book; I asked if he was going out - he said he was going to lay down; he had a candle; he would lay on the boards, where he generally lays every evening, till eleven o'clock, which is working time; I slammed the door after me, and left it on the spring-lock - I did not lock it - I could not bolt it outside; I think I tried it to see if it had fastened, but will not be positive; the door generally stuck so that if it was not slammed very hard, the lock would not catch; there was no hook to fasten the spring back; I returned about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock; I had not been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100036"/>near the house from the time I left it - I went from Shoreditch to Bishopsgate, stopped there till past nine o'clock, and went from there over to the Borough; we bake sixteen or eighteen sacks a week at the house in Shoreditch; our returns were between 40l. and 50l. a week, on an average; I generally settled with master on Monday; I had settled with him on the Tuesday, and had all the money in the house which was taken after that; it was better than 27l.; that money was in the cash-box, in my box; I found, when I returned, that the keys were in the box, but I did not know I had left them there; I usually lock it; I did not go to the box till after two o'clock in the morning; I did not look for the money till nine next morning - when Mr. Rowley called; the money was then gone - I had not taken it; I did not know the prisoner till he came to work at the house - some furniture had been moved to the house in the London-road - he had moved sufficient to make the house comfortable - two beds were left there - the apprentice had slept in my bed the night before, and the girl in the other, which is a story higher - Rowley's sister was there when I came on Sunday morning; Castle never slept there - he left on Saturday afternoon, as soon as he had done work; I did not leave till nine o'clock in the evening: when I went out, I took the key of the door in my great-coat pocket; but am sure I did not lock the door; I never use the key when I go out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had no acquaintance with the prisoner till he came into Rowley's service? A. No; I received the money from the customers - I never told him where I put it; I do not believe he knew whether I locked it up, or paid it to my master; I do not think he was ever up stairs - he had no communication with the house; the passage runs on the other side of the little room - a person might go down the shop, and not see the stair-case; there is no lock to the stair-case door; it is in the little room; we always sit in that room when we are not serving: the prisoner never comes into the shop, except to bring the bread and bakings; he is not a man that made himself officious at all; I am not related to Rowley; the apprentice is his wife's brother; he slept in my bed on the Saturday, and might have seen the rags.</p>
               <p>Q. Had all the best of the furniture been moved? A. No; there were some very nice mahogany chairs in the first floor front room, which they occasionally used on Sunday, when they had friends; all the best beds were moved - only one table was moved, I believe; and that was from the little parlour - I left a middling fire burning in the little room when I went out - it was near five o'clock; we went to the coffee-shop, had tea, and staid there some time; the apprentice looked at the paper, and it wanted five minutes to six o'clock when we came out; I told the prisoner I was going out, and should return about the old time - he knew I had returned about eleven o'clock the Sunday before; he knew I must have the key to let myself in - he knew I let myself in; I did not miss the money till the following morning; the house was full of people when I came home; I did not go into the bed-room - they only showed me the stairs, and took me off to the watch-house; there were people all the way up stairs - I will not be positive whether any were in my bed-room - I saw several in the shop and little room, and on the top of the stairs; my bed-room door was open, and people close to it, on the landing; I never saw the prisoner and Rowley speak together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had Rowley a key of the premises, so that he could come in while the prisoner was asleep? A. There was no key but what I had; Rowley was himself committed for trial.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How soon after the fire was the prisoner examined at the office? A. About eleven or twelve o'clock on the Monday - I was examined at the same time; I was examined three times, and discharged at the fourth; we did not inquire the prisoner's character when he came.</p>

            . I am vestry-clerk of Enfield parish - it was formerly called St. Andrew, as that name is in some of the old writings - we always call it Enfield, in indictments, deeds, and parish matters; we have a parochial act for enclosing the chase - it is called the parish of Enfield in that act.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was it called St. Andrew? A. Anciently; I find that name in the old writings. I have been vestry-clerk forty years - it has always been called Enfield parish in my time.</p>

            . I am Mr. Strange's coachman, and have been so many years. On the 23d of November, I believe I was the last person up - I saw all the fastenings complete - I remember fastening the scullery door with two bolts at the top, two at the bottom, and a bar across the middle; this was about half-past ten o'clock. I was the first person down stairs in the morning, and found the door quite open: there was a round piece of wood cut quite out by some instrument - an arm could then be put in to undo the bolts: I missed two livery coats, a livery waistcoat, two pairs of boots, and a hat, belonging to me; the prisoner is my brother, I am sorry to say - he had been in the house, and slept there, some years ago; he has not called on me there for twelve months I think; I have seen some of the things, and know them again.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live at No. 52, Shoreditch. On Saturday morning, the 24th of November, about half-past nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the Angel and Crown public-house, Tabernacle-square - I never saw him before; he had a bundle, two coats, and a hat-box: he was dressed in stone-blue livery, and plush breeches; there was a drab coat, boots, shoes, and a drinking born in the bundle - I did not see the hat-box opened; I bought two coats of him - they were besides the one that was in the bundle; I did not buy that one: one coat was a kind of drab great coat, with false capes, and appeared like a servant's coat; it had plain buttons, I believe: the other was a close drab coat, with lace on it, and livery buttons; I also bought a pair of top-boots, and two pairs of women's shoes. I gave 20s. for the whole lot - I sold the two coats to Mr. Folkard, a pawnbroker, of Sun-street, for 24s. I have the boots and shoes here. I saw "Strange, Enfield," written on the hat-box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose your attention was taken up with looking at the things? A. I looked at the prisoner; I might not be a quarter of an hour buying the coats - he had a hat, I cannot say whether it was on, but he was in the house all day.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Although you were only a quarter of an hour dealing, how long were you in his company? A. I was in the house from half-past nine o'clock till five in the evening: he was there all the time, and I left him there - Mr. Holmes was there.</p>

            . I am a porter.

            . In November last the prisoner lodged with me. I remember the night the robbery was said to be committed - he did not come home that night, for we did not go to bed till near one o'clock; he was not at home then; I did not see him till the Sunday morning: I make the beds myself - his bed had been lain in - I went up at nine o'clock in the morning, and saw some clothes lying in the room; I went in, and made the bed. I found a spur on the floor, and another between the sheet and blanket; an orange coloured waistcoat laid on the table, and in a chair was a piece of new calico - there was a dirty shirt on the floor. I went into the other room, and saw him - I knocked at the door for a broom - he came to the door: he had a drab coat on; he usually wore a blue livery: there was a blue livery coat on a chair in his room - this was on Sunday morning. I do not think he went out all that day, but he might have gone out: he went out on the Monday, but, having a private door, I do not always know who goes out; his apartment was afterwards searched, and nothing found, but in the next room where Lee lives, a shirt, some stockings, and handkerchiefs were found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you went into the room in the morning you found him there? A. Yes, on the Sunday morning - the bed appeared to have been lain in, but whether for an hour, or how long. I could not tell; he did not sleep at home at all on the Friday night, and he was not at home on the Saturday night, between twelve and one o'clock, when we went to bed.</p>

            . I am constable of Enfield. In consequence of the prosecutor being robbed, I went in search, and on the 6th of December I saw the prisoner at the Swan public-house, Southampton-court, near Russel-square; I told him his brother thought it very strange he did not come to see him, knowing he was very ill: he said he had not an opportunity. I then said I wanted him on suspicion of a robbery at Enfield - he asked where - I said, at Mr. Strange's, where his brother was: he said he knew nothing at all about it - that he was never at Enfield, and was willing to go to the office; I asked where he lodged - he said he had no lodging. I took him to Worship-street - I asked him again next morning, where he lodged - he said at a baker's-shop in Phoenix-street, Somer's-town, but he could not tell the No. - I went to a baker's-shop, at No. 8, kept by Mr. Reed, whose wife has been examined; I searched the lodgings there, and found some handkerchiefs, stockings, and shirts, and some calico - the corners of the handkerchiefs are cut off. The things were in Joseph Lee's room - I produce them.</p>

No - there is another door - the dairy-door opens into the stable also; I was in the stable at half-past twelve o'clock, holding the candle to my son, while he fastened the doors, as the team had just come in - the fowls were then in the loft, at roost.</p>

            , with his fist; I came up, and said it was a shame for a young man, like him, to knock an old man down; he told me he would serve me so; he pulled off his coat and hat, and came towards me; he made a blow at me; I laid held of him, and brought him down on his knees; the prisoner came behind me, and laid hold of me across the middle; he put me down on my knees; I was down on the pavement, and could not see whether any body came to help him; my head laid on the foot-way, on the stones - I felt the prisoner putting his hand round towards my watch, and thought he meant to take it; I just shifted my head up, over my right shoulder, to see who it was, and it was the prisoner; when I looked up, his jaw-bone laid on my cheek - I saw his face as well as I do now - I have known him from a child; when he had forced the watch out of my fob he left me; I suppose my watch was gold, for when I went to pawn it, it was described in the duplicate as gold; there was an old ribbon and plain key attached to it; I was on the ground for about two minutes after he left me; I could not get up, as I was pressed down by others - when I did get up, I could not see him; my coat was torn into two pieces - I know the prisoner's mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long has the watch been in the family? A. About twelve months; I got it from my brother, who is not here - he made me a present of it - he is a marine - I will swear it was not a silver watch - I did not know where the prisoner lived at the time of the robbery - I knew where he was employed - I do not know whether he surrendered to this charge or not; I saw him at the office; I charged nobody else with the robbery - I went to Marlborough-street next morning, and in the afternoon I went out, expecting to see some of the young men; one of them came up, and gave me a violent blow, and knocked me down - I went to Marlborough-street next morning, and asked for a warrant against the party, for an assault - I accused nobody else of stealing my watch; I know a man named Barnes - he is outside; I did not accuse him of stealing the watch; I asked for his name to be included in the warrant which I asked for.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards, for money, or any thing else, withdraw the charge against Barnes? A. Never; there were a good many people present at the quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, after the quarrel was over, pull out your watch and chain, and show it to any body? A. Never in my life - I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not, on doing that, say you would swear a robbery against Clines and the prisoner? A. I never expressed such words, or any thing like them; I know Lavell - I did not say so to him; he told my wife he would swear that I showed him the watch after I was robbed - I heard that, and went to him, and said if he had the face to tell me that he had seen the watch in my possession after the robbery, I would quit it; I was sure he never saw it - by quitting it, I meant I should think nothing of him if he said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Lavell walk home with you after the row? A. No; he came stripped to my door, with the gang to see if he could ill-use me; he did walk about a yard or two home with me - the robbery was committed about sixty yards from my house; I do not know what the prisoner is- he professes to be a labourer; when I knew him he was hod-boy in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say Lavell came to your door stripped? A. He did - there was a lot of them with him, about eight or nine, I suppose.</p>

On Friday, the 28th of December, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was at Queen-square, and saw the prisoner nearly opposite the back entrance of the office - I had been in search of him all day on Thursday, in the neighbourhood of Peter-street, but I did not find his mother's house; I asked if his name was Mitchell; he said it was; I asked if he had come to give himself up; he said,"No, I have come to hear about the watch;" I had not told him about any watch; I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He came into the midst of all the officers himself? A. Exactly so; I happened to be at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100040"/>Marlborough-street when the prosecutor applied for a warrant; the Magistrate said there was no occasion for one, and then he came to me about it.</p>

            . I have known the prosecutor about six years in London; I was present in this row, on the 26th of December; the first I saw of it was when I came up in the street - there was a mob, and when I got up I saw them striking each other; I saw the prosecutor strike Clines - after the row was over, Culpin, being a particular friend of mine, I took him by the arm, and pressed him to come along home, and he did - and he certainly said that he would swear a robbery against Clines; I asked him what they had robbed him of; he said, "My coat is torn, and I believe my watch must be broken" - he, at the same time, took hold of his watch, and took it out of his pocket; I am quite certain I saw him produce it after the row - I parted from him within a few yards of his own door, and did not see him again till about seven o'clock that night, when I saw him come up, and strike Mitchell in the street, and Mitchell's hat fell off; the prosecutor ran away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far did you go with him towards his own house? A. From the place where the row was - it was about two minutes' walk; but he stopped in the way, saying, he would swear vengeance against these parties.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was not Mitchell in that row? A. Yes, he was there; I did not see the prosecutor down on his knees; he was not down when I saw him, nor was any body upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at seven o'clock, when you saw him come up and strike Mitchell? A. Very near where the first row was - there are gas-lights in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prosecutor's house that evening, with your coat off? A. No, I did not - nor did I go to his house in company with any man that evening.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prosecutor in liquor? A. He seemed tipsy - I do not know whether he was drunk.</p>

            , my man, in the house; I had given Blackgrove leave to go out; I afterwards missed a cream-ewer, a china sugar-basin, worth 5s., and six table-cloths; I also missed some copper money - it must have been halfpence and penny pieces; I pay the rent and taxes of the house; a person named William Melford lived with me about two years and a half ago- I recollect the name, but not the person - I can only say a William Melford lived in my service - whether it was the prisoner or not, I cannot say; he left me two years and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do not you know that that William Melford was another person? A. The prisoner William does not appear like the same person; I have not the least recollection of him; I rent the whole house; I do not know when my maid-servant went out - she returned about half-past eight o'clock; I have no Christian name besides Mary Ann; I had seen three of the spoons on the table that day, and three in the closet; I do not know how many tea-spoons I had - I may have two dozen; I am sure the spoons I lost are the same I saw that day - they have my initials on them.</p>
               <p>SARAH BLACKGROVE. On the 11th of December I was in the service of Mrs. Norbury; she gave me leave to go out - I went out at a quarter before twelve o'clock, and returned at a quarter-past eight; I left the plate and every thing safe, and when I came back it was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been in all the rooms that day? A. Yes I had, to dust them; I left Tibbs at home - no one had been in the house before I went out; I had been in my own room; if any one came while I was up there, I could not tell; my mistress went out a quarter before eleven o'clock, and I a quarter before twelve.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. While you were there, did you hear any knock at the door, or ring at the bell? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure you went into all the rooms? A. Yes; my mistress locked them, but I went into them; we both came out together; she locked the doors after me.</p>
               <p>HENRY TIBBS. I was in the service of Mrs. Norbury<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100041"/>on the 11th of November; she went out between eleven and twelve o'clock that day, leaving me and the servant in the house; the servant afterwards went out, leaving me alone; no one, except the milk-woman, came to the house from that time till half-past five o'clock; about half-past five I heard a kind of rustling at the shop door (the shop door is a street door); I went up stairs from the kitchen, opened the door, and the prisoner Charles Melford stood at the door; he asked if I would let him have a few oysters; I said Yes: he came in; I shut the door after him, and went behind the counter to serve him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it a spring lock, so that any body could come in without your assistance? A. Yes. He asked me how Mrs. Norbury did - I said she was quite well; he said, "I suppose she is at her father's, at dinner. to-day;" I said, Yes; I then opened some oysters for him; he said he had some more friends outside, who would take some; when he had eaten three or four, he went and opened the door, and spoke to somebody, but what he said I do not know - the prisoner William Melford then came in; his face was as it is now, without any disguise; he ate one oyster, and said he did not like them: one of them said, "You do not open them fast enough;" there were only two persons in the shop then; he asked if I had not got any body to help me - I said No; I am not certain which that was; one must have heard whatever the other said: he then asked if there was nobody in the house but me - I said, No, there was not; one of them went out - I am not certain which; he brought in a third man, who was Sullivan; I am certain of his person - (pointing him out;) one of them asked if he would not take any oysters - he said he would not, or No, I am not certain which; they then asked him if he would have a bottle of ginger-beer - he said No: Charles Melford then said, "That will do - that is enough," and asked what there was to pay; I said 8d. - he gave me half-a-crown: I said I had no change, and asked if he had no smaller change; he took up the half-crown, and put down a shilling; I said if he would give me the halfpence I would give him a sixpence - he asked William Melford if he had any - he said No: I gave Charles 6d., and said I would trust him for the 2d.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did William Melford do any thing? A. He shut the door, and locked it; he then pulled a pistol out of his trousers pocket, I think, but am not certain which pocket it came from; it was a small pistol - he presented it to me across the counter, and said, "Do not you say a word - I won't hurt you;" Charles then said, "We don't want any thing of you - we only want your master's money;" he (Charles) pulled a sword out of his stick; and Sullivan pulled a pistol out of his pocket; one of them asked me to come down stairs: they asked me to show them where my mistress' money was - I said I did not know any more than a stranger that was never in the house - one of them asked me to go down stairs; I said No; one of them said, "Go round, and lay hold of him by the collar;" I do not know which that was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you quite free from alarm, with two pistols and a sword presented to you? A. I was quite collected.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Well, what happened? A. Charles Melford came round the counter - he laid hold of me by the collar, and desired me to come down stairs, and at the same time put the sword against my breast, saying, if I did not come down he would run me through - I said I did not care if he did: one of the other men said to him,"Never mind, go down yourself;" Charles let me go, and went down stairs into the kitchen without me - he returned almost directly, and brought up a lighted candle; it was there, lighted, before.</p>
               <p>Q. While he was gone down stairs you were in the shop - what passed? A. Sullivan was holding the pistol across the counter to me at the time, I being behind the counter; when Charles Melford returned up stairs, William said to Sullivan, "If he makes the least noise, blow his brains out directly;" that frightened me - Charles and William Melford then went up stairs, and I saw no more of William afterwards. Sullivan stood at the same place, holding the pistol across the counter, directed towards me, and he (Sullivan) said if I squeeked, or made the least noise, he would have me down directly; while they were up stairs I heard them breaking open doors and places: they remained up stairs about a quarter of an hour, as near as I can judge, and at the end of that time Charles Melford came down, and asked me for another candle - I gave him one out of the cupboard at the back of the shop - I do not know which of them lighted it; he went up stairs again with the candle, Sullivan still remaining below - I then heard them come down stairs, to the first floor; the first noise I had heard was higher up: I heard them say something about the kitchen, but what I do not know. Charles Melford then came down stairs a second time - William remained above: Charles said, "Follow me," and Sullivan said, "Go on," and he followed me; I went half way down the stairs, and saw Charles Melford take something out of his coat pocket - he was at the bottom of the stairs - I did not care to go any further down then, and I stood still; Charles then said, "Come on - we won't hurt you;" I then went down to the bottom of the stairs; Charles then took a cord, and tied my hands behind my back, and tied the cord, at the same time, round my body - he had another string, and fastened my legs with it - he then dared me never to know either of them, if I saw them again; he said, "Mind, you never know us again if you ever meet us in the street;" they then went up stairs, and I saw no more of them; they left the street door ajar. I gave an alarm, and got assistance; when I got up stairs I found the things all thrown about the rooms - I got up stairs by cutting the cords, in about two minutes; I got across the kitchen, got a knife, and cut them; when I got up stairs I found the things thrown about the rooms, and the doors broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect going to the Saracen's Head at any time? A. Yes, the day after, or two or three days after - I think it was the next day; a person passed me, who attracted my attention, and I charged him with this - I believed it to be William Melford, and I gave him in charge - he was not the man, but I took it to be him; there was something the matter with his nose, which induced me to take him for the man.</p>
               <p>Q. That having been the case, do you still swear positively or not to William? A. Yes; I am quite sure of him. I went to Worship-street five or six weeks afterwards, and the prisoner Charles Melford was shown to me by Hanley - he was under examination; I was not in the office two minutes before; I said he was the man. I have left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100042"/>Mrs. Norbury's since, in consequence of the robbery - I believe I was partly suspected of it, because I did not fasten the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Part of the cause was your having left the door unfastened? A. Yes; the suspicion was mostly through my leaving the door unfastened. I had been in her service about twelve months; before that I lived with the persons whom I now live with, Messrs. Stapleton and Biddle, fishmongers, Holborn-hill. I should think the prisoners were in the house about half an hour; we have gas-lights in the shop, and they were burning; the shop shutters were up, and the door was shut and locked. I gave the cord which I was fastened with, to Mr. Smith, the beadle of the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you fix on the man at the Saracen's Head? A. By his looking very hard at me, and having lost his nose, but I did not swear to that man; I said I could not swear to him - that was before the Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>Q. After that man was discharged, did you not still say you believed he was the man? A. I said I still thought he was the man, but could not swear to him; it was proved before the Lord Mayor, that that man had been discharged from the hospital the day before; I saw Charles five or six weeks after that, and said I knew him before I was in the room two minutes - I have always said that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not twenty minutes or half an hour? A. I mentioned it in twenty minutes, or half an hour also; I mentioned it in two minutes as well; I saw him in a private room, not in the Justice-room; he stood against a table - another person, named Moss, stood by his side - Moss was a person taken on suspicion of a robbery in the City-road; he had no connexion with this case; he is a shortish person, and looks a little like a Jew.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after you saw the man you suspected at the Saracen's Head, did you see the prisoner William Melford? A. About five weeks - I was quite certain of him. I saw Sullivan the day after Christmas day; he was at Worship-street - he was taken after the Melfords were committed; I was quite certain of him. I speak with certainly to his being one of the three.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer of Worship-street. I apprehended the prisoner Charles Melford, on the 10th of December, at No. 24, Henrietta-street, Hackney-road; there was a woman in the house, whom I heard him call mother, and a young woman, whom I am not certain, that he called sister, in the house, but he spoke of her afterwards to me as being his sister; after taking him to Worship-street, I returned again with Wilmot, to assist in searching the house; there are two sleeping rooms; the mother and sister sleep in the front, and I understood from the mother, that Charles and William slept in the back, but that was not said in their hearing; there are two rooms below, but no bed-room, except the two up stairs - I found hanging on the door of the back bed-room, a blue coat, which Charles Melford owned - I also found in a box near the foot of the bed, in that room, six pistol bullets, two small vials of gunpowder, and several flints, and, on the mantel-piece, were two other pistol bullets in a watch-stand - in another box, I found this bullet-mould, which fits the bullets, and in the same box I found two masks, which I did not take away at the time, but have them here now; there was a box on the landing-place, within a yard of the room door; I could not get the key of it, and broke it open with a chisel - I found a large loaded pistol at the top of that box - I have drawn the charge; it was loaded with small shot, and primed; in the same box I found a cut glass creamewer, wrapped in brown paper - I did not bring that away at first, but am certain it is the same - I saw Wilmot find two pistol keys; he took them up in the room, and showed them to me - I believe he took them from one of the boxes - I found nothing more that day - I produced these things at the Police-office; only Charles was in custody then - I produced these things before him - I do not recollect whether I had any conversation with him, expect before the Magistrate; the mother was present when I found them - I apprehended him before ten o'clock in the morning - I went back and found the things about eleven; the bed was unmade - I did not notice whether one or two persons had slept in it - I apprehended William on Monday the 17th, at the Olive Branch public-house, Maze, Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask William Melford where he lived? A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100043"/>We took him for another affair - Mrs. Norbury's robbery was mentioned to him, but not particularly; he said nothing particular about it - I went on the 18th, to the house in Henrietta-street, with Garton and Brown, and in a cupboard in the back room, ground-floor, I found this sword stick; it is a sword for thrusting; it was in the room under that in which I found the things in the box, and up stairs, in the back room, where I had searched before, I found the duplicate of a fish-knife, pawned for 18s., at Lawton's, No. 151, Bishopsgate-street - I went there with that duplicate, and the fish-knife was produced to me; there was a screw-driver, which I produced; Garton has that; we found a tooth-pick in William's pocket, when we took him, and Brown found a pencil-case. On Christmas day, between five and six o'clock, I went in company with my brother officer to the Ship and Shovel public-house, in a court behind Guy's Hospital - I went up stairs, and found the prisoner Sullivan lying on a bed, with his clothes on; he was lying outside - I told him to get up, that I might look at him; he had a different coat on to what he wears now; he got off the bed - I told him I was a Police-officer, and from his description, I suspected he had been concerned in a robbery, and asked him how he got his bread; he said,"Not in that way, master" - I asked him, "What way then?" he said he had been a licensed hawker - I asked him to show me his goods; he said he had no goods, they had been stolen from him - I asked him to show me his box; he said he had no box - I asked how long he had known Bill Melford, and whether Bill had not slept in that room with him about a week ago; he said Yes, he had a short time before, and that he got acquainted with him in Guy's Hospital - I looked near the head of his bed, and found a bawker's bag, with "Jeremiah Sullivan, licensed hawker" on it; the landlady was in the room, and said, in his hearing, that it belonged to him - I took these cords out of that bag; they are what are called nettles, I believe; they belong to a hammock I believe; he said so, and I found a sort of ring with them - I found a duplicate on him, which does not relate to this business, and half a crown in money - I found a small pistol flint in the bag, a common flint - I asked what he did with those cords; he said they belonged to his hammock, when he was in the Preventive Service - I took him to the watch-house. I should have stated, that I put these cords into his hat, and he took them to the watch-house. I found them in his hat afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Charles was taken first? A. Yes - I went to the mother's house three or four times, in order to take William - I found some things the first time; the mother knew I found them. William was not then in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went the second time, you found other things? A. I found all the articles, except the duplicate and sword-stick at the first search, but did not bring them all away.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I accompanied Hanley to the Olive Branch, and took William Melford; I searched him, and found four duplicates in the fob of his trousers pocket - I produce them - three of them relate to this robbery; one is from Harris, and two from Martin; the other was a duplicate for a pair of spectacles, pawned for 5s. I went to No. 24, Henrietta-street, the day after I took William, and, on searching the boxes in the back room, up stairs, I found this silver pencil-case. I went to Mrs. Norbury's, in Birchin-lane, and examined her premises - I think it was on the 18th - Garton was with me, and he had a screw-driver, which I saw found at Henrietta-street, in the same room; I applied that screw-driver myself to two room doors, three closet doors, and a chest of drawers, all of which had been forced; I compared it with the impressions made on the wood, and it corresponded exactly with all of them.</p>

            . I am an assistant to Mr. Lawton's pawnbroker, No. 151, Bishopsgate-street. I gave this duplicate (looking at one), on the 26th of November, for this fish-knife, which was pawned in the name of John Smith, by the prisoner Charles Melford - I am quite certain of his person; I asked him if it was his own property; he said Yes, to be sure it was - whose did I suppose it was; he gave me his name and address, "John Smith, No. 14, Brunswick-street."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. That was seven weeks ago nearly? - A. Yes; I am certain of his person - I advanced 18s. on it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The duplicate appears to describe the person pawning as a housekeeper? A. Yes; he said he was a housekeeper, so I gave him a duplicate with the letter H. on it.</p>
               <p>JAMES BROWN re-examined. I produce a rope, which I received from Tibbs.</p>
               <p>HENRY TIBBS. That is the rope which my hands and feet were bound with.</p>

               <p>GEORGE WILMOT re-examined. I have worked as a rope-maker on board ship, though I am not a rope-maker; this is a sort of rope called nettles - it is used to tie up hammocks with; this is a particularly fine one, and is termed a three-yarn nettle.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at those pieces found in Sullivan's bag - are they the same in every particular? A. This piece is not - it is a two-yarn nettle, nor is this piece, but this one is exactly the same kind of stuff; these nettles are generally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100044"/>used for slinging a hammock; one piece, I swear, is the same manufacture as that produced by Tibbs - it is very fine, unusually fine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The first piece is cut clean at the ends? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you untwist the piece you compared? A. To ascertain the quality of the yarn - the rest are coarser, and quite different,</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any particular yarn in the composition of these two that you say tally? A. Yes; it is particularly fine yarn, which is not common.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SULLIVAN. Q. Is there hardly a sailor in London without such ropes as those? A. No; not one in five hundred has rope of this quality to his hammock - it is considerably uncommon; it is particularly fine, very choice - I do not mean to say there is none of this sort, but it is uncommon.</p>

            . I keep the Ship and Shovel public-house. I know all the prisoners; Sullivan lodged with me for four months, up to the time he was taken up; the other prisoners very frequently visited him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they visit him before, or near the 11th of December? A. Yes; William Melford slept with Sullivan on the 11th of December - that was the first night he slept with him; they visited him often.</p>

               <p>Prisoner SULLIVAN. Q. Did you see me more with the Melfords than other men? A. The Melfords were more acquainted with him than with any other person.</p>
               <p>MRS. NORBURY. This fish-slice is mine, and these six silver tea-spoons have my initials on them; the six table-cloths are mine - they are not marked, but I gave the officer one, which was cut from the same piece - they are of a particular shape and make; they are made small, narrow, and long, for the tables in my business - they correspond in pattern with what I have at home; I know this glass cream-jug; I have a sugar-basin corresponding with it; the sugar-tongs are mine, and have my initials on them(M. A. N.) - the spoons are marked the same. I know this pencil-case - it is an old one, which I have had for years - it was in a box, with the seal, which is not found; nothing more of mine is here - I am certain they were safe in the house before the robbery; I had used the spoons the day before.</p>

               <p>CHARLES MELFORD's Defence. I know nothing about the robbery.</p>
               <p>SULLIVAN's Defence. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>JURY to HENRY TIBBS. Q. You have said you were fastened hand and foot - how did you get liberated in two minutes? A. I was at the bottom of the stairs; my hands were fastened with a cord, and tied round my body, but I managed to get my hands out. I noticed Sullivan's voice - his voice to-day corresponds exactly; Sullivan might be twenty-five minutes, or half an hour, with me; while they were going over the house, he was holding the pistols across the counter; we were face to face - I was under no alarm at first.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. These persons' lives are concerned in this charge; can you, on your oath, conscientiously and seriously, before God, declare you are certain of each of the three prisoners? A. I am certain of all of them; I should know the coat Sullivan had on if it was produced.</p>

Stop thief! I ran after them, and they ran before me; they ran up Coburg-street, two on the left hand side, and one on the right; one of them turned down a cow-yard - I followed that man; he ran into the cow-house - I went into the cow-house, but could not see him there - Hawkins went into the cow-house, and soon after brought the prisoner out of it; this bottle of wine was given to me out of the cow-house, by Seabrook; when the prisoner was brought out, he appeared to be the same man as I was pursuing - I am sure of him - I have not a doubt of him.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you hear him opening the cupboard? A. I heard him with a knife opening it - I went up, and he had the cupboard door open, and the glove of money in his hand - I cried out, that I was robbed; there was nobody else in the room - I am sure the glove was in his hand; he beat me with his fist, and I went down into the kitchen; he gave me a blow in the eye with his fist, and struck me with the handle of the knife - I had a black eye - he went out of the room, down into the kitchen, where there were a great many people - I accused him there, before my husband, of taking the money, and my husband beat me, because I had never told him what money I had; he did not know I had so much.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner? A. I was almost fainting, and asked for a drop of water, and as my daughter gave me the water, he ran out; he kept going on with the quarrelling; he said he would have another man, who had been two years in my house, and would stand in his blood between that and the morning; I do not know how long he remained in the kitchen - I do not know which way he ran, only he followed the other man (Richard Farrell,) who lodged with us; he was obliged to run away for his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go and tell a Police-officer of this? A. I was going after him two days after the robbery, to get him taken up to Lambeth-street - I went there, but was crowded away, and they would not let me say any thing - I went to the office, on the Friday; he has not returned to our house since, only that night, when he came like a madman, and said he would have that man's life; he had not given us warning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Now, on your oath, did not the prisoner, himself, complain at the office first against both of you, for assaulting him? A. My husband and him went there first, with one another; that was two days after the robbery; they charged each other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100046"/>with an assault - I went after them, to get him taken up, when I heard he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on your solemn oath, did you at the office say a single word about a robbery, when the charge of assault was preferred by your husband? A. When I went there I did - I went there, and was crowded out, and turned away - I then went to Worship-street; they said at Lambeth-street, that there was nothing for me there, and turned me away, and I then went to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. After O'Brien robbed you, did he take the sovereigns down stairs to the kitchen with him? A. That I do not know, because he knocked me down, and beat me; he was in the house when my husband beat me; he struck my husband with the knife, before he went out - I do not know how many men were in the kitchen at that time - I cannot say whether there were five, six, or seven.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason that you remained for two days without going to the office, about the one hundred sovereigns? A. I followed him there, when I heard he was there - I did not complain of it before, as I was waiting to get him taken up - I never wanted the prisoner to marry my daughter; he followed me on Christmas night to my bed - I never told his brother, that if he did not marry my daughter, I would make him suffer - my husband used to give me his earnings; but before I was robbed, he did not bring me to account; he knew I had some money - I never counted it before any body; a woman who lodged in the house, has seen me with ten and forty sovereigns on Mr. Benjamin's table; she is at my house now; my daughter has seen me with a good deal of money; the prisoner wanted to have my daughter - I often missed money out of my cupboard - I once missed two sovereigns, and told my husband of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the kitchen when you told your husband he had robbed you? A. Yes; and I said he had got all the money I had in the world; he went down into the kitchen directly, before I did; I did not see the money there; the people in the kitchen were my lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body demand that the prisoner should be searched? A. They saw my husband beat me after going to Lambeth-street; I went three days running to the Priest, and after that went to Worship-street; the prisoner was taken for quarrelling; he was set at liberty - but that was not in my case; when I mentioned the robbery, I was pushed outside; I was at the office on a second occasion, with my husband - he was going to mention about the robbery with me.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL MURPHY. This is my dwelling-house. On boxing-night I had been to bed, and I came down to the kitchen between seven and eight o'clock; I lighted the prisoner three times up stairs that night, to get him to bed; he was up stairs when my wife went up; she and he came down together; I cannot say who was first; she said she was robbed, but did not say of what, or by whom, at that time - but called for a drink of water; she said soon after that O'Brien was the person; I knew she could not be without money, but did not know what she had, whether it was 1l., 100l., or 200l.; when she said she was robbed, I gave her a slap in the mouth, for fear of a row being in the house - I believe the prisoner remained there about an hour after; he went out after another man, to a public-house; he had kicked up a row; I went to bed, and was forced to get up again; I found him in the kitchen; he went away in about half an hour; he never returned to lodge at the house; he had given no notice to quit; he paid weekly - this was the middle of his week; I went to Lambeth-street for an indictment against him for a row, for he had stabbed me with a knife before he went out; I went there a day before my wife; I did not complain of a robbery, for she did not tell me what sum she had lost till the next day; I never inquired the sum; my wife went to the office to get an indictment against him for robbing her; I offered, on the Friday, to tell the Magistrate of the robbery, but did not mention it; I mentioned it on Saturday to Norris, the officer; he told me there was nothing to be got there; we went to Worship-street afterwards, and got a warrant, for Vann to apprehend him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On your solemn oath, did he not go the office to get a warrant against you for an assault? A. Yes; he got his warrant after I got mine - the Magistrate dismissed both charges, that was on Friday; he heard us both - I said nothing to him about the robbery - my wife told me that it was one hundred sovereigns, about ten or eleven o'clock on the Friday; my wife came to the office about twelve o'clock, but the officer would not let her in - he told her she would get no warrant; I swear that: it was Norris - she did not go to Worship-street till the Wednesday following - I went myself to the Lord Mayor, and they told me I should get no warrant there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you go to the Lord Mayor? A. On Saturday; I made the first complaint at Lambeth-street; my wife did not tell me the amount of the money till after I left the office on Friday; the Magistrate only looked at both of us, and said he would not hear the warrants.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the prisoner complain that you was detaining his box, with forty-seven sovereigns in it, and the Magistrate sent an officer for you to give it up? A. No; the officer told me to give it up; he told the officer it contained valuable property.</p>

I was bound over, by the direction of Mr. Twyford, to attend on behalf of the prisoner; when he was apprehended he wished me to come to Worship-street - I went, and found the people who had taken him were the same who had the warrants against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been an officer? A. Five years - on the Thursday after boxing-day I saw O'Brien at the office, but do not recollect seeing Murphy there that day, but I know he was there, as both the assault warrants were granted on that day - Mr. Wyatt, the Magistrate, heard them both at full length - Mrs. Murphy was outside - I took her into the office about three o'clock- not a word was said to the officers or the Magistrate about a robbery then - both warrants were discharged, and I heard nothing further till I was fetched to Worship-street, on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Then is it true that she told you of the robbery on Friday, and you turned her out of the office? A. Quite the reverse; I took her before the Magistrate - she was not turned out, but after she heard the warrants were discharged, she said, "I will have a warrant for him myself now;" I said she had better go about her business - she had said nothing before that; I took her in before the Magistrate, and told him that she wanted a warrant, he said,"Send her out about her business."</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. From whom did you first hear of a robbery? A. From the prisoner's brother, who fetched me to Worship-street on the Wednesday - I understand the woman did come to the office drunk, on Friday evening, and mention a robbery to Lee and another officer.</p>

No price was mentioned; he did not ask the price, nor did I set any price, nor did he say he should wish to bargain for them; he only asked what I had, and that is all that passed; I waited for him on the following morning, till half-past nine o'clock - he did not come - I sold one of the cows that day to Mr. Howard, of Queen-street, Seven-dials, for eighteen guineas, and I had to send the other two to Mr. Styles; I went to Laycock's that day, and took two men to take the two cows to Mr. Styles, and one to Howard; Styles lives in Upper Gower-mews, Bedford-square; I stated at the office about making this sale to Howard and Styles; when I got to Laycock's I found one of the cows and calf was not there - they were worth 18l.; it was a red roan cow, a kind of strawberry-colour; the cows and calves were all the sole property of William Smeeton, my father; I have no share in the business; I was going to leave town that day, but stopped to find the prisoner; it was Saturday; I had told the prisoner I should leave town that day - I am sure of that - I saw the cow again last Saturday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has your father no partner? A. No; I do business for my father - he does not pay me; I have no share at all in the business; I had seen the prisoner but once before; he paid me for that transaction, but not all at once.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual in your business, when a dealer wishes to buy a beast, that he takes it, and it is left to the salesman afterwards to settle the price? A. Yes, sometimes, but it must be a gentleman whom we know well - it is very seldom done. I have known Mr. Styles twelve months: I am certain none of my brothers are in partnership with my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Although you have only had one transaction with the prisoner, has he not several times bid money for cattle? A. Never.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Was there ever such a bargain between you and the prisoner, as for him to take cattle, and you to fix the price afterwards? A. Never.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would you have allowed him to take any of your cattle without a regular bargain, and the money being paid? A. No.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Laycock, of Islington, who keeps places for housing and foddering cattle. I know the prisoner; he came to me on Saturday morning, the 5th of January, about eleven o'clock, in the lairs at Islington, and asked me if Mr. Smeeton had not got three cows there - I said Yes, and showed them to him - he said, "Those are the two cows which I have bought," pointing to a cow and calf, and one that was in calf - he said he had bought them of Smeeton, and said, "This old devil here, he wanted to shove upon me, but I would not buy it;" (meaning the third cow, which was older than the others) he said, "I did not know this cow was so lame, for I sold it last night to a gentleman for 21l." - that was a cow in calf; he did not say who he had sold it to - he told me he had bought the cows for 37l., and paid for them - he said he was to meet Mr. Smeeton, and breakfast with him, at the Grapes, but had not seen him: that was all the conversation I had with him. He waited at our place for Mr. Smeeton for an hour, and then said he would wait no longer - he said the other cow was lame; I said if he took it away he would ruin it, and he had better leave it there, and I would dress it; he said if I would, he would satisfy me for it, and would fetch it on the Thursday; he said he was going to take the cow and call to Wandsworth, but did not say who to: he had come to our place before, about Barnet fair time, for a cow which he had bought at Barnet, of Smeeton: he fetched it away from our place. He drove the cow and calf away - I went part of the way with him - it was a strawberry colour.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you in Mr. Laycock's employ? A. I look after his cattle. The prisoner said he lived at Wandsworth-common - I knew his name before - I should have given him the other cow if he had chosen, but he left it behind, and for that reason I had no suspicion; I suppose the one left behind was worth about 17l. - this was on Saturday: he came after two more cows on the Monday following - I saw him myself; he knew that I knew Smeeton; it was about twelve o'clock when he drove away the cow and calf. I understand he has been a dealer in cattle; I am not the foreman - I am under the foreman. I went to Battersea-bridge, to the prisoner's father's house, with the officer, on the Saturday on which he had the cow away, and he came to our yard on the following Monday; I told his father he had got a wrong cow; I did not state that it was an officer who was with me; he told me he was to meet Smeeton at the Grapes, but said he had not seen him.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Do you mean to say he said he had not seen Smeeton, or that you yourself say so? A. He said he had not seen Smeeton on the Saturday - I believed, from what he said, that he had purchased the cows.</p>

            . I am a cow-dealer, and live at the Bull public-house, at Holloway. On the 5th of January, as near one o'clock as possible, I was in Bridge-street, Blackfriars', and saw the prisoner driving a cow and calf; whether he asked me to buy it, or I asked him to sell it, I cannot say, but he asked me eighteen guineas for it - I bid him 15l. for the cow and calf; I asked how he came by her, and he said he had her from Cambridgeshire, or something to that effect; I looked at the cow more steady, and saw it was one I had seen exposed for sale on the Thursday before, at Mr. Laycock's lairs; I then went away, declining to buy it, in consequence of suspicions; he had offered it to me at 18l. I walked away, being determined not to purchase it, and told him his story was an untruth; I have seen the cow and calf since, and am quite<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100049"/>certain they are the same as he offered to me; I saw them yesterday morning, at Mr. Laycock's lair; I saw them on the evening after he offered them to me, at Mr. Lewis', in the Borough, and was sure they were the same - it was a strawberry cow, of a Lincolnshire breed.</p>

            . I am a cow-keeper, and live in White-street, Borough. On Saturday, the 5th of January, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at my premises; he said he had a cow and calf in the street, and if I was a buyer he would sell them to me worth the money; I asked him to bring them into the yard, for me to examine; he did so; I asked where he brought them from - he said they came from Smithfield that day - that he had turned his back a little, and the man took the cow away, for that money, as far as Blackfriars - that he and another ran after her, and brought her back, and he had lost the sale of her for the day; he took her to the Ram yard, Smithfield, and locked her up all night - he said he would sell her worth the money, as he wanted the money to go to a fair in the country; he asked 16l. for it; I offered him 14l., which he took. I paid him for them, and gave them up next day to the officer.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Laycock. I know the prisoner by sight. On Monday, the 7th of January, I saw him at Laycock's yard, about five o'clock in the afternoon - he asked for his two cows - I am sure he asked for two; he did not show me which two he meant; I told him he had none there - he said he had two, which he had bought of Mr. Smeeton (the strawberry cow and the calf had then been brought back by the officer;) I spoke to Mr. Laycock, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to his father's house? A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COPE. I am a constable of Islington. On Monday, the 7th, I received the prisoner in charge at Mr. Laycock's; he told me he had paid Smeeton 37l. for the cows, and that the cows and calf were at Wandsworth. I had fetched the cow and calf from Lewis', and they were at Laycock's when I apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to his father and mother's house? A. I did; I went to different houses, and found where he lodged; no offer was made to give up the prosecution for 18l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had an interview with Mr. Smeeton on Friday afternoon - I asked if he had any cows to suit me; before that I had been at a public-house, and seen Smeeton's man, who said his master was at the Lock and Key, and that they had turned three cows out of the market; I went there, saw Smeeton, and had a glass of something with him; he asked me to breakfast with him next morning; I said I would, and intended going, but the morning was so very wet and snowey, I was not there till after half-past nine o'clock. I asked the young woman in the bar if he was there; she said he was gone, and I asked where he was going; she said he said he was going into the country; I asked if he was likely to be at Laycock's; she said, "Most likely;" I went and inquired if he had been there; they sent me to the foreman's house; I went and asked if Smeeton had been there; a young woman said No, and told me to go into the lairs, and inquire for George, which I did, and asked if Smeeton was there; I said I expected to meet him there about some cows; I waited there an hour and a quarter; he never came; as we were dealers together, and he had left the price to other people, I thought he would do the same with me; and so he would if he had not been pressed to bring this charge; seeing one was lame, I left her there, and promised to give George 3s. for dressing her, he having told me to say nothing to the foreman about it - I was a perfect stranger to George; I waited a long time, and then said I would take one away; he said,"I dare say it is all right;" I said, "You may depend upon it, it is," and when Smeeton came, he should have put the price on them, and I would have paid him. In Bridge-street I met this man, who calls himself a dealer, but he only goes about to look after cows for other people; he asked me to give him some gin; I said I would not; he said, "Where did you bring that from?" I said, "Out of the country,' for I was not going to satisfy him - he never came out into the road at all to me; I was going to take it to Johnson's, of Kent-street, to show him, but Mr. Lewis' man came out, and said, "That cow would suit my master;" I said if he liked to look at it he should: I went into the yard, and told Lewis I had a cow to sell; I sold it to him for 14l., and referred him to Johnson, of Kent-street; he went there before he paid me, and got the best of referrences. This cow is valued at eighteen guineas - it is not worth the money. On Monday I went to Islington, to see if George had dressed the cow as he had promised; these people had been at my father's house on the Sunday, and a man said if my mother would give him 18l. they would say no more about it. I went to Mr. Laycock's foreman's house on Monday, and asked if he was at home; they said No; I called out George, but he did not answer; this gentleman came; I said I came to look at the cows I bought of Smeeton; he said, "You have none here;" I said, "I have two, which I bought of Smeeton;" he left me, and this man came up; we went to a public-house, and had some brandy and water together; this gentleman came in, and the constable said he had a charge of felony against me, for stealing the cows; I said I would go any where, but as to my mentioning a price I never did: I asked George if they were worth 37l., but never said I gave that for them. The Magistrate would not have committed me if he had not been pressed. Is it likely, if I wanted to steal the cows, that I should go to Laycock's? I intended to pay him the money this week, when he came up to London. I have sold 40l. worth of cattle at a time, and nobody can say I owe them 1s.; the time being short, and my friends living in the country, they are not here. I intended to pay Mr. Smeeton honestly for them; I had no conversation with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100050"/>man in Bridge-street; I never went out of the road, and he and the drover stood on the pavement; would a guilty man have gone to Laycock's on the Monday, as I did? my friends went yesterday to the Grapes, to ask the young woman to come and prove that I had been there, and asked for Mr. Smeeton, but they said she should not come, and that she should know nothing about it; I sent her a subpoena, but believe she is not here.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LEWIS. He did refer me to Johnson.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you drinking at the Coopers' Arms from eleven o'clock till two? A. No - I was quite sober; Ford's son was not sober - I do not know how the Captain was; I had not been drinking with him - his son fetched me to the Coopers' Arms about eleven o'clock; the Captain was in another room - I was drinking with the son - he did not appear very drunk - he was a little fresh, I and another man drank 4d. worth of gin and water, and part of two pots of beer among three of us - there was a row in the barge - I went to see what it was - I did not know who was in the row - I now understand Mr. Ford's son was in it - I did not know he was on board when I went - the side of the barge is not very high - I was looking over it - I did not spring up - I might have lifted myself up.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time you were there was not the prisoner engaged in fighting with young Ford? A. He was not engaged, for he took my hat off - I did not know Ford was on board then - Captain Ford came on board in a quarter of an hour after I got there - I did not exactly see Bowden's hand take my hat off, but there was nobody there but him, and it was dark in that part of the barge; Bowden was nearest to me - whether he was in the scuffle or not I cannot tell: I seized him by the collar, and was dragged into the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have been dragged in if you had let go of Bowden? A. No, but if I had let go I should have lost my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. He struggled with you, and after being thrown down on him, blows passed between you? A. Yes, and we were down together again, and I felt I was wounded; the scuffle was done with when I felt I was wounded - it was going on when I felt the first wound, and afterwards; Captain Ford was in the barge when I received the third wound; I do not know where young Ford was - I do not know that I struck the prisoner above once or twice - I will swear I did not strike him ten times - I held him with my left hand, and kept several blows from me with my right; I got the skin chipped off my fingers with stopping his blows; I do not exactly know where I hit him - it might be in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear old Ford say, "Fair play, let me see how my son will fight?" A. No. I went before the Lord Mayor on the Wednesday week following, by myself - I was not able to go before - the prisoner was there when I made my deposition - I was not there when Ford was examined. I never heard the prisoner say, "Oh! Lord, am I to be killed in this manner?" I am quite sure he did not say so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You had hold of him all the time? A. Yes; if he had said that, it must be so that nobody could hear him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Was it so dark in the barge that you could not see the persons who were struggling? A. They were not near enough for me to tell who they were - Ford did not take me into custody - he said I must come to the watch-house.</p>

            . My father is commander of a vessel. On the 26th of December, about two o'clock, I went from the Coopers' Arms, with Smith, to go on board our vessel; Smith was sober; I was about half-sens-over; I heard a noise in the barge as I was going down the stairs; I had left Smith behind - he stopped on the stairs for a necessary purpose; I went into the barge to see what was the matter, and as soon as I got in, four or five of them knocked me down; this was inside the barge - when I got up I saw my father come into the barge; I said, "Is that you, father?" he said, Yes; some of them jumped out of the barge - I jumped out, and went to the boat; I cannot say how many persons were in the barge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If you were not sober, how could you tell whether Smith was so? A. I am certain he was sober - I was neither drunk nor sober; I did not fight any body on board the barge - I struck nobody, I am quite certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see your father? A. Yes - I cast my eye up, and saw him; there was not sufficient light to see from one end of the barge to the other - I could see my father, because he came close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else in the barge? A. I saw those who had hold of me - they struck me down, and held me down.</p>
               <p>Q. You never struck anybody yourself? A. I do not know that - I did not strike anybody - I went to the Coopers' Arms about eight o'clock, and had part of four or five pots of beer - I stopped there till my father came, except going out now and then, about ten, to look at the boat - I returned and left for good about two - I had nothing but beer - Smith drank with me part of the time - I did not see him drink with anybody else - I paid for some of the drink - I did not see him pay for any; he had no gin and water in my company; he was not with me till eleven o'clock - I went out between eleven and two - I did not bear my father call for fair play in the barge - he could not have done so while I was in the barge without my hearing him; when the man pulled me to the bottom of the barge I got up again - I never struck him - I collared him - I tried to get away.

               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Was there something going on there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100052"/>before? A. There was scuffling; I was sober enough to know what I was doing; I did nothing before other persons touched me - I could see the persons who held me, but not to know them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you use the word "scuffling," do you mean they were contending together, or merely moving about with a little noise? A. No - they did not fight - there was a lark - I cannot say whether the persons on board were men or boys.</p>

            . I am master of the ship Commerce. I left the Coopers' Arms between one and two o'clock on the morning of the 27th of December; I had seen the prosecutor there that evening; I went to the Tower-stairs, to go on board my ship; Captain Allen and I walked down together. I found a barge in the causeway; I went down to my boat before I noticed any thing in the barge; my little boy, being in the boat, said there was a noise in the barge, and I went there; I did not hear the noise till I got there - I heard no cries, but a kind of hustling noise; I tried to get into the barge - I got one leg in first, and got in at last; I first observed two or three people had got hold of my son; as I was getting over the barge he said, "Is that you, father?" I said Yes, and with that all ran out of the barge; my son ran after them. Bowden and Smith were then left in the barge with me - we were the only persons left; I went to take hold of them - they were struggling together, standing up; Bowden with his back against the barge, and Smith before him; I took hold of them, and said I should take them to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. When you said that, did you know what had happened? A. No, I only saw the blood running from Smith's cheek; I took them to the watch-house; I saw Smith's cheek and chin bleeding very much - his clothes were very bloody, all the way down to his feet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you been drinking in company with Smith all the evening? No; there were several masters of vessels in the same parlour - I was not with Smith - I was quite sober when I came out- I had been there from eight o'clock; I had dined there - it was near eight when we had done dinner - it might be five when we began dinner - I did not take particular notice; I was as sober as I am now; Smith and my son went down to the barge first - they were not in my sight - it was a day or two past the full moon, but it was foggy; I did not know Smith was on board the barge until after I got in; my boat was fifteen or sixteen yards off. I was struck by somebody on getting into the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out, "Fair play - let me see how my son will fight?" A. I did not, nor any thing of the kind; nothing of the sort was said in my hearing - four of them had got hold of my son - I could not tell whether they were men or boys. I live at Ipswich. I did not hear the prisoner speak till I got hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Smith had hold of him, and had got him up by the side? A. Yes; I could not see whether they were striking - they were both standing there; I could see the blood run. Captain Allen had gone on board his own vessel; when I got hold of the prisoner, Smith said, "Will you lend me a hand to hold this man;" I heard Bowden say nothing further, than that he would go with me to the watch-house. I went to the Mansion-house about it that morning; I was brought into the prisoner's presence this day week; the Lord Mayor said my son ought to have been there.</p>

            . I am a constable of Tower Ward. On the night of the 26th of December Ford brought the prisoner and prosecutor to the watch-house, about a quarter-past three o'clock; the prosecutor was completely covered with blood - he said he was cut down in the barge at Tower-stairs: I asked who cut him; he pointed to the prisoner, and said that was the man who cut him, he could take his oath of it; the prisoner's hands were completely covered with blood. I sent for Mr. Hunter, the surgeon, of Mincing-lane; here are the clothes the prosecutor had on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the cut on the prosecutor's cheek appear deep? A. It was deep, so that I could almost put my hand into the gash, the lower part of the cheek was so fallen down; the cut on the chin was trifling, and there were several wounds on the back of the head; they appeared to have been made by a sharp instrument; his jacket is cut in two or three places on the breast; it has not been in my possession ever since: but I believe it to be in the same state as when it was brought to the watch-house; there were cuts on the jacket, but I did not take particular notice of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether the cuts had been there for a month you cannot tell? A. I cannot; the front of his jacket was nearly covered with blood; I suppose that was from his face.</p>

I was desired to go on board this barge; I perceived nothing there but water, straw, and blood; there was a great deal of blood on the near side of the barge; I went into a lug-boat on the off-side - it was moored along and fastened to the barge; I found in that boat a razor, shut, and covered with blood; I took it to the watch-house, and delivered it to Thompson.</p>

               <p>MR. JOHN HUNTER. I am a surgeon, of Mincing-lane. On the morning of the 27th I was fetched to the watch-house, and saw Smith; he had a wound across his left cheek, about four inches in extent, between the ear and nose - another on the back of his head, and a small wound on the chin; the wound on the cheek was deep - it had not penetrated into the mouth - it was a wide gaping wound; the one on the cheek was a slight small angular one; that on the back of the head was about three inches in extent - it had cut through the hair, but was not so deep as the other; I did not much notice his clothes; I asked if he was hurt in any other part; he said not - and I ordered him to be sent to the Hospital in a coach.</p>

            . I am stoker of the York steam-boat, trading from Gravesend to London. I was at the Tower wharf on the night in question; I know the prisoner; he was at the wharf that night, ready to carry the poultry out of the Ostend steam-boat, up to Leadenhall-market; I cannot say whether he was sober; I was not long in the boat - the Ostend did not arrive; and he went on board this barge with more of them; I did not hear them making any noise; I saw Smith and young Mr. Ford come down to the water side; they were intoxicated with liquor - they came there together; I followed them - one of the lads was whistling at the barge, and Ford said to the man who has been cut, "There is somebody on board the barge;" he said, "D - n me, we will go and have a lark;" Ford immediately went into the barge, and when he went in there was a bit of a scuffle; whether they were playing or fighting I cannot say; Smith immediately went into the barge - then the scuffle increased more - whether it was fighting or play I cannot say; I heard nobody cry out that he had lost his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Ford's father come down? A. While the other two were in the barge, in about a second, I observed a shortish man come down - how he got into the barge I cannot say, but I observed him in the barge in a short time; I saw him do nothing, but I heard a person cry, "Let him have fair play - I will see whether my son can fight;" I cannot say who said that (I did not see old Ford go into the barge, but I saw him in it); this was said loud enough for any body to hear; there was then a general scuffle altogether; two sea-faring men came on the quay, and entered into the barge, and the scuffle increased still more, and I observed three lads come running up the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean lads who were in the barge with the prisoner at first? A. Yes; nobody ran after them; I heard the prisoner cry out, "Oh! Lord, am I to be killed?" that was after his companions left the barge - I went down to the barge's gunwale to make peace, but directly I put my hands on the barge, I was struck a violent blow over the eye - I could not see who struck me; I was knocked down and stunned; I got up, put my hand over my eye, and walked home; I afterwards went to Mr. Hobler; my eye was blood-shot with the blow then - it was not black.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Where had you been that evening? A. I was at work down there, at the steam-boat; I had not been in the barge; I had been home to get my meals; I live at No. 2, Blue Anchor-yard, Whitechapel; I was quite sober - I had drank nothing; I was sitting on the waterman's-seat, on the beach, when I first saw Ford and Smith - it is about sixty yards from the river; I had been watching there about an hour, for the arrival of the Ostend boat; they came from Billingsgate way; I saw them come round the post of the plying-place - they were about ten yards from me; I followed them down close, because they were intoxicated; I saw that when they came close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to suppose they were intoxicated? A. Because they were reeling about, one up against the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to follow them? A. I did not know but they might be going to look for the watchman of the boats; I went to help them, finding him cut - I did not speak to them; I was about two yards from them - they passed quite close - when I went to the barge's gunwale, I saw some one on board the barge; I could see persons all up in one corner, there was Bowden, Cannon, Murgatary, and Kibble on board; I saw them all there; I knew the prisoner before, and knew his voice; I should not know the two sea-faring men if I saw them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were Cannon and the others taken before the Lord Mayor? A. Yes, and discharged - I am sure both Ford and the prosecutor were drunk - I saw Smith put his two hands on the gunwale of the barge, and raise his body up, and support his body on his right knee.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person pull him, or seize him, to compel him to go on board the barge at all? A. No; young Ford jumped up on the gunwale, but how he managed to get in, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say, they were both equally drunk? A. Yes; they reeled about like drunken men; they were reeling up against one another, both of them - I could see no difference in them - I was eight steps from the barge, when they got into it - I did not see Smith brought out of the barge - I went away directly I was struck.</p>
               <p>MR. HUNTER re-examined. The prosecutor did not appear to me to be intoxicated; if he had been so an hour or two before, I certainly must have observed it; he was reeling about with pain; if I was asked whether he was drunk, I should have said he was not; he did not appear so to me; the intoxication would rather be lessened by the loss of blood. I saw no signs of intoxication.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time in the morning were you called to him? A. The clock struck three, while I was out; he had lost a great deal of blood - I merely looked at his eyes with a candle - I did not smell his breath.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS WARD re-examined. He did not appear to me to have been intoxicated shortly before - I saw him again in the morning; there was no fever, which I should certainly think would have come on, if he had been intoxicated.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you a surgeon? A. I am a student in surgery. I have practised for myself; if he had been intoxicated, I should certainly have seen symptoms of it - I first saw him about five o'clock; if a man was in an extreme state of intoxication, he could not have answered me in the correct manner he did - I never knew or read of extreme agitation or suffering bringing a man too in five minutes: fever would certainly have followed the wound if he had been intoxicated.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100054"/>Q. Did you that night see Smith and Ford? A. I cannot speak to their persons, but I saw two or three come down, and I was glad to get out of their way, they were kicking up such a riot - I saw them go on board the barge; they had no business there; while they were on board I heard the prisoner call out for help - I heard him say,"Oh! Lord, am I to be killed?" and he said, "What have I done, that I am to be beat in this manner?" there were then three persons beating him on board the barge - I have known the prisoner six or seven years - I do not believe a person can give him a bad character; there might be five or six persons on board the barge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You knew them all? A. I knew them; there was Cannon, Murgatary, Bowden, one Bull, and Kibble; they were the prisoner's companions, and were waiting for the steam-boat; but two of them act as watermen.</p>

               <p>Q. They must have seen this as well as you? A. They had gone into the barge to sleep - I was not in the barge; I was sitting on the plumber's steps when they passed me; it was a dark morning - I should not know the persons who passed me - I was not eight yards from them; hearing the name of Ford called, I went down to see if I was called; I am sure there were three persons beating the prisoner at the time I left: either two or three went down to the steps; I do not know which; they passed me, but in the riotous way they went by, I was glad to get them past me, because it was not the first time I have been insulted and ill-used at these steps. I did not notice whether there were more than three - I am certain they could not be sober, because they came down in a riotous drunken manner; they were not sober, I am certain.</p>

            . I am an occasional night-watchman at the Tower-stairs. On the morning this took place, I saw the prisoner and his companions on board the barge; they said they would go there and turn in for a little while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing of the scuffle? A. I was in my watch-box, at the corner of Tower-stairs - I heard a noise, but having sprained my wrist, I was laying down; I heard the cry of "Ford" a number of times, and I thought it was the last witness who was called, or I should have gone out - I went out, and the first thing I saw was, a number of people jumping out of the craft in every direction - I said, "It is a pity, but the police were here, to take charge of you all" - I went to the Tower-dock, and could get no assistance - I then returned, heard a cry of Murder! and different things - I then went and got a light in my lantern - I went to the barge's gunwale, which was as high as my mouth - I locked over, and in the afterpart, was a good deal of straw; a person came to me all in a gore of blood, and said, "For God's sake call the watch; take the man some where, that he may have something done to him;" they had got this poor unfortunate prisoner, and said they would go to the watch-house; he said he would go with them; a tall man, the man who was cut, and another man, stood on the left of me in the barge; they went away altogether to the watch-house, and in a few minutes an officer and patrol came down, and they could find nothing in the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner, and the rest, been quiet and peaceable in the barge? A. They had turned in to sleep there - I have known the prisoner three or four years; he bore a peaceable sober character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw three persons in the barge, one of whom had been cut - did you follow them to the watch-house? A. No - I saw them come out of the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe any thing in their conduct, to cause you to believe they were in a great state of intoxication at that time? A. My Lord, they certainly must have been, or they never would have gone over the barge to go to the water - I will not swear they were drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. If they had been reeling about, must you not have observed it? A. No. I should think such a circumstance as that would have brought any man to his senses.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard of the robbery, and took the prisoners into custody on the 28th of November, and found the things at the broker's-shop; I made the prisoners no threat nor promise. I had previously taken Catherine Stokes into custody, and when before the Magistrate I heard her state, in the presence of both the prisoners, that they had given them to her to sell, and she had sold them to Ebers - they heard that, and said what she stated was true; I am confident they said so: when I went to take them they asked what I wanted them for; I said I would tell them presently. I asked them how they came in possession of the tools which they had directed Stokes to sell; Taylor said he had had them a length of time, and had worked with them in the brick fields - Stokes charged them both with it, and Davis said he knew nothing about them; this was before they went to the Magistrate, but when there, they both stated that what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100056"/>Stokes said was true. These are the tools. Stokes is a women of the town. The prisoners live about three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I know these tools to be his; I had worked with this spade the day before; I locked them up in the tool-house in the evening - the door was not open in the morning.</p>
               <p>COURT to the PROSECUTOR. Q. How did they get into the tool-house? A. I have no doubt but they got over the door; there is a space through which a boy, or perhaps a man, might get - we saw a footmark on the padlock of the door.</p>


               <p>DAVIS' Defence. I had nothing to do with the tools. - I met that woman between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, going with them.</p>

            . I am a servant at No. 16, Sloane-street. On the 4th of December I was out of place, having a bad shoulder. I was out all day, in search of a situation; I was returning about half-past ten o'clock at night, to my lodging near the old church Chelsea - I had a bundle, with all the articles stated in it.

When we had had the rum and water, he went home with me, and gave me the bundle at my house, and I missed these articles, which I am certain were in the bundle when I gave it him; there was a large pillow in it, so that it appeared as large as when I gave it him. When he was apprehended, as we were going before the Magistrate, he offered to pay me for every thing that was lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not rather tipsy? A. No; I was putting my pattens on, and stooping to tie them - a watchman, named Davis, came up to me, but he did not assist me home; I was quite sober: it was a very wet night. I drank nothing whatever myself. I did not tell the prisoner I had been robbed the night before.</p>

On the 10th of December, about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner at Walhamgreen - on seeing me, he crossed from the gas-light to a dark part of the road; I and Young crossed over to him, and saw that he had a cask on his shoulder; he said he picked it up against Garden-row, and was taking it to his own home; we said he must go with us; he then said he had picked it up near the two mile-stone, and was going to lay it on the bridge; we took it to Mr. Stocken's brew-house, and it was claimed; he said he did not think we should take him for so trifling a thing, if he had any thing of more value he should have planted it till morning, and then got it; he was about three-quarters of a mile from Stocken's, and about two hundred yards from Mr. Jermain's.</p>

I said Yes; he said, "I have been getting coals;" he lived at a public-house near, and Brookes is in the prosecutors' employ; I asked Brookes if his master allowed him to sell coals at that time of night; he said, "No; but I hope you will say nothing about it;" I said, "You had better go and see your master;" Mahoney then wheeled the coals away towards his master's house; I walked a little way with Brookes; he said Mahoney had given him 1s. for the coals; he then said he had not locked the shed, and must go back; I walked home, and soon afterwards Mr. Fergusson gave charge of Mahoney.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Are you in Mr. Fergusson's employ? A. Yes, sometimes; I suppose there were about two bushels of coals in the sack; I know Spratley - he was taken up; Brookes bore a good character - he was considered an idiot; persons used to push him about, and ill use him; Mahoney was in the service of Spratley, who is a publican; he is now in prison, I believe.</p>
               <p>JOHN FERGUSSON. I am in partnership with Mr. Cook - Brookes was in our service at the coal-warehouse; I also keep the Gun tavern; I never allow Brookes to send coals out; he appeared rather an idiot, and might not know what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you believe he might be persuaded to do wrong, by artful persons? A. Yes; at times he was very bad.</p>

            . I am a wire-worker. On the 3d of January, about twenty minutes to two o'clock, I heard Mrs. Lamprey (my neighbour), say she had lost a duck and fowl - I went to my door, and then went into the City-road, and saw the prisoner near the Angel public-house, at the corner of Tabernacle-walK, with the duck under his arm; he was a stranger; he crossed into Old-street; I followed him thirty yards, then tapped him on his shoulder; he turned round, and said, "If you will take the duck, and let me go, I will give you something to drink?" I took him towards the watch-house, met an officer, and gave charge of him; here is the duck.</p>
               <p>JAMES LAMPREY. I know this duck to be mine, by the marks on its wings; it was safe on my premises about one o'clock.</p>

I followed, and against a house, which she passed, I heard something strike - I saw the prosecutor was likely to take her, and turned to that spot, and found this watch on the pavement; the prosecutor secured her in two or three seconds; there was nobody within fifty or sixty yards of the place.</p>
               <p>CHARLES FOX. This is my watch. On the night in question I was with the prisoner - I had been to a house with her, and as we came out, I missed my watch - I was not quite sober - I said to a companion, "I have lost my watch;" the prisoner directly ran away - I had left all safe in the house, and had not undressed - I followed her, saw the patrol in High-street, and called Stop thief! she then threw something away - I heard it fall, and took her about thirty yards further; there was nobody in the room with us.</p>

            . On the 22d of November the prisoner gave me an account of what he had received: I am sure I took down every sum he mentioned - I went over the accounts with him, and ascertained the sum to be received, which was 2l. 7s. - here is no mention of a sum of 9s. received from Mr. Green, of Drummond-street; he mentioned a cask of beer going to Mr. Green, but not about any money received from him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many items were entered that day? A. About twenty-four; he said he delivered a cask of beer to Mr. Green, which came to 4s. 6d.; he has accounted for 6l. 6s. received on one day - it is not true that he never received more than 4l. or 5l. in a day - there are, on several days, a great number of items accounted for by him - he accounted when he came home, which was generally from six o'clock to eight in the evening; here is a figure of 4, which means a quarter cask.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many of these items, on the 22d of November, have money against them? A. Three only - I think 4l. a-day is above the average of what he has received; Mr. Green had had beer without money before; if the money was paid, it would be carried into the next column.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What does the prisoner account to you from? A. He has read from a list, but generally from memory.</p>
               <p>MR. LAXTON. He has never accounted to me for this 9s - I found it out about the 19th of December.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How much might he receive a a day? A. I meant to say from 4l. to 6l. - if I said less it was not intentional; there is seldom more than ten items of money received.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you dealt with Laxton before? A. Yes, for some time; about three years; Mr. Laxton came to me about it; the prisoner has called on me for the last eighteen months. I got the receipt off my file.</p>

At the watch-house I observed that the prisoner was all over dirt and mortar.</p>

On the 29th of December, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I stopped the prisoner with this oil-cloth; I asked where he was going with it; he said to Mr. Burnet, in Petticoat-lane, and had brought it from Mr. Mace's, in Whitechapel, for whom he had been employed about a mouth; I asked where he lived himself; he said he did know - I held him while my brother officer ran to Mace's - it was not above five minutes' walk; I have inquired, and find the prisoner has no friends, and is actually lost for want.</p>

I was in our parlour; a young man told me of this circumstance; I went out - one of our men served the prisoner with cloth to the amount of 11s.; he was taken into the parlour, and the buttons were found. I have inquired, and find he bore a most excellent character; he had frequently dealt at our shop - they were found in the cloth which he had bought, not in his pocket.</p>

            . I am guard of the Tally-ho, Birmingham coach. On the 8th of December Mr. Osmond was a passenger - I put his portmanteau, baskets, and carpet-bag into the boot at Coventry; we got to Hadley a few minutes past six o'clock; the boot fastens with an iron bar, which crosses and clasps on a staple under my seat - there is a key-hole in the boot; soon after six o'clock I heard a noise, turned my head, and saw the boot-door open, and the prisoner turning from behind, and running away from the coach; when I first saw him, he jumped from behind the hind-boot, and ran away; I jumped from the coach, and hallooed Stop thief! I am sure he is the man; I pursued him five or ten yards, and then saw the portmanteau drop from him - I picked it up, and ran on a little further, with it under my arm, two or three yards, and there laid this carpet-bag; there was nobody before the prisoner who could have dropped them; I continued to call Stop thief! Tearle came running behind me, with a lantern in his hand - he passed me, and pursued; I pursued a little way, and then turned back with the portmanteau and bag, as they were heavy - they were what the prosecutor had given me; I saw the same baskets next day; the prisoner was brought back - I put him on the coach, and brought him to London; I asked what he had been doing that day; he said he had been shooting over Mr. Byng's grounds; I asked where his gun or dog were, and if he had a certificate; he said, Oh! many men went shooting without a certificate - that he had left his dog with Hawkins, a small farmer, and his gun with a friend; I brought him to town, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. While you were pursuing, was there no other person before him? A. Not that I saw - if there had been, I must have seen them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Does your boot fasten by a bolt or lock? A. There are both, but it was not locked; it was not very dark - there was no moon nor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100069"/>stars visible; if a person had been far off the prisoner, I could not have seen him; I said at the office it was a man like the prisoner, in a long coat, but not that I did not know who it was; I went to Hawkins to enquire about the dog; the prisoner might be two or three yards off when the portmanteau dropped - I was almost near enough to catch hold of him - I will swear he was not ten yards from me; I saw it was a portmanteau when I came up; I turned back, and two men came up with the prisoner in less than five minutes; Hawkins is not here; the baskets were found behind a sand-heap by the road side.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. Did you find any dog at Hawkins? A. No, none had been left there; he must have dropped the portmanteau.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whatever was dropped, did you pay most attention to that or the man? A. I looked at both - I did not lose sight of the man.</p>

            . I am a schoolmaster, and live at Hadley. On the evening of the 8th of December, about six o'clock, I was crossing the road - I heard a coach coming, and hurried over to clear the fore-wheels; I afterwards found it was the Tally-ho; I first heard an expression of regret, as if a man had lost something, or somebody, and let him go; I heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran behind the coach to see what was the matter, and saw the guard pick up the portmanteau - I passed him in pursuit of a man, who I saw running as fast as he could; I stumbled against something, but did not fall; I put my lantern down, and it was the carpet bag - in doing this I lost sight of the man; I still ran on, and listened to hear if he was running along the road, but he was not - I then crossed the road, and saw Testing and a carpenter with the prisoner; Testing had hold of the prisoner - I thought him the man I had pursued; I held the light up to him, and found he was exactly the size of the man who was running before me; I had been within about two yards of him - I could look over his shoulder, and I judged him to be the man; I took hold of him, and called to the coachman to stop; I picked up this piece of a leather strap, and behind a sand-bank, about seventy yards behind where the coach stopped, I saw two baskets found, on the left side of the road - there is a ditch and a hedge between the bank and the road; the strap was opposite the sand-heap, and has a broken buckle to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far is the sand-bank from where you first saw the prisoner? A. About thirty yards - I lost sight of him just about that place; I was from two to four yards from him; I did not see him threw any thing away - It was a dark night; my eye was fixed on him; the baskets were nearly full - I could throw one of them twenty yards myself; I had my lantern, but that was not on account of the darkness of the night.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. Were you crossing the road when you ran out of the way of the coach? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an exciseman, and live at Hadley. On the 8th of December I heard a cry of Stop thief! and came to my door; I saw the coach standing at a little distance, and a light near it - I presently saw some persons running together towards me; I observed one person with a dark coat on - he crossed straight towards me, where there was a deal of mud and stuff - he seemed to me to be in the centre; some others went straight on; there was one on the left went up a lane, I opened my little gate, and saw the prisoner running, and Hickmott after him; Hickmott said, "I see nobody else on the road, and I shall stop you;" he was near my house then; I went up, and saw the prisoner in his hands; Hickmott was induced to let him go, as he said, "Yonder he goes - stop him, stop him!" there was nobody else to stop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he been crying out before that? A. Immediately he saw Hickmott close to him he called out, but not before, for he had passed me before Hickmott came up.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. From the time you came out, did you see any body running in the same direction as the prisoner? A. No; when Hickmott let him go, he ran as hard as he could for about ninety yards; I pursued; Hickmott ran and took him again; and, as we brought him back, we met Mr. Tearle with a light - I am certain he is the person Hickmott had taken before; I did not lose sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. This was a lightish night, was it not? A. Middling; I could see pretty well - if a man had been within twenty yards of me, I could have seen him; if he had thrown away the basket I should have seen him - I think there was nobody ahead of the prisoner, when he crossed towards me; there were some persons before him, and some behind when he crossed; I cannot tell how many; there might be three; I saw the prisoner come across to the dirty place, where nobody would go unless they were forced - nobody was stopped but the prisoner.</p>

I made my way towards the coach three or four road, then saw the prisoner running as hard as he could towards me, and I stopped him; Testing came up, but nobody else; directly I caught hold of the prisoner, he called out, "Stop him! Stop him! I am not the man." I let him go, and ran by the side of him; I collared him again, and he again said he was not the man; Testing came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If any body had taken you, you would have said you was not the man? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could you, looking at a man four yards from you, see him throw these baskets away? A. Yes, I should think so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I started early that morning by the coach, and had been shooting the whole day; I have been at the public-house before, and the landlord has lent me a pointer dog which he keeps.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I sold this iron to the prisoner, for 2s. 6d. and three pints of beer.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. How long is it since you have worked? A. Eight months; I have been kept by the parish, and I belong to a club - I have 3s. 6d. a-week from the parish, for my wife and two children, and 9s. a-week from the club. I found the iron in a ditch at the back of my father's garden, in Solesbridge-lane, laying there loose; I put them into a sack, and sold them to the prisoner, about a yard from where I found them; he brought the sack, and I put them in; I had found them a week before I sold them - I do not know how many there were. I found them one morning; I told nobody of it: the ditch is near a lane. I have known Bull five or six years. I was attending the Grand Jury, as I was subpoenaed, but I was not called - I did not take the subpoena; I said I did not know what it meant, and threw it out. I was at Clerkenwell - I saw Mr. Rance at Chorley-wood - I do not recollect what passed between us.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 13th of December, about eight o'clock in the morning. I was in Turnmill-street, and saw a quantity of lead - there were about three pieces in a cart, three on the pavement, and, I think, three in the prisoner's shop; I crossed over, and asked the prisoner if he had bought that lead - he said what business was it of mine - I said I was an officer, and would know - he then said he had bought it of two men; I asked if he had a bill and receipt; he went into the room, and began writing on the mantel-piece - he called me in, and said, "That is the person I bought it of, Mr. Thomas, of Walham-green - I have bought things of him before;" I said, "Where is the bill?" he then took down a file - I said they were old bills - he went out, and brought in a piece of paper - I said that would not do, I should take the lead and him too; his wife began crying, and hanging about him, and he said, "Here is a sovereign, go on;" I said, "I shall take it away," and said,"If you bought this honestly, you will go with me, and see if we can find the man;" we went to several places,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100074"/>and in St. John-street saw two men with lead in a cart - the prisoner went up to them. and said, "Do you know the man who drove the grey pony, who brought some lead to my house this morning?" they said No, and ran away; I left Cohen, pursued, and took one of them - I then went home to the prisoner, and said, "I don't think I have done right in letting you go - I must take you;" he said he hoped not, on account of the situation of his wife; I said I would take his word, and he met me at the office - he told me there, he had bought the lead in the street, for 7l., and here is a book, which he produced as his entry-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you live near him? A. Yes, and have known him all his life; his wife was pregnant - I knew him and let him go; he came to me at half-past ten o'clock in the morning, and we went to the office together; there is an officer and patrol live opposite his house; I have inquired at Walham-green, and find a man, named Cheeseman, answering the description of the man whom he said he bought it of, is out of the way.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he not say he bought it of Thomas? A. Yes, and that he had bought a still of him before; the paper he gave me says, "Thomas, bought of Cohen," which made me think it was not right; I fitted the lead - it corresponded.</p>

            . While Cohen and I were going to find the men who had sold him some lead, we saw this lead, in a cart, at Bowyer's door, in Ray-street; the prisoner and another man were unloading it; we went up to them, the prisoner ran off in one direction, and the other in another; I followed the prisoner, and in a quarter of a mile he was taken by Attwater; he said to every one he met, "It is not me, it is the man behind;" when I came up and took him, I found these pinchers in his pocket, and in the cart we found the lead, this crow-bar, and bludgeon - I compared the lead to the building - it fitted exactly, and here are marks of the pinchers on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What did you or Cohen say in the hearing of the men, before they ran away? A. Cohen asked if they knew who the man was who drove the grey pony, as he had bought part of the lead which I had stopped; this was a portion of the same lead; the tail-board was down - it was then about nine o'clock - the name of "William Brown, Fulham, Middlesex," was on the cart; the prisoner said at the watch-house, "The truth is, I owe my landlord a little money, and have got my brother-in-law's name on the cart, for fear of its being taken from me" - and that the cart had been hired of him by the other man; I went down, and got Brown up; he said he knew nothing of his name being on the cart; I found there had been a man, named Cheeseman, at Walham-green, answering Cohen's description of Thomas - he has absconded.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Thames Police. On the 12th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners turn out of Whitechapel into Petticoat-lane - one had a bag, and the other something heavy in a leather apron; I went up to Callarn, and asked what he had got; he said tools - White was close by, and he also said tools; I felt, and said, "It is lead, where did you get it?" White then said, "I am master, that is my man - it is some lead I have been working with at Mr. Duff's, at Poplar, and am taking it home;" I took them into a public-house, and then before a Magistrate; Callarn there said he worked for Mr. Fulham, at Clerkenwell, and that White was the journeyman and he labourer; White had about forty pounds of lead, and Callarn twenty-eight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. In what way were they carrying it? A. On their shoulders; White afterwards said he lived in Golden-lane, and mentioned several persons whom he knew there; he said, at the office, that he was not a master - and I did not go to Golden-lane; it is not sheet-lead, but lumps.</p>

            . I am foreman to Joseph Thomas Fulham, a smith, who lives at Clerkenwell; the prisoners were in his employ. On the 12th of December I saw this lead at the Thames Police-office, and know it by marks on it, corresponding with marks of the chisel, and with another piece, which I have brought; the prisoners wished for more lead for their work at Mr. Duff's iron-railing - I gave them 2 cwt. - it was in their care; I told Callarn to fetch it from the cellar - I think it was on the 8th; it was lead of this description.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Point out the marks? A. Here is the mark where it has been broken with a chisel - other people may use a chisel, but this fits our chisel; I know this lead from the corresponding pieces, which I produce; I know it from the chisel marks, and from its substance and quality, being the same as some left behind.</p>

I obtained the number of some of the notes at my banker's; I have since seen a 20l. note, No. 4056, and two 10l. notes - I do not know the dates of them.

            . I am a silversmith, and live at Uxbridge. This bowl of a spoon was brought to me by Cooper, on Friday evening, the 28th of December - I bought it for 1s. 5d.; I asked where he got it; I knew he lived somewhere in the town; the bowl is not worn out - it weighs about 6 dwts.; Franklin brought the other part about two hours after; I told him it looked suspicious, for I had bought the bowl, and would not buy that: I then went over to Green's, in consequence of information, and the prisoners were taken a few days after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a boy like Cooper had brought you a whole spoon, would you buy it? A. It depends on whether he told me a plausible story - he said he had found it on Brown's dung-hill; we often hear of such things; I asked where he lived, and where his father worked; I found I knew his father by sight, and believed he had found it.</p>

I crossed over, and went down a passage leading into Windmill-street; at the end I saw this boy holding the prisoner; he said, "For God's sake stop him, for he has robbed me;" and then said, "He stopped me from going after the thief."</p>

I saw McKelvin at the house as late as twelve o'clock, or between eleven and twelve - he was in the pantry with Holmes and the other man; I did not see him go out, but I saw Holmes go towards the door, and when he came back, he said he had been to let McKelvin out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What became of the man who was ill? A. He remained there - there were only those two and the servants, the cook and two housemaids; I had one glass of rum and water, and one glass of gin - no more; we dined about half-past two o'clock; I went out to a chemist's with the other man, returned about five o'clock, and in the evening we had the liquor - nothing was drank but what they brought - there might be two pints of gin and rum; I heard no appointment to meet again after that day; the meat and drink was thrown over the table-cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear Holmes tell McKelvin his master would be angry, and he must take the cloth to be washed, and bring it again? A. Not a word of the sort; I went to bed, and did not know what had happened till the next morning.</p>

            . I am a night-constable. I was at the watch-house; McKelvin was brought in, and these things found - he said the decanters were his own, and the table-cloth he was going to get washed; I asked his name - he said he would tell the Magistrate; the paper the candles are in, has "Richmond, Esq." on it.(Property produced and sworn to)</p>
               <p>HOLMES' Defence. I gave this man the cloth to get washed, and the decanters to bring some liquor in on Sunday, as my time expired on the Monday following, and I wished to pay my footing; I have lived with Mr. Alderman Wood</p>

I was sent to Faint's shop by my mother, between four and five o'clock in the evening, and as I returned I met the four prisoners coming round the corner - I said to Moore."When will you pay my mother that 3d." - he said, "You must go round to my mother;" I said, "Very well;" they then all whispered together - I saw Haines and Moore go into the shop; Haines asked for some plums, and Moore knocked the halfpenny out of his hand - it rolled towards the parlour; King and Brewer were against some rails just by - I did not wait till they came out; I heard Brewer say, before they came out, that he would snatch the plums out of Haines' hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What did Moore owe the money for? A. For his clothes; I never quarrelled with him about it.</p>

I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100083"/>after the prisoner, but did not see him again till I met him on the 22d, and took him to Lambeth-street; I said I had been waiting for him some time; he said, "I heard you wanted to see me;" he said he was innocent.</p>

I know no more about the money than you do; there were two more boys in the stable - he asked me to go into the loft - I would not, and he turned me out of the stable; he went up, and was asleep there for two hours; I waited for him in the yard all that time.</p>

On the 29th of December, I came into my room, and saw the prisoner there, about half-past six o'clock; I did not know her; I looked about, and missed my things - I asked if she took them; she said No; I asked her again - she still said No - I said if she would tell me where they were I would give her 6d.; she would not, but afterwards said she had taken them down; my little girl at last found them in the yard; I had seen them safe about two o'clock.</p>

In consequence of suspicion, I directed persons to watch the prisoner. He never gave me to understand that any annatto had been moved to his lodgings - he had no authority to remove it. I and an officer went to his house in Globe-lane, and from there to Raycroft's, and under the stairs we found a cask of annatto - it is above 2 cwt.; some of my manufacture is marked "Joseph Botcherby, extra superfine;" some only "extra superfine;" the name of Goode was never inserted on any made at my house; some of that in the cask is marked"W. and a star H., superfine;" some not marked. I had the prisoner taken - he was at work at my house at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The prisoner had been a manufacturer? A. Yes; annatto is a vegetable substance; I believe he did business for himself before he came to me; he had travelled for another manufacturer, and from that I expected some connexion; my goods were never sold in his name.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 24th of December the prosecutor applied to me - I went to his house, and found the back window open; two holes were bored through the shutter by a centre-bit. I went with Pace to the prisoner's house in Old Pye-street, which is five or six minutes' walk from the prosecutor's house - he was sitting at breakfast - it was about ten o'clock; Pace called him into the shop - I came in with them; he is a lock-smith and bell-hanger, and keeps a little shop; I turned round, and saw this violin in an old box without a lid - it was not a violin-box; I said, "Where did you get this violin?" he made no answer, but seemed very much confused; I took it out of the box, and under it found this flageolet; I said, "Martin, where did you get these things? I am quite convinced you know of the robbery, for these are the things;" he said, "They might be;" I said, "Where are the rest of the things?" he said he had got no more - I am sure he said so; I said I should search the place, and in turning round I saw a coat lay - I took it up, and said,"This comes from the robbery;" he said, "I dare say it may;" I said, "Have you any more?" and am sure he said No; we then opened the drawers in the parlour behind the shop - Pace took a blue coat out, and said, "This is one of the coats;" Martin said it was; Pace took a boy's jacket from the same drawer, and said it belonged to the robbery; he said it did; we asked if he had any thing more - he said No, it was all he had; Pace had asked him at first if he knew of a robbery in Marsham-street, but he had not time to answer before I put my hand on the violin. Pace afterwards found a small box in the bureau, with trinkets in it. As we were taking him to the office he said, "I will tell you where the two men are who I had them of; if you will go to my old house in the two-pair front room, you will find a man named Harford," and another name which I forget. We went, and found a bat in that room, but no men; but on inquiry I found one of the men lived in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Did you not go to the prisoner's house for some other person? A. I went to see for a person for whom I had a warrant; I did not know it was necessary to state that; the prisoner's windows were open, but the door shut and fastened; there was no way of going into the shop but through the parlour, the door of which is down a passage; no person could see the things without going near the box; what the prisoner said was voluntarily.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Six Bells public-house, Chelsea. On Christmasday, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in the street, lying on the curb for nearly an hour - I did not know him before; between nine and ten o'clock I saw Smith go up, and take hold of him by the collar; he asked his name; he said it was Davies, but a lad said it was Bull. Smith said,"You must go along with me;" Bull then got up, and went a few yards with him; I saw a scuffle began by Bull, who tried to pull himself away from Smith, who held him by the collar; Smith fell down, in the struggle, on his hands and knees, with great violence. Bull ran away as hard as he could. Anderson ran after him; Smith got up, and went after Anderson; in about half an hour I picked up a large key in the road, and gave it to Smith when he called next morning; Smith was intoxicated, but he was capable of walking - he staggered a little; no blows passed between them, or I must have seen them - I was within a yard of Smith - he had something in his hand, but I could not see what; he did not say "Here is a warrant," nor any thing of that kind.</p>

            . I am a veterinary surgeon, and live at Uxbridge. On the morning of the 8th of January, at three o'clock, I was near the village of Cowley, with a friend; I had been to attend a sick horse. Cowley, I believe, is about nine mile from Hanworth, but I was never there - it is between Hanworth and Uxbridge. I saw the prisoner walking in the road - he passed by me; there was a gelding about forty yards from him - it was following him - he could see us before he came up to us, for twenty yards or more - the horse was following him; I took hold of the horse, overtook the prisoner, and asked if he knew any thing of the horse; he declared he had never seen it - there was no person whatever there but him. I asked where he was going: he said he was going home to Feltham (that is about a mile from Hanworth); he was going as if to Hanworth; I shewed the same horse to Twyford and his servants - they claimed it.</p>
               <p>MR. TWYFORD. The horse the witness showed me was mine, and the halter likewise.</p>

I saw Oldfield run towards me, with the clothes in his hand - Geddes was with him; the jacket and trousers were buttoned together; they were only a few yards from the shop; Oldfield gave them to Geddes, and when they had ran further, Oldfield took them again, and put them under his coat; they offered them to me, but I would not take them; they ran down Monmouth-street, into a coach-yard; the officer came and took us all three.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GEDDES. Q. Did you not stand at the end of the street, on purpose to take them? A. No.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was in Oxford-street, about six o'clock in the evening of the 7th of January, and saw the prisoners, in company with another, who is not here; I watched them, and saw the one who is not here go on the right-hand side of the street with Ryan, and Mahoney on the left, by himself: they were following a covered cart - they walked a considerable distance, then turned back, joined together, and went to Rathbone-place, and down to Tottenham-court-road; they there divided again - Mahoney walked on the left side, Ryan and the other on the right - I followed them till they came near Whitfield's chapel, then Ryan and the other crossed, and all joined together - Ryan then left them, and went up behind Levy and Salmon's cart - the other two were walking on the pavement, six or seven steps from the cart - it was a large cart, with one horse - Ryan climbed up at the back of the cart, leaned part of his body into the cart, under the tarpauling that was over it, and brought out this box on his shoulder - he came over to the side where I was, with it on his shoulder; the others were on the other side - I took out my staff, and caught hold of him - he threw the box on my hand, and broke my hold of him - I struck at him with my staff - he ran off, and I after him, about seventy or seventy-two paces - I did not lose sight of him; I called Stop thief! seized him again, took him into a grocer's shop, and secured him - Mahoney was taken the same night, after I had been to Marlborough-street - I knew them well before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this occupy, from the time you first saw them? A. About an hour - I can safely say they were in company.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Mahoney touch the cart? A. He did not - he was on the curb - I know Birchell, an officer - I did not tell him I did not know Mahoney; I went into a public-house, with four other officers afterwards; I did not ask Mahoney his name there - he was brought down stairs at the public-house by one of the night officers.</p>

            . I was with Whittingham, and saw what he has stated. I saw Ryan take the box out of the cart; I knew the parties before; the others were on the opposite side, near the cart, and seemed to be looking out, to see if anybody was watching them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. A. PHILLIPS. Q. It was dark? A. Yes; I believe Mahoney crossed the cart, and looked in once - that was some time before the box was taken - he was about six yards from the cart then; I deal in earthenware, and live in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields.</p>
               <p>JAMES NASH. I was driving Messrs. David Levy and John Salmon's cart; they live in Oxford-street; there was a good tarpauling over the cart, and it was tied securely up - this box was near the tail - I missed it in Tottenham-court-road, where my attention was called to it - it contains raisins.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am under porter to Mr. Leslie. The property of Brownutt and Powell was in his possession for sale - it was in Mr. Brownutt's shop - the prisoners were in Leslie's employ, as porters - on the 11th of January we had been sent in to prepare the sale, but Mr. Brownutt was still in possession - it was to be sold on his premises; Mr. Brownutt suspected one of the prisoners had taken something.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWNUTT re-examined. I sent for Mayes back, took him into the counting-house, and accused him of taking property - he was searched, and the files and bolts were found on him - Kirby had been out - he was searched when he came in, but had nothing; he promised to show where he had hid some bolts and things in the snow.</p>

            . On the morning of the 29th of December, about seven o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in the Minories, with this copper on his head; I asked where he got it; he said from a street in Blackfriars'-road, from a person named Lloyd, and was taking it to Young, on Towerhill; I took him to the watch-house; he there said he brought it from his sister, who lodged at No. 2, Wild-court; I went there, and found it had been taken from there, and his sister lodged there.</p>

When I came home on the 10th of December my wife, who was ill in bed, told me the prisoner had begged to go out to buy a ribbon - she did not return: the next day I missed the articles stated in the indictment, and went to her mother, but the prisoner was not found till the 1st of January, and on the 2d her mother brought her to my house, with this shawl and bonnet, which are mine; the prisoner said she had pawned the coat at Mr. Aaron's, in Whitechapel, and wished to know if I would take her again - I inquired at the pawnbroker's, but the coat had been redeemed a night or two after it was pawned, and has not been found.</p>

On the 22d of December, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner Bullock came to me, and said he had a lot of old pipe to sell - I told him to bring it, and in about half an hour Pearce came and brought it - I thought it was not right, and I went to a fireman, and told him to look into the engine-house; he did so, and missed a roll of pipe, and a piece of brass to it - I said I had stopped Pearce on suspicion - Pearce said Bullock had employed him to sell it, and he was to have 1s. - another officer took Bullock - Bullock said he thought I bought things on the cross, and that made him bring it to me. I am a boot and shoemaker.</p>

            . I am in the service of Robert Ware, an engine-master. On Friday morning, the 21st of December, the pipes were all right in the engine-house of St. Dunstan in the West, and on the 22d, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I missed a roll of pipe - the lock of the engine-house had been forced off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PEARCE. Q. What makes you think this is the pipe you lost? A. It has five tongues to it, which no other of our pipes had, and here are thirty-five feet which is just the length of the piece lost.</p>

            . I am keeper of St. Dunstan's engine-house. The engine belongs to the parish - I believe this pipe to have been taken from there. I have seen it many times.</p>
               <p>PEARCE's Defence. I went down Petticoat-lane, to buy some old shoes, and translate them - I met a man with this piece of pipe, and another small piece - I bought this large piece of him for 10s. I went along Long-lane, the next day, where I met Bullock, who asked if I had any shoes. (I had once sold him a pair) - I said I had not; as I had bought this pipe, he said he thought he could tell me of a man who would buy it; he went to Vincent's, and came and told me he would buy it - I went there, and he was not at home - I waited for him, and when he came in, I said, "I have brought the leather the young man spoke to you about."</p>
               <p>BULLOCK's Defence. I met this young man - I asked him if he had a pair of shoes; he said No, he had laid out all his money for this pipe, and asked if I knew a man who would buy it - I said I thought I did - I went to Vincent, who said he would buy it - I told Pearce to take it, and he gave me that small piece to mend the heel of my shoe.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I passed the prosecutor's door, where I saw some prints exposed for sale - I stepped to look at them, and another woman (a stranger) did the same - one of them fell off the chair on the ground, I picked it up, and placed it on the chair, and I solemnly declare that I have no further knowledge of the charge. I unfortunately was in liquor at the time.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About eleven o'clock at night on the 18th of December the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge, at the corner of Union-street, High-street, Shadwell; he said she had robbed him of three half-crowns and half a sovereign; she said she knew nothing about it - she afterwards said, "I have three half-crowns of the man's property, and that you know, Marshall;" he said "Yes, and you have my half-sovereign as well;" they were both in liquor; a man named Harris, who is not here, said he saw her take it - she said she did not; the half-sovereign and three half-crowns were found on her by the officer; the prosecutor is gone to sea, I believe, and Harris cannot be found.</p>

On the 9th of January Mr. Salt gave me information; I knew the prisoners, and about half-past two o'clock I took Brown, going up to her own house; I followed her, and she said, "Watchman, it is all right, you shall have part - don't make a noise;" I said, "Very well, come in, and we will talk about it;" I went in, and in a corner of her shawl I found seven sovereigns, one guinea, and some memorandums; Davis was apprehended between five and six o'clock in the evening, in Cow-cross, and 3l. 16s. 6d. found on her.</p>

            . I am landlord of the King Arms. Last Tuesday I saw the prisoners and prosecutor in my tap-room; they seemed to make a great deal of the old man - there was another woman in company with them; she brought a sovereign to the bar to change; I stopped it, and said I should ascertain where it came from; she then went away - I kept the sovereign, and sent for an officer. Notcher took the ticket from Melsom's hand, and returned it to the prosecutor. The prosecutor gave no alarm, to my knowledge; they came to the house together - the other woman was with them; they were not there above half an hour; the other woman left before the officer came.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JENNINGS re-examined. I saw Melsom take the ticket and money from me, and gave an alarm directly; I sent the sovereign to the bar to change - that was before I was robbed; I then wrapped the other three in my ticket again; I then found Melsom's hand in my pocket - I am sure it was her hand; I have not got them again; I believe the prisoners were not searched - the other woman had slipped away.</p>
               <p>THOMAS OBORNE. I am an officer. The prisoners were brought to the watch-house; nothing was found on them; I asked Melsom how she came by the pension-ticket; she said it fell out of his hat.</p>
               <p>MELSOM'S Defence. The prosecutor met me, and asked me to shew him Tower-hill; he forced me into the public-house; the other prisoner came in, but I did not not know him.</p>
               <p>LARDON'S Defence. I went into this house with a woman, and fell asleep - I know nothing of it.</p>

I ran out, and saw the prisoner running, with the cheese, which he threw down, and ran off; I pursued him up two or three streets, and saw him stopped in Broad-street; I am certain of his person - I only lost sight of him in turning the corners; I was not fifteen yards off when he was stopped.</p>

On Sunday night, at half-past ten o'clock, I was going to put some more to it - I found the cupboard unlocked, the gally-pot removed, and the money gone - I have never found any of it since; I inquired who had been up stairs, and could not find that any body had, except the prisoner, who had gone up at two o'clock, to shift his shirt, but he had not asked my leave, and had no right there. I had him taken about half-past eleven o'clock that night - he said he knew nothing of it, and had no gold or any money about him - I am sure of that; he was searched in my presence, and 1l. 2s. 6d. in silver, and some halfpence were found on him.</p>
