"I have had them quite twelve months"—he did not say where he got them from—I said, "I shall arrest you on suspicion"—he said, "You have got me fair, I will give in; these are two of the boxes you are looking for, I bought them over the bar for 10s.": he did not say if the 10s. was for two boxes only, "he is short and stout, but I do not know him. I gave all the cigars away and burned all the other boxes"—I went into the kitchen, and on the chest of drawers there I found thirteen similar boxes—the prisoner said, "Now you have found them I shall make a clean breast of it"—he called to his wife, and said, "I am done; give the officer that gold watch in the cash box"—the box was in the kitchen, but the prisoner's wife had the key—she said "When I saw them searching the house I gave it to the potman to hide in the cellar"—I left the prisoner with another officer and went into the cellar where I found Cooper the potman, who took from under some straw in a dark corner of the beer cellar a gold watch, which Mrs. Edwards has identified—he handed it to me—I went upstairs to the prisoner, and he gave me from behind a box in the front bedroom the umbrella identified by Mr. Le Richau—I bad missed it when I had searched the room—he said. "That is the one you want.

I said to the prisoner, "Please, will you pay me?"—he said, "Don't be in a hurry"—he gave me this postal order. I said, "It is rather late to give me an older. I do not think I can cash it—it was about 12.45 a.m.—he said. "My brother sent it to me by the last post last night and I have no more money; you can either cash the order or have nothing"—I took it and gave him 14s. 4d. change—next morning I gave it to my cake traveller—I do not know his name.</p>

I live at 38, Spital-square, and am agent to the land-lady of 26, Gunn-street—in June last I let the top room floor to a man named John Taylor, at 5s. a week—I recognise the female prisoners as Taylor's wife and daughter—Mrs. Taylor sometimes paid the rent when I went round at 8.30 on Monday mornings—I have seen the younger woman at the door at odd times—Taylor is a different man to the prisoner Jones.</p>

I am a butcher, of 146, Franklyn Road, North—tie prisoner Bailey is a neighbour of mine—he is a barber—he said to me last October that if I wanted any linoleum he had a friend in the line, and could get it at cost price—I purchased a piece when Bailey and Putnam were in the shop—Bailey asked me about it, and I said I would have a look at it—I have seen it outside—he said the price was 18s. a piece, and I bought it for 18s., and paid Putnam for it—he gave me no receipt, I never asked for one—I bought a small piece, about 2 1/2 yards, of Bailey about January 1, for 6s., I selected it at his shop—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it has been used since—I bought twenty-two yards more at the end of January, for which I paid Bailey £2 Os. 6d. in his shop—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) looks like it—it was new, then—the police took it away—just before Bailey was arrested in February, I was passing his shop, and went in, and he asked me if I could <hi rend="italic">do with</hi> a table cloth—I said that I would take it and see whether my good lady liked it—the price was 4s. 6d. on approval—this was in the morning, and Bailey was arrested in the evening—I saw Putnam twice—he came to my shop about three weeks before he was arrested, and said that he would bring some curtains down for me to look at—he brought five single pairs, and I bought two pairs at 19s.</p>

I live at 62, Church Road, Upper Norwood, and am sub-manager of the curtain and carpet department of the Auxiliary Stores—I have seen the various articles here—they are similar to things sold in my department—I can actually identify one piece of linoleum—the stock value of inlaid linoleum is 3s. 6d. a square yard, that is what we should sell it at—it could not be sold at a profit at 1s. 6d. or 2s. a yard—it could not be produced at the price—the value of the two rugs produced is £1 and 30s.—the small Turkey rug would be a guinea—I cannot trace that any of the things have ever been sold to Chitty—as far as I know, Bailey and Putnam have never dealt at the Stores, nor Duggan—the name of any employee, if he bought goods, would appear in the books, but not the destination.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Admiral Adolphus Augustus FitzGeorge, of 12, Eaton Square—on February 18th I went to a theatre—on coming in I found this letter lying on the hall table—it was in an envelope—I opened it and read it: "A. B. Block. St. George's Union.</p>

               <p>Fulham Road, S.W.—Most noble and illustrious sir, I am sorry to inform you that your career is about to end. You had the honour of prosecuting a man of the name of Henry Saunderson, at Westminster Police Court, for obtaining 1s. by false pretences, and ho was sentenced to three months' hard labour. That young man is myself. I now intend to have revenge, and I shall lay wait for you on Sunday, as you are going to church, and I shall shoot you dead. I don't care if I hang for it. I hope you don't think I am insane, for I am not. I am doing this for myself as well as for others. I have the honour of belonging to the brothrehood of the Pierced Heart a society which takes upon itself the honour of doing away with all tyrants and aristocratic liars, and you are one of them. You would sooner let me starve in the gutter or rot in the workhouse, but "tread on the worm, he will turn "is a true proverb, as you will soon find. The motto of our brothrehood is <hi rend="italic">Sic semper tyrannus</hi>, the truest mottoe ever found in the Latin language. I may also add that our society is not known to the police, so we are not afraid of being raided. Of course, we are known in society as anarchists, which, of course, we are. That is all I have to say.—Yours truly, George Swatland, B.P.H. <hi rend="italic">Vive l'anarchy.

"Well, perhaps it is a good job you have got me, as I was going to leave the workhouse to-morrow morning, and, if I could not have got a revolver. I should have got something to knock his brains out; I have not forgotten the whipping the Admiral ordered me when I was in the Navy, and that three months did it"—he was charged—he made no reply—I searched him—I found a memorandum-book on him—I showed it to him, and he said, "That is the code of the brotherhood which I belong to—I arrested the prisoner on May 15, and he was sentenced to three months' hard labour for obtaining 1s. as charitable frauds by false pretences from the Admiral.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by Mr. Johnson, solicitor, of 18, Theobald's Road, the landlord of 5, Cromer Street, Gray's Inn Road—in June, 1902, he let it to the prisoner Allen, who gave an address, 9, Cromer Road. Holloway, and as references Mr. Linden, of 606, Seven Sisters Road, by whom he said he had been employed, and Mr. Batrisk, of 19, Ballater Road, Brixton—I wrote to Linden and received no answer—I wrote to the other man and received an answer—he was stated to be the landlord where Allen was then living—I saw Allen about Linden's reference—he said he did not understand it, but it would be all right, and that he would go and see Linden—he went away and returned the same day with a letter from Linden, which was favourable—I believe we had a wire, but I cannot find it—I wrote again asking Linden to guarantee the rent, but got no answer—I let the house, and produce the counterpart lease signed by Allen, which he acknowledged in my presence—the term is twenty-one years terminable at seven or fourteen years Allen took possession the same day, July 14th—the rent was £65 for the first five years, £70 for the next five years, and £75 for the remainder of the term—I got no rent—I applied several times—Allen took possession on July 1st £10 16s. 8d. was due to September 29th—I could not find Allen—I distrained and put in a broker on October 8th—the distress realised £4 12s. 6d.—subsequently I got the remainder, and the lease was assigned to the man to whom Allen sold the business, who paid the Christmas rent, and as far as we know is still going on with the business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, of 606. Seven Sisters Road—up to September, 1902. I was employed by Irvine Brothers, provision merchants—I first became acquainted with Ferguson in September or October last at the Grocers' Exhibition at the Agricultural Hall—when I was in charge of Irvine Brothers stall, Ferguson as Woodvilie inquired the prices of lard and provisions—eventually I sold him twenty-five</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190303090037"/>
               <p>pails of lard and one cask of butter—I sent the order to the firm in Tooley Street, and it was executed—I subsequently left Irvine's employment and entered that of Woodville at 23, Short Street, Spitalfields, as clerk and buyer at 50s. a week, which was about the same position as I had at Irvine's—Woodville gave me cheques in blank on banks, one of which was Lloyds Bank at Hammersmith—these were signed "Kate Alberta May"—I filled in the amounts as I bought the goods—I saw the lady many a time—another bank was the Provincial Bank, Holloway Road, in the name of George Woodville—the name at 606, Seven Sisters Road was changed from George Woodville to "The British Food Supply Asso<lb/>ciation"—I bought bacon of William Thorn, of Smithfield, on Wood<lb/>ville's instructions—I gave him this cheque that I had from Woodville for £10 1s. 10d., signed "Kate Alberta May," of November 18th, and made payable to William Thorn, provision merchant, Smithfield Market—in Short Street there was a small shop and a warehouse—the body of the cheque is my writing—the bacon was delivered to the Seven Sisters <hi rend="italic">Road</hi> by carrier—I drove the van to Paterson's Hotel about the middle of November with bacon and cheese in it, which came from Messrs. Thorn—we had two dealings with Thorn—the first was five sides of bacon, delivered at Seven Sisters Road, and the next five sides of bacon and three cheeses, which I took to Paterson's Hotel, Carthusian Street, E.C.—I paid by cheque—I saw Woodville, who is Ferguson, and Hill, who is Allen—I understood he was trading as Allen and Co.—one of them, I think it was Woodville, both being present, told me to load up three sides of bacon on to the Seven Sisters Road van and the two cheeses—the remainder of the bacon was left in Allen's van—Allen and Ferguson got up and drove away with it—this cheque, in favour of Thorn, of November 15th, for £10 1s. 10d., was for the five sides of bacon and two cheeses—I went to Charterhouse Street to Wolf, Sayer, and Feller's about the end of November by Ferguson's directions, where Allen was present with Allen's van, and loaded up with two half-tierces, and a tierce of sausage skins—I think the order was worth about £20—they were unloaded again, and I drove the empty van back to Paterson's Hotel, where I saw Ferguson and Allen—I told them that the manager had said that they had made inquiries of Woodville which were not satisfactory, and that he would like me to unload the van, and that I had said, "Yes, certainly"—both Allen and Ferguson were very <hi rend="italic">wild</hi>, and said I was a fool—they got in the van and I drove away—I left that day or the day after—I have something due to me now from Ferguson—I was not in Allen's employment—from what I saw I thought it was best to get away—my leaving was a sort of mutual thing—about November 22nd or 23rd I went to the firm of Jacob Jones, at Clapton, with Allen, on Ferguson's instructions, to buy goods for the British Food Supply Association—I went on to the wharf, but did not get any goods—I went back to Allen—I told him I had been to see the manager or the foreman and told him that I came from the British Food Supply Association, but directly I gave the address, 606, Seven Sisters Road, he said, "No, thank you. We have had enough of them," and that he asked me if I knew Linden, and</p>

               <p>that I said I did not, that I had nothing to do with it. I had simply lent my van—I saw Schirmer at 23, Short Street—he did the correspondence, in German, I believe—there was a good bit of Correspondence in fits and starts—I told Ferguson the result of my visit, and we drove to the Three Brewers public-house in the New North Road—Ferguson said, "Linden used to keep the shop but I believe he is at Southend now; I do not know where he is"—Linden, I know now, used to be in Whitechapel Street and at Seven Sisters Road—I met Schirmer once or twice in Smithfield—I am not now in employment, I shall be after this week—I went with Schirmer into a public house in Carthusian Street the last Saturday in November—I saw Ferguson and several other gentlemen—I was living at Seven Sisters Road over the shop with my wife, where I am still living as a lodger—Schirmer said, "You had better clear out of Seven Sisters Road this afternoon"—I asked him why—he said, "You take my advice and go, even if it is with a wheelbarrow, because they are going to shift from there the first thing Monday morning—I said, "I can protect myself; I am not going to shift out: I am not going to be put to any inconvenience"—they went away early on Monday morning—Harry Medwin, whom I thought was Ferguson's brother-in-law, Mr. Glassy, Ferguson's manager, and Schirmer were there all Sunday packing—I went to the Police on Saturday night and asked for protection for my furniture—I received this letter in Schirmer's writing in the first week in December that he was taken with his van to the Police station at King's Cross for being in possession of a stolen van and goods and remanded—when Schirmer went away with the stock of the shop in the van, he was stopped by the Police—I replied that I was awfully upset, and that I would see him on Sunday—I also received Schirmer's letter of December 6th from Brixton Prison, asking for the addresses of Godwin, Glassy, and May, whom he wanted as witnesses—I wrote to Godwin and May, but got no answer—May, I thought, was Ferguson's wife, and Godwin Mrs. May's father—when the shop was in the name of Woodville, Ferguson resided there with Mrs. May—I was introduced to her as his wife—Godwin lived at Kensing<lb/>ton, and visited them occasionally—I saw Schirmer outside the Court after the hearing, when he was discharged—that was about a fortnight or three weeks before Christmas—he said, "Don't stop talking here, come up the road"—when I went with him up the road he said that he had had enough of Ferguson: he could not stop, and I invited him to dinner the following Sunday—he said he did not want to see any of them outside the Court, and that he was going to a solicitor at King's Cross, and then he said he was going to Germany.</p>

Mann, Crossman, and Paulin, brewers—it is split up into money received and property not converted into money—on the next page there is an item of £700, and there is a note in the margin, "Leasehold estate as follows: Premises at No. 4, Moor Lane, in the City of London, held for a term of 61 years from September 29th, 1831, at the apportioned ground rent of £2 8s. per annum"—the price paid by deceased for this in 1871 was £232, trade, plant, and utensils, goodwill of business; there is a note annexed marked A.

I went out of the house, and the prisoner put in a man named Green—Lillyman was alive in 1887 when I left the house—Green was there for a few months then a Mr. Harper came—I did not get any of the purchase money that he paid—I had nothing to do with it—while I was in the house I paid the ground rent and rates and taxes—on Mrs. Jordan's death I was informed that the brewers were prepared to pay £700 for the house—the £700 which I was to pay I fixed with Mr. Lillyman.</p>

Kingston Hill—Jane Mary Cook was admitted to that school on May 29th. 1889—she left on October 6th. 1897—our school is really the National Society for the Protection of Young Girls, but we took the name of the Princess Louise in 1893—it is for the reception of girls who have nobody to look after them—it is not free—this girl was paid for at the rate of £10 a year by Mr. George Lillyman Fowler—the total amount contributed to her maintenance there by him was £83 10s. 8d.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We had a. letter about the girl, saying that her mother was dead, and that her father neglected her—the matter of her pocket money did not pass through my hands, except once, when I had a letter from Mr. Fowler sending me £10 for maintenance and 5s. for pocket money—the girls generally write once a quarter—the matron reads all correspondence—I never saw the prisoner at the home.</p>

I went to Eastbourne as a servant—I stayed there four months—while there I had 4s. one Sunday from the prisoner—when I left Eastbourne I went to live with him for about three months, when he provided me with a dress, a bat, a jacket, and an umbrella—they would cost about £3—about May. 1898, I went to service at Cricklewbod, and have remained at the same address ever since—since then I have received various sums, amounting to about £6, from the prisoner—he also paid £4 14s. for ray lodging with a Mrs. Plum—I authorised Mr. Hayes Jones to bring an action against the prisoner—that was before I was twenty-one, and when Mr.' Blaber took over the proceedings I authorised him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I instructed them to get some money for me and have an account rendered—I do not think I have had more money than I have stated—the prisoner took me out as anybody else might, but he never sug<lb/>gested that the expense of that came out of ray estate—I was constantly writing to him saying how happy I was in my place, and how good he was to me—before these matters were suggested to me there was nothing in ray mind to make me think that I had not been treated well—I remember being unwell whilst at Cricklewood, and a doctor was called in—the prisoner paid for that, but when I sent him the doctor's account he wrote several letters, saying that he thought the price was exorbitant—the charge was £3 3s.—I think there was only one doctor's bill—I should not remember every item sent to me—I never made any complaint about my money or clothes or anything else.</p>

                  </hi> I am chief clerk at Messrs. Mann. Crossman, and Paulin, brewers, Mile End—I have here their ledgers containing the accounts of the executors of Jane Jordan—we used to receive deposits from our customers and we used to pay five per cent, to the depositors—Jane Jordan, of 4. Moor Lane was a depositor, and after her death the account was continued in the name of her executors—this account shows all the payments in and out of that account—the depositors had a deposit book which was a copy of the ledger account—when a payment was made in or out the book was always produced—the executors at first were the prisoner and Lillyman—a certificate of Lilly-man's death was sent to us which showed that he died on February 20th, 1895. and after that date the account was in the prisoner's name only, as the remaining execu<lb/>tor—the deposit book was sent to us from time to time—the prisoner would write for a cheque and we would draw one on the firm's account—the last cheque was drawn on April 14th, 1899, when the account was closed by drawing out the whole of the balance—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is one of the cheques we sent to the prisoner at his request—it is dated October 28th, 1896. on the London and Westminster Bank, for £418 19s. 8d.—it was crossed and endorsed—it has gone through the bank and been paid—this is a letter from the firm signed by me, to Mrs. Jordan, care of G. L. Fowler, dated September 29th, 1897 (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "We beg to enclose cheque for £40 17s. 10d., interest upon deposit account; we also enclose book at the same time.'"—that cheque was paid by our firm and passed through the bank in the usual way—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is dated December 9th, 1897, for £200. payable to G. L. Fowler or order, and endorsed by him—the next payment, for which we have not kept the cheque, is for £24.3s. 4d., referred to in this letter from us to the prisoner, dated March 20th. 1898, and also returning the deposit book—tin's (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a cheque dated January 16th. 1899, payable to the prisoner or order, for £613.1s. 9d. endorsed G.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The balance with us in 1879 was £1.000—on March 5th, 1879. we paid to the executors, £308 12s. 9d.—the interest drawn by them on October 25th, 1879, was £.34 2s.3d.,—on Nov.3rd. 1885, £234 was paid into the account—I cannot say now by whom it was paid, but I presume by the executors—on September 30th, 1880, £30 was paid in by them, and On March 28th 1888, another £30—on March 20th, 1889, there was a payment in of £30 6s. 6d., and on April 17th, 1889. £46 16s.—altogether that is £371 2s. 6d. which would be earning compound interest up to March. 1898. at five per cent., and afterwards at 4 percent—assuming that in January 1879. there was £960 in the account, and the whole of the interest which was to be paid to the children was paid by the</p>

I am an accountant at the London City and Midland Bank—I know the prisoner as Lue Pitcher—he opened an account with us in that name on November 2nd, 1896—I have an examined copy of that account here—it was closed on May 22nd, 1902, by transferring the credit balance of £240 11s. 10d. to the account of L. M. L. Pitcher, who is a married daughter of Pitcher—the prisoner also had power to draw on that new account—in the course of Lue Pitcher's account, the items shown in this extract from the waste book of the bank were paid in—the £420 which opened that account included Mann, Cross man's cheque for £418 19s. 8d.—on October 1st there is an item called sundries, and in the total of £59 4s. 4d. there was a cheque for £49 17s. 10d. paid in—on December 10th there is a total payment in of £215 18s., under the heading of sundries, which includes Mann. Grossman's cheque for £200—on March 28th, 1898. a credit item under sundries of £29 3s. 4d. was paid in, which included Mann, Grossman's cheque for £24 3s. 4d.—on January 17th, 1899, there is a credit entry under sundries. £619 4s. 3d., which includes Mann, Grossman's cheque for £613 1s. 9d.—on April 14th, 1899, there is a credit entry for £211, which is a Mann, Crossman cheque—the prisoner also had a deposit account with our bank, of which I produce a correct copy—the first entry is November 2nd, 1896, and the last, July 31st. 1897—the whole of that was eventually absorbed in the current account, including the interest upon the deposits—the hand-writing on the back of these six cheques, as far as I can judge, is in the prisoner's writing—I believe the signature on this affidavit leading to probate is in the same writing, as well as the signature on this residuary account.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have not allowed the prisoner for sums of which we did not know—I have based my account entirely upon Mann, Crossman's account—where sums paid for the maintenance and education of the chil<lb/>dren are in excess of the sums claimed by the prisoner I have given him the benefit—if the original sum in Mann, Crossman's was only £960, and if Mary Cook had all the interest on it at the time of her death, there would be only the £960 left—I think the £1,000 has grown by repayments back to £1,201 16s.—the total payments shown on the account rendered to Mr. Jones come to £1.889 6s. 3d., including the £700 which was the principal for the lease, but which was never paid—the payments claimed by the prisoner do not come to the full amount shown by the residuary account without any interest at all—all the interest on the money in Mann Crossman was drawn out, but the prisoner repaid £371 2s. 6d.—he has not been charged a second time with that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If £371 ran on at compound interest it would not dis<lb/>charge the prisoner of the balance; it might double itself but it would leave a balance of about £800 unaccounted for.</p>

Denham and Goyder till June last—the prisoner was an assistant at the time—soon after Christmas, in cones<lb/>quence of what I was told, I got into communication with the prisoner Bell—Bell, who had been in the employ of the firm, told me his address—the prisoner came to see me at my house—we had several conversations—he told me at one of our interviews that he had seen Bell and could get hold of a lot of cheap stuff at about a third of its value—I suggested to him that we should start a little business in the country, and he agreed with me—on another occasion, when he came to see me he said he had seen Bell and he could get hold of a lot of goods that Bell had got from Edmonds Bros., of Wood Green, for a third of their value—I said. "I should get them, then"—I immediately afterwards communicated with my firm—the following week I saw the prisoner again—I was acting under the directions of the Company then; they provided me with money—when I saw the prisoner he told me he was going to meet Bell at Broad Street Station—he had then a parcel of dress boards—the prisoner gave me a list of the goods he could get from Bell—as soon as he left me I went to Kentish Town Police Station—with a detective I went to Broad Street Station, but we did not see either Bell or the prisoner—on February 1st the prisoner came to me he said he had seen Bell, and he could get the goods for £4 0s. 1d.: I agreed to that—on February 3rd he came to my house and brought some of the goods—I identified the goods as those now in Court.</p>

I shall plead guilty"—he was formally charged and said, "I did not steal it, I know; I received it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am sub postmaster, and live at the Bostall Hill Post Office—on the evening of February 20th I left the post office perfectly secure, holding my light up to see that the back window and door were fastened—I was roused a little before 2 a.m., and came into the post office—I found White behind the counter, which had been forced open, and there was a mark which, with the inspector, I afterwards compared with this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—I counted stamps found on the floor amounting to 16s. 8d. and afterwards found the date stamp, which I remember putting away—the putty of the kitchen window had been cut out and a pane of glass removed, which was standing against the wall—I found the back door unbolted—I opened it to let the Policeman in—looking through the front door one could see it.</p>

"You stopped me at Welling, and asked me for a ride, and I told you I had a load—Welling is twenty minutes' walk from Bostall Post Office—McPherson's trousers were torn, he was wearing no hat, but had a handkerchief tied round his head—I said, "Where is your hat?"—he replied. "I sold it on the road for 6 1/2 d."—he showed me 6 1/2 d. in bronze—I said, "You resemble a man who is wanted with another, for burglary at Bostall Hill'—he answers to the rough description I had—I took him to the station—Jennings and Bennett identified him.</p>

High Street, Hastings, and carrying on the business of a chemist there—I have now retired—I was at Hastings for about eighteen years, and while there I used frequently to go to a barber's shop to get shaved—the prisoner was employed there, and he shaved me on many occasions—one day he bought several things from me, and asked me to let him have a particular poison—he came to my shop and purchased one ounce of tartar emetic—we have to keep a copy of the sale of poisons—this is my poison register book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—there is an entry here of the tartar emetic sold to the prisoner: it is "April 3rd 1897, name of purchaser, Mr. G. Chapman. I ounce of tartar emetic."—that is in my writing—then there is "purpose for which it is required," but I cannot make out what is written here, it is in the prisoner's writing—it looks like "take" or "teke"—he wrote that in my presence after he signed G. Chapman—I knew him as Chapman—I do not recollect his Christian name—I gave him the ounce of tartar emetic—it was in a white powder—this label is in my writing—it is the one I put on the bottle containing the tartar emetic (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—"W. H. Davidson, dispensing chemist. Poison, tartar emetic. Dose:,', grain to grain: to be used with caution. 66, High Street.

               <p>me, and when we got into the room he took hold of Maud's pulse—he did not say anything—I asked Maud what she thought was the matter with her—she said she did not know—she had pains in her stomach, diarrhoea, and vomiting—I stayed in the room about three hours—she often showed signs of thirst—the prisoner gave her some water—he came up and down-stairs every few minutes the whole of the time that I was there—when she asked for water the prisoner went out of the room to get it—he was not absent long—I did not know where anything was kept—when he gave her the drink she vomited it nearly every time—I did not notice the colour of the vomit, but I noticed that the water was discoloured and not clear—I saw the prisoner as I was going away—nothing passed between us—on Tuesday, October 21st, about 9 a.m., I made a communication to Dr. Grapel—he was our family doctor at Croydon—about 6 or 7 p.m. the same day I went to the Crown and saw the prisoner—I did not know if Dr. Grapel had been by then, but the prisoner told me that the doctor had been—I asked how Maud was; he said she was very bad—I went upstairs with him—I thought Maud was better—I went up to the room twice—I remained there a little time—I went down again and saw the prisoner in the bar—I said, "Maudie is very bad is not she, George?"—he said. "es'"—he did not say any more—I went upstairs again with him—I said to him. "I think my daughter will pull through now, George"—he said, "She will never get up no more"—I said, "Have you seen anyone else like it?"—he said, "Yes"'—J said. "Was your other wife like it?"—he said, "Just about in the same way"—he told me that Dr. Grapel had been—he said that he had already got one doctor in attendance and he did not know what we wanted another for; we did not want fifty—I told him it was no good to make a fuss about the doctor as I had sent him up—before I had gone downstairs I thought Maud seemed better, I was quite pleased at the way she spoke to me—that was the last time I saw her alive—next day about 4 p.m. I had a telegram announcing her death—I showed it to Dr. Grapel about 5 o'clock.</p>

"Yes," quite readily, and he had no hesitation in saying about his other wife. "Just the same way"—when the prisoner went out of the room to get anything he did not appear to be gone any longer than Toon was when she went to get anything—I suspected the prisoner on the 18th. that is why I told Dr. Grapel to go—I did not like him getting the water, and giving everything to her himself—I did not offer to do it—the woman was there to do it, but he would not let her—I did not do it because I did not know where the things were—I did not see him mix anything—I never saw Toon fetch anything; she was not always in the room when I was there—I do not know whom the brandy came from or where it was kept—when I Kepi the house for him the brandy was</p>

I practice at 303, London Road, West Croydon, and have been the medical attendant to the Marsh family for some time—on Tuesday, October 21st, Mr. Marsh called on me, and in consequence of what he said I went about 3 or 4 p.m. to the Crown—I saw the prisoner and told him that I was a medical man from Croydon, and had come to see Dr. Stoker in consultation about his wife—he gave me the idea that he had never heard about it, so I asked him if it was the Crown, as I thought I had come to the wrong place—he said there was a doctor already in attendance, and something about fifty others—I could not distinguish exactly what he did say—I asked to see Mrs. Marsh—I sat in the bar and then saw Dr. Stoker, and together we examined the deceased—her skin was sallow, jaundiced, and muddy in appearance, her tongue coated, her pulse fairly quick, her breathing shallow—she was in a semi<lb/>comatose condition—I examined her stomach—it was extremely tender to the touch—when I touched it she groaned and retched—I had a consultation with Dr. Stoker downstairs and then saw Mrs. Marsh—before leaving the house I asked for and was shown some of the vomit—it was green—Dr. Stoker and I were of the opinion that she was suffering from some acute irritant poison, probably ptomaine—later on the suspicion</p>

               <p>Sunday—she was very much better—I changed the medicine and gave her bismuth, morphia, and ipecacuanha, that was for the soothing of the stomach—I saw her again on the 13th, she was then as bad as ever—she had diarrhoea and vomiting, I saw them both, they were mixed together—it was an ordinary yellow brown mixture—I saw her again on the 14th, she was no better—about the fifth day I noticed she had spasms—they came on with great pain in the stomach, she got rigidity of the muscles of the leg, they passed off in about half a minute—they did not synchronize with the sickness—they came on independently—on one occasion she had two in about five minutes—I could not then form an opinion as to what caused them—I saw her again on the 15th, she was no better—I asked the prisoner if she was having the milk diet, and he lead me to believe she was having all I ordered—there was no one else to ask—I was not there when anything was administered—she was very much worse on the 15th, and on that day I stopped all food through the mouth except the bismuth powders—she could not even keep the medicine down—I ordered her to be fed by injections through the rectum—she was to have egg, milk and beef tea as a mixture—I could not then form any opinion as to what she was suffering from—I thought the symp<lb/>toms might be those of gastro-enteritis, which is inflammation of the stomach and the bowels—at that time I had not the slightest suspicion of any foul play—I suggested to the prisoner that she should be taken to the hospital, but the deceased objected and began to cry—I then suggested a nurse, but the next day, finding there was still not one there, I spoke to the prisoner about it—he said he had tried to get one and that she would come in the following day—on this day I found that the deceased could not retain the bismuth powders—they were to allay the irritation of the mucous membranes of the stomach—I stopped them and advised her to be fed entirely with the injection—I got beef tea suppositories and told the prisoner to give her everything iced—I do not know whether up to that time she had had any injections—on Friday I saw the nurse, Toon, for the first time—I gave her directions about the food and injections—I did not know if she knew anything about giving injections—the prisoner was there when I gave Toon the instructions—I thought Toon—was carrying out my directions—I called again on Saturday, the 18th—I found the deceased very bad, vomiting and diarrhoea—I saw the vomit, it was slimy and green, the green would be due to the irritation of the stomach and gut—I do not think I visited her on the Sunday, I know I missed one day, I think it was the Sunday—the next time that I saw her after the Saturday I found her much weaker and with the same symptoms—I asked the nurse about the injections—she told me she did not even retain these—I told her she ought to reduce them to half the quantity to try if she could retain any liquid—the prisoner was there when I said that—I had no idea that it was the prisoner who was giving the injections—I remember seeing Mrs. Marsh on Tuesday, the 21st—I had some conversation with her, and later that same day I was sent for to meet Dr. Grapel—the prisoner was not present—the deceased was very weak and semi-unconscious—I had some conversation with</p>

Inspector Godley saw me and in consequence I subjected another portion of the contents of the stomach to Marsh's test, which is also a test for arsenic and antimony—I discovered both present by that test, and also found that there was far more antimony present than arsenic—I did not open the second jar—I replaced the stomach in the first one, and a part of it which I had used in my tests I placed in a perfectly clean glass-stoppered bottle, and on October 28th I handed all three jars to the Coroner's officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 31, Gaywood Street, and am Coroner's Officer for Southwark—on October 25th I got some informa<lb/>tion and went to the Police station, and an inquest was opened on the body of Maud Marsh on the 28th—that evening by the Coroner's order I went to Mr. Bodmer and received from him three jars—I took them to my house and kept them there till October 30th, when I gave them in the same state to Dr. Stevenson.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am one of the official analysts to the Home Office, and also Lecturer on Forensic Medicine at Guy's Hospital—I have had experience, in analysis, particularly with reference to poisons, and have acted for the Home Office for thirty-one years—on October 30th I attended St. George's Mortuary to make a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the body of Maud Marsh—Dr. Freyberger, Dr. Stoker, and Dr. Cotter were there—there had been a previous <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>—the body had been dead fully eight days, but there was not much decomposition, much less than I should expect in a body so long dead, considering the time and season—the scalp covering the skull was dry; that indicated that there was little fluid in the tissues—the skull and brain were normal—there was no hemorrhage or disease in the brain—the spinal cord was normal and no sign of disease there—the tongue was yellow, coated, and swollen—the air passages to the lungs were quite clear, and the lungs free from disease—there was a good deal of fat about the heart, but that would not have affected her health much, unless it had gone much further—it had invaded the muscles to the extent of about one-third—the mesenteric glands were much swollen—the stomach had been taken away, but it was given to me by the coroner's officer before the end of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>—the blood vessels of the bowels were unusually red and injected with blood, but not to iv very marked extent—the mucous membrane of the bowels was swollen and slimy, and was in the condition which we generally know as sub-acute enteritis, which is inflammation of the membrane lining the bowels—there was a good deal of liquid in the bowels, but only a little semi-solid faecal matter, which was about the sigmoid flexure of the colon—one of the glands showed that she had probably been a person subjected to habitual constipation—the whole of the rectum had been removed—I found no ulceration of the bowels—I examined the pancreas, the spleen, and the kidneys they were all sound and healthy—the liver had been</p>

               <p>detached, but it was in the abdomen—a small portion had been removed—it was rather dry and greasy, but there was no condition which would affect her health ma terially—I examined the womb and ovaries—they were perfectly normal—she had never apparently borne a child, nor was there any signs that she had been far advanced in pregnancy—menstruation was just upon ceasing—I found no evidence of any natural disease which would account for her death—I suspected that she had died from some form of irritant poison, which had set up enteritis—I had heard of the question of arsenical poisoning, but I came to the conclusion on making the examination that it was not arsenic but some other metallic poison—I then removed the brain, some blood from the cavity of the chest, the spleen, the gall bladder, which was full of bile, the liver, the kidneys, the contents of the bowels, the bowels themselves, and also some blood from the ab<lb/>dominal cavity—they were all rather light in weight—the drain on the fluid caused by the vomiting would account for that in a great measure—on the 31st I examined the stomach from the jar—there were signs of putrefaction externally and internally it was pink and injected with blood—the blood vessels were prominent and redder than usual—internally it was coated with a good deal of yellow slimy mucus, which became an orange colour at the bowel end—I did not find any ulcers or loss of sub<lb/>stance—I examined the contents in the stomach and portion of the liver and rectum in the jars—I made an analysis of various parts of the body—every portion of the body which I examined had antimony in it—I found antimony in the stomach and its contents, in the bowels, and their contents, in the liver, bile, spleen, kidneys, the fluid which I took from the abdominal cavity, in the blood from the cavity of the chest, and in the brain—I made tests for arsenical poison—I found traces of arsenic in a small quantity, and I formed the opinion that death had not resulted from it—arsenic is sometimes found in antimony when it is impure—I came to the conclusion that death was caused by poisoning with antimony in a soluble form—that was tartar emetic or metallic antimony—that is one of the scheduled poisons—I did not find any bismuth there, but the tests for bismuth are not so complete—if there was any it must have been infinitesimal—I have never heard in late years of a case where bismuth has caused such symptoms as these, or caused death—bismuth is now purified from arsenic and other impurities—five grains is an ordinary dose—in the cases I have heard of where death was caused by bismuth I think that 120 grains must have been taken—I found no trace of impure bismuth in this case—I found 0.23 grains of metallic antimony in the con<lb/>tents of the stomach, 5.99 grains in the contents of the bowels—that indicated to me that there must have been a large dose of antimony given within a few hours of death, as it is soluble in water—it had not been got rid of by purging or vomiting—in the liver I found 0.71 grains of metallic antimony, in the kidneys 0.14 grain, in the brain 0.17 grain, in all 7.24 grains, which is 7 1/4, the bulk of which was in the bowel—I deduct from that that there was a good deal more antimony in the body—antimony can be made soluble in the form of tartar emetic or emetic tartar, which is a white powder, soluable in water—it does not change the appearance of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190303090108"/>
               <p>the water emetic tartar is not altogether antimony—724 grains of metallic antimony would represent 2012 grains of tartar emetic—the proportion is roughly 3 to I—I did not calculate the amount of tartar emetic in the whole body, but from my experience I should put it at between 25 and 30 grains—when tartar emetic or antimony is administered as a rule the greater part of it is very quickly ejected—purging relieves it—the effect of the poison itself generally takes a very considerable time before it causes death—death has occurred in many cases where it is given in repeated moderate doses—vomiting and purging makes people waste away—it produces gastro-enteritis and they also appear to die from failure of the heart—antimony depresses the circulation—it quickens the pulse, but gives it a very feeble power—two grains of tartar emetic has killed, but that is not ordinary—I should put the ordinary fatal dose at probably 15 grains—others put it at 10—even that might not be fatal if the greater portion of it is vomited—people have taken cream of tartar in much larger quantities and have recovered where it has been quickly vomited—I am of opinion if two or three grains were given repeatedly to a healthy person that it would eventually cause death—when doses of antimony are given from time to time the symptoms are great depression, profuse perspiration, followed by nausea and vomiting—purging is set up with pain in the abdomen, and usually after a time there is a burning or metallic sensation in the throat and stomach—there is a great thirst—spasms are quite common, and patients fall sometimes into a comatose or semi<lb/>comatose state—they are generally very pallid, and sometimes they get quite jaundiced, and dark under the eyes, and thin and worn—it is some<lb/>times the appearance, apart from other symptoms, which, indicates that the patient is approaching death—in the case of Mr. Braywood it was his appearance which excited the suspicion that he would die—Sir William (full and others who saw him, although he was apparently going on well, thought afterwards he could not get on so well—that was a case of poisoning by tartar emetic—if tartar emetic is taken in a strong solution it has a somewhat metallic but sweetish taste, but when taken diluted it does not have much taste—it can be covered up by food or medicine—people take antimony wine, which is sherry with antimony in it, and yet not know that anything is wrong—if doses had been going on for some time so as to set up irritation of the mucous membrane, that would set up the burning feeling in the throat—antimony can be dissolved and given by injections, or put into injections—that would be very dangerous; it would be quickly absorbed into the rectum and then into the body—the vomit in a case of poison by antimonial would be at first the contents of the stomach and then it would become green or yellow—I got a great number of bottles from Sergeant Kemp—I examined them—there was antimony or arsenic in one of them—some of them had contained photographic chemicals—I examined the bismuth powders found in the room, proved to have come from Dr. Stoker—they were free from antimony and arsenic—I also examined the bismuth from Dr. Stoker's surgery—it was pure and a very good specimen—these two bottles which contained medicine had no trace of antimony or arsenic—this other one had two or three drops at the</p>

               <p>bottom of it—I do not know ii it kid been washed out—I found bismuth and antimony in it—I should say there was quite as much antimony as bismuth in it—there was enough antimony to give several full doses—emetic tartar can be dissolved in water so as not to be apparent, and then could be mixed with a bismuth preparation—tartar emetic is also soluble in brandy—brandy of ordinary strength will take up about two grains to the ounce—a tablespoonful of such medicine would be a full emetic dose—it is much more soluble in brandy and water than in plain brandy—these two bottles contain brandy and water, two parts water to one part brandy—there is tartar emetic in one of them—this one, which contains about an ounce, is probably a fatal dose—I could find nothing to account for death except poison by antimony—antimony might be given to produce perspiration and for bad colds, but only from one-twenty-fourth to one twenty-sixth of a grain to a dose—half a grain to a grain would be an emetic—death would not ensue from one dose of that strength or cause great pain—if vomited, it would not produce diarrhoea—all the signs I found at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> would not be caused by such doses as that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was not enough antimony left in this bottle for a fatal dose—if the bottle had been full of the same preparation of bismuth, antimony, and water, I think there would have been sufficient for a fatal dose, but I am not positive—it contained six doses—each dose of itself would not be a fatal one, but I cannot say what would be the effect of six successive doses—I should expect a person to be very ill after taking them—I examined the syringes—one of them is covered with an insoluble preparation of antimony, which is used in its manufacture—apart from that, I do not find any trace of antimony on either of them—I heard that they were used for the injecting of liquid beef tea, but also that they were soaked and washed afterwards—the immediate cause of death was acute sub-gastritis—I have had to do with a good many cases, but I never saw such extensive gastro-enteritis from ptomaine poisoning—it generally produces more inflammation of the bowels than of the stomach—in this case the stomach was worse than the bowels—persons who have died from ptomaine poisoning suffer from sub-acute enteritis—it is a question of degree—the fat which I noticed round the heart might point to old alcoholism, but fatty degeneration of the heart is well known in poisoning—the deceased was a very young woman to have had a fatty heart from alcoholism—tartar emetic is sometimes used as a check to drinking propensities—it nauseates the patient so that they cannot indulge in drink for the time being—in former times bismuth contained impurities which, apart from the bismuth itself, gave rise to arsenical poisoning; but at the present day bismuth is cleansed from those impurities, and is not itself poisonous—there have been cases on record of bismuth poisoning where the dose was only two drachms—I have edited Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence—a metallic taste, vomiting,</p>

               <p>and purging, spasms in the arms and legs, which occurred in a, case of bismuth poisoning would coinside with a case of poisoning by antimony; but in a paragraph in my edition of Taylor, I think that that is explained—my reason for saying that I did not attribute the poisoning to arsenic was because the quantity of arsenic was very small, and it was present only in the contents of the stomach and bowel, and in the liver, but I could not detect any in the more remote organs, and if a person died from arsenical poisoning I should expect to find arsenic generally distri<lb/>buted through the body—there was not sufficient antimony to make me attach any importance to it—I ascertain its presence in various ways—the colour of the copper foil in Reinche's test is very significant—arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and mercury give very much the same colour, but none of them give the particular effect of antimony, so far as I know, and, of course, one does not rely on that one simple test alone—my tests are absolute, and not only probable—I discovered some orange sulphide, which was soluble in hydro-chloride acid, and separating it and treating it by Marsh's process, it was proved over and over again beyond all doubt to be antimony—that colour is not common to other mineral or vegetable poisons—putrifaction had only just commenced on the body of the deceased at the time of her death—there was only one day when the temperature rose above 50 degrees—I keep a record—I was engaged in the Bravo case, which was a case of poisoning by tartar emetic—I did not see the vomit in that case, but probably it contained blood—the purge contained blood, but it is not invariably present in the vomit and purge in cases of antimonial poisoning—I have not personally had a case where a person who died of antimonial poisoning vomited or purged blood—Bravo passed blood the same night that he had the antimony—I was at the inquest in that case—there are cases where there has been no vomiting of blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The question of blood in the stool would be according to the amount of the irritation, and in the faeces the blood might not appear as blood, but as a black stuff—to an unskilled person it might not appear to be blood—if the motion was black it would probably indicate that there was blood—if I as a medical man wished to know whether there was metallic poison, I should look to see if there was blood in the faecal matter—these glass tubes contain antimony in a sulphide form which I took from the deceased's body—here are some in the metallic form—this shining portion is the sulphide from the bowel—all the bismuth coming from Dr. Stoker was pure, and did not contain arsenic—I have no reason to think that the deceased was addicted to drink—I never heard it suggested until now—there was nothing in the fatty degeneration of the heart that would cause death—I daresay I have a much fatter heart than she had—it would not have produced vomit or gastro-enteritis—the main poisoning could not possibly bring about the production of antimony by any internal process—if the syringes were soaked in water, that would get rid of any traces of antimony—there would be no difficulty in mixing the antimony with bismuth if you dissolve it in water first—you could also put it into the bismuth without dissolving it.</p>

               <p>preserved—the stomach was unusually pink externally—that was from the blood in the vessels being more than usually good—it's inner coat was of a peculiar cinnabar red colour, and towards the bowel end there was a patch of black blood which had been effused—there was no sign of perforation or ulceration—there was no loss of substance in the mucus membrane—towards the bowel end there were some old scars of years' standing—the bowels were not ruptured—the tube was intact—internally the bowel had the same red colour as the stomach—there was no ulceration—the liver was pale but firm in texture "and fairly normal—the spleen, the kidneys, the bladder, the heart, and the lungs were all normal—there was no sign of phthisis; that generally indicates disease of the lungs—the cause of death was gastro-enteritis—there was no other cause—there was nothing to indi<lb/>cate that the woman had been a confirmed drunkard—if she had drank it had not produced any serious injury to the kidneys or liver—the inflamma<lb/>tion which I found in the stomach was not attributed to alcohol—I removed the stomach, the bowels, liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, heart, brain, and some of the muscles, and submitted them all to analysis except the lungs—they all contained antimony—it had permeated to the muscle of the thigh—in the bowels I found 0.41 grain of metallic antimony, in the liver 0'87 grain, in the kidneys 0.06, and the stomach 0.03, which makes altogether 1.37—that, would represent as emetic tartar 3.83 grains—there was more in her liver than I found in Maud Marsh's—that quantity points to a large amount of antimony having been absorbed into the body, and would indicate a con<lb/>siderable dose having been taken some hours before death or the continuous administration of small doses—the purging and vomiting would get rid of a good deal of the antimony—I came to the conclusion that the cause of death was poisoning by antimony, and I attribute the preservation of the body to the antimony—it has not been thoroughly recognised that preservation is one of the effects of antimony, but it has been found in previous cases to be a preservative—the fact of antimony being found in the muscles would not indicate that doses of antimony had been going on for some time, because I think it would quickly pass to every vascular part of the body—I tested the earth round the coffin to see if it yielded any water; evidently the body had not been touched by water; the coffin and its contents being well preserved.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The condition of preservation in a measure depends on the surroundings of the body quite apart from anything internal—it was an elm coffin—the grave was eighteen feet deep—the depth of a grave to some extent helps to preserve a body, but if this body had begun to decay at the time it was buried, the depth of the grave would not have retarded it—the air generally reaches, a body before it is buried—this soil was very dry, clay and loam, which would assist preservation—it would take a few years for rain to get down eighteen feet—the grave was not a brick one—there were seven other coffins above, this one was at the bottom—the body was almost life-like—bodies buried in lead coffins, when opened years afterwards, have been found to be preserved to a wonderful degree—in those cases the air had been excluded—a wooden coffin would not be Hermetically sealed—the other bodies removed from</p>

               <p>this grave had a fearful smell—we did not open the other coffins, they were reverently put aside, and a tarpaulin put over them—the whole of them had been buried within a month—I did not analyse the lungs, because I was told the woman had died from phthisis, but when I found no traces I put them aside in case questions were asked—if I had not known the history of the woman but was told that a certificate of death from phthisis had been given, I might possibly have found that consistent with her condition—when people die from phthisis there is generally great emaciation.</p>

I live at 22, Fanshaw Avenue, Barking, and have been a nurse for a number of years—I used to live at Union Street, Borough—two or three months before Christmas, 1900, I got to know the prisoner and Bessie Taylor at the Monument—when I first knew Bessie she seemed pretty well in health—later on she complained to me of being fatigued, languid, and having pains in her stomach—I suggested that she should go to the doctor—she made a complaint to me and I mentioned Dr. Stoker's name—I went with her to his surgery more than once—he gave her some medicine—she seemed to rally, but not for long—I went to the Monument and nursed her about a week or ten days before Christmas—she engaged me herself—at first I only stayed during the day—she had vomiting and diarrhoea, and great pain—she complained a little about her throat burning, which was very red—about twice I noticed perspi<lb/>ration—when she vomited it was severe, and green, thick, and slimy—she did not complain of being thirsty—when she did complain I saw milk, water, brandy and water, and champagne given to her—at first I was the only person there in the daytime—the prisoner used to come up and see her from time to time—he used to ask her how she was—sometimes he held her hand in a friendly way—sometimes I prepared what nourish<lb/>ment she had, sometimes her mother, sometimes the prisoner—after a time I stayed there during the night as well as the day—the prisoner was there during the night until Bessie's mother came, and then he went and slept in the parlour—I went back to my home in the daytime for an hour sometimes—Mrs. Taylor did not go out very often—she took a walk sometimes—Bessie was sometimes better and sometimes worse—one Sunday after Christmas she got up and went about the house, then sat down and played the piano in the club-room adjoining her bed-room—as she was playing. Dr. Stoker who was attending her came in—he put his finger up so that I should not interrupt her—then he said. "apital '"—she looked round and discovered him there—I went home to sleep that night—I was sent for again on the Monday or Tuesday—Bessie seemed quite prostrated—she went to bed directly I got there</p>

               <p>—she said she was very tired and languid—she did not complain of pain she had violent sickness and purging—Dr. Stoker came—I was with Bessie on February 13th, and about 1.30 a.m. I thought she was dying—I called the prisoner—he came up just as she was dying—he looked at her, and I think he said, "Oh, she has gone "and he commenced to cry—I stopped a day or two in the house, and on the 15th the body was removed in a coffin to the railway station.</p>

I sent a portion of her vomit to the Clinical Research Association with directions to see if—there was any trace of cancer—that would be a microscopical examination—they found no trace—the constant vomiting and diarrhoea continued more or less during the whole time that I was there—I remember one evening going in and finding her playing the piano—I cannot recollect the date—she appeared very much better, and in consequence I said I would not call back again unless I was sent for—I do not recollect if I had any conversation with the prisoner on that day—I was sent for the next day—I found her worse than ever—I was with her the day before she died—she was very bad then with the same symptoms—I do not recollect whether on that day I thought she was dying or not—next day I heard of her death—I was asked to give a certi<lb/>ficate, which I did giving the cause of death as intestinal obstruction, vomiting, and exhaustion—intestinal obstruction would cause vomiting and exhaustion—she was suffering from vomiting and ordinary stoppage when she came to my surgery—diarrhoea would follow when the stoppage was cleared—I did not put the particulars in the certificate, "G. Chapman, widower of deceased"—I thought the prisoner was married to the woman—I never had such a thing as antimony at this period, and I never pre<lb/>scribed it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had seen Mrs. Stevens before—it was at her recom<lb/>mendation that I went to the Chapmans—up to that time I knew nothing of them—at first I regarded the case as one of constipation, and I directed my treatment with a view of removing that—I attended her at her home for excessive diarrhoea so the stoppage must have given way—I think that she came to my surgery twice—I do not remember what I gave her most likely a dose of salts—I next saw her at her home on January 1st, when I treated her for diarrhoea and vomiting—I do not know what I gave her then—I saw the prisoner—I do not remember if when I suggested to him that I should like further advice, it was within the month—he at once agreed—I believe that Dr. Sundertand came to the conclusion that she was suffering from some uterine trouble—I have no record of it—I have not seen him since—the prisoner saw Dr. Sunderland when he came, and asked him what was the matter with his wife—I do not remember that he was dissatisfied with our opinion—he was willing to have a third doctor—he paid the fees—I consulted with Dr. Thorpe—I think he told the prisoner that the woman had hysteria—he accepted that opinion, as he had accepted Dr. Sunderland's—it was at my suggestion that a fourth doctor was called in because the woman was getting no better—the prisoner agreed to that—I do not know what fee he paid in each case—he did not grumble—Dr. Cotter said it was some cancerous disease of the stomach or intestines—I think Dr. Bodmer examined the vomit that I sent—Dr. Cotter's opinion was not</p>

On November 22nd I was at Lymn Churchyard, Cheshire, and I saw Bessie Taylor's coffin taken from the grave—it had a plate on it, "Bessie Chapman, died February 13th, 1901, age 36 years"—the body was covered with a mouldy growth, but other<lb/>wise, was fresh—there was no putrifaction and no odour—the tissues were dry—the muscles had a red and freshish appearance—there was a faecal odour in the abdomen, but no putrifactive odour—although the features shad mould on them one could follow the shape and general contour—the yeast was shrunken and the whole body dry—generally when bodies decom<lb/>pose they become wet and slimy—this was one extremely well preserved except for the superficial skin—I made an examination of the various organs—on the base of the right lung I found some old adhesions from old pleurisy—the lungs were shrunken and dry but otherwise healthy and free from deposits or cavities—adhesions are quite common in people of good health in middle life and after—the heart and its valves were</p>

               <p>healthy—the stomach was empty, but its vessels were filled with dark blood to an unusual extent—on the inner surface of the gullet end of the stomach there was a patch about four inches in diameter of a cinnabar red colour which denoted gastritis—there was no ulceration or perfora<lb/>tion or any loss of substance in the mucus membrane of the stomach—the cinnabar red colour extended more or less through the bowels, indi<lb/>cating enteritis—the inner surface of the bowel was coated with a yellow paint-like stun" which was sulphide of antimony—the pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and liver were all shrunken by time but otherwise normal—the womb, ovaries, appendages and bladder were quite normal—I found no trace of cancer nor uterine trouble—I could find no sign of any cause of death—I examined the brain—it was a good deal decomposed—there was no sign of hemorrhage, or any recognisable disease—I found no intestinal obstruction—I formed the opinion that she had died from gastro-enteritis which was due to some irritant poison—I removed the stomach, bowels, liver, spleen, kidneys, heart, brain, and lungs, and subjected them all to analysis and examination—the analysis showed that antimony was present in all those parts—there was no other poison—in the stomach there was 0.12 grain of metallic antimony, in the bowel 8.43 grains, in the liver 164 grain in the kidneys 030 grain, making a total of 1049 grains which equals 10 1/2—that represents of tartar emetic in the stomach 032 grain, in the bowel 2343 grains, in the liver 4.55 grains, in the kidneys 082. grain, making in all 2912 grains—I cannot find any recorded case of such a quantity having been found in the bowel after death—it suggests that she had some large dose not long before her death—I examined the earth about the coffin but found no poison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The woman had been buried about twenty-one months—Isabella Spink had been interred practically five years—neither body was putrid—Taylor was covered with ordinary vegetable fungi—there were conditions about the body that I identified with the case of Spink—I compared Taylor's features with a photograph which I was told was hers, and I could recognise the general contour—the nose and cheeks had preserved their shape—I could not distinguish the eyes—there had been a change in her which was more remarkable than in the case of Spink, where there had been practically none—I think Taylor's body contained more antimony than Spink's—given the same conditions as far as the coffin and grave were concerned. I should have expected to find that a woman who had only been buried twenty months, and had more antimony in her body, to be less subject to change than a woman who had been buried five years and had less antimony—Taylor's coffin was a dry elm one, and, as far as I could judge, the body had not been contaminated by contact with the soil, which was very dry and sandy loam—putrifaction generally begins through the nose, mouth, and <hi rend="italic">anus</hi>, and spreads outwards—there was none of that in either body—the superficial decomposition of the body was due to the growth of mould—the presence of antimony does not prevent the growth of moulds in fact they will grow in a strong solution of tartar emetic—the long railway journey which Taylor's body had taken, and the growth of mould were distinct from the case of Spink's,</p>

               <p>and the growth of mould would depend on the cleansing of the body after death—Bessie Taylor's body was apparently cleaner than that of Spink's, as the latter had had a severe flooding shortly before death but that would only affect one part of the body—I have no reason to suppose that either of the bodies were not properly cleaned.</p>

On October 25th I went with Kemp to the Grown—the first communication about this case was made to me through Dr. Stoker about midnight of that day—a telegram was sent to Dr. Waldo, the Coroner, at 4.19 a.m. on the 25th, and at 10 a.m. I saw his officer—at noon I went to the Crown and saw the prisoner—I said, "Are you Mr. Chapman?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I wish to speak to you quietly"—I did not then say who I was—there was nobody in the parlour on the same floor, and he asked me to go in there—I said, "am inspector of police for this district; Maud Marsh, who has been living with you as your wife, has been poisoned with arsenic, and from the surrounding circumstances I shall take you to the police station while I make inquiries"—he said, "I know nothing about it; I do not know how she got the poison: she has been in Guy's Hospital for the same tort of sickness"—I said, "Before we go to the police station I am going to examine the bedroom where she died"—he made no reply, but led the way upstairs to the second floor back room—he took a key from his trousers pocket and unlocked the door—I said, "I am going to take possession of all medicine bottles"—I saw the three bottles which have been produced—they were on the floor by the fireplace—the prisoner stooped down and picked them up and gave them to me—I said, "If you have any money in that safe you had better count it"—there was a safe in the bedroom—he said, "The safe is broken," and he produced a bunch of keys from his pocket and unlocked one of the small drawers in the chest of drawers, and took from it in coin and notes £268 10s.—there were some bottles in the room—I locked it up and left Sergeant Leak outside the door—I took the key with me to the station with the prisoner, where he was detained—about 4 p.m. I returned to the Crown, and found Leak still in charge—I went into the room and took possession of the bottles and some other articles—I went into the box-room on the other side of the passage—I found several boxes and other articles there in the bedroom I found three powders, which were produced yester<lb/>day, and some medical books—the pocket book I found in the office downstairs with a Pharmacopea—I found one of the syringes and Kemp found the other, which he handed to me—I also found the little book in Polish, the papers in Russian, the will, an American revolver in a case fully loaded, a number of photographic chemicals and bottles of various kinds; also a number of papers and documents, amongst them the photograph of Bessie Taylor—some of the papers related to the change from the Prince of Wales to the Grapes, from the Grapes to the Monument, and from the Monument to the Crown also a tpyewritten letter from</p>

               <p>Biggs and Co,. dated September 8th, 1902, to "Mr. D. Chapman," at the Crown (<hi rend="italic">This stated that they regretted having been unable to find a, customer, and that in order to push matters forward they suggested advertise<lb/>ments being inserted in the daily papers, which would no doubt effect a sale.</hi>)—I also found bills relating to the funeral of Mrs. Spink and Bessie Taylor—in the pocket book there is an entry, "February 13th, 1901, Wednesday. Bessie Taylor dead, at 1.30 a.m., with great sorrow, by G. Chapman," and on October 28th, 1901, "Sunday, 27th, to Mabele Spins marrid"—I gave certain bottles and powders to Kemp with certain instructions—at 7 p.m. on October 25th I went into the charge room at the station and saw the prisoner—he said, "Can I have bail?"—I said, "No, I have not finished my enquiries yet, it is a very serious case of poisoning—he said, "She did not die suddenly; if she had been poisoned she would have done"—I had the three bismuth powders with me then—I said, "I found these three powders on the drawers in your bedroom"—he said, "The doctor sent them"—I said, "I am going to see the doctor and finish my enquiries"—I left him, and again saw him at 10.15—I said, "It is now my duty to charge you with the wilful murder of Maud Marsh by poisoning her with arsenic"—he said, "I am innocent, can I have bail?"—I said, "No"—on the Monday he was brought before the Magistrate and remanded from time to time until November 12th, when the case was commenced by the calling of evidence—from that date up to the end of December he was charged as George Chapman—in the meantime I had been making enquiries, and on December 31st I charged him in the name of Severino Klosowski with the wilful murder of Mary Isabella Spink, otherwise Chapman, on December 25th, 1897, at the Prince of Wales—I also charged him with the wilful murder of Bessie Chapman, otherwise Taylor, on February 13th, 1901—when I told him of the name of Klosowski, and the charge was read over to him, he said, "I do not know the other fellow"—in answer to the charge of murder he said, "By what means, stabbing, shooting, or what?"—I said, "The inspector will read the charge to you after he has taken it down"—it was written down and read over to him—he said, "Who is the other fellow?"—I said, "That is you; we call you Severino Klo<lb/>sowski, otherwise George Chapman"—he said, "I do not know anything about the other name"—I was present at each of the exhumations.</p>

On October 25th I accompanied Godley to the Crown, and assisted him in searching the premises and taking away the things we found—I found this green syringe—about 7 p.m. on that day I saw the prisoner in the charge room at the station—he said, "Can I speak to you a minute?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Your inspector brought some white powders in just now, which he said he had found on the drawers in the bedroom, has the doctor examined them yet?"—I said, "I do not know at present"—he said, "I would not hurt her for the world. I have had a lot of trouble with my bar<lb/>maids, but I took a great fancy to this one there was some jealousy</p>
