                  <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK SERGEANT</hi>. I am a clerk in the firm of Willoughby and Cox, attorneys. I have here the proceedings in an action of "Steadman V. Knight"—I produce the writ of summons, the issue, and the record—the verdict was for the plaintiff, damages 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in addition to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid into court—I remember the taxation of costs—I have a memorandum here on the final judgment paper, by which I can tell when the damages and costs were paid—it is" June 25, 1852; received 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that was the amount of the damages beyond the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not the dates of payment here, bat they were paid afterwards—time was given for payment of the costs—I have got the subpœnas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let me look at the subpœnas—(<hi rend="italic">the witness handed them</hi> in)—I suppose you attended the trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not; Mr. Cox did—I only know from representations made that Mr. Steadman was seriously injured on that occasion—I suppose I saw him about that time—I do not of my own knowledge know that he was attended by Mr. Digby, the surgeon, for the injuries he received—I believe Mr. Cox is not here—he did not intend to come; he has not been subpœnaed—he is at his office—the cause was in the paper for the 9th June, but I believe the verdict was given on the 10th—I received a memorandum of the witnesses that were subpœnaed by Shadrake—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I delivered the subpœnas either to Shadrake or Mr. Steadman, I could not say which—I delivered subpœnas to be taken into the country, as I understood—I do not know now whether the names were stated on that occasion—I cannot say positively whether I delivered the subpœnas in blank—I filled up the body</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280002"/>
               <p>of them, but whether I left blanks for the names or not I cannot positively state—the names are now all filled in in my handwriting, but that was very probably done after the trial was over, when there was a statement handed to me by either Shadrake or Mr. Steadman of the names of the witnesses who attended; it is very likely that I then for the first time filled them up in the original subpœnas, but I cannot say now—I might have delivered the copy subpœnas with directions to fill them in—this subpœna (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) includes the names of William Sparks, Robert Miller, John Williams, all of Emscote, Warwickshire; and this other subpœna includes the names of Benjamin Dickerson and Alfred Carter—since the trial of this action I believe our firm has made a further application to Mr. Knight for further injury to Mr. Steadman since the issuing of the writ.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that of your own knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen the letter—I cannot say that I posted it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has Mr. Knight since the trial been called upon by any of your firm on the subject to your knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not to my knowledge—I received from Shadrake or Mr. Steadman, I will not say positively which, a memorandum of the witnesses that had been subpœnaed—this is the memorandum—I cannot speak positively to Shadrake's handwriting—I think I recollect an occasion upon which I have seen him write—I believe this memorandum is in his writing; it contains the names of Sparks, Miller, Williams, Dickenson, and Carter—Shadrake acted on the part of Mr. Steadman in the course of the proceedings before they came to trial—he was at our office on several occasions; he was foreman to Mr. Steadman, I believe—I attended the taxation of the costs—I can tell, by referring to the office copy of the bill of costs, what was allowed for the attendance of these five witnesses—nothing was allowed for William Sparks, or Miller, Williams, or Carter—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was allowed for Dickenson—Mr. Cox, the plaintiff's attorney, was in attendance at that time, and the defendant's attorney also—I believe Mr. Knight was not present at the taxation—after the taxation I believe Mr. Knight applied for time to pay, and it was given him as far as the costs were concerned—he paid by instalments.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at those subpœnas: can you undertake to say when they were filled up, before or after action? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot undertake to say whether they were filled up, as regards the names, before or after the trial—I know nothing of my own knowledge of the service of these subpœnas—I gave them out, understanding that they were to be taken down to Emscote—the sums allowed at the original taxation of costs are marked here in black ink, and those at the review of the taxation in red ink—opposite the name of William Sparks there is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in red ink, and that is taken off in black ink; and the like with regard to Miller and Williams—17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. appears here as the amount taken off on the review—Dickenson was originally allowed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was taken off on the review—other items were also taken off, which constituted a portion of the tavern expenses (<hi rend="italic">reading the items</hi>)—I did not attend the review, nor was I in the Court of Exchequer when judgment was given—speaking from recollection, I believe some reduction was made on the review for the subpœnas of these four witnesses, which had been previously allowed—I have seen Mr. Steadman at our office on several occasions whilst the action was going on, not giving instructions, the instructions were generally given by Shadrake, his clerk—I did not see Mr. Steadman much till the latter part of the proceedings—I am not aware that the Judges of the Exchequer ordered this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There were sixteen witnesses, I believe, subpœnaed</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler of Emscote, in Warwickshire. I was there, and at Leamington, on 9th and 10th June last—I was not at Westminster Hall on those days—I did not attend on those days a trial at Westminster Hall, of Steadman v. Knight—I was never subpœnaed on such a trial, and was not there—Steadman did not pay me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expenses as a witness—Shadrake and his clerk, and Mr. Steadman, had been boarding and lodging at my house, they occasionally doing work at the Asylum; and they might want me, but I never was subpœnaed and never was paid—I know William Carter; I cannot say whether I saw him on 9th and 10th June at Emscote, for I saw him most days—he is an iron founder, and his foundry is close to me—I do not think it probable that there was an interval of four days at that time without my seeing him—I cannot say whether I ever saw him for four days together, or two days together—I know William Sparks; he was down working there in June last, but could not swear whether I saw him on 9th and 10th June—I know Robert Miller and John Williams, but cannot swear whether I saw them on those two days; but they were at work, and came to my house two days afterwards to be paid their wages—I do not know of their leaving; they were backwards and forwards at my house every two or three days—the first time I heard that my name had been put down as a witness was a few days after the trial.</p>

I said, "Yes, it is no use stopping down there: you never sent us word where we were to get our money from for our wages, or anything else; I thought it was most time, then, to come up;" he said, "Oh, that is all right, I expect some money in a few days, and that will be all right; I will pay you when I get the money"—after that he asked me whether Mr. Bushel had called at my house (that is a party that used to work at Steadman's shop)—I said that he had: he said directly, "He is trying to do me all the injury he can"—this was about a fortnight or three weeks after I now know the trial to have taken place, but Mr. Steadman never said a word about the action—in consequence of what Mr. Steadman said to me, I went down to Warwickshire again to finish some particular work at the Asylum, but I only stayed there a few days—I then came up to town by myself, and Williams and Miller-came up two or three days afterwards—we did not all go to the shop together, I was the first that went; we were to meet there on that day—I had seen Mr. Steadman in London before, about eight or nine days before they came up; that would be about a month after 10th June—I went in first—I did not see Mr. Steadman when I first went in (I saw his man), he was upstairs; I afterwards saw him, and he said to me, "I intended to give Mr. Shadrake a subpœna to give you down at Warwick"—he said that because he had heard that Bushel had been at my house, and found I was not at the trial—he told me that he had charged for us at the trial, and said that if anybody should ask me if I was at the trial, I was to say yes; and to avoid my telling a falsehood in one way, he would send his man along with us to take us down to the Court, and show us the Court where the trial was at Westminster, so that if anybody asked us if we were at the Court, we could merely say we were at the Court; and with that he gave me a subpœna enclosed in an envelope, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this was a month after the trial—after that conversation Williams and Miller came in, and he spoke to them in a similar way: I heard him tell them they were to go down to the Court along with this man, who would show us the Court, and if anybody asked us if we had been at the Court we could say "yes"—he did not serve them with subpœnas himself; his man did, in the shop, but not in his presence—he was upstairs,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280005"/>
               <p>and sent them down by the man—we then all four left together, me, Miller, Williams, and Yorston, and went from there down to Westminster, into the Court of Exchequer, I think it was: and Yorston said, "Here is where the case was tried; you will know if anybody asks you where it was"—there was some cause or other being tried there then, but we did not stop long enough to know what it was; we only stopped about a couple of minutes in Court—we came out and went into a public-house, and Yorston said, "This is the public-house where we stopped and had some refreshment, and you can say this was the public-house where you were when the trial was going on"—Yorston was sent by Steadman himself—we had some refreshment, a drop or two of beer and a bit of steak, and parted in the evening—Mr. Steadman never mentioned this matter afterwards—it is from three to four months ago since I was applied to to give evidence in this matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith and engineer—I was at work at Emscote on a job of Mr. Steadman's, all June; I did not leave there at all—I was not in London at a trial of Steadman <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Knight, at Westminster, on 9th and 10th June—I did not receive any subpœna to attend the trial—I received no money for having attended as a witness; neither 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or any sum—I heard of the action before it was tried, and had seen Mr. Steadman down at Emscote once or twice; I cannot say the date, but he was there several times about a month or so before I left—Alfred Sparks was with me at the time at Emscote, on 9th and 10th June—I came up to town about the end of June; I finally left the job, I think, in July—when I came up to town, I, Sparks, and Williams, went to see Mr. Steadman about our work—I remember being at Mr. Steadman's with Sparks and Williams; we saw Steadman, the first thing he asked me was, how my health was, and how we got on with the work; I said we could not get on for materials, and we came to</p>

               <p>London, we thought it was the best way—nothing was said by Mr. Steadman as far as I recollect, about our being witnesses in the action; I have never said so—I had a subpœna served on me there by one of my workmates, Robert Yorston; we were speaking about the work, and Yorston put the subpœna into my hand—I was not called on after the accident to make any affidavit, or to swear to one—I did not make one—I know what an affidavit is; it is speaking the truth—the signature to this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—after I was served with the subpœna, Sparks, Williams, Yorston, and me, went to Westminster, and into the Court of Queen's Bench, I think it was—Yorston took us there; I do not exactly know what it was for, out we were to go up to the Court, and return to Warwick in the morning—we then went and had some dinner, and went back again to the shop—we afterwards went down to Emscote again—I knew nothing from Steadman of why we went to Westminster; I do not recollect that he said anything of why we went with Yorston.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, carrying on business in the name of Willoughby and Cox; it is a firm of long standing. We were employed to bring an action against Mr. Knight, and in the ordinary course we learned what means he had of proof—there would likewise have been a question of the amount of damages he sustained; there was a count for special damages—for the purposes of proof it was necessary that certain witnesses should be subpœnaed from the place where his works went on—Sparks was one of those witnesses, Miller was another, Dickenson another, Williams another, and Carter another—it was not to prove special damages in the ordinary sense of the term—it was for the purpose of proving his absence through inability to attend, through illness—all those names were on the brief, excepting Carter, whose name was by accident omitted—I had his name in the instructions—I received those instructions from Mr. Steadman, and he gave me those names—on the trial I did not know what witnesses were present, but before the trial began I asked Steadman if all his witnesses were there—on that he left the Court for a minute or two—I do not know whether the witnesses had been turned out of Court, but Shadrake was out of Court—Steadman came back in a couple of minutes, and told me that all the witnesses were there, and upon that the trial proceeded—none of those witnesses were called, as they were subpœnaed for the purpose of proving his not attending to his business, and his illness had been so perfectly proved by the medical man that it was not necessary—my counsel were Mr. Crowder and Mr. Pitt Taylor—during the proceedings Mr. Steadman appeared to be suffering from what the medical men said was the effect of this accident—his head was tied up till shortly before the trial, and his arm was in a sling at the time of the trial—he appeared</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280009"/>
               <p>to me to be suffering from ill health—I saw Shadrake several times in the course of the proceedings—I got the case up myself—my clerk Sergeant was not more directly in communication with him than me, till after the trial was over—Shadrake appeared to be taking an active part in the matters, as Mr. Steadman seemed very much excited, and his memory appeared to be affected in some manner—he had received an injury on his head—it was stated by counsel that we could not recover for damages after the writ issued; whatever moneys had been disbursed after the writ issued could not be recovered—in consequence of that, I after this action made a communication to Mr. Knight—we did not say anything about another action—I endeavoured to act as mediator, but did not succeed—I should not have brought another action; I was very sorry to go on with this—I had no difficulty in getting the costs—they were not paid all at once—an application was made to us by a client of ours, whose name I do not wish to mention, and we gave some little time—if we had said we would not give time, I believe they would have been paid—we gave our client time for his damages on an application of the then defendant—the affidavit in which I unfortunately joined was, I think, made on 17th June—the first taxation was on 19th. June, but Mr. Jay could not attend, and I believe it was about 22nd or 23rd June—something was struck off on that taxation, but merely for tavern bills and matters of that kind—nothing further was struck off on the review of the taxation—that was not after the long vacation—the meeting to review was held in Michaelmas Terms—it was quite unnecessary for me to have joined in the affidavit, except as to the materiality—I have no doubt, and had none, of the materiality of those five witnesses; if I had not known that they were there at she time the Jury were sworn, I should not have gone on with the case, without the advice of counsel, because counsel had advised them to be subpœnaed—I should say that on the morning after the trial Mr. Steadman called at the office, and I requested him to get the christian and surnames of the witnesses who were in actual attendance at the Court—he afterwards brought back the paper, with the names of the witnesses on it in Shadrake's writing, and then I said, "As my clerk will have to draw the affidavit of increase, hand that list to him?" and I see here is my clerk's writing the "eight miles" where "distance" is written, and I really had nothing more to do with it till the affidavit of increase was made—affidavits of increase are not in printed forms—there is a form in the practice from which our clerk draws the affidavit—I cannot say much about the state of Steadman's health on the day we made the affidavit jointly—he seemed quiet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not yourself prepare the affidavit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: it was read over to Steadman either by me, or by my clerk in my presence—I consider, as a respectable practitioner, that making any affidavit is of the first importance—Steadman's attention was called at the time to the sums of money that he was prepared to say he paid to them—if we had known that that was not true, we should have kicked him out of the office; but Mr. Steadman himself gave me the amounts paid to those witnesses—on 15th June I. took down a statement that they had not all been paid, and I gave him a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go and pay the balance—he stated on the 15th all the sums that the parties had been paid, and said that Yorston had not been paid, and that there were some other sums to pay; the amount of the list he gave me two days before was 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had exhausted his funds, and I gave him the cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go and pay the rest; and on the morning of 16th or 17th he said that they had all been paid, and I gave him an affidavit to go to my clerk and till in the names.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If Mr. Steadman was in a state of mind not to understand the contents, should you have allowed him to swear the affidavit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was perfectly in a sound state of mind, there is no doubt about it—I do not recollect advancing any money to Steadman before the trial after the trial we did—I should say I saw Shadrake as long as a week before the trial; I will not swear it was not longer, I saw him off and on, because the case was in hand several months—I lost sight of him about a week before the trial: I should say here, that short notice of trial was given, from the 4th to the 9th, and there was very little time to subpœna the witnesses, who, being in Warwickshire, I desired my clerk to issue the four subpoenas, and to fill up the copies and give them all to Shadrake, and desire Steadman to be very particular, and see that they were all subpœnaed; and then Shadrake went down to subpoena them, as there was not time to send the subpoenas down to an agent—Shadrake never told me that he missed the train going down to Emscote, I never heard that before to-day—if I had I should not have gone on with the trial without speaking to counsel—these two copies, of subpoenas were issued from our office either on 5th or 6th June, and all the paper copies—I did not give any out, Mr. Sergeant gave them out, but the parchment subpoenas I do not believe ever left our office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Sergeant said he could not tell whether the subpoenas were filled in before or after the trial; what is the meaning of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You cannot fill in the witnesses names in full till you know them, and therefore the subpoena is always issued in blank, and when the name is put in the copy, of course it is in the original; but it ought not to be put in after the trial, if it was so it was not done with my knowledge: there is no doubt that the moment a trial is over the parchment subpoena should be left in the same state, and if this has been touched it is not with my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it that you first heard that these witnesses were not in attendance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the day we attended to tax the costs Mr. Jay said some of the witnesses were not present, and I replied with considerable warmth, and said they were there; I did not think he meant the imputation against me, but it came on me by surprise—at that time I had before me Steadman's affidavit—in what I have stated in my affidavit as regards the attendance, I have relied on the statements that Steadman made to me; and but for the experience I have had, I should not have hesitated in doing the same over again, in reference to any other client who I believed to be respectable; afterwards, when I found out the cause of this unfortunate matter, I paid their solicitor all the money that it had cost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came it that Shadrake's bill of costs was turned into 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We received the money and paid it to Mr. Shadrake; after the order to review, Mr. Jay said he was informed that some witnesses did not come from Warwickshire, and I said to them, "I have had enough of affidavits, make your statement to the Master;" and they did, and were treated as town witnesses, and the bill of costs was reduced from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that had been actually paid to Shadrake—we did not also pay him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Dickenson—Steadman never paid me back, he was in prison—I have no doubt Mr. Jay believed Dickenson had not come up to London on purpose, I am sure Mr. Jay would not make a statement unless he believed it was true—three sums of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. allowed on the original taxation for Sparks, Miller, and Williams, were disallowed because the Master said that we had too many witnesses to one fact; I drew the Master's attention the counsel's opinion, and he said, "Well, I sometimes differ with counsel, and I do here"—it was Master Walton—it was not on the ground of their not having been paid, but because they were not necessary; if they were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280011"/>
               <p>necessary, the affidavit would have carried them—there would be no inquiry about them on the review, only they were put into the affidavit—there would be no question about them on the review as to the sums; for the purpose of getting anything back it was unnecessary, because nothing had been paid—that would also refer to Alfred Carter 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deducted, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. allowed to Benjamin Dickenson—we should have banded over every 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mr. Steadman, we do not keep another person's money—we waited for the trial to come on at the Exchequer all day on the 9th, and the case came on about 12 o'clock on the 10th—Steadman was examined as a witness for about an hour or an hour and a half; he was obliged to sit down while he was being examined—he was not ordered out of Court with the other witnesses, it was arranged that the parties themselves should not go out, either before or after—he was in Court on the 9th and on the 10th—I saw him next morning at ay office, and on the 13th.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By arrangement he remained in Court, the other witnesses being out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was the case on both days—he remained in Court on the day the cause was tried—from the beginning to the end Stead man never told me that be had subpœnaed the witnesses himself; he never conveyed that to me—Shadrake was constantly assisting him; I had a great deal of trouble in getting the evidence together—since this case, Steadman has taken the benefit of the Insolvent Debtors' Act; he was only out of prison a few days before the last Sessions</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 205, Fleet-street. I know the defendant, and remember an injury that he sustained by a collision of carriages in Nov., 1851—I did not attend him till some time afterwards; he was under the care of a medical man at Walthamstow—I attended him when he came to London; it was about June—I did not make any memorandum of the time; it was some weeks before the trial—I was rather shocked at his appearance; he was rather in a weak state, and had received serious in<lb/>juries</p>

               <p>on the head and shoulders—I should think there had been concussion; there were symptoms of it, but he was not labouring under it at the time—I looked upon him with some apprehension—I continued to attend him down to the trial—at the time of the trial he was in a very unfit state to attend to business—I do not know whether, while I was in attendance upon him, he went down into Warwickshire; I constantly recommended quiet—I continued to attend him for a week or two after the trial, and then I lost sight of him; and he came to me again about a fortnight ago; he was then much better, but certainly not in good health—I attribute the state of his health to the injury he received—I attended him six or eight weeks in the summer months of 1852—I had claims on him for medical attendance during that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Meyer Meyers and Co., umbrella and parasol makers in Bow-lane. On 9th Feb. I looked over the work in the warehouse, some of it bed to go downstairs to receive an addition to it, the work that was complete I took away—there was one bundle of parasols that was not complete, that I let remain—I was absent about twenty minutes—when I left, I left the prisoner and five or six others in the shop—Levin was one of them—when I came beck from dinner I was told the parasols were gone—I went and looked, and missed them—I have teen them since—it is the bundle produced by the pawnbroker—I cannot say how many parasols the bundle contained—twelve have been produced—they are my employers' property—I have also seen four ether parasols, which are my employers' property—they are the fellow parasols to the twelve—they were not finished when they were in our place.</p>

I work for Mr. Meyers, in Bow-lane—I was there on 9th Feb., between 2 and 3 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there, sitting on the counter—there was a bundle behind her back—I did not take much notice of it—I believe she had a green baize before her, with work in it—she stood that against the other bundle, and threw her shawl over her arm, and said, "I should like to go to sleep"—she</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He used to conduct all the correspondence of the society? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the instructions of the Committee—we used not to dictate the letters to him; we told him our suggestions, and allowed him to write accordingly—three formed a quorum; it happened at times that there were not three; that happened in consequence of the prisoner's neglect to write to some of the Committee—the Committee met on the third Tuesday in the month, and it was the prisoner's duty to send notices round previously to that—it was also his duty to write letters to the Committee—I was Honorary Secretary, and I did my duty—I never summoned the Committee; I used to give instructions to the prisoner to do so—I did not sometimes forget to do so; I have no recollection of forgetting it; but, for some cause or other, it did happen that the meetings were not so regular as we could desire—whatever I do is a purely honorary act on my part; I never received a farthing in my life—I was with the Society at its formation—the prisoner has been with us two years and a quarter; his salary was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; he has six or seven children, I do not know which—we never had a settlement with him; we never could get him up to the mark—I am not aware whether, at the time he was given into custody, there was a full twelve-months' salary due to him; our books will show—I do not know whether during the whole two years and a quarter we have paid him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for salary and commission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you paid him more than 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for salary and commission during the whole two years and a quarter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not gone into that part of the accounts to see, therefore I do not know—we used to draw a check for petty cash; it appears by his own book that he was in advance of us for petty cash—I know nothing about the accounts except what the books show—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is our petty cash book, kept by the prisoner; the balance that he claims in it is 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the only petty cash book—it was not shown from time to time to the Committee—he never claimed that sum by word of mouth—he made disbursements for petty cash from time to time, and we gave him checks from time to time, "Pay petty cash"—we continually asked for accounts, but could not get them—the prisoner collected subscriptions, and got 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in new subscriptions while he was with us—the average income of the Society is between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not his custom, to your knowledge, himself to get the checks cashed before they were paid over to the parties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not unless he had a check for several little amounts, which would be drawn for "sundries," when he would receive it, and pay the tradesmen the amount—the balance at our banker's was never very large—we never drew a check without putting the question to the prisoner," What moneys are there at the banker's?"—we had not the banker's book always—I think there was one instance, and but one, in which a check has been drawn by us, and kept back by the prisoner, because there were not funds in the bank—it appears by the banker's passbook that Mitchell's check for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid into the bank on Dec. 21st; I do not know on what account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not it paid in on your own account on 21st Dec.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think it was Dec. 2nd—here is, "Per secretary, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—it is put on one side and then on the other, so that it is of no effect; it might as well have stopped out—we were credited and debited at the same time; the banker's clerk will explain it—the prisoner left our Board on 21st Dec; we ordered</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280019"/>
               <p>him to withdraw, and he did so—if he had come back again, we should have told him to withdraw again—he came to the next meeting of the Committee, and we gave him into custody, acting on the advice of Mr. Humphreys, the solicitor, the gentleman who is acting as solicitor for the prosecution—the prisoner did not, when he came, ask permission to look at the books—I really mean to say that—after he had been heard before the Magistrate, he was on bail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he come to your office afterwards, and request permission to examine the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know about examining the books; he sent a letter, or brought it; it was brought into the room by the housekeeper—we did not see him at the office—he did not come to the office and make a personal application to look at the books—we have never let him look at the books, either by attorney or accountant—I have no recollection of any application being made to us for that purpose—I really mean to say that no application has been made on behalf of the defendant to inspect the books, so as to enable him to make out his accounts—his accounts could be made out from the books; I have gone over them—whatever I or the Committee have done, has been done in the prisoner's absence, and without any person on his behalf being present—a letter was sent to us by the prisoner—he did not, otherwise than by letter, request that he might have permission to explain his position and his accounts to the Committee.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he given you an account of what moneys had been received and paid, would you at once have written him a check for what was due to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He never applied for a check without having money given to him—he has on a great many occasions applied to us for accounts—he would have no authority from us to apply any moneys received on account to his salary or commission—all the books of the Society are here—the prisoner kept them—I produce them—allowing him credit for all his claims, money is due to the Society by him independent of these checks—the balance against him is 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we call subscriptions old ones when they are a year old—this paper which I am looking at is a statement which I have made out from the books—I can only speak from this paper now, because if I were to speak from the books I should have to take each Independent item for two years and a quarter, and see whether they are subscriptions or donations</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you carefully gone through the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I make the result against the Society of 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that is due to the Society—here is a defalcation between this book and the pass book of 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—by defalcation I mean deficiency—the 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. against the prisoner includes the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of his voluntary statement on the 21st; after allowing him all his per centage and salary, the amount of defalcation, independent of the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, is 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is allowing him all his salary and commission, and claim for petty cash.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not omitted to take into the account (this has been just suggested to me by the prisoner) a sum of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which has been due to him for petty cash disbursements for twelve months? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have taken his petty cash book, and admitted it to be correct—he has never asked for a settlement of the petty cash disbursements—this is the first I have heard of a sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for petty cash disbursements for more than twelve months—I know nothing of a guinea with which he has debited himself from a Mr. Cox—I have taken the books just as they are, to make up the accounts—a son of the prisoner was never employed by us, nor was he there working day after day for twelve months—I never saw him there in the daytime in my life—we do not meet in the daytime, and if he had been there I should have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280020"/>
               <p>seen him—I have sometimes seen him there of an evening during five or six months, not extending over a period of twelve or fifteen months—I expected to see the prisoner there every day, but not all day—he had no stated times of work—the office was not always open of an evening—it was when the Committee met, which was sometimes twice a week—I never knew anything of this 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the end of 1851, which he says he has never been paid, till after he was given in custody; then I went over the books, and saw it, and in going over the books I have taken the balance as he has stated—I did not see that balance when I went over the books, I saw it before you pointed it out to me—I did not take notice of it because I took the balance as Mr. Fowler showed it—it is as it is there; I should be most anxious to give him every benefit—we were informed that he was busy in apprehending a person who had forged upon us—I do not know whether he paid a reward of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he from time to time apply to you for checks in payment of the petty cash which he expended? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we always gave those checks—he never said one word at our Committee meeting about there being 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd due to him for a twelvemonth—I was almost always at the Committee; I was not away perhaps once in a twelvemonth—I have assumed his accounts to be correct merely for the purposes of my calculation—I have not gone into the items at all, but I assume it in his favour—I am able to say from recollection that we have drawn checks for petty cash in 1852—I or some other member of the Committee have applied to the prisoner for a settlement of accounts I should think twenty or thirty times—we were never able to obtain it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were all these books left in your possession in the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in our possession, in the prisoner's possession, and his only—I do not know what he did with them—they were in his charge, and were not accessible to every member of the managing Committee—any member of the Committee could go to the office, and see them if they were there—there was but one key, and that was in the charge of the prisoner—I have often gone there and could not get in, and the other Committee-men as well—there is a housekeeper upstairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any refusal by the prisoner to allow you to see the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have never asked for the books, but we have asked to have them made up repeatedly—the key was not left with the housekeeper that I am aware of—I never knew her to have it—I always considered it was in Mr. Fowler's hands—I never asked him for it.</p>

I am a member of the Committee of the London Philanthropic Society; I was present on 21st Dec. when the prisoner attended—in consequence of something that had occurred the Committee met to examine the books on that occasion—we told the prisoner that we wished to go into the accounts to see how we stood—he immediately took a paper from his pocket, and said, "To be can did with you, Gentlemen, I have been making use of the Society's money"—the paper produced by Mr. Heeps is the statement that I took down from the prisoner's lips at the time: I was chairman—I read it over to him, and he corrected the error of a shilling that I had made in the casting.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday, 5th February, I was in the next house, and I was fetched into my shop—the prisoner was at the counter—the boy Hardcastle put a half-crown and a shilling in my hand, they were both bad—he pointed to the prisoner, and said, "This man has tried to pass to mistress this bad half-crown and shilling"—I asked the prisoner if he had any more of them—he said he did not know, he would look; and he immediately said, "This is London, the sooner I get out of it the better"—he said he had changed a half-sovereign that morning in Westminster, naming the house, but I forget it—I sent the boy for a policeman; before he came the prisoner went out—the policeman went and brought him back—I showed the bad shilling and half-crown to the policeman, and delivered them up at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Rutland Wharf, Upper Thames-street, and am clerk to Purcell and Co., coal merchants. On the night of 18th Feb. I went down to the wharfs at 10 o'clock—I saw the prisoner, whom I had seen before—he had two empty sacks, which I saw him partly fill with oats from a bulk lying immediately under the wharf—the oats were Messrs. Henry Green and William Keene Sedgwick's—Cullen was with me—he came and told me of it, and he accompanied me—I sent him for a policeman; I remained, jumped down, and stopped the prisoner—he required very little stopping; he stopped very quietly—he said he was very sorry, he had been out of work a long time, and he had a wife and family—he shot the two sacks into the bulk again.</p>

I am errand boy to Mrs. Watkins On, Friday, 28th Jan., I took a box to Mr. Pawson's, in St. Paul's Churchyard—I got there about 5 o'clock—when I got between the two doors I saw the clerk—he said, "Are these the returned cloaks?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You must take them round the back way"—the prisoner James was between the two doors—I was carrying the box round the back way, and the prisoner James tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Are these the two returned cloaks?"—I said, "Yes"—he said. "Give them to me; I am the ware-houseman"—I said, "I want the bill receipted"—I gave him the cloaks, and asked him to receipt the bill—he said he was very busy that night unpacking, and said I was to call the next day between 10 and 11 o'clock for the box and the bill receipted—I left him and went home—I feel confident he is the same man that took the box of me—this is the box, and these cloaks were in it at the time.</p>

Pawson's; he pointed out the lad as coming from there with the returned cloaks; he said I was to go to him and ask for the bill; I went and asked him if he had got the cloaks; he said yes, and he returned them to me, and the bill; the gentleman took the bill from me, and told me to go with the cloaks to the Golden Cross, and leave them there in the name of Thomas Webster; Henry then came and joined me, and I told him to carry the box; when we were in Tudor-street we were stopped by Brett; I told him I had had the box, but I did not know what it contained. I have been made a tool of in this case; I acknowledge having the box, but I obtained it from the boy; he states that he saw me near the door; it was out in the street, it was not near the door; I am entirely innocent of any guilty knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor of this indictment; I am a solicitor. In the year 1846 I occasionally went to the offices of Mr. George Lewis, in Barnard's Inn—at that time the two prisoners, King and Wyatt, were clerks to Mr. Lewis—I remember going to the office on 3rd July, 1846; I saw King there, and Mr. John Minn Cooke—King said that Mr. Cooke had a judgment against Lord George Loftus for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked me if I would become the purchaser of it, at the same time stating that he had papers then before him, abstracts or copies of settlement, showing that the late Marquis of Ely had covenanted with trustees, on his marriage, to insure his life for the sum of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for each younger child; that the Marquis had omitted to do so, and he, King, was about to take proceedings either against the present Marquis, or the trustees of the late Marquis, to recover the 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and that, should he succeed, there would be the prospect of a tolerable dividend under Lord George Loftus's estate, he having taken the benefit of the Insolvent Act—after discussing the matter, I was shown the judgment paper, and the bills upon which the action against Lord George was founded—after some discussion, I ageed to purchase it of Mr. Cooke, who was the party holding it—that agreement was reduced to writing—this is it—King wrote it out—it is signed by me and Mr. Cooke—(<hi rend="italic">this being read, was a memorandum of agreement, dated</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">rd July</hi>, 1846<hi rend="italic">, between Francis Gibbons, by John Minn Cooke, his agent, of the one part, and John Jackson Lee of the other part; and recited that on</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1842, <hi rend="italic">the said Francis Gibbons obtained a final judgment against Lord George Loftus for</hi> 558<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">debt, and</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">taxed costs, which he</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Gibbons</hi>) <hi rend="italic">agreed to sell the said J.

I called again, and it was not then executed—I saw King, and he asked me to let him have a further payment on account of Mr. Cooke—I then paid him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he stated that the assignment should be put in hand immediately, and I should have it on the following day—that was all that took place on 21st Aug.—I might have called between 3rd July and</p>

               <p>21st Aug.; very likely I did—I called on 21st Aug., and again on 22nd, and King said be would send Wyatt out to get the deed executed—I do not know that Wyatt was present at that time; they sat in different rooms, and I do not know that Wyatt was in the room; I think not—I called again some time in Sept.—I saw King, and paid him the balance, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to make up the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I also paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the stamp of the deed, and received the deed from him—this is it—it is in the same state in which I received it—(<hi rend="italic">the deed was here read. It was dated 22nd Aug.</hi>, 1846, <hi rend="italic">and purported to assign the debt in question to John Jackson Lee; it was signed Francis Gibbons, and witnessed by Thomas Wyatt, clerk to Mr. Lewis On the back was a receipt for the</hi> 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">also signed Francis Gibbons, and witnessed by Thomas Wyatt</hi>)—I believe this signature "Francis Gibbons" to be Hildebrandt's writing—the attestation of Thomas Wyatt is Wyatt's handwriting—I speak to both of Wyatt's signatures—in consequence of information I received, some time at the latter part of last year, I asked Wyatt if he could give me any information about Francis Gibbons; what he was, and where he resided—he displayed some hesitation at first, but on my second inquiry he told me that he was a carver and gilder in Piccadilly—I have looked when I have occasionally gone through Piccadilly, and could see no such name—I did not go for the express purpose of ascertaining whether there was such a person, but I have gone up Piccadilly on one or two occasions and looked, and could see no such name; and I made inquiries of persons in the street, and could hear of no such man—I also directed my clerk, William Jackson, to make a search—I have advertised for Francis Gibbons, but cannot ascertain that there is such a person—I have made inquiries for Lord George Loftus, both at the Marquis of Ely's and at the late Marchioness's—they told me he was at Hanover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there such a person as Lord George Loftus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh yes; I went with a subpœna to procure his attendance both to the Marquis of Ely's and the Marchioness's—I could not ascertain on what part of the Continent he was—I believed that there was something wrong about the deed last year, but I only ascertained that it was a forgery yesterday six weeks—it might be in Sept. or Oct. last year that I believed there was something wrong about it; when I made the inquiry of Wyatt which I have spoken of—I gave King and Wyatt into custody on a Tuesday; it was about the 18th or 19th Jan.; it was the day after I got information of the forgery—it was the day before the trial of an action against me at Westminster—King and Wyatt were both my witnesses on that trial; I had subpœnaed them both—I cannot tell whether they were to be witnesses for the plaintiff—it is impossible I can tell who a man intends to call for his witnesses—King's son was the plaintiff in the action, as executor of Mr. Lewis—there was a claim against me of 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to which I had a good defence—I have reason to believe the record was withdrawn—I have subpœnaed Mr. John Minn Cooke—I have known Hildebrandt by sight perhaps six or eight months, but I did not know his name—I do not know when I first knew his name; I should not have known it till I was told yesterday six weeks—I knew him by sight five or six months before that—I had seen him at Lewis and Cooke's offices, and once or twice since, I believe—I might have heard his name before yesterday six weeks, but it is an uncommon name, and I might have forgotten it—I never had any dealings or transactions with him—I never received any communication from him in writing, and never saw him Write; but I have seen some of his writing which he has given me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you have never seen him write, or received any written communication from him, how cameyouto swear that you believed this signature to be his writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because when I went to him, when I was first informed of the forgery, I asked him to give me some of his handwriting that I might see it—when I was informed who had committed the forgery, I asked a party to show me his house—I waited about the house probably about a couple of hours, with the intention of taking him into custody; I did not succeed, and I returned to town, and apprehended the two prisoners—I then returned to Hildebrandt's—I got into the house, the door being opened upon my knocking at it, and I walked up stairs, and found him—I produced the deed to him, and asked him if he had any of his own handwriting by him; and be then gave me this small note, stating that this was his handwriting—that is my only knowledge of his handwriting, and from what passed between us at the time—I paid the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the first instance; that was in Mr. Cooke's presence—I think Mr. Cooke was present at the whole of the first interview—I received a note of hand and judgment paper at the time of the agreement—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe, besides being an attorney, you are a discounter of bills, are you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not discount myself; I get my clients to discount paper—I am not a good deal on the <hi rend="italic">turf</hi>, not at all—I am not a betting man—I have occasionally betted, but not for some time past, and not to any very large amount, certainly not to the amount of thousands, not to 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nothing like it, neither as a loser or winner—I formerly resided at Leeds—I was never charged with any assaults at Leeds; I was new charged with one in my life—I never had a summons served on me—I was never charged with stealing a bill by a Mr. Davis—I know what you allude to, and will explain it—a gentleman of the name of Davis, who has since been charged with robbery, came to me, and asked me to obtain a loan of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by way of mortgage on a gentleman's property—I said I would do it—I was going to obtain the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on security—a few days afterwards he came to me, and said, "Would you oblige the gentleman with a loan of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or a bill till you procure him the money?"—I said I would see if I could obtain the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I let the man Davis have 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of something that transpired, I found I had been deceived by the party wishing to borrow the money, and I put the bill, which I considered as so much waste paper, into my sideboard drawer—I received a letter from a Mr. Hornage, wishing me to restore the bill—of course I wished to have back my 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which had been got from me—I was told if I did not restore the bill to the drawer of it by 2 o'clock in the day, proceedings would be taken against me; the clerk was to call for it—I stayed at home to see the clerk, and, to my great surprise, who should come in but Mr. Hornage, the drawer of the bill, with a police-man, and said he would give me in charge, for having paid away the bill, and got the proceeds in my pocket—I said, "Well, if that is the charge, I will go to the police-office at once"—I took the bill out of the drawer, and went to the police-office—I lost my 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the Magistrate said, "There is no charge against Mr. Lewis"—I was the injured party—one of the parties has run away, another has been indicted for perjury, and the third was taken for stealing—it was a plan to rob me of my money—I know the Baroness do Blaquire—several boxes were entrusted to my care; they belonged to the Baron, and were his property—I was never threatened with criminal proceedings for breaking open those boxes—nothing of the kind transpired what I did was by the Baron's authority, and it was his property.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I am a carver and gilder by business. I have known the prisoner King about twenty years—the signature of "Francis Gibbons" to this deed is my writing, and also the name of "Francis Gibbons" on the back—I wrote it in Aug., 1846—I called on Mr. King, at Barnard's Inn, for a little money that be owed me, and he said, "Now you are here, I want you to sign a deed"—I do not recollect what answer I made—he placed the deed before me—this is the deed—I think no one but King was present at the time—he had written out the name I was to sign on a piece of paper; and when I saw it was not my own name, which I supposed it was, I made an objection—I said I objected to write any other name but my own—he then stated that it was only a matter of form, and that any person passing through the Inn would answer the purpose quite as well as me—he said, "Don't you think for a moment that I would lead you into an error"—I then signed the deed—I made a mistake in the first signature; I put a letter wrong—this is the signature I speak of, at the bottom; the mistake I made was an "e" instead of an "i," or an "i" instead of an "e," I do not know which—I then signed this at the back; it was done at the same time—no one was present but King and myself at the time; it was all done within two minutes; I do not think there was any one there; I do not remember seeing any one as I was leaving the office, but I think Mr. Walbanck came in as I went out—I am not quite certain whether I spoke to Walbanck or not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not over and over again said that you never did sign this deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In consequence of its being copied from a piece of paper, when I first saw the deed I certainly did not know the handwriting; that was when Mr. Lee came up to my lodging—I told him it was not my handwriting; I thought so myself for some time—I have not the least doubt about it now—I do not recollect having said, in the presence of Mr. King or Mr. Dunn, that it was not my signature—I should not like to swear positively that I did not—I have not said to Mr. Dunn that it was not my signature, and that I knew nothing about it—I am sure I have not—I do not say I have not said so to any one, because it is possible I may have said so—I did say so to Mr. Lee, and at first I very likely said so to others, because it was my impression that it was not my handwriting; but afterwards the circumstances, more especially that little mistake in the name, came across my mind, and then it struck me that the circumstance took place—I have not seen the deed since I saw it in Mr. Lee's possession up to this moment when it was put into my hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In 1846 how long had you been with Mr. Lewis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a year, I should say—I was not an articled clerk—I believe there was afterwards a change in the firm from Lewis to Lewis and Cooke, and from Lewis and Cooke to Fisher and Cooke, at the death of Mr. Lewis; I was not there at that time—the Mr. Cooke is Mr. John Minn Cooke—I am now secretary to the Metropolitan Cab Company—I am also a shareholder to a considerable amount—I have 600 or 700 shares—I have paid 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon those shares—I paid that sum some time ago—I cannot say when—it was paid in different sums—the company has been in existence for the last eighteen months or more—during that period that sum has been paid—it has been caused to be paid—it has been paid by me—the amount of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had, I think, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week with Mr. Lewis besides perquisites which I was entitled to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you name any one sum which you have paid on account of these shares: paid yourself with your own hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, my salary as secretary has been going on, and therefore I consider that equal to a payment—I have given them credit for my salary, and they have given me the 500 or 600 shares, besides the moneys that I have paid—I really cannot say what amounts I have paid, but I have paid certain amounts, and certain amounts have passed to the credit of the Company—there are different sums, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I have passed to the credit of the Company by writing it in the books; that is paying.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me one payment that you have made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say on what day or in what month I paid that; if I had known you were going to ask me I could have brought the Company's books with me—I have paid 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—that is the utmost I have paid—I do not know the nominal value of the shares; how is it possible I can tell? the shares are 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I believe I am one of the trustees of the Company—I know that I am—I really do not know whether these shares are saleable now—I was one of the promoters of the Company, together with a gentleman of the name of Fellingham.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever, in the course of your time, used any other name besides the one you now use? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have; Walbanck is the name that I have taken, Charnock is my real name; I can explain the whole circumstance if you wish it—the fact is this: when I was very young I was drawn into pecuniary circumstances and liabilities; I afterwards mentioned it to a certain gentleman, and he advised me to alter my name—it was well known that those parties who were responsible with me would have to pay the liabilities, therefore they advised me, in order to carry it out, that I should not, being young, bear any responsibility, and that I had better change my name for a short time—I have changed my name for the last sixteen or seventeen years—my uncle was a banker in the country, and Williams, Deacon, and Co., in Birchin-lane, stopped payment, owing them between 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was drawn into it, and when my uncle's partner came up to London, post baste, in a chaise and four, he found that Williams, Deacon, and Co. were closed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you attribute the changing of the name to the failure of Williams, Deacon, and Co.; is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt about it—I have never used any other name, or answered to any other name besides—I am quite sure of that—I once lived in Osborn-street, Whitechapel, with a person of the name of Mr. Scott—there was such a person, I am quite certain—I do not know that I was frequently addressed there as Mr. Scott—Mr. Scott was is partnership with me, and he was there every day; if he was not there day by day, he was there four or five times during the week—we were house agents there—I was there, I suppose, for a year and a half—I did not leave without paying any rent—the fact is, the landlord died, it got into other hands, and the other party wished me to leave, and there were fixtures which I thought were quite equivalent to the rent—Mr. Scott went to Birmingham—I was manager of the Rotunda, in the Blackfriars-road—that was after leaving Barnard's Inn—it is a theatre—it did not require a licence, it was for Negro melodies—I did not keep a similar entertainment in Holborn—I went there occasionally; not to act; I took no part whatever in it—I merely went for amusement—I once lived in Bucklersbury, for a few weeks or a month or two—I think that was before I was at the Rotunda; I was at Osborn-street after the Rotunda—at Bucklersbury I answered to the name of Hilder and Co., under the instigation of Mr. King—I do not know hot long I was there; the landlord wanted the premises, and they were given up—I do not think there was any rent demanded.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had Wyatt been employed at Mr. Lewis's office before 22nd Aug.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not very long, I believe; some months, I should say—I did not engage him for Mr. King; I had no power to do so—this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is my writing—I certainly did not engage Wyatt—he was engrossing clerk, or anything else—this deed was engrossed by him—very likely I may have seen other deeds that were engrossed by him.</p>

I was in attendance on the deceased as day nurse for six weeks, and left through illness about four weeks before her death—the prisoner attended her—I have seen him administer several things to her; he did the emetics himself—she was sick about twice in the week—she also took powders; it was a kind of mixture which was kept by itself in a paper: the attended to that herself—she was able to get up in the middle of the day while I was with her; she sometimes seemed better, and sometimes worse—after being sick she seemed to breathe freer, and to receive ease from it—the prisoner attended her every day, to the best of my recollection.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 22, Arbour-place, Kingsland-road On 11th Feb. I was called in to examine the body of the deceased—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the lungs exhibited evidences of long-standing inflammation—the stomach was inflamed throughout its surface, and there were traces of incipient ulceration—the state of the lungs was certainly not the cause of the ulceration in the stomach—the ulceration proceeded, in my opinion, from some acrid substance being taken into the stomach—there was a fluid in the stomach at the time I examined it, amounting to three ounces, and of an olive green colour—that fluid was saved, and was afterwards gives to Dr. Letheby to be analyzed—my opinion is that the proximate cause of death was disease of the lungs and stomach; there was disease enough in the lungs to account for death—there was an effusion of something like sixteen ounces of fluid in the cavity of the chest, the result of inflammation of the lungs—seeing how the woman was, I should say lobelia was not a proper thing to be given; it would be likely to hasten death—cayenne pepper was not a good thing to administer to a person in that state—lobelia, cayenne pepper, and stimulants of that nature, would be apt to hasten the death of a person diseased as she appears to have been.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are cayenne pepper and lobelia stimulants of the same sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not of the same character; cayenne pepper is a powerful stimulant; lobelia is used in medicine in some diseases; it is of the tobacco tribe—it is not like stramonium exactly—the tribe is not called <hi rend="italic">datura</hi>; it belongs to the tribe lobelia—when I said it was of the tobacco tribe, I meant having similar effects on the constitution.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know that these gentlemen, who give something much more innocent than you do, do business more cheaply than you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have heard of Dr. Coffin; it is an ugly name—I do not trouble myself about the number of patients he and his followers have—it was the Coroner that sent for Dr. Letheby; I did not suggest it—I have never been a witness in any of these cases before—lobelia is a plant found in the United States—I have never seen the shrub; I have seen it in powder and in the leaf—I have seen the seeds once, and the leaf several times—I have known a considerable number of instances of lobelia being administered—I have administered it as a sedative, in the shape of tincture, not as an emetic—it will act as an emetic—should not give emetics in cases of inflammation of the lungs—under some circumstances, I should give an emetic to get rid of phlegm—phlegm is generally in the air passage—there were no tubercles in the deceased's lungs—there was adhesion of the lungs to the chest—the sign of athma, on poet <hi rend="italic">mortem</hi> examination, is inflammation of the air passages, but not of the surface of the lungs—there was inflammation of the air passages, but not enough to account for a very serious state of asthma—she had not asthma seriously—I know that her breathing was bad; I attribute that to the disease of the structure of the lungs, and not to asthma.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is lobelia given for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is given for asthma in small doses—there is always a sign of asthma upon dissection; you have thickening as the result of inflammation, and the passages filled with mucus, which has been thrown out of those passages; unless that was the case, the patient could not have had asthma—if a patient had spasmodic asthma, and died suddenly, there would be symptoms found, a thickening and mucus—I never saw a person in a fit of spasmodic asthma which stopped suddenly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> is there an opinion among scientific persons that there is such a thing as spasmodic asthma arising from disease of the nerves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been called such, and thought so—there is an opinion that there is a nervous asthma, which hinders a man from breathing, spasmodically, and then he breathes on again—I have never opened the body of a person afflicted with that kind of asthma; it would not leave traces on dissection; it would be a disease of the nerves—the respiratory nerves ate the eighth pair—you cannot detect disease of the eighth pair of nerves on cutting a man up—that particular species of asthma leaves no trace discernible on dissection—lobelia was given a good deal for asthma; I think I recollect it being given fifteen or sixteen years ago; since that it has been in vogue, and some people trust it more than others—it is a disadvantage to me not to have had the opportunity of seeing the person alive during the time of the treatment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of No. 61, High-street, Hoxton. I was called on to assist Mr. Clarke, and examined the deceased with him—I agree with him perfectly as far as facts go, but do not pledge myself to his opinions—the lungs were extensively diseased, seeing which, I should decidedly say that lobelia was not a proper drug to administer; I think it would tend to hasten death—I have not had considerable experience in giving lobelia; I have given it two or three times in cases of asthma, but it has not relieved in my hands—I administered fifteen or twenty drops of the tincture—the tincture is made by macerating the leaves in spirits of wine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How did you intend the lobelia to act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I depend upon it chiefly as an anti-spasmodic—I attribute the asthma to the nerves; it sometimes arises from the nerves, and sometimes from other causes.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280040"/>
               <p>and from mixed causes—I gave it in cases of asthma arising from the nerves. and producing spasmodic breathing—that is a sort of breathing which goes on a little time and then stops, and the person breathes properly again—I cannot say where I got my lobelia from; I know that that makes a difference with every medicine, as also does the quality of the spirit in which it is made up—I do not pledge myself to agree with the last witness in some things—I am not aware that there is a great difference in the medical profession about the exhibition of lobelia; as with all other medicines, it requires some knowledge of the quantity to be applied to render it at all efficient—when I applied it, I found it did not act on the nerves.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M. D. I am a professor of chemistry and toxicology, at the London Hospital. I have received certain bottles from the last witness and some powder, also the contents of a stomach from Mr. Clarke—I have analysed the powder—it does not contain anything of a very deleterious nature; cayenne pepper is the only thing—this pbial (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) contains lobelia—I analysed the contents of the stomach, and found 110 grains of the seeds of lobelia—that quantity is quite sufficient to kill; I have known less than that kill, considerably less—I have heard from the medical gentlemen the state the lungs were in—lobelia was a highly improper drug to administer to a person whose lungs were diseased as this woman's were—in my opinion, lobelia given to a person so diseased would hasten death—I found more than enough to kill in the stomach—larger doses than that have been given with impunity certainly, because it is very irritating, and the stomach discharges itself of it by reason of the vomiting it occasions; but when it remains on the stomach, one third of that quantity kills—it is not used by medical practitioners at all as an emetic, because of its danger—I examined the other bottles; one contains a quantity of Cayenne pepper alone, and the others demulcient medicine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In what state was the digestion of the woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing at all of the condition of the woman; I did not see the stomach, only its contents, which the constable brought me—I found a small quantity of cayenne pepper in the stomach, but it was only on searching very rigorously; it was not more than a person might take in some article of food—a great portion of the active principle of the lobelia had been taken out, but the structure of the seed was there—no doubt the active principle was gone into the stomach of the woman, but the powder remained—this would not kill anybody, it is inert now—this is the husk, or, in other words, the woody matter of the seed, the active principle being dissolved—it would be very difficult to digest it, or to get rid of it at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the woman's bowels were not active, it would not pass off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Digestion does not depend upon that; if the bowels were not active, it would pass out of the stomach into the bowels just the same—the whole system is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280041"/>
               <p>not always weakened immediately before death; sometimes persons are killed in a moment, when the whole system is in a state of activity—in the case of a woman dying gradually in six weeks, her system would be very much weakened—I have had a great many cases of lobelia—I was a witness here against a gentleman who I afterwards heard through the public papers was acquitted, and I have seen him out since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you got some lobelia there, which has not been in the deceased's stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the powder at the bottom of this bottle—I have added spirits of wine to it to make a tincture of it in order to test it—when a person gets tincture of lobelia, he does not get powder in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much pure lobelia could you extract out of this quantity, supposing it had not got into the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Allow me to calculate: the quantity of powder there is equal to two ounces of tincture of lobelia—110 grains; but the actual essence is obtained with great difficulty, and there has been no per centage arrived at—about one third of the seed is soluble in spirit—this is not soluble at all—this quantity of husk is equal to 147 grains of the seed; the active principle contained in that would have been thirty-seven grains, equal to 147 grains of the former seed, or two ounces of tincture, put it in which way you like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you a doctor of medicine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am a bachelor of medicine, of the London University, and practice medicine at the hospital—I know that lobelia is given by medical persons, and in cases of asthma—it is given is cases which I think imprudent, unless the system has become accustomed to it, there is not then so much harm done—this 110 grains is a sort of husk of the wood, like the grains of malt, which has had all the goodness or badness taken out of it, and is not digestible in a weak stomach—such a thing night happen as its remaining in the stomach from day to day, or it might pass out into the alimentary canal—I cannot say how long it would take, as such a difference of opinion exists—all the quality has been got out of it in the stomach by maceration; that is, assuming that none of the quality had been got out of it before it got into the stomach, which I cannot tell—I found a mere inert matter, not capable of digestion in a weak stomach—if it went into the stomach in an active state, it most have remained there long enough for the liquid to dissolve all the active principle in it—the question how long that would take, has matter of scientific opinion involved in it; some physicians believe digestion to take three or four hours, and others believe that there are circumstances existing under which it has not taken place under twenty-four hours, and you have all kinds of opinions between the four and the twenty-four—I will not venture to offer an opinion at all; if the stomach is weak, it may still have the power of dissolving vegetable matter—sometimes a weak stomach would dissolve the seed quicker than a strong one—I should think that this was a very weak stomach—such a thing might happen, that the stomach of a person just going to die would dissolve anything much quicker than that of a robust one—I have known digestion take place after death—this is the seed of lobelia; the plant has been raised in this country; it is grown as a common plant in our gardens; it has a little blue flower, and is cultivated for its beauty in almost every garden—it is a natural family—Linnaeus would have called it a class; a genus is a subdivision of a natural family—tobacco is not of that family—here are some seeds from the stomach (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the plant itself has much less smell than the seeds usually have—the seeds contain more of the active principle than the leaves, although they have not a smell—lobelia, in combination with an acid has no smell, it keeps its odour down—the active principle of this plant is an alkali, and until</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280042"/>
               <p>the alkali is set free by another acid, you cannot smell the lobelia—tincture of lobelia has a smell, the acid sets the smell free—some doctors fancy the ethereal tincture of lobelia; I like it, and give a good deal of it—I think lobelia a very excellent medicine in its proper place—I should give from five to twenty drops, made with ether or spirits; we make both of the same strength.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 67, Eagle-street, Holborn, and am a French polisher; the prisoner is my wife. On Friday week I was with her at a public house—there was no one in particular with us; there were several persons there—we had three quarterns of gin between three of us—the other person was a woman; I cannot say her name—that other woman had one glass, I and my wife had the rest—we drank in our turns—I do not think my wife drank more than I did, or that I drank more than her—we went to the public house about 8 o'clock, and left it between 11 and 12 o'clock—we both</p>

I have stabbed him?"—I still lay on the bed, and hallooed out and knocked with my feet en the floor till the policeman came—I was afterwards taken to the hospital, and was there from Saturday morning till Thursday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon, at Gray's-inn-lane Hospital. The last witness was brought there about 2 o'clock in the morning of the 19th—I examined him; he had a wound through the right upper eyelid, dividing the whole lid and wounding the outside of the eyeball, a small cut on the nose, one cut on the lip, and two cuts on the right hand—the wound on the eye was severe, and it was dangerous—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by this knife if it were used with violence—it does not appear to be a sharp knife—the wound on the face was very slight; the wound on the lip was more severe—he is not likely to lose his sight—the wounds on the nose and lip were in such a direction that I think they could have been inflicted at the same time with the wound in the eye, by withdrawing the knife.</p>

I have done it! take him to some hospital," she rose up, and said, "I will go with you"—she seemed rather excited; there were no tears—I took the knife out of her hand, and took her to the station, after I had sent one of the other lodgers for another constable—I remained in the cell with the prisoner till 3 o'clock; Robert Adams, another constable who stops at the station, was in the cell part of the time—while I was in the cell, the prisoner said, "If I get out, I shall soon be here again"—she then said, "I will <hi rend="italic">pay him out</hi> for putting me in this cold place all night; "that was between 4 and 5 o'clock, when she had been there an hour and a half.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280046"/>
               <p>of it were, "In consequence of your not pressing the judgment got by you against me, I hereby agree to give you possession of my beerhouse"—I went with the prisoner to the beerhouse—it is called the Market-house—he there gave roe formal possession—I found a person there having a bill of sale on behalf of Mr. Chandler—I asked the prisoner for the key of the door and it could not be found—then it turned out there was another door, and the key of that could not be found—I asked him to give me formal possession; to repeat the words after me, that he gave me formal possession according to the agreement—I went to call on some customers, and left the prisoner in the house, and the man in possession—when I returned I saw the prisoner and he asked me to let him look at the document he had signed—I think I said to him that he had no occasion, as he had heard it read before signing it—he said, "Nevertheless you will oblige me by allowing me to have it"—he said, he wanted to read it himself—I handed it to him; he began to read it, but he had not proceeded far when he folded it tip and attempted to put it in his pocket—he was in the act of doing it when I, exclaimed," Denning, that is very unfair,"—I said, "you must return it, "and I then attempted to struggle with him to get bold of it—he said very little; I do not remember that he said anything, he was very quiet—but I found he was stronger that I was, and it appeared to me that be passed a paper; I cannot swear that it was the paper—he handed it over his shoulder, and it appeared to me he gave it to another party; this was while I was struggling with him—he was holding it up to keep it out of my reach—after the paper appeared to put, he said, "It is no use your struggling, it is gone"—in a few minutes I heard a female voice cry," It is burnt; the paper is burnt.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many persons were in the room when he asked you to let him look at it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The party who held the bill of sale was one, and I dare say there might be two beside—that was in the bar of the beershop—we went afterwards to a room beyond; it was there the struggle took place—then was Denning there, and I think be called another person to come—I think he called some name, but I cannot tell what it was</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am anxious to have this very little that was said by the prisoner when he got hold of the paper and was reading it, and you said he must give it you back—what was it he said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What I meant to express by that was he said little or nothing—most decidedly he did not say, "I did not know that I had signed such a paper, I must show it to some one else"—I have a clerk named Bishop—he is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Some time prior to this, had not Mr. Bishop stated that he bad had a communication with the prisoner touching the disposal of his business to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on the morning before this document was signed; it was consequent on that that it was signed—Mr. Bishop did not tell me that inasmuch as there was a bill of sale in the house and a judgment, he would sell his business to me for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. provided I would pay the bill of sale out; nothing of the kind—I had obtained judgment I think for about 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand that the prisoner had agreed to make over to you his interest in the establishment merely in consequence of your discharging the judgment against him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The empty house he had—he had already given the power over everything in the house under a bill of sale—I certainly had not undertaken to pay out that bill of sale—there was no agreement about the fixtures; I was to have nothing but the empty house—I could not have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the meaning of this in the memorandum:" In consideration of your not enforcing the judgment against me, I agree to deliver up to you the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you got to Mr. Burnell, did you ask the prisoner to remain down stairs and mind the horse and gig, while you went up to your solicitor. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did for a short time—I went up, leaving him with the horse and gig, but it was not in the first instance—it was in the latter instance—my direction to prepare the draft was an afterthought that I had in coming away.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You left the prisoner down stairs with the horse and gig, and while you were up stairs Mr. Burnell wrote this agreement in Mr. Denning's absence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he was not down stairs with the horse and gig at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I thought you said you left him down stairs with the horse and gig? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You went down stairs to Mr. Denning. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went down stairs and requested him to go up stairs, because it would be as well to make a written agreement—it was not drawn up when I went up stairs, I had other avocations to go to while it was drawing—it was being drawn when Mr. Denning and I went up stairs—I had given directions about it before—I did not see Mr. Burnell give him any copy of it—I had not signed it—after this transaction I put it in my pocket and drove away, and Mr. Denning with me, to the house itself, which is called the Market-house, in Market-street, Stepney—there Mr. Denning took it in his band and began to read it—I think he had not it in his hand more than a minute or two, time enough to read half a dozen lines—he was then folding it up; he had not succeeded in putting it in his pocket—I am not prepared to state that this paper did not drop on the floor in the scuffle between us—I heard some one exclaim, "It is burnt;" I think it was a female voice.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it read over to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When it was ready, in Mr. Burnett's own private room—Mr. Burnell read it—there was no objection made by the prisoner to any expression—my impression is, but I will not be sure, that it was read over twice to him—I did not see it fall on the floor—I saw it folded up, and attempted to be put in his pocket, and I said, "Denning, that is unfair;" and I made an effort to recover it, and afterwards he seemed to pass the same paper as it were over his shoulder, and shortly afterwards he exclaimed, "It is gone from me.

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">on the same side</hi>) <hi rend="italic">urged that it was a stealing from Dalgleish, and that the opinion of the Jury must be asked upon that; that the form of taking the check to Benazuz was only a cover to what he meant to do with it; that he got it, in the first instance, from Webb for the purpose of stealing it; that the taking the check to Benazuz did not sufficiently disconnect the prisoner from the relationship to his master as to render him irresponsible for the criminal act he committed. The whole of the evidence evinced that his intention was to rob his master, and it was for the Jury to say whether at the time he handed the check to Benazuz he did not mean to act it back again; for unless the delivery to Benazuz was a bond fide delivery</hi> (<hi rend="italic">which was a question for the Jury</hi>) <hi rend="italic">it did not alter the relationship of master and servant.</hi>

                  </hi>. I remember 14th March, 1851; it was on a Friday. I was passing the Blue Anchor between 10 and 11 o'clock at night—I heard the people halloo in the street, and a man pointed up to a window—I looked up, and saw the prisoner and another man get out—I was about two yards from the window; I walked up, and might have put my hand on the prisoner's shoulder if I had known what was the matter at the time—I had known the prisoner for some time; I used to go to the same school with him—I could not be mistaken in him—it was a beautiful moonlight night; it shone right on the window—when they got out they ran along the leads, and jumped from there to the tiles, from there to the gate, and jumped down—when they got from the gate to the ground, I walked up, and might have put my hand on the prisoner—the other man was George Ellis; I knew him well before—I did not know where the prisoner lived at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were so near you could have put your hand on them, if you had known there had been a robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw the two men come out of the window, run along the leads and on the tiles, and on the gate, and jump down and run away—I did not know what it was—a man came out of the house and pointed to the window; he did not say anything—I did not think there was a robbery—I did not know what the people were screaming and calling about; I thought there was a fight, or something—I did not give it a thought—I did not know that there was some robbery—I was passing the house in going home—I knew Ellis; he lived in Amwell-street, the first house on the left hand side—he used to work at Tucker's factory—I believe at that time he had nothing to do; he might have been out of work for six months—I had seen a good deal of him during that time—I was at that time working at a distiller's, at Bromley—I had worked three or four years before that time, sometimes three or four days in a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been examined before, and cross-examined—had you worked three years before that, or only two days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the week of the robbery I think I worked two days—when I did not get work I lived at home with my father and mother, and I do so still—I work now at Curry's and at Hughes'—they are both distillers—I only worked at the gas-works that day—I worked at the distillers three years before the robbery—I never was in any difficulty.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you seize the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were gone so quick—I have had no quarrel with the prisoner—when they came away there was a man came out of the house, and cried, "Stop thief!"—I ran after them, but could not catch them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since this matter occurred, haveyouseen the prisoner in Whitechapel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I saw him in Ratcliff-highway ten weeks ago last Saturday—he was with another person—I could not get near enough to him to take him—I have seen him several times since the robbery—I saw him at Hackney two or three times—I gave information to the constable each time I saw him—when I saw him ten weeks ago I expect he saw me, and he ran away too quick for me—I ran after him 200 or 300 yards—he went up the Commercial-road towards Whitechapel church—it was about half-past 10 o'clock in the day—I did not call police—there were not a great many people about—I spoke to a policeman, and he had seen him the day before in company with two more in the Commercial-road—I worked at the distillers for three years, two days a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not before stateyouhad been working with your father? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he worked there—the prisoner had a cap on, and a dark jacket—I do not think the name of this prisoner was mentioned on the former trial—I did not give information on the night of the robbery—I went home and went to bed—I did not see any constable that night—I knew there had been a robbery when the man came out—I did not go back to the Blue Anchor; I met my mother as I came back, and she persuaded me not to go—I mentioned the prisoner's name on the morning after the robbery to Mr. Gifford, when he came down to my house after me—I told him Who the other prisoner was—there was a handkerchief left by Ellis in the Blue Anchor, which led to his being taken—the officer found it with the plate tied in it—if the policeman bad not come to me I would not have given information—the policeman came to me because my brother was standing at the Blue Anchor door, and I told him I knew who they were.</p>

On a Thursday, I do not know the day of the month, I was at work with the prisoner in the cellar—he said in the morning, "I should like to have a few halfpence, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>"—he said he wanted a pair of boots very badly for himself, and a pair for his wife—he said, "There are a few bottles up stairs, which I think I am entitled to have, because I brought seventeen or eighteen dozen from a gentleman's house at Winchmore-hill"—(Mr. Eastby has allowed us to bring home bottles to make up the stars)—I said I should not like to do it, unless Mr. Eastby was aware of it—he did not tell me how many bottles there were, pints and quarts together—I asked him—he said he did not know—I asked him how much he would get for the pints and quarts—he said he should not get more than 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen for the pints, and the quarts he did not know how much he should get for—he said, "I will give you some of it"—I did pot see the witness Farmer—I wrote this paper at the prisoner's request, and gave it him on the Saturday, between 2 and 3 o'clock—he told me what to write—I wrote" Mr. Garrod, bottle merchant, Red Lion-street, Holbom"—I did not see the bottles put in the baskets—he did not tell me how many there were in each basket—I law three baskets; but there were more than three baskets behind the door, and they were filled with bottles—I did not tell my master, because the prisoner said he thought he was entitled to them; so I did not think it any harm to write the bit of paper—I believed the prisoner was entitled to all the bottles that came from Winchmore-hill, because he was the cellarman.</p>

I have only known the prisoner since he has been in custody—he has nothing to do with the Gresham-office—he was not an agent for loans, and has never been employed by the Society; if he had been an agent for obtaining debtors to the Society I should have known it—he did come to the office and ask me about Hillmer's case, and I said it bad not been proceeded with—when loans are advanced to persons on their insuring, there is a fee for making inquiries as to the securities—the prisoner did not pay me any fee on account of Mr. Lynn, or anybody else—if he had paid it at the office, it must have passed into my hands—I have made inquiries about the prisoner.</p>

On 17th Nov. an old man, who seemed nearly blind, came to my house with a boy, and engaged an apartment—the day after he came the old man asked me to write to his agent, Mr. Rickerby, of Stamford-street, for him—the next day the prisoner came, asked for Mr. Ratten, and it was understood he came from Mr. Rickerby, the blind man Mr. Ratten's agent—he was taken up to Mr. Ratten—I was in the room with Mr. Ratten, and when the prisoner came in he said, "Well, young man, what is the reason Mr. Rickerby," or "your master did not come?" I think he said "Mr. Rickerby"—the prisoner said he was very unwell; he had got a bad cold, and he would call upon him in a day or two—the blind man then said, "Tell your master to send all my title deeds"—the prisoner said, "Very well, Sir"—the prisoner came again next day; my daughter took him up to Mr. Ratten, and he asked him if he had brought his title deeds—the prisoner said he had, and delivered five or six to him—I then left the room, and a short time afterwards the prisoner left the house—after the prisoner was gone the old man asked my wife if she had a drawer where she could place the deeds in safety—I saw the deeds that evening, but they were not put into my hands till the next morning, when the old man brought them to me and said, "What is this?"—he showed it me to read, he was apparently blind—there was" C. A. Ratten, Esq., Cherry Orchard, Dorking, "on one parchment deed—I saw several of them, and he called them his title deeds—after I had looked at them, he said, "I hope you are perfectly satisfied, "and said he had sent for them for my satisfaction—(he had represented himself to be a man of house property when he took the apartments)—being a blind man I told him I had no reason to doubt him—a few days after that a letter came for him, which my daughter took to him and read to him in his presence—I saw this promissory note taken from it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>:" Leatherhead, Dec. 4th, 1852.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through the interpreter</hi>). My name is Oaka. I am a native of the Sandwich Islands—I remember the ship <hi rend="italic">Pekin</hi> coming to Honolulu in the summer of last year—the prisoner was chief mate of the ship—I, with fourteen other natives of the Sandwich Islands, was engaged to work the ship to England—there were fifteen of us—among us was one who died on board the vessel as she was coming home—his name was Kaila; that was his foreign name—his native name was <hi rend="italic">Kawadaloilio</hi>—the name by which he was known by the foreigners was Doyle, or Kaila—we left Honolulu on board the <hi rend="italic">Pekin</hi>—there were fifteen natives on board, and eight foreigners—there were twenty-three persons altogether—I remember Doyle, or Kaila's death—it was four months after we went on board—I remember something happening to him the day before he died—on the day before his dying, I saw the mate (the prisoner) strike him in the face or eye—I remember the mate ordering Doyle to go up the rigging—at that time Doyle had a disease in his feet, which caused him great pain—when he was ordered to go up the rigging, he went up—the first thing I noticed was the officer (the prisoner) calling upon him to make haste; he said, "Go up quickly;" and the next thing I saw was the officer following him with a piece of wood—it was like what we call a handspike—according to my recollection, it was a piece of wood as long as my arm, and nearly as large as my arm; I saw the officer, with the piece of wood in his hand, follow Kaila, and strike him at the back of the neck three times, and then he fell down on the deck—I should think it was about four fathoms from the place where he was to the deck—he fell with his face to the deck—he did not catch or touch the ropes as he fell, but fell directly to the deck—after he fell, he had not power to rise or to move, but continued as if asleep or insensible—he remained there from noon until the evening—whilst he was lying on the deck, I saw the prisoner with a cord or rope strike him three times.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he carried below in the evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was; and we laid him in the cabin, and looked at his neck, and saw a dark place on his neck, and also on his back—the time when the prisoner struck him in the eye was before that time that he struck him with the wood; it was not the same day—Doyle continued till past midnight, and died just before daylight—while the mate was striking Doyle, the captain was in the stern; he could not see the striking; Mr. Gumming, the second mate, was aloft—all of us who were aloft could see the mate strike Doyle; the vessel bad three masts—I was aloft when the mate struck Doyle; I was on the right side, on the same side that Doyle fell—he had a shirt on—after the falling, and the striking with the rope, and while he was lying on the deck, the captain came to the place, and saw him lie—nothing was done for him by the captain or the mate, or any of the foreigners, from the time of his falling—the sun was directly over head when he was committed to the deep—before that he was wrapped and sewn up in a blanket; he was sewn up by <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, one of the natives—from the time that he lay on the deck, neither the captain, the first officer, the second officer, or any of the foreigners, came to him, or did anything with him; <hi rend="italic">we</hi> took him down, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> examined his body, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> wrapped him up and sewed him up in the blanket, and I myself put the shot at his feet, to make him sink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you just now state that the mate struck Doyle on the eye the day before he died? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not on that day, it was on a previous day—if I said so, I did not understand—it was not on that day—at the time this happened it was a day of wind but not a tempestuous day—the wind was so strong, the sails being all out, that the captain was afraid it would break the mast, and ordered us up to make the sails less—we had all gone up aloft but Doyle; he remained below, in consequence of the pain in his feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner carry the hand-spike up in one hand or both? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He took the wood up in one hand, and when he got up he stood with his feet on the rigging, and took both hands to hold the stick, and struck Doyle with the stick in both hands, three times—when he came down he threw away the piece of wood down on the deck—the rope that he then took up and beat Doyle with was a piece of rope belonging to the rigging that we had been making on a former day, and It was near one of the pins by the side of the ship—it was a common piece of rigging—it was not so big as my arm—it was the ordinary size of rope for rigging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the captain or one of the officers order you and the other natives to carry the man down below, directly they saw him lying on the deck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the time of his falling down, the captain, the first officer, the second officer, did not say anything to us, but told us to go on with the work of the ship—he was left there till the evening, and in the evening they told us to take him away—we had never objected to Doyle's being down in the cabin with us—the time before, when the prisoner struck him in the eye, and his eye was bad, the company of chiefs (the officers) in the ship took him aft, and took him away from us—we could not say why they did so; perhaps because</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280080"/>
               <p>they were angry with us—we do not know the foundation of evil—we did not refuse to let him come into our company—at the time of the striking I was towards the outside of the rigging, on the higher side, the windward side (a <hi rend="italic">sketch of a ship was here shown to the witness, upon which he pointed out the position of the prisoner and deceased and himself</hi>)—I was at the extreme point—Doyle was here, and the officer was down at the bottom; and on account of my being at the extreme point I could see very clearly—we were all of us up on the yard, on the sail, the wind was flapping the sail about and we were holding on, but I was at the end and saw distinctly—I do not know whether some of the men had come down before the beating was over or not, but I did not see any.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the general treatment of the crew, with the exception of this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For one week after we left Honolulu, until after the first sabbath of our sailing, they behaved kindly to us, they behaved well to us; but after that they behaved differently; and on several occasions the captain was very angry, the first officer was very angry, the second officer was very angry, the third officer was very angry, and they were frequently very angry with us, and we were in fear.</p>

My name is Ka-a-vee—on board the ship they called me <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—I am a native of the Sandwich Islands. I went on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Pekin</hi>—I recollect the death of Doyle—I saw the striking of his eye—afterwards I saw the striking—we were all ordered aloft; the greater part had gone aloft—I was near Doyle, and was going aloft, I had not got up; I was on the rigging, going up, and the officer (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the prisoner</hi>) called to Doyle, and said, "Go up quick, quick! quick, quick!" but Doyle could not go up quickly, in consequence of the pain of his feet—I do not know correctly how high Doyle had got up before anything occurred, perhaps it was about four fathoms—I do not think it was quite so high as this room—I then saw the officer hit him with a wood—he took the piece of wood from the deck, and struck him on the back of the neck—I saw him strike him four times, he then fell down on the deck—he fell with his face downwards—while he was lying on the deck, I saw the prisoner strike him with a rope on the back—at this time the sun was climbing towards the centre, but was not quite over our heads—Doyle had his general ordinary health, common health—we had all been working that day, and Doyle with us—the mate knew that Doyle's feet were bad—after he was struck with the rope he was left on the deck for a long time—he did not speak at all after he fell—the captain and the officers looked at him as they went about; they did not examine his person, they did not look scrutinously, they did not handle him—he died at very nearly the opening of the day—before he died we saw marks on his back, when we took him down; we also saw a mark on the neck—that was where I had seen him struck; it was a reddish mark, as if from a blow—it was not a very large place that was black, but a larger place that was red, it was on the back of his neck; it was not very long, it was wider than long—<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> sewed him up before he was thrown into the sea; the captain and mate did not examine him before he was thrown into the sea; it was in the middle of the day that he was thrown over; the sun was just above us, and it was very near to having our dinner.</p>

               <p>when Doyle was struck with the rope on the deck—what he was struck with in the rigging was what we, the natives, call the wood; foreigners call it a handspike—the mate took the wood in his left hand, and took hold of the rope to go up with his right hand, till he got to Doyle, then he again said, "Make haste!" and struck him with the wood on the neck—when he struck the wood was in his right hand, but he held with his knees on to the ropes of the ship, and took both hands to the wood—I saw him myself thrust his knee through the rattlin of the rigging, to hold himself fast, and then take both bands to the wood—I taw him strike him four times, in the same manner, with both hands.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the general treatment during the voyage, with the exception of this individual case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Within a week after we had got out to sea they called us <hi rend="italic">niggers</hi>, and said we were brutes; and were very angry with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what language did they call you brutes?—how did they express themselves? Do you understand English? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very little I know, not much—they did not beat us, but we had very little food—we did not mess with them—we, the natives, had our food together, not with the foreigners—there was no disease on board but such as is common among us; some of us had boils on parts of our bodies, and Doyle had a very bad foot—we arrived in England in good health.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember being examined before the Lord Mayor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes (<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>); I put this mark to this paper—what I then said was true (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>:—"This deponent, Joe (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>) on his oath, says, I am a native of the Sandwich Island, Honolulu. I knew Doyle; I think his name was Makaolu—I recollect his dying in the ship—I had not seen anybody do anything to him before he died, only one beat him; it was the mate, about 12 o'clock—I was in the main top.</p>

               <p>Doyle was down on deck—the mate beat him with a stick, or wood, or rope, or something or other, across the back of the neck—he beat him one time, and he fell; then he was going to get up, and could not—he fell down, and was like sleep; he lay down, that is all—I did not hear him speak—no one else beat him—he was taken forward—he had nothing to eat after that—I speak to him; he cannot speak—I help carry him forward, and he could not open his eyes clearly (<hi rend="italic">the witness turns up his eyes, and catches his breath</hi>)—the mate was the prisoner—he, Doyle, was not sick before—he was black on the neck and one eye when I sewed him up; he was also black on the back and other parts—I saw the mate strike him, and he fell down, and then the mate struck him two or three times, and he could pot get up again, and I think that he died from that—I was in the main top—Doyle was called to go up, but he had had a large foot and could not, and that was the cause of the mate striking him—he struck him on the ribs, as well as the neck—the mate struck him on the eye with his hand, and made that bad; the mate then went down and got a wood, and struck him with that—I told the captain in the morning the man was dead, and he told me to sew him up—we all went to tell the captain—Doyle had done his work in the morning with us; he did not then seem ill or in pain—I did not see the captain or second mate there when the prisoner beat him—the captain was astern at that time—Mr. Gumming was aloft with us.</p>

                  </hi>. I was master of the ship <hi rend="italic">Pekin.</hi> At the latter end of the year 1850, she was chartered by the agents of the Hudson's Bay Company upon a voyage to the Columbia River—we arrived at Columbia River in June, 1851, and there discharged our cargo—after we arrived there, sixteen of the crew deserted, I think the second day after our arrival there—I was detained there thirteen months—I was only able to engage three seamen to assist me in navigating the ship to the Sandwich Islands—I arrived at Honolulu about 23rd or 24th Aug., 1852—I stayed there ten or eleven days, and finding I could get no English seamen to navigate the vessel, I engaged fifteen natives with the sanction of the Governor—I left Honolulu on 2nd Sept.—I had a list of their names furnished to me, but I never could get them to answer to their names—I think only three out of the fifteen had been to sea—besides the natives, my crew consisted of Mr. Vaile my chief officer; Mr. Gumming, my second officer; Loftus, my third officer; two apprentices and the steward; making seven with myself—I gave the natives English names—the deceased was called Doyle—(he natives were extremely lazy and dirty, and they refused to let the man Doyle down below for many weeks, I think for as long as five weeks, during which time I had the man aft, always under my own eye, to see that he got his allowance of food and that he ate it himself, that the others did not rob him of it—I observed nothing particular about the man as to his state of health, only that he was rather slow—on two previous occasions he complained of headache, and I gave him a little simple medicine—he had not been to sea before—I remember some time before he died his being missed on the watch being called over, which was about 8 o'clock in the evening—we hunted for him high and low about the vessel until about half past 9 o'clock I think, when we found him stowed between the spars in the after part of the vessel, with a great quantity of biscuit stowed away in his shirt, which he had taken off his body—I cannot tell for what purpose he was there, but his own comrades the natives brought him up from there, and then he either pretended to be or was in a state of insensibility; however, I found the hartshorn bottle quickly relieved him, he came to his senses, and remained on the main hatch rolled up in his blanket the whole of the night,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280084"/>
               <p>and in the morning he got up and ate his breakfast the same as the others did—he was extremely indolent, and most filthy—I believe it was through that in the first instance that the other men would not associate with him—he would never even take down his trowsers—on 30th Dec, 1852, we were a little distance from the Western Islands—I cannot say the exact latitude—my logbook is here (<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>)—on 30th Dec. we were about 44° 38' north, and 26° west—about noon that day there was an increasing gale, so much so that I had recourse to take in our close reefed main top sail, under which sail alone the ship then was—for that purpose all hands were ordered aloft—both myself and the chief officer were below—it is not usual for either the chief officer or the commander to go aloft—I was on deck, on the poop—I was then taking noon observations, it must have been only a few minutes before noon—I saw Doyle going up the rigging very slowly, and I called Mr. Vaile's attention to him—he was on the port side or left side of the rigging, what is called the shrouds—the other men were all aloft—when I called Mr. Vaile's attention to him he first told him to be quick, and on his remaining standing in the rigging, not moving at all, Mr. Vaile went up the rigging and made him fast with a small piece of broken lead line, which was a piece of condemned lead line—he took and made him fast round the body to one of the shrouds—at this time the wind was blowing very much, and there was a very heavy sea—after Mr. Vaile had passed the line round him he came down on deck—I told him it was of no use punishing the man, that he had better let him come down; and he went up and let him come down accordingly—he walked down the rigging, I swear to that—I was observing Mr. Vaile while he was up in the rigging—I saw the whole of it—no blow whatever was struck by Mr. Vaile or by any person else—Doyle came down the rigging himself—when he came down I believe Mr. Vaile would have struck him had he not been stopped, but Mr. Gumming was down on deck at the time, and he said, Oh, Vaile, it is no use to strike him" and I immediately said the same thing, and Mr. Vaile never struck him at all—when he went up into the rigging, he had nothing whatever in his hand but this small piece of condemned lead line—he had no handspike or anything of the sort—when he was going to strike him it was with the piece of lead line that he had untied, and brought down out of the rigging—the line was about three quarters of an inch in girth I suppose, a small line by which we heave a hand lead, it is made in three strands—after I had interfered, and prevented Vaile from striking Doyle, Doyle stood by the gangway for some short time, and after that he seated himself down on deck—I dare say he was standing by the gangway two or three minutes—he then squatted himself down on deck in the gangway—I did not give any directions then as to what was to be done with him—afterwards Mr. Vaile himself ordered him to be taken forward—that was when he had lain down—it was their custom very often to lie down on deck immediately they had knocked off work—the men were sent to their dinner after this reefing was done—Mr. Vaile ordered some of the men to take Doyle below—he was not taken below—they took him forward, and put him underneath the top-gallant forecastle, and there left him—at 7 o'clock in the evening I heard that he was still lying underneath the top-gallant forecastle—that is a place which is extremely wet in bad weather; it was very wet at that time—I did nothing with him—he was lying there to all appearance asleep, he had his blankets round him—he was taken down after that by Mr. Vaile's directions—on the morning of the 31st I received information of his death—the body was brought on deck about noon of that day—I examined the body, and so did Mr. Vaile—I observed no marks of violence upon it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280085"/>
               <p>whatever—I examined it carefully—I cannot account for his death in any other way than natural causes—that was the conclusion to which I came from the examination of the body, and from what I knew of his previous state of health—Mr. Vaile has been with me since Aug., 1849, I have never known a kinder officer in my time at sea, which has been twenty-two years—supposing the deceased to have fallen from the rigging, where he was, he must have fallen overboard—he could not possibly have fallen inboard for this reason, that the rigging would serve as a network; and he being in the left band side of the rigging, it was quite impossible for Mr. Vaile to strike him at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just explain, was he on the windward side? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was on the weather side, the windward side, that is the port side; the wind was if anything on the port quarter, and the yards were nearly square; if he had fallen be must have fallen overboard—the ship was perfectly upright, the wind was very nearly <hi rend="italic">aft</hi>; it would not cause any inclination, the yards had no <hi rend="italic">cant</hi> whatever—they were square; we were what we call <hi rend="italic">scudding</hi>—there was a very heavy sea at the time—the motion was forward, up and down—the impetus given by the wind would be in the line of the ship's wake—he could not have fallen through the rigging on the deck, it would form a perfect net—he was on the mainmast, on the side of the rigging next the sea; if he had fallen he must have fallen into the sea, the shrouds would have thrown him that way; they were sloping that way; he was not more than one-third of the way up the main rigging; he could not possibly have fallen clear of the shrouds, the rattlin of the rigging forming a perfect net work would have stopped him—that network is generally about twelve or fourteen inches wide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if the ship were rocking somewhat fore and aft, whichever way it happened to be rocking at the moment the man lost his hold, he would be thrown backwards or forwards in the direction of the rocking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The width of the rigging would prevent that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What, twelve inches? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is merely one section of the rattlin; the rigging has a spread of many feet; I should think it might be twelve feet in width fore and aft, and there was a space of twelve feet through which he could not fall; he must have been projected six feet forward or backward in order to fall, and there was not rock enough of the ship for that.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whether that were so or no, are you quite positive that you were observing him, and that he did not fall, and that no blow was struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am perfectly positive of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How high was he up when your mate, Vaile, fastened him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should judge about one-third the distance up the main rigging; I should think that would not be more than eighteen feet at the utmost—I knew that he had a club foot; I knew that he had a small crack in his foot, which is very common with all seamen; that would not be a subject of any pain whatever; it is caused by sea water; it is not a thing to be of any inconvenience at all: I noticed the fact of his having it, because the men had stated that his feet were sore some days previous, and I had seen what it was, and told him what to do for it; we generally apply a small piece of worsted; I have oftentimes had them myself, and I never got off my duty through having them—during the time I had them I had to mount the rigging—I do not think the crack in the foot was a matter to cause pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you use worsted; do you mean worsted thread? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it is a small crack caused by the sea water; it comes just under the big toe, and if you pass a piece of worsted round it it is not of the least inconvenience—you tie it right in the crack.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280086"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At all events he had complained of a score foot previously? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had; in addition to that he had a club foot—his feet Were thick, both were the same; they were not deformed, they were very short and thick—he walked in a very strange manner at all times—we had a heavy sea and a high wind at this time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose it did not occur to you that tying one of the men to the mast would help the navigation of the vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would help the discipline; it was necessary that some punishment should be adopted in order to prevent others; I thought that tying him up was a good thing, though I did not order him to be tied to the rigging, I ordered him to be liberated—he was there, I should think, from two to five minutes; he might have been then only a minute, I cannot say; I cannot tell the exact time, it was about that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Turn to the log, if you please, and read me the account of this man's death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The account put down is merely this: "About 4 o'clock in the morning departed this life one of the Kanakas, Doyle"—there is nothing stated about his having been tied to the rigging—the chief mate keeps the log; he called my attention to that entry, so far as this, I overhauled the log after the chief mate had written it—every week I generally look over the log.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here was a man who to all appearance was perfectly well somewhere about 12 o'clock in the day, and who died a very few hours afterwards; did you make any inquiries as to what could have caused his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made inquiries of one or two—I found he bad not received his food for one or two previous days, that Bull had had part of it, and a man of the name of <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> had had another part—it was from one of the other Kanakas that I heard that Bull had had his food—I think that was one reason why he was weaker than he would have been—it was not necessary to enter that in the log; he was not starved to death—we never do put such things in the log, I have never seen it in my experience—I should not have entered in the log if he had been struck—he was not struck, therefore there was no necessity to enter it—if he had been struck, and I thought it had murdered the man, I should most undoubtedly have entered it, but not otherwise—there is not sufficient reason to enter every time a man is touched on board a ship—except from his food being eaten, I have no other mode of accounting for his death, unless it be from natural causes which were unknown to me, I not being a surgeon—I examined his neck—I will swear that there was nothing but folds of dirt on the back of his neck, there was he mark that I saw but the mark of dirt; there were two or three layers of it, two or three folds; there was no appearance whatever of redness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What made you examine the back of his neck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I examined him all over round about the head and face; his mouth was swelled, that was the only part I found—Mr. Vaile also examined him before we had him sewn up—we felt his body, I did not examine his body—I examined the back of his neck because I could see it—I stayed there while the roan was being sewn up—his mouth was the only part that was swollen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did that appear to be from a blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; his lips appeared swollen.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been in the habit of swearing at him at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, that I really cannot answer, because I might tell a falsehood by saying so—I do not remember having done so—I did at times swear at the men—I never called him a d—d <hi rend="italic">nigger</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">nigger</hi>—I will swear that—I never heard him called a <hi rend="italic">nigger</hi> by any one—I never heard the other men</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280087"/>
               <p>called <hi rend="italic">niggers</hi>—I have heard them called brutes, but not d—d brutes—there is no memorandum in the log, of the deceased being found between the spars with his shirt full of biscuit two or three weeks before his death; we do not enter such things in the log—there is no memorandum in the log, of any illness of his to my knowledge, there may be (<hi rend="italic">referring to the log</hi>)—there is not in this at all events; it would be in the other book if there was any—I have stated that it would be impossible for Mr. Vaile to have struck him; tying him is quite a different thing, a man might tie him though he could not strike him; he could not hold on with his feet and knees in the main rigging—he could hold on sufficiently to tie him, but not to strike him—he had the use of both his hands to tie him; he could pass his bands right round the shrouds, which he did—I cannot say the exact length of the line he used, it might be a fathom—I heard Doyle say nothing, but when he was down on deck he asked one of the natives for some water in his own language—I think the mate told him to be quick up the rigging—that was all I heard him say—and then he went and tied him—I was standing on the poop—the other men were aloft—Tom was aloft, and Johnny Bull also, on the same mast they had gone up before—these men had never made any complaints, they seemed perfectly satisfied—they never made any complaints to me, or of me to my knowledge—when we were at the Sandwich Islands, and were short of the crew, a guarantee was given by the agent of the Hudson's Bay Company there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you got to London did you make any communication of the death of one of these men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I spoke of it in the office; I spoke of it also at Newcastle—I did not make any communication to the Company—it was in Messrs. T. and W. Smith's offices that I spoke of it—I did not tell the owners, because they were not there—I stated in the office that one of the natives had died—Mr. Southern was there at the time.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mentioned the name of some person who was there. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Southern, he was in the room it the time I made the statement—I did not make any particular statement, I spoke of it, that one of the men out of the fifteen had died coming home—I had nothing-whatever to do with the Hudson's Bay Company, after delivering my cargo at Columbia River—when I returned, the log and papers were given up in the ordinary way to the owners at Newcastle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your charter by the Hudson's Bay Company finished at Columbia River? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I then came to England on account of my owners—I went and cut a cargo of spars and wood as a cargo—the burden of the ship was 562 tons; her complement was thirty-two hands, we were very short—I went down the Columbia River at the risk of my life, with three men and an apprentice; some of the men ran away and went to California; some remained there in the river working for American people, they got better wages than with me, they got something near 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month; I wish I could have ran away myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked about these men making any complaint; did either of them during the rest of the voyage make any complaint or representation to you of any violence done to this man Doyle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None of them ever made a complaint to me of anything of the sort.</p>

               <p>—the crew deserted, as a matter of course—when we got to the Sandwich Islands the captain made an arrangement to get some natives, and fifteen natives came on board, among whom was one who went by the name of Doyle; he was about as brutally used as a man could be, by the rest of the men—he was kicked, rope's-ended, and turned out of the forecastle in 61 1/2 latitude, at as cold a place as there is in that latitude—he slept in a small locker on deck, which was used for boatswain's stores—I know no more reason for this than that the men seemed to have a dislike to him and his dirty habits; the particular dislike arose from that—they were not quartered pretty close to one another about the forecastle—there was no degree of dirt or nuisance but what he would be guilty of—Mr. Vaile was obliged to let him sleep in the locker—he told the other men to let him in several times, but they would not, and then the poor man had no other place than the open deck, so of course Mr. Vaile let him have this place as a shelter—I remember some time before Doyle's death his being missed in the ship, I cannot swear to the time, it may be five or six weeks before his death, he was found on the port side between decks, stowed among the spars, which we were bringing home as part cargo and part ballast—I was not one of the persons that found him—I saw him after he had been brought on deck; he was in a complete state of nature—the captain administered restoratives to him in the shape of hartshorn—he was rolled in blankets and laid on the main batch, but whether he really was insensible, or whether it was skulking, I cannot pretend to say, nor yet the exact time at which he appeared to come to—he was well next day—no provisions were found in this place at that exact time; I believe some days afterwards the captain was down looking round the ship, and in among the spars where Doyle was found, was a shirt which I had given him some months before; and in that shirt was wrapped a large quantity of bread, which he evidently must have stolen—I remember the day before Doyle died; it was blowing a pretty smart gale of wind, it was necessary to take in as much sail as we possibly could—all hands were called to shorten sail—I heard that order given; I was in my cabin at the time, and went out on deck to take my station, which was in the front of the yard, on the main topsail yard, on the weather-quarter—I went up there—I went up after all the others, as I always did—<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> went up before me—I cannot say where Doyle was when I went up, he must have been skulking somewhere; I had not seen him among the other men, or I should also have seen him aloft before I had gone—I did not see him after I had got up aloft, I could not see him from aloft, that is too dangerous a game to be trying, to look down on deck at that which is underneath you, my life is of more value; I saw all the men, <hi rend="italic">Joe, Tom</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Johnny Bull</hi>, up on the yards, but their exact situations on the yards I do not know; I cannot say whether they were close to me or not; I should not think they were on the same yard, because <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> was invariably down to leeward with the eldest apprentice, Waite, that was his station by rights, he received orders to go there; we were all at work on one sail, the main topsail, we were all on the same yard, it was blowing a gale of wind, it could not blow much harder unless it was a hurricane—it is generally pretty difficult to hold on, unless you keep your eyes about you—the yard I was on is attached to the main topmast—the men engaged in reefing a sail are looking forward, except the two at the <hi rend="italic">earing</hi>—one of them looks one way, and one the other, both amidships—the men were on the same yard with me, and I could not see where Doyle was—I could not see the main rigging, the maintop interfered and intercepted my view—the sail was also flapping about—I remained up until the main topsail"</p>

               <p>was reefed—I then came down, and the other men also, we were all coming down at the same time—as I came down I passed Doyle in the rigging, he was then walking down slowly, I was getting down as quick as I could out of the cold, he was walking slowly down; I saw him step over the gangway, which is about the height of four feet, and step down on deck, and stand there about a minute or two—I saw Mr. Vaile about to strike him with a piece of condemned lead line; I said to him, "What is the good of striking him, he is no use at any time, you may as well let him be;" and he did not strike him—I then went away, and when I came back next, Doyle was lying on the main deck very comfortably stretched out—that may have been about ten minutes afterwards; I did not hear the order given to remove him; I missed him off the deck about 1 o'clock; it was my watch on the deck from 12 to 6 o'clock; I had to attend to the steering of the ship, in fact I had to do it myself, because none of the Kanaka's could do it in a gale; therefore the order being given by Vaile, on the deck, I could not hear it at the helm; but at 1 o'clock I was just at the break of the poop, and missed him from there—it is not true that he remained there for six or seven hours after I first saw him—I found out afterwards that he was taken forward under the top gallant forecastle—that is a wet place, especially in bad weather; I was only told of his being there, I did not see him there myself—I next saw him when he was dead, that was about 11 o'clock next day; I saw his body then—I did not observe any marks whatever of blows about him; I noticed the back of his neck and shoulders while they were sewing him up; I did not help to sew him up. Heaven forbid—I saw no mark, or anything but the natural dirt of him; it is the nature of them to be dirty; they are an unnatural set; they are always in a dirty state, and in a very uncomfortable state too, I am certain.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know of any article of dress having been given to the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I know that a great many had been given to him, some by the captain, some by myself, some by the steward, and some by Mr. Vaile—when he came on board he bad a pair of trowsers and a shirt, and with that he left to go a four months' voyage; that was the only rag he had belonging to him—I have been acquainted with Mr. Vaile since the Aug. of 1849—as an officer those above him can give him the highest character; for my own part I shall be glad to imitate his mode of proceeding as a superior officer; as a man he is one of the kindest-hearted men that ever lived, a better cannot live.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What countryman are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was born in the City and Liberties of Westminster, in the county of Middlesex, Sir—I did not call these fellows <hi rend="italic">niggers</hi>; they are not so good as <hi rend="italic">niggers</hi>, because a <hi rend="italic">nigger</hi> is a clean and a willing man, whereas these men are dirty and lazy—these are not so good as those <hi rend="italic">niggers</hi> that I have been accustomed to—Doyle got brutally ill used by his countrymen and rope's ended—I frequently interfered with them—I took hold of a man named George, and shook him pretty heavily one day for it, because Doyle was a much less man than him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When this man was dead, if he had been so brutally ill used, kicked, and beaten, did it not occur to you that it would be worth while to examine his body to see if there were any marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it did not; I am no</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280090"/>
               <p>coroner—I had no idea of such a thing—I should come to a conclusion without looking to see if there were any marks—the conclusion that I did come to was that he perhaps had died from those causes—I came to no conclusion—it was not ray place to examine him, I cannot say whose place it was—nobody examined his body that I saw, there was no special examination—I cannot pretend to say whether the captain knew that he had been brutally ill used—I did not tell him—I reported when they stole the food from him I did not report their brutally ill treating him, I dare say I might have mentioned it, but if is a thing I have quite forgotten—I do not know whether there is any such thing in the log; I neither wrote the log or looked at it—it was ten minutes after he had gone down from the shrouds by himself that I found him lying comfortably on the deck—I do not know whether I am bound in duty to answer whether I put my toe to him and turned him round to see who he was, but I did not—he was lying very comfortably, full length, I do not say he was stretched straight out—he was not lying on his face, apparently on his side—I could see his face, his lips were not swollen—I am on my oath—they were not swollen—I did not stoop down to him—I looked at him; I wondered what business he had to lie there—I did not ask him, because I had done with him; I did not trouble myself at all about him; he was no use when he was up—I cannot say whether it was necessary to take in the sails any more that day; I really have forgotten; we take in sail and make sail so frequently, perhaps three or four times in four hours—it was not necessary to take in sail again within ten or twelve minutes that I recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is taking in sail? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Shortening sail, reducing the quantity—we went up in this gale of wind to do that—we did it—you have to reduce or increase sail, according as the gale increases or not—it was very nearly as high a wind as could blow—we had very little sail.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you saw Vaile about to strike Doyle; just show us what he was doing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you have got a small piece of lead line I can show you in a minute—he was just going to hit him so (<hi rend="italic">waving his hand</hi>)—I cannot pretend to say whether I was up in the rigging again that day, I might have been up in the rigging half a dozen times that day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE WHITBY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have told us that you ordered all hands aloft for the purpose of reefing the main topsail? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we could not have done it again that day, considering it was the last and closest reef that we took in; but there were other sails loose besides that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember whether you took in any more sail? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did not take in any more—the mainsail was already taken in, but it was furled afterwards; it was hauled up at the time of the main topsail being reefed, but it was not furled; it was all had snugly up by the buntings, lashings, and so on, close to the yard, ready for furling—the main topsail was then put into the same state, that is, close reefed, so that it could not be reefed any closer, unless it were clewed up and furled also; therefore, after that sail was close reefed, the mainsail alone was left—in the heaviest gale the vessel generally reduces all but her close reefed main topsail; that is merely to counterbalance the effect of a heavy sea on the ship; it enables her to obey the rudder.</p>

               <p>him—I passed him in the rigging; he was then coming down—I was a little below him—he was coming down slower than I was—when I got on deck I had duties to perform, and I saw him come down and step over the gangway—he walked down on deck himself—I saw him standing in the gangway—I was there perhaps four minutes, and then went away, and saw no more of him—after I went away I heard the prisoner tell the natives to take Doyle below, and they took him under the forecastle; that was perhaps twenty minutes or half an hour after I came down from the rigging—I did not go to the forecastle at that time; I went at 7 o'clock in the evening, and he was then in a very wet state, and I told the prisoner that he was lying in the forecastle, under the topgallant, and they had not taken him below as he had ordered—the men were pumping the ship out at that time, but the prisoner would not let them go on till they had taken him down, and then they took him down—I saw his dead body next day for two or three minutes—I noticed no marks of violence, but I did not look for that particular purpose—if there had been marks on the neck or back I should have seen them—I have known the prisoner since 1850; he is the kindest officer I was ever with.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So then a piece of line was the mode adopted to request them to go to their work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at first, till we found they would not go without—I did not find it necessary to start them for the first week—we had a moderately quick passage; it was not one of the best ever known, it was not extraordinarily quick—I did not see the man tied in the rigging—I never saw any man tied in the rigging, that I recollect—I have been at sea three years and a half—we took these men on board at the Sandwich Islands; we were then going into a warmer climate—it was warmer during this week than it was at the Sandwich Islands—this is my name to these depositions (<hi rend="italic">these being read, stated</hi>, "I saw the deceased lashed in the rigging; I did not see who lashed him in it; it was in the forenoon; we were all coming down from aloft, and I passed him coming down")—that is what I said before the Lord Mayor, it is true—he was just untying himself when I got down, when I passed him coming down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which is true; what you have sworn to-day, or what you swore before the Lord Mayor, or are either of them true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know that he came down directly after me; I have made a mistake about saying I saw him lashed there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let me call your particular attention to what you did swear: you said, "He was well, to all appearance, prior to his death. I recollect the day before he died, the weather was very windy that day. I saw the deceased lashed in the rigging; I did not see who lashed him in; it was in the forenoon, we were all coming down from aloft, and I passed him coming down; he came down almost directly after us; I did not see him unloose himself, but I heard that he did;" now is that all a mistake? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is all the same as I have said just now, except that I said I saw him lashed there—he might have been tied there, for anything I know, when I passed him coming down—I do not know whether he was lashed at the moment—I am apprenticed to Mr. Thomas Smith—I do not know whether I am</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you heard that anybody had unfastened themselves from the rigging? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I heard that the deceased had unfastened himself from the shrouds—I did not as I came down take sufficient notice of him to see whether he was lashed to the rigging or not—I was down on deck about two minutes before he came down—I heard the prisoner give directions for him to be carried below—from the time of his giving those directions until the prisoner was carried to the forecastle, there was no going aloft to do anything to the sails, or anything of that kind that I remember, but I cannot remember exactly.</p>

I reside and carry on business at No. 10, Winchester-street, Old Broad-street—the prisoner is my son—he lost his mother on 20th Sept—previous to her death I had been in the habit of employing him, but I never could get him to work regularly; he would work nowhere—he did not commit any assault on me at the time she was lying ill—after the death of Mrs. Corton he worked for me at times, and I wished to keep him on, if I could—I was at my house in the morning of 4th Feb.—I recollect the prisoner coming; it was about 10 o'clock, as nigh as I can guess, or it might be later (he did not lodge in my house)—I asked him if he thought it was a proper hour to come to work, and if he could not come before that he had better go back again, I had nothing for him—I do not know what words he used—he sat himself down on a chair in the shop, and not being dressed in shop dress, it was not altogether proper—after some time he went down into the cellar, or workshop, and soon after I went into the back yard, and hearing a cry from my errand boy I went down in the workshop to them, and the boy told me that the prisoner had knocked him about, and had thrown his cap on the fire, or on a piece of hot iron—the prisoner was close to the fire, near to the lad—on the boy making this complaint, I told the prisoner to go out of the place, I would not have him there—he said, "What for?" and said he would not go for me at first, and I then put my hand on his shoulder to push him up—I got him up stairs, and he went into the other shop, in the front shop—I there told him to go; I had some trouble to get him to go—when I got him to the door he made a rush at me, and struck me on the right jaw with his fist; it was a pretty sharp blow, and it is swelled a little—after he struck me this blow he ran away, and turned the corner of the street, and finding me following him he ran back again and into the shop, as I understood, but I did not follow him down—when I got back he was gone down in the cellar—I sent for a policeman; he came to the house, and the prisoner was concealed in the cellar; I could not find him for some time—we found him in the front cellar, and I gave him in charge of the policeman fur striking me—I went to the station house in Moor-lane with him and the officer, and my eldest son—when we got to the station the prisoner denied the charge, and the constable discharged him, there being no corroborative evidence—I went back to my house, and the prisoner was there; he had got down stairs again—I had no conversation with him, he having gone down to work—I went out directly, leaving him in the house; I went to the Mansion House to take out a summons—I did not get a summons, they said there was a long case on—I went to the Mansion House three times, and after that I returned to my own house—I went into the shop; the prisoner was there, and my daughter, and my other son—the prisoner came in from the cellar, and he asked me if I was going to take out a warrant against him; I said, "Yes"—he began to abuse me, and I went to him to put him out; Salter, the boy, was at that time in the shop—the pri<lb/>soner</p>

               <p>struck me on the nose—I could not say what he struck me with, the blood was all streaming down; it was done with some sharp instrument—this blow on the nose was struck in the shop; I was trying to put him out, and I received various blows with this knife—I did not see the knife in his hand—I received the first blow on the nose; it has been strapped up—I received one blow on this right thumb—the leader is all dead now—I received one on the third finger of my left hand, one in the throat, and one just on the heart; they were all wounds, and all bled—I cannot say in what way they were given; I fenced them off, but how I received them I cannot tell—here is a scar on my breast, and one on my throat—I had a coat on, a waistcoat, a shirt, and a flannel waistcoat underneath—the instrument which made the wound on my breast, cut through all those clothes—here is the coat; it is cut through on the arm, on the breast, and on the neck too—after I had received these wounds, my eldest son called to me, and said, "Father, take the knife;" and I saw the knife held up by my eldest son, who had struggled with the prisoner and had taken the knife from him—I was bleeding very much; I became faint from loss of blood; I fainted in the doctor's shop—this is the knife; it seems a new one—I had never seen my son with it before—I had seen him with a knife, which I have got in my pocket, but not this knife—this is the knife which my son William had in his hand after I had been stabbed—at the time this took place, the prisoner was under recognizances to keep the peace towards me—I was taken to the hospital in a <hi rend="italic">cab—</hi> I was there a fortnight at first, and then I had to go back again—I was attended by Dr. Coleman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am brother to the prisoner. On Friday, 4th Feb., I recollect being down in the workshop with the prisoner and the lad Salter—the lad was rather saucy to him, and he gave him a clout on the head—it knocked his cap off, and it fell on a piece of iron that a man was working, and the boy said he would smash his nose for it—the boy cried, and my father came down in the cellar—the boy did not make any complaint to my father that I heard—there was no complaint made, but my father ordered my brother out because the lad was crying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When your father came down stairs, did he not ask the boy what he was crying for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in my hearing—I have not stated that before that I am aware of—I am not aware that the boy said the prisoner had been knocking him about—I did not hear it—my father ordered the prisoner out—he did not go out directly—he was carried up by the policeman and my father—I went with them to the station—I did not see the prisoner strike my father any blow—the blow was struck before the policeman came down.</p>

I was on duty in Great Winchester-street, about a quarter before 3 o'clock, I saw the prisoner near Mr. Corton's house; I saw blood on his face; he was in company with his brother—I inquired what the matter was, and hit brother answered he had been stabbing his father—his father afterwards came out of the house, accompanied with his porter—I saw blood on the father's face, and a wound on his nose; he appeared in a very weak state, and quite agitated—I asked him if I was to take the prisoner into custody? he said, "Yes;" adding at the same time that he had stabbed him in the heart, or to the heart—I took the prisoner to the station—he alleged that he was suffering from kicks he had received from his father in the abdomen, and he could not proceed quick to the station; he could not walk quick—I searched him at the station, and found on him two duplicates, two keys, an old penknife, an old pocket-book, and a bottle of what Dr. Simpson pronounced to be chloroform—I took the prisoner to Bartholomew's Hospital—he remained all night in custody, and was discharged about four o'clock the following evening, and I took him to the station—I took him before the Magistrate—he was remanded, and was finally committed for trial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—I remember Mr. Corton being brought there on 4th Feb.—I did not notice the time, I know it was before 5 o'clock—I examined his person; I found a wound over his nose, one over the left collar-bone, one over the cartilage of the sixth rib, near the breast-bone, one on the right thumb, one on the ring finger of the left-hand, one on the right fore-arm, near the elbow, and one on the back part of the left thigh; they were all punctured wounds, with the exception of the one on the arm, which was an incised wound—they were all wounds which might have been inflicted by a knife of this description—the one over the cartilage of the sixth rib is very near the region of the heart—the point of the instrument seemed to have impinged on the cartilage of the rib which attaches the rib to the breast-bone; it seemed to have slipped up a little—the wound was a quarter of an inch deep and three-quarters of an inch wide; it went a little beyond the edge of the rib—the rib seemed to have stopped it going to the heart—if it had gone between the ribs it would have reached the heart, and death would have occurred shortly—from the wound in the chest he had symptoms of inflammation of the lungs, for which he was removed to another ward—from the blow on the breast having gone through a coat, a waistcoat, a shirt, and an under waist<lb/>coat,</p>

On 4th Feb., I was acting-sergeant at Moor-lane-station—the prisoner was brought there on the 4th Feb., at 20 minutes before 1 o'clock, on a charge of assaulting his father—the father was present, and made the charge against him—there was no other witness, and I told him I could not take the charge; he might summon him, which I recommended him to do—we require in all cases a corroborative witness, unless there are marks of violence—the prisoner was charged again at 3 o'clock with this charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I was passing along the road, which leads from Ilford to Chadwell-heath, on Tuesday, 8th Feb.—I passed Barley-lane about 9 o'clock, walking in a direction towards Ilford and London, and from Chadwell—I cannot tell what distance Barley-lane is from Barking—I did not notice any person standing there when I passed Barley-lane—when I had got nearly a quarter of a mile from Barley-lane, I heard something which induced me to look back, and I saw a man beating another with a stick; he</p>

               <p>knocked his hat off, and the man cried, "Murder!"—Mr. Toller was one, and the prisoner the other—I returned towards them, and shouted, "Leave off! leave off!"—I saw Mr. Toller knocked down by a great many blows with a large stick; he held up his hands to defend himself—as I was advancing, I saw the prisoner take a knife from his person, and cut the throat of the deceased—I was at that time about forty yards from them—I saw Mr. Willis in the other direction—on getting up, I did not speak to the prisoner; Mr. Willis spoke, and said, "Why, you have killed the man"—the prisoner said, "He tried to murder me, and now I have murdered him"—he had a knife in one hand and a stick in the other—Willis went away towards Chadwell for the police; he ran the same way as I did—neither of us said what we were going for—I noticed the prisoner going away towards Ilford; that way leads to the Seven Kings' Watering—Barley-lane leads out of the high road, and the Seven Kings' Watering is a running water that crosses the road—the prisoner went running off—I never saw the deceased move—this is very like the stick I saw the prisoner beating him with (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I will not swear to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, living at Chadwell-heath. I knew the deceased perfectly well, I believe he was a commission agent; he has told me that he sold things on commisson—he was in the habit of going to London; he mostly went on foot—I think he went every day, I have been in the habit of seeing him every day on the road (Chadwell-heath is ten miles from Whitechapel Church); he was a quiet man in his disposition, and had a wife and five children—he was, I believe, about forty-eight years of age—his place of abode was about a mile, or perhaps a little more, from Barley-lane—it would be his regular way to London to pass the end of Barley-lane—on that Tuesday morning, shortly after 9 o'clock, I heard the report that Mr. Toller was murdered—it caused very great excitement—I saw several persons who had been to see the man who was murdered, but I did not see any of them looking after the prisoner—I commenced my rounds with my cart to serve my customers—I went towards a place called Little-heath, and palled up at the opposite end of Barley-lane, to where the murder had been committed, to serve a customer at a tobacco shop, Mrs. Inglish—at that place three roads join, one goes by Chadwell to Little-heath, which I went along; Barley-lane is the second, and the third goes to the Forest—I know the brook, Seven Kings' Watering, that does not lead directly to the tobacco shop, but a person could get to it by going round—I was inside Mrs. Inglish's house, which is a beershop and chandler's shop; the prisoner came to the door, and asked for a halfpenny worth of tobacco—he did not come into the house; he said he had got a box, and asked for a lucifer or two—the tobacco and some lucifers were supplied to him, and he left the house and went towards, Barley-lane—I had never seen him before—I was going away when I saw my dogs following him down Barley-lane, which I thought very strange, as they are very shy of any one—I followed him shortly afterwards (he had no stick with him at the shop)—I came up with him just at the end of the lane, when he was with a policeman—I said to Metcalfe, in his hearing. "You have got him just in time, I was after him;" the prisoner is the man—I went for Willis, the gardener, brought him back, and he identified the prisoner; he said, "That is the man"—I do not think the prisoner made any answer to that—I took the policeman and the prisoner to Ilford gaol in my cart; on the way the prisoner said something (he was not asked any question before he said so, nor was anything said as to whether it would be better for him to tell the truth)—he said, "I will tell you the truth, he once attempted to murder me, and now I have murdered him; he once hindered me</p>

I received information of this murder, about a quarter past 9 o'clock; I went to the end of Barley-lane, on the road, and there found the dead body of Mr. Toller—I knew him well—he was a peaceable inoffensive man; very much so—the body was lying on the footpath with the throat cut, and quite warm—there were several marks about the head where he had been beaten about with something—the body was removed to the Grey Hound Inn, at Chad well, where the Inquest met—that was the body on which the Inquest was held—I obtained from Willis the description of the person who was said to have committed the deed; and about 10 minutes or a quarter past 10 o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Barley-lane, and saw the prisoner coming down Barley-lane, from Little-heath, towards where I was standing—his dress did not agree with the description I had received from Willis—I went and met him, and asked him where he came from—he said from Chelmsford and Romford—Barley-lane is not in the way from Chelmsford; on the contrary, it leads from the forest—I observed spots of blood on his coat and trowsers, and asked him how he came by the blood on his clothes; he said he had cut his finger with a flint stone; and unwrapped a piece of rag from his finger, and showed me a wound upon it, which was bleeding at the time—I did not take him into custody, but walked alongside of him in the direction of Willis'; past the spot where I had found the dead body lying—his trowsers were very wet nearly up to the knee—about that time Gaywood the butcher came up with his cart, and fetched Willis out of his garden, who said, "That is the man"—the prisoner made no remark to that, and I took him into custody—Gaywood took me and the prisoner in his cart towards Ilford Gaol—on the way the prisoner said, "I will tell the truth, he once attempted to murder me, and now I have murdered him"—I cautioned him, and said that whatever he said would be used against him again—he said, "He once hindered me from getting 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and something to eat, and a night's lodging;" and said there were four or five others, who he would have served the same if there had been time; that he did not do it for want, but something he knew of him before—this stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found on 25th Feb. by a man named George Cole; he did not touch it, I saw it lying on the ground; itwas</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will you be kind enough to listen to my reading a passage from a work, and tell me whether your opinion as a medical man coincides with that,—"There can be no doubt from the concurrent testimony of all writers on insanity, that a predisposition to the disease it frequently transmitted from parent to child through many generations The malady may not always show itself in such cases, because the offspring may pass through life without being exposed to any exciting cause; but in general the malady supervenes from very slight causes?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I perfectly agree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "This predisposition to insanity is much more readily transmitted through the female than through the male parent"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite true—I saw the prisoner in Ilford gaol; I was called to treat him for the wound on his finger—I had conversation with him several times—he appeared to me to be labouring under a delusion, not only as to the deceased having attempted to murder him, but that several other persons were in a conspiracy to murder him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon all the circumstances of hereditary insanity in a family, and that the party committing the crime was cognizant of the consequences of that crime, which would be the loss of his life, and that on the commission of that crime, instead of attempting to escape from justice, he delivered himself up to the law, and seemed reckless of the consequences, are you, as a medical man, prepared to say whether those circumstances taken together, and the commission of the crime, indicate a sound or unsound state of mind in the criminal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unsound, rather; certainly they would—I have not of my own knowledge known persons become suddenly insane whose conduct had been previously only eccentric—I have, as a medical man, given my attention to the subject of insanity.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you seen much of your brother during the last few years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; occasionally he would call on me, but he has been a wanderer for twelve or fourteen years—I saw him last, as near as I can remember, a month before Christmas—he stayed with me about a quarter of an hour—he was very much excited—his conversation was on the Catholic religion—he said there were men after him who would kill him, go which way he would—his conversation was of an excited nature during the whole of the quarter of an hour he was with me—he left me after that—he wandered outside my door for a long time before he entered the house on each occasion that he called—I had to press him to come in each time that he visited me—I endeavoured to reason him out of that, but to no effect—he considered that he was superior to any other person, and that he should have a good deal of money and be a gentleman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, at No. 6, Acre-lane, Brixton. On Thursday, 27th Jan., at a few minutes past 8 o'clock in the evening, as I was going along Brighton-terrace, which is a turning out of the Brixton-road, I was overtaken and accosted by a female, who asked me if I knew of a Dr. Wallis living in that neighbourhood—I told her I knew no such person, and she asked me some other question relative to a singing master, who I knew nothing about—I then walked on some few yards past a customer's, in Brighton-terrace, where I was going to, and then stopped—I was in the act of naming to her that there were some fresh families in a square just above, where she might probably find the person she was in search of, and at that moment the prisoner was stepping across the road towards where I was standing—there were the usual quantity of gas lamps about, one on each side of the road; about every thirty-five or forty yards—the prisoner came up to me, and said, "You d—d villain!" or some words to that effect, "you have insulted that woman"—before I could make any reply, he struck me a violent blow on the front of the face, and knocked me down; from the effect of the blow,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280112"/>
               <p>and the alarm, I was insensible for some short time—on coming to myself, I found myself lying on my right side, and saw the woman standing over me—I immediately got up, and saw the prisoner and another man going across the road; I had seen the other man following in the prisoner's wake as he came up to me, before he struck me—when I got up, the woman had got hold of me by the collar and the cuff of the coat—I immediately disengaged myself from her, and ran after the prisoner and his companion; they were then going down Brighton-terrace again, towards the Brixton-road; Brighton-terrace leads through a square, and turning to the left, leads near to Acre-lane; it was formerly closed at the end, but lately has been made a thoroughfare—when I first saw the prisoner, he appeared to have been up the terrace, and was coming back towards me, meeting me and the woman in an opposite direction—I pursued the prisoner and the other man—I passed the other man, who was the shorter of the two, and came up with the prisoner; he was just in the act of passing a lamp between him and me—I put my hand against him on the right side, and said, "You thief, you have got my purse"—I then saw his face very plainly; there was a lamp directly behind me—the light was clear upon his face; I saw his countenance as clearly and distinctly as I see it now—he said to me," Me? I never saw you before in my life"—he then turned up to where I had left his companion, and they both ran away together towards where the woman was left, back up to Brighton-terrace—they were the only persons I saw in Brighton-terrace—I pursued them, crying," Police! Stop thief!" very many times, until I brought out many of the neighbours on both sides of me; I pursued them up the terrace to a field at the top, where they made their escape—they went over into the field; I am quite sure the prisoner is one of the persons who went into the field—I immediately ran back, picked up my hat and umbrella, and went to the station-house, which did not take me more than two minutes—I got two policemen, and went with them to Shepherd's-lane, which leads to the field where I saw the men go in; it is no thoroughfare, I believe—we walked about thirty or forty yards up the lane, and met the prisoner coming down the lane from the direction of the field—directly I got to him I said, "That is the man that knocked me down; "this was not more than five minutes after I saw him go into the field—supposing him to have been the same person, he would have had to travel across the field, about 300 yards, and down the lane—I told the policemen that was the man who knocked me down, and the prisoner said, "Me? I never saw you before in my life"—I said, "So you told me before;" I then gave him in charge—there is a light at the end of the lane where we found him; I do not believe the lights go all the way up the lane, but they do at that end—the policemen asked what business he had there; he said he had been to the Exhibition (meaning the New Crystal Palace), looking for work, and had lost his way—the lane is not a place that could be taken for the high road; it is a narrow lane, with no thoroughfare—he said he was a stranger in London, and had only been three weeks from Manchester—this is my purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it was made by my daughter—I had it in my pocket when I was first accosted; I had not been out of my own house three minutes—it contained two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, and either 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, which was all gone when the purse was recovered—I missed my purse immediately on recovering my legs, after being knocked down—a man found the purse next morning in Acre-lane, just by my own house; I saw it afterwards before the Magistrate.</p>

The prisoners took a furnished room at my house in Oct., and stayed till 24th Dec.—they had not given me any notice when they left, and there was a week's rent due; they took the keys of the room door and the street door—after they had left I had their room unlocked, went in and missed a blanket, two pillows, four pillow cases, and a sheet which were in the room when it was let to them—in consequence of inquiries I went to Mr. Chapman's, and found all my things there—about a week after Christmas, I found the prisoners together at a lodging they had taken—they said it was distress drove them to it.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody in Gravel-lane—I searched him at the station, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his trowsers pocket—there were marks of wet blood on it—the prisoner's right hand had a good deal of blood on it—he was very drunk—at the station the prosecutor had his right hand bound up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I dressed the prosecutor's hand on this night—I found one incised wound on the wrist, and another across the knuckles—the extensor tendon of the fore finger was cut; he will only recover the partial use of it; there is partial loss of power in the finger—the wrist is now perfectly well—a knife of this kind would be sufficient to make such wounds—the prosecutor was perfectly sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does the tendon lie over the knuckle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a slight incision would cut it, but there must be some force attached to it—the tendon lies very superficially—a very deep cut cannot be made on the back of the hand—he has been under my care almost to the present time; I dressed his hand two days ago—any cut on the tendon requires considerable time to heal—the cut on his wrist was very simple—I do not know that it is absolutely necessary for him to have his arm in a bandage.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BIRNIE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it useful? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but not absolutely necessary—although the tendon lies near the surface, a certain degree of force is necessary to sever it.

                  </hi>. I keep the Half-way public house, in Webber-street, Blackfriar's-road. On 27th Jan. I was called by my wife to give change—I came into the bar, and I saw Richardson and Spring there, with another, whom I cannot recognise positively—I saw a half sovereign lying on the counter, close by the side of the prisoners—my wife said, "Change this half sovereign"—I took it and tried it, and it was a good one—I put it down, and Richardson said, "Here, governor, put that back, I will pay you for that, "and he put his hand in his pocket—hearing that I did not change the half sovereign, I left it for a moment on the counter, and a gentleman on the other side said, "Draw me a glass of ale"—I served that customer, and then my attention was called back to the half sovereign; I said, "Who is going to pay me?" and Spring said, "Here governor, take it out of this," and he pushed the half sovereign towards the edge of the counter, where I stood—I took it up and placed it in my purse, where I had no other gold; I gave the change to Spring, and they went away immediately—'they had drank some of the ale which they had ordered, but left the greater part, and my suspicion was excited—I took the half sovereign out of my purse and tried it in the detector, and bent it in half (I had tried the first half sovereign in the detector and it was good)—I bent it back again, and put it in my purse, and the next morning I took it out of the purse and put it in my desk—I kept it by itself, under a glass first; I afterwards took it up stairs, and put it in my desk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Bell public house, in Friar-street Blackfriars-road. On 5th Feb., between 4 and 5 o'clock, the three prisoners came in together—Richardson asked for half a quartern of gin and cold water—he threw down half a crown to pay for it—I took it up, and saw it was good by looking at it—I did not put it in the detector—I can tell by looking whether it is good or bad—I am in the habit of taking a good deal of money—when I had taken the half crown, Spring said, <hi rend="italic">u</hi> I will pay for that gin," and he tendered me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was going to take up the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Richardson said, "What are you going to do?" I said, "To take the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said "You shan't do that," and he tendered me a bad half crown in place of the good one which he had taken up—I could see the difference between the two half crowns, because we have had that done so frequently before—I told him of it at the time, and gave the bad half crown back to Richardson—Richardson said to Spring, "What did she say?" or words to that effect—I am not very quick of hearing, I only hear on one side—Richardson took up the half crown, Spring paid me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the gin, and they all went away together.</p>
