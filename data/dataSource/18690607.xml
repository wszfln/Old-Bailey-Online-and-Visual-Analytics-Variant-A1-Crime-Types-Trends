I am in the service of Thomas Pavey, a grocer, of Broad Street, Bloomsbury—on Tuesday, 18th May, the prisoner came there—I served him with a quarter of a pound of eightpenny cheese—he put down a half-crown—I told him it was bad, it was a rank bad one—he asked me to bend it in three places, which I did—he asked me to give it him; I did so, and he said he would go to the corner, where he took it—he went away, but did not return—on 24th May, about 9 o'clock, he came again for a quarter of a pound of the best cheese—I knew him again directly—he put down a half-crown—Mr. Pavey took it up, and said it was bad—I directly ran round the counter, and said that was the same man that came in the week before—the prisoner said I was mistaken, he was not the man, he only came up from the country the morning before.</p>

On 11th May, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty near the Bald-faced Stag, at Finchley, and saw the prisoner going in the direction of the rick, and about 500 yards from it—about ten minutes afterwards he came running back—I stopped him—he said, "Do you see that light?"—I looked, and said, Yes—he said, "I have set that on fire"—I asked him what it was—he said, "<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> hayrick"—I took him into the station—I found on him two boxes of fusees, fourpenny, a knife, and a bit of copper wire—he said he set the stack on fire with the fusees—he gave no address.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, New Road, Sloane Street—I sot as door-porter at Messrs. Hunt &amp; Roskell's—I have been in the army—on 14th August I saw a carriage drive up to the door of Messrs. Hunt &amp; Roskell's—I opened the door—two men and a woman got out of the carriage and passed into the shop—they remained there about twenty minutes, and then came out—I opened the door to let them into the carriage again—the male prisoner did not get into the carriage, but the others did—the male prisoner came out first, the woman followed him, and then the second man—he put the woman into the carriage, and stood alongside me at the carriage door; the other man kept Mr. Cavey in talk in the passage when he saw the woman was in the carriage—he came out, and went into the carriage, and said, "Charing Cross Hotel," and this man went towards Oxford Street, seemingly in a hurry—I noticed him particularly—I had a reason—I am in the habit of letting ladies and gentlemen into their carriages, and I could see that he did not take off his hat or bow to the lady as a gentleman ought; he merely said, "Good-day," and away he went—the female prisoner is the woman—I am quite certain of her—I had an opportunity of seeing her when I let her out, and when she came back she wore a dark green silk dress, a black sash round her waist, a dark bonnet, with a red flower on the top, and light green ribbons, not anything like the dress—she had not a shawl, it did not come down low enough for a shawl, it was a thing that just covered—the neck behind, a kind of scarf—I have not seen the other man since—they could not have driven off above a minute and a half before I heard of the lose of the bracelet; they were just out of sight.</p>

               <p>them—the male prisoner said, "What a beautiful thing!"—the young man assisted me to put it before them to look at—the male prisoner took up the bracelet, looked at it, and put it back again—it was then agreed that a drawing should be made of some ornaments, and were to be ready on the Wednesday following—I proposed to call upon them, but it was agreed that they should come again—they gave me the address at the Charing Cross Hotel, and another address in the country, and also left this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they said I had better have the drawing made as proposed—I took a piece of paper, and said to the female prisoner, "What will you require? "—she said she would have the head-ornament, the bracelets, the earrings, and brooch, making a whole set—she spoke very little—Clifford left first, the woman went after him, and the other man stood talking to me in the plate room—I asked if they required anything in plate as well; they gave no answer, and seemed in a hurry to get out—when I returned to the shop an assistant came to me, and my attention was called to the fact that the bracelet was missing—I went after the prisoners immediately, but they were gone—one of them stood conversing with me in the lobby while the other two went to the carriage—I don't know whether the lady was inside the carriage when he left—when he went out the carriage drove off imme<lb/>diately my attention was drawn to the bracelet being missing within a minute after—there were no other customers in that part of the shop at the time I showed them the diamond ornaments—no one could have had access to the bracelet but the three prisoners, myself, and Mr. Morris—I am quite positive of that—Clifford took up the bracelet, but he put it down again—, it is my very firm belief that Clifford was one of the men—I have also a very strong belief that the other prisoner was the woman who was with them.</p>

I was senseless when I had the knife, and do not remember anything about. it The captain told all hands to stand back as he was going to blow my brains out with two revolvers, which he held in his hand. He said, "Do you give yourself up?" and then I looked at my hand and saw the knife, and threw it down imme<lb/>diately. They did not allow me to change my clothes, which had become filthy with vermin. When we got into cold latitudes, where there where was snow and ice, I could not keep myself warm, as my clothes were wringing wet from the water running down upon me. The captain defied me to look at him, as if I was a robber, and he told me he would blow my brains out if I did; and he threatened to hang me up by the heels, and set the dog on me.</p>

I have had several consultations with different lawyers, who are of the same opinion as regards certain investments. Of course the responsibility rests with you and I, and as far as I am concerned, I am quite prepared to take the responsibility, but of course can do nothing except with your sanction and approval I shall be glad if you will give the subject your attention, and let me know your opinion as soon as possible, as good things are turning up every day in this locality, simply requiring a little watchfulness and buying at the right time, being on the spot to do so. I will do anything I possibly can to benefit the family. I hope to be able to get over to Bed-ford in the spring or summer. The accounts received from there are good as regards health, but not as regards pecuniary means. I certainly think by the terms of the will we have power to vary the investment.

I am the manager of the Birkenhead branch of the Alliance Bonk, and have been so about six yean—I have known the prisoner nearly that time—he had an account with us—it was opened in August, 1863—it was an ordinary private account—not a trust account—I knew him as chief constable of Birkenhead—on 7th August, 1867, he called at the bank to see me—he told me that one of the trustees under the will of Miss Agnes Gundy bad died, and that he had been appointed as successor, and that Mr. Henry Thomas Maxted was his co<lb/>trusted—he showed me a letter from Mr. Maxted, approving of his appointment—he told me that the funds were invested in Consols, according to the pro<lb/>visions of the will—we made the necessary inquiries, and obtained powers to enable us to receive the dividends, and we did ultimately receive them by arrangement with the prisoner and Mr. Maxted, and they were put to the prisoner's account, and he drew them out—in January, 1868, I received a power of attorney for the sale of 333<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stock—it realized 308<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 26th January, 1869, the prisoner called at the bank, and said that a payment of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had to be made out of the trust fund, and requested me to obtain power for the sale of such a sum as would meet that amount—he also told me that Mr. Maxted had written to him, stating that he was going to California, by way of the United States and Liver<lb/>pool, and he would then execute the power in passing through Liverpool—I wrote to our London office that same day, and on 28th January I received a letter from them—I saw the prisoner, and read the letter to him—this is it:—(<hi rend="italic">This suggested, that in order to save trouble and expense, it would be</hi>

Maxted, Woodside, Birken-head"—the words "late of Gibraltar" were not there then—I pointed out to him that the address did not correspond with that given in the body of the power, and suggested that the words "late of Gibraltar" should be added—I asked him where Mr. Maxted was, and he replied, "In my dining-room"—he then took the power away, and shortly after returned with it in its present state, with the words "late of Gibraltar" added—he left it with me, and I sent it to London that same night to be acted upon—I knew Colonel Twibill, and knew his signature—I did not know John Chandler—on 26th I received a notice from London that the power had been stopped—upon that I went to Major Beswick's office—he was not there—I then went to his house, and found he was out of town, but was expected home, and I saw him that evening—I had previously left or sent this memorandum at his house—(<hi rend="italic">This informed the prisoner that the power had been stopped at the Bank of England by Mr. Maxted</hi>)—I think I saw the prisoner between 6 and 7 o'clock that evening—he then gave me an explanation, which I transmitted to our London office—it was to the effect that he was much astonished, thunder—struck, I think the word was, when he reached home and found my note, and one from Mr. Maxted, declining to make the transfer—he showed me Mr. Maxted's letter—he said that someone, evidently well acquainted with the circumstances of the trusteeship, had written a letter, purporting to be signed by Mr. Maxted, saying that he would pass through Liverpool on his way to Cali<lb/>fornia, authorizing the sale, and would then sign the power—he did not show me any such letter—he further stated that someone had met him in the street, addressed him as Mr. Maxted, and signed the power; that he himself had not seen Mr. Maxted, with the exception of a day, I think he said, on hut way from the Crimea, for twenty-two years—he also said that he was very anxious to exonerate himself, and would proceed to London to see the Bank authorities; that some one was evidently personating Mr. Maxted, and that he had put the matter into the detectives' hands—he said the man had stated that he would return on the Thursday or Friday, and then receive the money, or make arrangements for its distribution—he said he was most anxious that the power should be retained, not destroyed, an the might have a material bearing on the case—on the evening of that</p>

               <p>same day I wrote to our London manager—I afterwards read to the prisoner a copy of the letter—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>; "February 26, 1869. Dear Sir,—My customer, Major Beswick, has requested me to give some explanation about the transfer which has been stopped. This evening, on his return home, he was surprised to find, not only my note, but one from Mr. Maxted, Gibraltar, which he has shown me, declining to make the transfer. Strange to say, someone, evidently well acquainted with the circumstances of the trus-teeship, sent a letter, purporting to be signed by Mr. Maxted, requesting the sale, and stating that he himself would pass through Liverpool, on his way to the United States, and would then execute it. Major Beswick, who has not seen his co-trustee since he was in Gibraltar, with his regiment, twenty-two years ago, when Mr. Maxted was a young man, acted on the letter, giving us the instructions upon which the transfer was made out. The party presented himself this week, signed it, and appears to have intended to have come to-day to arrange about the distribution of the funds. From the letter received to-night there can be little doubt someone is personifying Mr. Maxted, and the matter has been placed in the detectives' hands, and it is for this reason the detaining of the transfer is desired. Mr. Beswick, who, perhaps, from the fact of his being the Head-Superintendent of the Police force here, alone makes him acutely feel the trick which has been played upon him, is most anxious to exonerate himself, and has requested me to say that he will at once proceed to London to see the Bank autho<lb/>rities, if you think it would be desirable. In the meantime he is extremely sorry for the trouble he has occasioned you, and is much obliged for what you have done.")—When I read that letter to the prisoner, he said that I had omitted to state that he had seen Mr. Maxted one day on his return from the Crimea—on 1st March I, saw the prisoner again—he repeated what he had told me before, with this exception, that I think he then for the first time stated that he was going to Bedfordshire, on matters con<lb/>nected with the trust, on the morning when the supposed Mr. Maxted accosted him in the street, and that he would not leave a stone unturned to get at the bottom of the matter, and give us the earliest intimation—he also said that the party had not called again—it was between 10.30 and 12 o'clock in the morning of the 23rd February, when the prisoner brought the power, and he took it away and returned it with the words, "late of Gib<lb/>raltar" added, in less than half-an-hour, I should say—this (<hi rend="italic">product</hi>) is the prisoner's pass-book at our bank—I could not tell from this what balance there was to his credit on 24th January—these entries are made by Mr. Beswick himself, and are not copies from the bank-book—according to those figures the balance seems to be 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to his credit—this book should be kept by the bank solely—it is irregular for a customer to make entries—this book does not appear to have been in the bank since 11th January last—the balance then to his credit was 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 1st January it was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

On 23rd February the prisoner came with his wife to spend two days with me at Bedford—he arrived at my house about 7 o'clock—I have known him a great number of years, and been in constant communication with him—in the course of the evening we had conversa<lb/>tion about past times—we very often spoke about Mr. Maxted—the prisoner did not mention to me that Mr. Maxted was in England—he never said a word about his being there, or that he was going to California, or anything of that sort—he said nothing about having seen him at all that day, or that he had seen him at all—he said he had heard from him—he did not say that he had heard that day, but previous to that he had heard from him about the transfer of this money—he said that Mr. Maxted did not wish it, and he was perfectly satisfied with Mr. Maxted's decision—I had not heard of any sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be paid as a legacy, or to be paid to anyone out of the trust fund, in respect of this matter; nor was I at all aware that he was going to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you had often had conversation with Major Beswick about transferring the fund? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, very often, and my late husband also; we both wished to have it invested, so that we might receive a better rate of interest—I don't know that it was frequently brought to Major Beswick's attention; but we spoke of it at different times—he was pressed to become a trustee—he was asked if he would become one, and he said he would be very happy—he said he would not do it for anyone else, only we were such very old friends—he has been exceedingly kind to me, nobody could have been kinder—his wife came with him to Bedford—he has a very large family, ten children—I can't remember whether it was the day he arrived or the day after that he said he had re<lb/>ceived a letter from Mr. Maxted; it was in the course of conversation—I live in the same house with Miss Gundy—she is a great invalid—she is not excitable—she is a very quiet person, and always was—on one occasion the prisoner procured some money for me, that was last year—he sent it to me—the dividends were always paid very correctly.</p>

I am a draper, at Argyle Street, Birkenhead—during the course of last year the prisoner was indebted to me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter that I wrote to him—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated October</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1868, <hi rend="italic">enclosing an account for</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and regretting that he was obliged to requst an <hi rend="italic">immediate settlement, or a bill at one or two months</hi>)—I don't think I did receive any payment at that time—I went to the prisoner in the course of the present year to ask for payment—I think it was some time in February, and I wrote him this letter—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 16th February, and was a renewal of the application for his account, amounting to</hi> 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and offering to take a bill, renewable at the prisoner's convenience</hi>)—Besides writing those letters, I went and saw the prisoner at his office—he spoke to me at one time about a sum of money he expected to be able to pay me with; in fact, he let me</p>

               <p>see a letter that he had received from the manager of the Alliance Bank—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter he showed me—he said he was going to sell some stock, and he was merely waiting for the signature of a gentleman who was coming from Gibraltar—that was about the last week in February—I said I would wait—I think that was after the letter of 16th February—I told him I was wanting the money at the beginning of March, and be told me if he did not get paid at that time he would give me the bill I asked him for—he did not pay me the money up to that time, and the last day of February, or the 1st March, I called on him to get his signature to a bill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer at Birkenhead—on 5th March the prisoner called me into his private office, at the police-station, and said, "Hemmingway, there was a man at my house on 25th February very near making a mess of me when I was returning from Bedford," or "going to Bedford," I am not positive which—he then handed me this slip of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) and said, "I want you to go over to Liverpool and see Mr. Keogh, the Superintendent of the Detective Department—see him per<lb/>sonally, and ask him to be kind enough to instruct his detective officers to be on the look—out for a man answering this description—if they should succeed in apprehending him, I will go over any hour, night or day, to identify him"—I then said, "There is no charge on the paper; what charge shall be preferred against the man if he is apprehended?"—he said, "He was very nearly getting a lot of money from me, and he will probably be staying at some second—class hotel at Liverpool"—I then went over to Mr. Keogh, and made some inquiries, but was unable to obtain any informa<lb/>tion—in the police—office at Birkenhead there is a report-book kept, which is here; it is the usual course to enter any complaint in that—I believe there is no such entry in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and postmaster, and live at 10, Murray Street, St. Pancras—on the night of 5th May last, about 11.30, I went to bed, after seeing that the place was thoroughly secured—about 2.50 in the morning, I was awoke by a noise in my bed room, and saw the prisoner standing close by my bedside—he remained perfectly still—I called out, "Who's there?" and sprang from the bed and seized hold of him—I struggled with him into a back room—he had a knife in his hand—it was too dark to see; but I felt it across my left hand—I was cut in several places on the hands, and had two scratches down the neck, and a cut on the cheek; they were quite skin wounds—I had several small cuts on the hand, one rather deep—I got the knife from him, and threw him down, and his head came on the hearthstone, and I took him by the hair, and hit his head on the hearthstone several times—he then turned on all fours, to try and get wind—I pulled him on his side, and gave him some blows in the wind and the side of the head—I used him roughly, and at last disabled him—I called "Murder!" as soon as I got the knife from him—I did not see the prisoner, till the policeman came up with a lantern; but I still held him in my hands—I afterwards found that two coats had been removed from the pegs in the hall, down stairs—the noise that awoke me was made by his removing a box of studs off my drawers—I examined the house, and found that an entry had been effected by pushing back the catch of the back kitchen window.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Storey's Defence.</hi> On 23rd November, I received twenty-four begs of cochineal from two warehouses, and proceeded 'with them on my route to Fresh Wharf. At six o'clock, having had no dinner or tea, I stopped at a coffee-shop, as I was very faint, and left the boy in charge of the horse and cart. When I returned they were gone. I informed three constables of the loss within a quarter of an hour. One of them sent me to Seething Lane Station, and from there I was sent to Leman Street; they referred me to Mr. Hartley, who had left when I got there. I found him at his friend's house, and he told me that I must go and find it. I went to Leman Street again, and they had not heard of it; then to the City Green Yard; then to Old Street Road, Shadwell, and Bethnal Green police-stations. I stayed out till 12 o'clock in the morning, trying to recover the goods. I arose at 5 o'clock next morning, walked to Deptford, and saw Mr. Hartley, who told me I must go and find it. I walked back in the evening, and told him I had had no success. He took me to Mr. Carriok's office. We went to Leman Street again, and they told me to enrol myself as a kind of amateur detective, to see if I could see the boy who I left in charge of it, and give him in charge. I did as I was ordered on the first day, and continued to do so up to Saturday, when I went to the office about 10.30, and Mr. Carrick gave me in custody. I was taken before the Magistrate on Monday, who said that he saw no evidence against me, but Mr. Young opposed my being admitted to bail. I was afterwards bailed, and surrendered to my own recognisances twice. The case was withdrawn, and that of the other prisoners proceeded with, who were convicted here last January. When I</p>

               <p>asked for my papers, the police would not produce them, because they knew that they were evidence in my favour. Nobody can feel the loss more than I do. I have searched night and day, but because I was unsuccessful they gave me in charge. Three-fourths of the evidence is a tissue of falsehood.</p>

I am the treasurer of the society, and have been so for four or five years—whenever the prisoner received dues from courts, it was his duty to hand over the money to me, together with his cash-book and ledger—I have known the prisoner during the whole time he has been secretary, from 1862 to 1868—during my time as treasurer, I had continual communication with him as to his not paying over to me his dues—I have continually brought it before the board that the moneys were not handed over to me, and his answer has been that he would do it in future—I have distinctly understood him to say that my complaint should be attended to in future—of course, in the fulfilment of my duty as treasurer, I wanted to hand the moneys into the bank—the prisoner must have known the rules of the society, as everything, together with the books, were placed under his care—his name is printed in the rules—his salary was 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and sometimes a little more—he has never handed to me the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which he received in October, 1867, from Court 3451—I have evidently no such an entry in my books—I did not, on 6th December, receive from him the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. cash, nor 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 4th January, 1868—I cannot tell the date when I last saw him at the office—the last time I saw him act as secretary was at the latter end of December, at my house, 16, Essex Street, Strand, and I have never seen him since—we have a book called the dues book, and a tabular ledger, showing the arrears, when the dues were paid, and the various items of account.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a trustee of the London District for many years, in conjunction with Mr. Buckland and others—the last quarterly meeting which the prisoner attended was held in October, 1867—we expected him at the meeting in January, 1868, but he did not appear; and, in conse<lb/>quence of something which came to our knowledge, we were ordered by the meeting to go to Bow Street Police Court—the auditors at that time were Messrs. Reardon, Taylor, Bearham, and Winckworth—we applied for a warrant against the prisoner, but Mr. Flowers, the Magistrate, refused it, because at the time there was no information—I never heard from the prisoner after this, till the 7th January, 1869, and previous to that time a meeting of the society had sanctioned a settlement of his affairs by the pay<lb/>ment of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a bond for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never had any communication with the prisoner from the time he left in 1867 until January last—in January, 1868, we received 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on behalf of the prisoner, and paid it into the London and Westminster Bank, as trustees of the society—by com<lb/>mand of one of the meetings, however, we were obliged to withdraw it, and returned it to the source from whence we had it—we were then empowered to prosecute the prisoner—the meeting was held on the 16th February, 1868—there were 108 delegates present and nineteen absent—ninety-seven voted for the retention of the money out of that number—a second warrant was applied for, but not by us, as we ceased to be trustees—we made several applications to withdraw our warrant, but we were opposed by several of the members, as being contrary to the resolutions of the district.</p>

                  </hi>. I was living with Mr. Antrobus, at 65, Eaton Square, as butler—before that I was in service with Jones—I subscribed to the society to which he was a collector—I never authorized Jones to put me forward as a director of the National Provincial Union Assurance and Loan Society, Limited—about Christmas last he asked me to sign a paper for him—he did not say why—he merely asked me to sign it—I was busy. I at the time in the pantry—he put the paper before me, showed me where to sign, and I signed—I was not aware what I was signing—I had not time to read it—he said he would explain it at some other time—I don't recol<lb/>lect signing more than one paper, but at Guildhall I identified two as my handwriting—I had no intention when I signed that of becoming a director of the company, or qualifying myself for five shares—I never received fire shares—I found out that I was a director about two or three weeks after I signed the paper, some time in the beginning of January, I should expect—Reid, Kiddie and Jones were present; the prospectus was put into my hands—they were all together—I met them at the bottom of the square by chance—they handed me a paper, which I found afterwards was a prospectus—I did not look at it then—I made up my mind to go to the office and have my name taken off, and ask why they put my name down—I went away two or three days after I read it—I ultimately wrote two letters to Jones—these are the letters—they are in my handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">These were written by the witness to the prisoner Jones, and stated that he did not want his matter to know that his name had appeared as a director, as he should get the sack; and hoping that his letters were burnt, as, if his governor saw them, it would be the worse. for him</hi>)—I have lost my situation—Jones asked me to become a subscriber.</p>

               <p>service, and attended to the engine which works the crane, and over which the prisoner superintended—after working some time, I found it was very much to pieces, the eccentric and several things fell off, and several of the bolts were loose, a pump rod fell out; they should not have done so in half an hour, just by the working of the engine—when I went in the morn<lb/>ing the prisoner was there doing something to the engine, I do not know what, but I heard him knocking; I said, "Good morning, Jeffery, what have you been up to?"—he said "What the hell is the matter with you?"—he left off hammering, came to the end of the platform to me, and began using bad language; saying, that I had wormed him out of his job—he took off his coat, and wanted to fight—I told him I did not intend fighting for a job, I had always got on without—the engine worked, but not well, several of the keys were loose, but no damage was done then—on Saturday night, I found I could not get on with the engine, so I stopped her and put her right, and left instructions with the watchman that he was to get up steam it 3 o'clock on Sunday morning—I left her in working order—I went on Sunday morning at 4 o'clock, and found the blow-off cock turned on, and consequently the boiler was very nearly empty, I called the watchman's attention to it—I saw a quantity of salt on the plank which forms the frame of the crane, that aroused my suspicions, and I instructed a man to examine the tank while I stood by—I tasted the water, it was very strongly mixed, in my opinion with salt and soda, and made my tongue sore—we found salt and soda in the tank, the effect of which would be a very severe priming, which would drive out the top of the cylinders, or knock out the bottom; it would be likely to create an explosion, and so injure the engine—we took a sample of the water out of the tank to Mr. Shelbourne; I do not know whether it has been submitted to a chemist—the tank supplied the boiler—a large lump of salt and soda, about half a pound, was left, and some must have been dis<lb/>solved—if the top had been blown off, the damage would have been over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a consulting engineer and manufacturer of engines, at Burdett Street, Limehouse—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a diagram of the vertical boiler in question—there was found in this tank ten or twelve inches only of water, which was highly impregnated with salt and soda—the proper height is from ten to twelve inches above the top of the fire box; if it is below, the flames impinging against the iron would cause the iron to become thin, and an explosion might probably take place—the water was 3ft. some inches short, but it was fortunately found out before the watchman lighted the fire—I do not know that the water was 3ft. lower than it ought to be, but if it was down here it would be likely to create danger—the effect of salt in the water would be that priming would ensue, that is a strong beullition of the water, which would become steam, and the engine and the top or bottom of the cylinder might have broken—if the fires were lighted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186906070090"/>
               <p>the boilers might have exploded, and the result would have bean damage from 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the water at Blackwall is very slightly impregnated with salt, not enough to damage a boiler—I cannot account for this by the water of the Thames.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What would be the effect of the priming? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The water boiling over into the steam pipes and cylinders, it would be almost certain that injury would result—sometimes we put a quantity of soda in, and gently simmer the water to get rid of corrosion, we afterwards fill it up with the freshest water we can get—the great thing is to keep salt from the boilers—neither soda or salt have any business there, except when you have to clean—for working purposes you cannot have the water too pure—soda will counteract the effect of salt, most decidedly.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at East Greenwich, and am watchman to Messrs. Lewis &amp; Stockwell—Mr. Shelbourne's steam crane is on the premises—I know the prisoner—on 30th April, I was on the wharf in the evening, and saw him at Lewis &amp; Stockwell's engine-house—he came over to my watch-box, sat there a few minutes, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, I wish to do you no harm, nor anyone else, but Mr. Shelbourne has discharged me, and for that I will give him a doing. I will get a certain quantity of soda, dissolve it in boiling water, and put it in the tank of the boiler; that will give the engine a severe priming, that no man can work it. It will not be discerned, the soda being the same colour as the water"—I said, "Do not do that yet, for the sake of me and yourself, as you will get me and yourself into some trouble"—he sat there a few minutes, went away, and I saw no more of him—on Saturday night, 1st May, about 11 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and his wife outside the gate, in the main road, about 200 yards from the engine—I tried to make him go and apologize for what he had done—I said, "I have no doubt Mr. Shelbourne will take you back"—he said, "B—Shelbourne, and George, too!" meaning the foreman—about 11.30 that Saturday night, I examined the engine with my bull's-eye, and found it perfectly safe—I did not examine the cock, but no water was dripping from it whatever, or from the ash-pan—about 12.30 I examined it again, and found water dripping from the ash-pan—I did not examine it till day-light, when I sounded the boiler with a piece of iron—I had orders to light the fire that Sunday morning at 3 o'clock—I make it a practice to try the guaging before I light the fire—I did so and found there was no water at all—I turned the guage-cock, and no water came from the guage-glass, which shows the height of the water in the boiler.</p>

               <p>come to-morrow night"—I said, "Very well, you know best, it is in your hands, I will keep away," therefore, I did not go to the meeting on the Tuesday; then, on the Friday, Jennings told me that he had met Archer on the Thursday, at the Waterloo Station, with Clifford—that Archer had agreed to go to Lady Murray's, and to enter the house, and speak to the servants, but that Clifford was not satisfied with Archer's statement that he had lived there, and would not do the job unless he could see Archer go to the' house and speak to his old fellow-servants, which, he said, he could do if he really had lived there—he said "At first Archer agreed to go, but afterwards refused, in consequence of his clothing not being so good as he wished, but," he said, "We are going to build him up; we will find him some clothes; in<lb/>deed, I have brought a coat with me" (he had got a loose coat on at the time) "he can have this coat, and to-morrow he can have a hat, a neck wrapper, some boots, and other things, and he can have some money to go down to Wimbledon; Clifford will be there; and if he sees him go in and speak to the servants, he will be satisfied that he has lived there, and that what he has told him is right about the property, and the job will be done—we then went to Archer's lodging—he was in bed, and refused to get up—Jennings and I then walked as far as Victoria Street again, and Jennings said to me, "Win you see Archer in the morning T—I said, "Yes, I Will"—he said, "Take care to see him; tell him to be at Waterloo Station at 12.50 to-morrow, and we will be there, and we will have some clothes there for him; he can go into a public-house and put them on; we will give him the money, and he can go down to Wimbledon, and we will go down, too"—I afterwards saw Hasten; and in consequence of something he said to me, gave information to Sergeant Meikle john, and since last January I have been in constant communication with him.</p>

I am a licensed victualler, of 16, Alfred Road, Kings-land—on 8th April, about 9.30 in the evening, I looked my bedroom door, leaving everything safe, took the key with me down into the bar, and kept it there—at 1.30 in the morning, on going to bed, I found the bedroom window wide open; I had left it closed but not fastened; and a chair was placed against the door, inside, to prevent anyone coming in—a box had been forced open, and about 501. in gold taken, a gold watch, two silver I. ladles, and three gold studs—I have frequently seen the prisoners at my house, in front of my bar—I saw Jennings there on the night of the robbery—he was in the passage of the house—there is a bagatelle room on the same floor as my bedroom, and about 16ft. from it.</p>

On Monday morning, 20th April, at 7 o'clock, I went to Peter Street, Westminster, and found Lewis in bed—I told him I wanted him for being concerned with a man named Holloway in an attempted burglary, on Clapham Common—he said that he did not know the place, he never was there, and knew nothing about it.</p>

When the man came in, he looked up and down at the police, as though he expected a signal. The inspector said, "Well <hi rend="italic">Will</hi>?" and then he pointed me out. He says that I was on Clapham Common at 2 o'clock, therefore, as I was at home at 1.30, I should have to go six miles, and go through this operation on the prosecutor's door in three-quarters of an hour. This hat is very tight, and if I had worn it would not have fallen off my head, and it was tighter still when it was tried on me at Wandsworth—I never got up till the next morning, when Mary Blower came to look for her brooch. My acquaintance with these witnesses does not extend over two or three weeks, and therefore they have no interest in stating anything but the truth.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Torbay Taverd, at Rotherhithe—I had the card of a person named Turner by me, and I wrote a letter to Mr. E. D. Rodgers, Lime Street, City—the prisoner came to me the next day—I did not know him before—he said he had come from Mr. Rodgers, and brought the letter I had written the day before—I asked him if he knew Mr. Turner, and he said he did, perfectly well—I showed him the card—I told him I wanted to insure my plate glass, and he said it would be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he would bring me the policy to<lb/>morrow—he brought it the next day, and I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him why Mr. Rodgers' name was not on the policy—he said Mr. Rodgers was the principal of the firm, and he never put his name on the policies—I parted with my money, thinking he came from Mr. E. D. Rodgers, of Lime Street, City—I went</p>

I have been for fifteen years in the Plate Glass Insurance Company, established in 1852—the prisoner is not an agent of the company—I never saw him till I saw him at the Police Court—this is one of our prospectuses—Mr. Rodgers is the managing director of the company, and Mr. Oxford is the chairman—the policies are signed by them—I know nothing of the policies which have been produced, nor of any company at 14 A, Lime Street.</p>

On 4th May the prisoner was brought to Bow Street, by Mr. Harper—he gave the name of Frank Williams, 8, Bow Street—he was taken from Bow Street to Southwark—as we were going across Waterloo Bridge he took some papers from his coat pocket, and threw them over into the water—some of them fell back on the bridge, and were picked up—I searched him afterwards, and found a blank receipt and a circular of the genuine company, at 53, Lime Street.</p>
