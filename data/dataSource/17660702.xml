On the Sunday morning about eight o'clock, I had occasion to go down into the cellar; I observed the cover of a box full of books was loose; then I went to see my hats, and found five were gone: I went to look at the street-door, and found the staples were drawn, and the door open. The next morning my next door neighbour's house was broke open and robbed, upon which Bourk was taken up; then the evidence Ashbridge was apprehended, said he had no concern in my neighbour's but he had in breaking mine; upon which to the prisoner, who was in custody, and said, I understand you have my hats, let me know where they are: he said he knew nothing of them; I offered him half a guinea, in case I could have them again. That evening he sent me a letter, mentioning, if I would come to him, he would let me know something about them; I went to him; he said, do you remember what you said last night; I said I would give him the half guinea, in case I had my hats, and offered him a shilling of it; he said, that will not do; I said, he should have the rest of the money when I had the things; he said it would do, and took the shilling: then he took me on one side, and told me, one of my hats was sold to a baker in Golden-lane for 4 s. 6 d. which was a hat that I made for a clergyman, and worth above 15 s. he told me, the other four were sold to a man named Cantrell, that buys stolen handkerchiefs, in Field-lane, for half a guinea; two were worth 15 s. each, and the other two 12 s. each. Then I applied to my Lord-Mayor for a search-warrant, to search his house; but before I got there, he was got off, and not to be found since; I went to the baker, and he readily delivered that hat up: (produced and deposed to, by a brand mark on the inside the crown.)</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner told me the very spot where he took the plough from, before half a dozen people, the day he was committed: he first told me, he brought it out of Somersetshire two years ago; after that, he told me he had it of a woman that had it in her apron upon some chips, who, he said, told him she found it, and that he gave her 6 d. for it.</p>

               <p>I picked the handkerchief off the ground, and before I had liberty to speak, they took hold of me, and took it from me; I have been at sea ten or eleven years, and had not been home above nine months.</p>

            . I lay in the same room; I heard the prisoner Taylor ask Ayres to get up; I believe it was between five and six o'clock in the morning; I got up, and went and drank along with them; I saw him give her a ring, a pair of cotton stockings, and a shist; she enquired which way he came by them; he said, he bought them at a shop the night before.</p>

               <p>M. Osley. It is only for women; he called her up, and gave her a stone ring, a pair of cotton stockings, and a shist; and he laid a black silk cardinal down on the feet of the bed; she had another ring on, and she threw that out at the window and put the other on.</p>

The prosecutor asked him where the buckskin breeches were that Kelley had given him information of; he said he never had any; we brought the things away, and did not take the prisoner up then.</p>

I should not know him again; I believe it was the prisoner, but will not swear it. It was in Wingfield-street, up two pair of stairs, the same room which we found them in afterwards; he asked a guinea for the thirteen pair; the pair of buckskin ones were worth half a guinea: I seeing a ticket on one of them, did not buy them, but went and told the prosecutor of what I had seen.

The next day I had an information given, that the prisoner had got some of my goods in his house; I went with Mr. Parker to demand my goods; the prisoner told me, he would be paid for his trouble in fetching them away; I saw several things lying on the ground, breeches and other things under the bed; I found a heap of things done up in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this conversation before you searched the house or after?</p>
               <p>Alefounder. It was before; he took up a chair to knock me down; there was a piece of silk and stuff lay between the bolster and the bed, about 26 yards of it; I had sent Parker for them before, but the prisoner would not let him have them. I asked the prisoner his reason for not letting the fireman have them; he said he would be paid for them, before they should go out of his house. I told him, I did not think he took them with an intent to let me have them again, as he did not let me know any thing of them, and he living but a little way from me; he said, here are all I have, meaning the things on the floor: then I searched, and found the other things; then I took him before the sitting Alderman. We searched his house three times, and every time we found things in different places; after he was committed, we searched, and found a pair of leather breeches, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176607020009"/> cloth coat, two yards and a half of muslin, three pair of shoes, a new handkerchief, a copper sauce-pan, and two tea kettles; these were found at the second and third search.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to search a third time?</p>
               <p>Alefounder. There had been seen from the next yard a gown belonging to my maid, and a pair of breeches, which made me search again. (The goods produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to either of the things?</p>
               <p>Alefounder. I can swear to the greatest part of them, as being in my house when the fire was.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention what you can swear to?</p>
               <p>Alefounder. The silk and stuff, the coat, the shoes and handkerchief; I do not think there is a thing among them but what I could very safely swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Alefounder. He is a weaver; he has used my shop for twelve months.</p>

            . On the 22d of May we were at Mr. Alefounder's house, and going about the neighbourhood, to get the things in again that the London Insurance porters had information of. We had information there were some things at the prisoner's; our foreman bid me go with my bag for them; I went, and told the prisoner I was come for the things; he said he should be paid for his time, before the things should be taken away. I told it Mr. Alefounder; he came; still the prisoner was obstinate, and would not let us have them; he took up a chair to strike at one or two of us; we took up what we saw, and put them in my bag; he said that was all. We went afterwards, and found the several things concealed in different places; there was a piece of green stuff under the bed; after that, the next door neighbour said there was something we had missed; we looked over the rails, and there was a gown and a pair of breeches; and when we came to look for them at his house they were gone, but we found them in a closet; the man was in prison then.</p>

            . The woman at the bar took me out of the street into her house to live with her, and I lived with her about four months; she kept a bawdy-house in Eagle-court in the Strand. It was agreed between us, for me to give her all that I got, and she was to give me victuals and drink, lodging, and cloaths: she used to ask me, when any gentleman had been with me, for what they gave me, and I used to give it her all; she never allowed me any thing; there were other young women in the house, they used to do the same. There was a gentleman in company with me there, he asked upon what terms I was there; I told him; he gave me an 18 s. piece and half a guinea, to clothe myself and get out of that house.

Mr. Lodomy said he had cash at home, he would change it there; then I put it in my book again, and put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176607020010"/> that in my pocket. The prisoner went out soon after, and in about a quarter of an hour after I missed my pocket-book; this was before I left the vault. Mr. Lodomy sent his man after the prisoner, who returned, and said he had had sight of the prisoner, and saw him fall down, but he got up again, and went off. Mr. Lodomy and I went to see if we could find the prisoner, to two or three places, but we could not find him; then we went to Sir

I set out with the machine for Dover; there I found the prisoner; I brought him to town last Friday; he confessed every thing to me before Justice Hammond, and as we were in the machine on the road; but when he came before Major

Mr. M'Farquhar took out his pocket-book, in order to pay Mr. Drummond for two dozen of wine: Mr. Drummond replied, he had not change for the 30 l. note; I had it in my hand; he put it in his book again, and into his pocket: after we had drank a glass, the prisoner disappeared; Mr. M'Farquhar missed his pocket-book soon after; I desired Mr. Drummond's man to run out after the prisoner; he came back, and said he could not come up with him. After that, the prisoner sent me a letter, that he was sorry for what he had done, and sent the pocket-book also; he desired I would make interest with him to Mr. M'Farquhar.</p>

            . On the 19th of June the prisoner came to my shop a little after eight in the evening, in Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Where are Mr. Drummond's wine vaults?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. His wine-vaults are in King-street, St. James's square.</p>
               <p>Burch. My servant was serving him, I was backwards; when I came forwards, I saw the prisoner laying something by, which I imagined he had bought; he addressed me, and asked me if I was the master of the shop, and said he dealt in linen, and came to England once a year, and always carried some abroad with him; he said he was recommended to me by a hosier, as I understood, where he had bought some stockings; I desired he would tell me who it was recommended him, because I should be glad to know my friends; he looked over his pocket-book, but said he had not the direction, so he put his book up: he bought linen; the bill came to, I think, 24 l. 4 s. he bought his goods very hard, by which I took him to be in the business; he insisted I should abate him the 4 s. and said, when he came to London again, next February, he would call upon me again. My servant made out the bill; I gave him change for a 30 l. bank-note; 6 l. I gave him in change; the prosecutor called upon me, I referred him to my banker, and I believe he got the date of the note from him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what name did the prisoner come to you?</p>
               <p>Burch. He did not come in the name of Gasper French; he came, as I understood, in the name he wrote it, Cewper: this was to let me know who he was, and where he lived, and that he would be a customer again.</p>

The next day there were two more threepenny loaves missing; on the Friday we missed one more, and on Saturday morning one more. My son told me in the afternoon when I came home, he saw the prisoner putting two loaves in the place where he had seen one before, while the other servants were at dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been your servant?</p>
               <p>Hore. About five weeks. I went down into the cellar, and in the same place found a twopenny loaf, and in the prisoner's coat was another twopenny loaf, one half in one pocket, and the other in the other; I acquainted a friend that is here to give evidence with it, and desired him to be in the bakehouse to see that he took away the other loaf; he was planted there; the prisoner went out with bread in the afternoon, with the two half loaves in his pocket.</p>

            . The prosecutor told me he was defrauded of bread by his servant. I went on the Saturday to see if I could detect the person that did it, at Mr. Hore's desire: I got into a proper place; after I had taken the loaf in my hand, and placed it the same as before, Mr. Hore had sent the prisoner for some yeast while I secreted myself; when he came in, he came to the place where the loaf was; I was close to it; he took the loaf and went up stairs, and set out to go home. Mr. Hore asked me if he had got the loaf; I said, yes; he called him, and found the loaf in his pocket. I believe the prisoner split it in the cellar; it was pulled in two pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>On Saturday nights we take no supper, we commonly take a piece of bread in our pockets; I took a piece of a twopenny loaf in my pocket, and was going to supper with it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Do you allow your men to take bread out in in this manner on Saturday nights?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is no such thing allowed at my house.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Charles Green. I have known the prisoner three years; he always had a very good character. I have been a baker: it is always allowed to take a piece of bread, and go out in an afternoon to get a pot of beer to enjoy themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. What, so much as a twopenny loaf?</p>
               <p>Green. No, not so much as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a perquisite in your trade that a journeyman shall take a whole twopenny loaf, and split it in halves, and go off with it?</p>
               <p>Green. The prisoner now has 40 l. a year coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you?</p>
               <p>Green. I am a Scotchman, so is he.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been out of the country?</p>
               <p>Green. Not nine years.</p>

               <p>Anderson. I am his countryman; I never knew anything to his dishonesty in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you allow your servants to take bread at a twopenny loaf at a time, in the manner here charged on the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I never knew it to be found fault with in my life, to take what they please of bread, on a Saturday night when they don't sup at home; they always may go to the cupboard and take cheese, cold meat, and what they please. I never was denied it by no master when I was a journeyman.</p>
               <p>Q. What, was your practice to take twopenny loaves?</p>
               <p>Anderson. Sometimes one half of a twopenny loaf.</p>
               <p>Q. What, and secrete it, and take it out privately?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I used to take it before my master's face; that I never deny my servants now.</p>

               <p>Anderson. No; if they took it before my face, I should not find fault with it. </p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What wages did you give the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I gave him seven shillings a week, and his board and lodging.</p>

We could not dress her directly; the prisoner was contented to take the youngest in her arms; after she had been gone about half an hour, she picked up our eldest child; I heard the child cry under our window; I looked out, and saw her leading the eldest, and carrying the young one in her arms. I went in again thinking no ill, she having used my shop some time: about three quarters of an hour after, some of our neighbours came, and said they heard children crying up stairs, three or four doors off; my wife went up two pair of stairs, and brought our two children in; then we missed a pair of silver knee-buckles, which I had put into the eldest's shoes, but we did not miss the necklace and locket at that time; then I went in search of the prisoner; I got intelligence at a public-house in the neighbourhood which way she was gone, and I overtook her in Chiswell-street.

            . I am a tripe-man; between ten and eleven o'clock on the 3d of June, a cow was drove into Till's slaughter-house; I went there; there was the prisoner and his father; the cow was killed, and at the desire of the prisoner, I helped to dress her, but I took no sort of observation of the cow, and cannot tell what sort of a one it was. The prisoner said he bought that cow of one Holdney, by Limehouse-church; I said, What did you give 7 l. for it? No, said he, I gave 6 l. 10 s. I was before the Justices, there he denied he had bought it, but said he found it by the Angel.</p>

            . On the 4th of June the prisoner came in the morning, and knocked at my door, (I sell things by commission) I having little or nothing to do, was not up, I called my apprentice up; the prisoner left four quarters of a cow, two hind, and two fore quarters. I did not see him that morning; when I came down stairs, I saw three quarters, my servant sold one to Mr. Hold; I sold the other three on the Thursday.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was within about ten yards of them when the prisoner stopped them; there were four of them in all; they had walked once or twice by me that Monday night before this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Bullock. I did; he commonly walked Cranbourn-alley and about Leicester-fields on nights; there are about thirteen or fourteen of them that belong to that company; they resort at the King's-arms in Prince's-street; there is another company which have a pretty many bull-dogs belonging to them, but these have none. The prisonerca me up to the prosecutor, and said, money; he wanted money, and d - d his eyes, and said money he would have. Then I came up directly to them; the prosecutor charged me with the prisoner; after that, the prisoner charged me with them. I said to them, do you take care of the prisoner, and I will be answerable for you, if you assist me, for I knew we should be attacked. The prisoner went very quietly with me till his companions came up; they said to him, d - n you, will you go quietly with that man? then he began striking me, and the man that had hold of him; they got hold of my staff, and kicked out my light; we called out, and there were three or four watchman coming from Newport-market; they ran off, and left the prisoner in our custody.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were they when they first came up to the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Bullock. They were within three or four yards of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they walking as people walk in common?</p>
               <p>Bullock. No, they were coming together in a skulking manner, and I knew them to be skulkers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Bullock. To tell the truth, I do not think he was right sober; he had been drinking at the King's-arms with one Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen one man rob another, and not make use of his hands?</p>
               <p>Bullock. I have seen that done in Cranbourn-alley before now: they first br quarrels, two of them will go to fighting, in the mean time they go to picking of pockets; that I often see.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of another gang, what gang is that?</p>
               <p>Bullock. It is well known in the parish, there is a gang of about 50; that gang has been complained of to Justice Welch, and at the Rotation-office; there has been warra nts out, and some of them have been taken; they have bull dogs with them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had been drinking at a public-house; I got much in liquor, and met them two gentlemen in Cranbourn-alley; we had a few words together; I had no intention upon them; I had left my company at the public-house, and was going home; these two men charged me, and I charged them, and we went to the watch-house together.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>

               <p>Thomas Barnet. I live at Stepney; I make children's pumps; I had two dozen and four pair made for Mr. Gibson, a linen-draper and haberdasher at Stratford; Mr. Gibson took one dozen and four last Friday was se'nnight; coming back, I had a dozen pair tied up together in a handkerchief, six pair of what we call Morocco, and six pair of black calf-skin; I being a little tired, seeing a butcher's cart, begged leave of the butcher's man to let me ride; he gave me leave; there was the prisoner Spelter in the cart; I asked him where he came from, and where he was going; he said, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176607020017"/> came from Plaistow, and he was going to see his sister, who was a servant to a gentleman a little on the other side the turnpike, and he must get out there; he jumped out, and I did not miss him at first; in a little time I missed my handkerchief with the pumps in it, and the boy was then gone quite out of sight. On the Saturday Davis was detected in offering two of the pairs to sale; (produced in court and deposed to.) A neighbour of mine told me, a boy had been before the bench of Justices, on account of some children's pumps. I went there, and was asked by the clerk, if I had lost any; I said I had, and gave him an account of them: the two pair were produced, and I said they were mine. I was desired to go to the boy in Bridewell; I went, and saw he was not the boy that stole them: the boy was taken before a magistrate again, and there he made a true discovery of the prisoner Spelter, and another; that he said Spelter was on the copse of the cart at the time; and that they did not know what was in the handkerchief, till they opened it in the field; and that he himself was asleep in the field, and they awaked him, and showed him the pumps; he said there were twelve pair, six red and six black: he said, they d - d me for taking care of a crown paper of halfpence, which they designed to have got from me. I remember I pulled out a crown paper of halfpence while I was in the cart, but I put them safe in my pocket again.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the man on the copse of the cart, or the boy Spelter, took the pumps?</p>
               <p>Barnet. They lay so, that the man on the copse could not reach them; Spelter must be the person that took them; they lay just by him; that man jumped off the cart, and went away after Spelter was gone. When Spelter was taken up, he owned he took them.</p>

            . I was in Rag-fair on Saturday; saw Davis and one Gibson; Gibson is the master of this gang of boys; I heard Gibson say to Spelter, d - n your eyes, why do not you look sharp? then I went to Gibson, and said, how could you encourage these boys to go about thieving? I asked Davis what he did there; he said, what was that to me: I said, pray what have you in your pocket? there I found two pair of red Morocco pumps; I took them out, and carried him and the pumps before the bench of Justices, and delivered the pumps to an officer named Chapman.</p>

            . The prosecutor went out with some goods to Stratford, and afterwards told me he had lost such a quantity of pumps; I went with him to Bridewell to see the boy Davis; he was at play, he came to me as soon as I called him; I asked him upon what account he was in there; he said, upon the account of some pumps, but he did not steal them. I said, if you tell me the truth, I will endeavour to get you cleared. He told me, he had the pumps of Spelter and Gibson, and mentioned where Spelter lived.</p>

               <p>I was going to take a walk with Gibson; a butcher was going with a cart; they made to a gentleman's house; he asked Gibson to go and ride, Gibson asked me to go; the man said, we might be back in a couple of hours; we went to Plaistow with the cart. When we were in the cart, Gibson pointed to me, and bid me go more backwards, and I came more forwards. I got down, and was going home; Gibson got down, and came after me; he said he had something in the handkerchief, he could not tell what. We went into the fields, and looked into the handkerchief, and found they were shoes; I do not know where Gibson is, he is older than me; he is about twenty years of age, I am going on thirteen.</p>

She asked me to go along with her, and have a pint of beer; so I went with her to the house where I first saw her, and the people of the house knew that was the woman that took me out of that house. Then I got a watchman, and gave him charge of her; she was brought before the Justice; she said there, she did not sell the cloaths, but the people where I had been insisted upon either money or goods for the use of the room: she said she went with Bourn when my cloaths were sold, and got half a crown of the money; that the coat was sold to Mr. Fitzgerald, and the hat and breeches to Mrs. Clark, where I found them.</p>

            . The two prisoners at the bar came into my shop together; Bourn had a coat, which she offered to pledge to me; she said it was one of her lodger's.</p>
               <p>John Hall. I am one of the headboroughs of St. John's, Wapping, there are seven of us, so one attends every night; on Friday the 16th of May, about one in the morning, Campbell came to me, and gave me charge of Richardson; he said he had lost his coat, hat, and breeches, and had spent what money he had at the Fountain, and she took him down to another house, and he went to bed, but did not know whether he was stripped or not; and when he awaked, the girl and his cloaths, were gone. I asked Richardson if that was true; she said it was, but she did not take the cloaths; but Mrs. Bourn took them, as she found he had no money; that she went and sold the things, and gave her half a crown of the money, and she spent a shilling out of it; I took charge of her, and of the prosecutor also, as he was a stranger to me; I carried them before Justice Hodgson; the Justice asked what sort of a house Bourn kept; she answered, it was a bawdy-house, which she swore to, and that she, that day, gave her 18 d. for the use of the bed. The Justice granted a warrant to apprehend Bourn; we went and found her at the Fountain in the Minories; they both accused each other before the Justice; then I was sent to Mrs. Clark, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Popard, who gave the same account they have here. The prisoners were committed to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. from Richardson to prosecutor. Did I take your cloaths from you without your consent?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. How could I give you leave while I was asleep?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them liberty to raise money upon them?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I had spent three or four shillings on Richardson in the public-house; but the liquor was free for any body there, I had no money left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know you had no money left when you went with Richardson to her lodgings?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not; I did not know that I had left my scissars for money, till I was told of it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been acquainted with Richardson before?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been at the Fountain before you went to her lodging?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I imagine I had been there three or four hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober when you went in at the Fountain?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I went there in liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176607020019"/>Q. from Richardson. Did you not give me the things to let you lie with me?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; I neither gave you them, nor promised you them.</p>
               <p>Richardson's defence.</p>
               <p>I was in the public-house, the prosecutor happened to come in, his cloaths were very much dirty; he asked to sit down by me; another woman came in, he arose up, and asked her to drink part of a pint of twopenny; the landlord said he was very quarrelsome when in liquor, and would use women very ill; he came up to me and asked me to drink; he took his coat off his back, and asked me to dry it; he had been down in the dirt; the landlord would not let me, so I gave him it again; then he wanted a brush, the landlord would not lend him one. I was coming out to go home about five o'clock. he asked me where I was going, and said, my dear, shall I go with you? I said, I have no home to go to but to my sister's room, and I must go by myself; he said, why may not I go with you as well as another man? I said, I was a disorderly woman, but I thought he was not fit for me; he would go with me, and told me he had no money, but he had things that would make money; he went with me, and stripped the things off, and bid me go and pawn them. I went to Mr. Popard's and offered the coat to pawn, but he not taking it in, I carried it back to him again; then he said, you may go and sell them for something, and buy some other things to wear in their room; saying, he did not care what they were, for he had better at home. After he had got the other things on, he went to bed with me; he not using me well, I got up and dressed myself, and two days after he took me up for a robbery, and after that he wanted to make up the felony for 12 s.</p>
               <p>Bourn's defence.</p>
               <p>They came home together, he told me he had no money; she said she would not go to bed without he would make her a present; he pulled off his cloaths and gave them to her; she went to the pawnbroker's, and he would lend but 2 s. on the coat; then he desired us to go and sell them, which we did, and bought some old cloaths as he had desired us, then they went to bed.</p>

I came down as soon as I conveniently could, and found the prisoner at the bar in custody of a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who locked the door?</p>
               <p>Bigge. The street-door was safely locked; the back-door was bolted with two bolts; there was a window-shutter, that I fear was not properly secured; the sash-window was down; the watchman told me he had catched the prisoner with the greatest part of his body in at that window, and had pulled him out by his legs; he shewed me a handkerchief, in which were tied up two flat irons, a round towel, a piece of veal, and a piece of bread; they were tied up in the handkerchief, and safe in my house before I went to bed, which was a little after eleven o'clock, which he said he found upon the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a watchman; about one o'clock the prisoner, another man, and a woman, came by me; they said nothing to me, nor I to them: they went up the street and were gone about half an hour; then I saw the other man and woman come from the prisoner; soon after that, I heard something fall, which I take to be the flat irons. I went and saw the prisoner on the opposite side the way to Mr. Bigge's house; I saw him look at the handkerchief which he had in his hand; he set it down by the side of the house, and crossed the way, and went directly in at Mr. Bigge's parlour-window; I went and took hold of his feet, and pulled him out; he was all in but one foot: I said, what business have you here, and whether he belonged to the house: he said he was doing no harm; when he was out, he struggl ed very hard to get away; but I held him fast till assistance came. A man looked out at a window at the next house when he heard us, and said, hold him fast, I will be with you presently. He came down; I desired him to get a cord, which he did, and I tied the prisoner's hands behind him; then I knocked at the door for the gentleman of the house, he came down; I showed him the handkerchief and things in it; (the things mentioned in the indictment, except the veal, produced in court.)</p>

            . About half an hour after two that morning, the watchman called for assistance; I looked out, and saw him have hold of a man's legs at the window; the prisoner began to be resolute; I got a cord, and we tied him round one hand; he offered to hit me on the face; then I flung up his heels, and tied his other hand, and brought him, like a person going to the gallows. Mr. Bigge came down, and owned the handkerchief, and things in it; in the mean time, the brush dropped out of the prisoner's bosom; when we came to the watch-house the prisoner said, the other man that had been with him, whom he called Murphy, and his wife, were the two people that enticed him to do it, and they left him in it; this he said also before Mr. Alderman Cockayne.</p>

            . I was walking with Mr. More up Snow-hill; he called out, I have lost my handkerchief. I saw it hang between the prisoner and his companion; it was neither on the ground nor in their hands; the handkerchief fell on the ground, and the other man made off: the prisoner said, when Mr. More took hold of him, Sir, if I have offended you, I ask pardon.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Tremble, a smith; I was opening the shop-windows on the 10th of June in the morning, about six o'clock; the prisoner came and asked leave to leave the two sticks, and he would fetch them in a day or two, and satisfy me for my trouble. When he came with them, Mr. Hargrave followed him into the shop. Whether the prisoner saw him or not, I cannot say, but he went out at the passage door, and up Walbrook, and was soon out of sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run or walk?</p>
               <p>Tull. I did not see him; Mr. Hargrave ordered me to keep the wood, and he would go and acquaint his master of it; his master came and looked at it, and ordered me not to let it go.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hargrave. Who is your master?</p>
               <p>Hargrave. Mr. Crosier is.</p>
               <p>Tull. The prisoner called for it about ten or eleven days after, towards ten o'clock at night; as soon as he set eyes on me, he held out his hand to give me sixpence for my trouble. I told him I should not take it; I was ordered to charge a constable. My master being constable, I said to him, you know what you have to do. Master took him in custody, and ordered me to aid and assist: master ordered his kinsman to go and tell Mr. Crosier the man was come for the wood: the prisoner hearing Mr. Crosier's name, he began to wriggle; (I had hold of him) I said he should not get away; then he offered to kick up my heels, but we secured him: we asked him how he came by it; he was a considerable time before he gave any answer, and when he did, he said he bought it for about 4 s. he was ordered to the Counter, and the next morning he was carried to the Mansion-house; there he said he found it in the mud by the shore-side, on the other side the water.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whose property this piece is here produced?</p>

               <p>Harris. We do; we had weighed in for Mess. Crosier and Co. red wood, and in weighing it again, we found a deficiency of above two hundred weight. We have every gentleman's property put in different parcels; we always keep a particular account at coming in and going out.</p>

               <p>We are ordered to pile the wood up in different piles and different parcels, and very often a stick is left unpiled, and now and then all the loose sticks are picked up, and carried up into a lost; I have worked on this wharf eight or nine months; I was as faithful and as handy as any one there; I was used to do work within and without; while I was there I happened to pick up some wood; I would say, it deserves a pint of beer. I have been told they did not know whether I should have a pint or not: after that, I found some in the water; I got a brush, and cleaned them, and put them under my bed; having found no encouragement<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176607020024"/> for picking them up, I thought I might as well do it as other people.</p>

               <p>Phillips. I was to have received after the rate of 36 s. a chaldron; there were thirty-nine bushels of coals, they cost me 29 s. in the Pool. I took Weaver yesterday morning in his own house; I charged him with being accessary to the sale of these thirteen sacks of coals; he owned they were bought by Elliot, and he owned to his receiving<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176607020025"/> part of the money; and said, that Richardson was a receiver in part with him.</p>

            . I was the person that was to trim the coals at the Duke of Marlborough's for Mr. Phillips; Weaver called me out of the cellar, and said I was to go along with his cart; there were thirteen sacks of coals; I brought the coals up, and he met me just at the bottom of the Haymarket; he said, give me the ticket, I'll go and carry it, do you go to Elliot's house and shoot the coals; I went with the cart there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the cart loaded?</p>
               <p>Richardson. It was loaded at Mr. Phillips's wharf; Weaver's name was on the ticket, as car-man; Elliot helped me to shoot the coals at his house; Weaver waited for me, and met me in Pallmall; he said to me, you must give the ticket to the Duke's porter the next time, and tell him I forgot it; he said, the porter is to have a crown of the money, and that he was a party concerned. The next load of coals that I came with, I gave the porter two tickets, and said the other man forgot to give him one before; the porter said the coals have not been here; he would not take the ticket: then I went to Elliot and got 5 s. 3 d. and offered it to the porter; the porter said, I wonder what you mean by this, I'll have the coals in; the next load I went and got another 5 s. 3 d. of Elliot, and offered the porter the two 5 s. 3 d. pieces; he would not take them, and insisted on having the coals in. At night I went to Elliot and got the remainder of the money, 24 s. in the whole; he had three bushels in a sack, thirty-nine bushels in the whole. The next morning Weaver sent his wife to me at the stable; she was like a mad woman, and said her husband had had no rest all night; then he sent for me to an ale-house, and said we must go to Elliot, and make up the money to buy the coals; we went and asked him whether he would give any more money, and we laid the whole money down upon the bench; he said he would give no more; our fellow servants heard of it, and told it about that we had sold a chaldron of coals.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the 24 s.?</p>
               <p>Richardson. Weaver took it up, and gave me 2 s. of it.</p>
               <p>Q. from Weaver. Whether you did not stay along with me till all the money was gone, and 8 s. of my own money?</p>

             the Duke of Marlborough; the coals came in on the 3d of June; when Weaver brought two chaldrons of coals, he said, I can be 5 s. in your way; I said, how; let me alone for that, said he; I said, do you intend to leave any of the coals by the way, if you do, I'll do no such thing: he wanted me to take a ticket when no coals were delivered; I refused to take the ticket; Richardson came and offered me a 5 s. 3 d. I refused it; after that he came again with two; I refused them, and insisted on his bringing the coals; the next morning Weaver came and offered me 24 s. I refused to take it; he said if he was found out, he should come very badly off.</p>

I asked her the reason she was not up sooner (her usual time was at six;) she said she had been extremely ill all night; I said, if she was ill, it was better for her not to get up, I would get up and do her work for her; I got up and left her in bed; I observed something in the chamber-pot gave me some suspicion of something more than ordinary; she told me she had been at the vault. I went into the house-keeper's room, and told her what I had seen (which was blood;) she desired me to get a candle and look down into the vault, which I did; I saw a great effusion of blood by the vault upon the ground, and I saw an after-birth in the vault; I took it out with a pair of tongs, and put it into a pan of water. The housekeeper went and acquainted Mrs. Hop of it; then an apothecary was sent for:

            . I am foreman to Mr. Lydial; I was sent for on this occasion to Mrs. Hop's, on Sunday the 8th of June, about eight in the morning; I was taken down stairs and shewed an after-birth; I made the servant that shewed it me acquainted with what it was, and desired her to let Mrs. Hop know, upon which I was desired to go up to her; I told her what I had seen below; my lady desired I would step up to the girl; I went up, not being willing to slurry her too much, I first asked her how she did; she made answer she was indifferent, or something to that import; I asked her whether she had any thing come away from her more than what I had seen; she said no; I told her she could not think to deceive me, there certainly was a child somewhere; she made answer, she was sure it was dead, that she had not felt the child move for two months; I told her the child must be concealed about the bed some where, or where the after-birth was found; she said it was there; I went and acquainted my Lady Hop with what she had said. I went away, and was called there again about three o'clock, and was shewed the child; I examined it, and found no marks of violence upon it; I attended her daily till she was removed from my Lady's.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say in what manner she was delivered</p>
               <p>Harness. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child full grown?</p>
               <p>Harness. It was.</p>

               <p>Jos. Ferdinando Gellio. I am pupil to a surgeon. On Monday June the 9th, I was sent for on the Coroner's inquest, and was desired to open the body of a female infant, in order to inform them whether it was still-born; I did, and tried the usual experiment; I took the lungs out, and put them into a bowl of water; they swam.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you infer from that?</p>
               <p>Gellio. The inference I infer from that is, that the child had breathed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to have been at its full time?</p>
               <p>Gellio. It did.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen this experiment tried?</p>
               <p>Gellio. I have frequently, and have tried it myself; the lungs are specifically lighter upon the water by having been inflated.</p>
               <p>Q. Will they swim when they are putrid?</p>
               <p>Gellio. They will.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether, in your opinion and judgment, the unfortunate woman at the bar might be delivered of this child as she sat on the vault?</p>
               <p>Gellio. I believe there is a possibility of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the child might have dropped from her as she sat on the vault?</p>
               <p>Gellio. I do.</p>

            . On Sunday the 8th of June I was desired to go to Arlington-street, to Lady Hop's; I went into her fore-parlour, there I saw Mr. Spinage and another gentleman; they told me what had been, and that the child was down in the hog house: they desired I would get people in order to search after the body; I went and got a master bricklayer and his man; they went to work in order to search; I believe they found the body of the child about three o'clock. I saw it found; I believe it might be got down four feet into the soil; by raking, it might get lower down than it would have done, had the soil not been disturbed; I desired them to put it on a bit of a board, and get a pail of water, and wash it clean; after that, I sent for the apothecary to search the body, to see if there were any marks of violence upon it; he came, and did not find any; then I went and acquainted the Coroner of Westminster of it.</p>

They catched hold of me by the collar, and by my handkerchief about my neck, and dragged me five or six yards back; then they knocked me down again. Some of the company asked me, if I was an Irishman; I could make no answer, being obliged to call out for help; then they kicked me; I called murder I about half a dozen times; I called to Mr. Boldridge, who lives near, I serve him with bread; his wife came to the window and called out, let the man alone; you are murdering fellows: they knocked me down again; somebody said, let him alone, he is no Irishman; some of the witnesses that are here, fetched some watchmen; by that time I was almost strangled with blood coming out at my mouth and nose; if it had not been for the neighbours and the by-watch, I should certainly have lost my life; I desired them to take all I had got, so that they spared my life; they d - d me, and said, I was no Irishman; I believe they are Irish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they demand any thing of you?</p>
               <p>Norwell. I cannot say whether they did or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any money or watch about you?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know them before?</p>
               <p>Norwell. I never saw them before to my knowledge: they both violently laid their hands upon me; Cowen knocked me down; he had my handkerchief. The prisoners were apprehended in about two or three hours after in the same court, by the constable and assistance: I was there, and pointed them out.</p>

            . I was coming down Golden-lane; this passage comes down between two streets, it is called Sun-alley; these people had been in a quarrel before; I stood by and saw it: there were the two prisoners, and two or three more, quarrelling with a man that they met accidentally, this was better than half an hour after ten o'clock; they parted with him, and came cross Red-lion-market, and down into this alley. There was another man, who said, these people are very quarrelsome: he would not go on, but turned another way; it was my way to go through; I staid at the top of the alley, thinking they might be got to the bottom, but instead of that, they turned into this court; when I came within 15 or 20 yards of the court, they turned back into a narrow passage; Cowen set his back against the wall of Mr. Dickenson's brewhouse, the others set their backs against the wall on the other side; I came boldly down, and cried, halloo, my boys! I was just got past the last of them; the prosecutor came; I had not gone past five or six steps before he was knocked down, they catched hold of him, and dragged him into the narrow court out of the open passage; at the corner of the court they knocked him down again; one of them d - d his eyes, and said, he is an Irishman; another d - d his eyes, and said, he is no Irishman, and down with him again; he cried, murder! another gentleman was coming; I ran to call the watchman, and just as we came up, Cowen catched the prosecutor by the breast, and threw him down again; they had been kicking of him before; I had seen that, but dar'd not go to his assistance; I went to call the constable; he was rather dilatory in coming, and I went back again; then the neighbours got out of their beds, and went to fetch the constable; he then came, and two or three watchmen; in the mean time these men were gone into a house; then we went all back to the watch-house. The prosecutor insisted on the constable setting somebody at the door where they went in; they set three men. I went home to bed, but was called up afterwards, and went to the watch-house, and was sure the two prisoners were two of them; that is a very dangerous place in a night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think people that had just committed a robbery would go into a house directly?</p>
               <p>Hodskin. People were got about, so that they could not get either way to get off.</p>

            . I am a lodger in Mr. Boldridge's house; about a quarter before eleven, I heard the cry of murder several times; I got out of bed, and saw the baker lying on the ground, and four or five men about him; he got up; I saw them knock him down again; he arose upon his knees, they knocked him down again; he cried murder! in a very alarming manner. The woman where I live got to the window and cried, you murdering thieves! have you a mind to murder another man: then I saw them run into the house where they were taken. When I came down to the baker, his mouth was full of blood; when I asked him what was the matter, he was not able to answer. I was at the taking the prisoners in their lodgings.</p>

            . I was coming home that night about half an hour after ten o'clock; I heard a noise of a parcel of people, and murder was cried; I pushed forward towards the broad place; I had not been there a minute before the prisoner Cowen knocked the baker down, and the other prisoner stamped upon him with his knee; they cried out, d - n him, he is no Irishman. I was obliged to make my escape as fast as I could. I ran to the watch-house in Red-cross-street: by that time people got to the watch-house; then we came up to the place where they abused him, and the men were got into their place of abode. We set three or four watchmen at the door; the constable knocked and asked for admittance; it was some time before they would open the door; the mob<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176607020031"/> insisted upon going up, and seeing what people there were in the garret: I went up with them; the constable would not break the door open; we came down again; the constable went to the watch-house, and three watchmen more came to watch; there came three or four people quite enraged, and insisted the door should be broke open: the constable came and went up with us, and a man took a watchman's staff and broke the door open; there we found four men in bed, the two prisoners were two of them; we guarded them one by one to the watch-house; the baker gave charge of the two prisoners, which I can swear to, that one knocked him down, and the other kneeled upon him. The landlord of the house where they lodged came to the watch-house, and said he could swear the other two were in bed by nine o'clock, upon which the constable allowed them bail; I could have swore to one of them that is let go.</p>

               <p>One of them tumbled over the other, and the man cried out, murder! and watch!

I asked him about the harness; he told me he had sold them at the Black-horse in Aldersgate-street; I went with two or three of my servants, and found them there, one Green bought them; we took them away.

            . I am the widow to the deceased; my husband came home about twelve o'clock that night; he was all over ashes; he said, he had been very ill used at a house in Thames-street by two villains; he complained prodigiously of his head, and said, the villain had given him his last blow, and desired I would go and get a friend on the morrow to see them brought to justice: all I gave him the next day came up again; he was very feverish; he got up, and went out about two hours, and came in again, and said he could drink nothing; he continued reaching all that night. I went out, and when I returned, my landlady told me my husband was dying. I went up to him; he had a violent fit, he had had one before. I sent for a surgeon, who bled him; this was on Thursday the 14th; he mentioned several times of their throwing gun-powder in his face; on the 28th at night he said he could neither spit nor blow his nose, but it made his head seem as if it would come in halves; he died between the 28th and 29th of May, a fortnight after he received this injury, and left word with me to bring them to justice as far as I could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ioney. I was sent for to the deceased on the 15th of May; he complained very much of his head; I asked him by what means it came; he informed me, he had been at a public-house by Thames-street, and in a fall his head went against something, and it grew worse and worse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention to you who did him the injury?</p>
               <p>Ioney. No, he did not; he mentioned two captains and some others: the symptoms he had upon him denoted an injured brain; upon which, I examined his head, but could find no wound or tumour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did those symptoms continue?</p>
               <p>Ioney. They did, till his death; he died, I think, the 28th; after his death I was desired to open the head, which I did, in the presence of another surgeon; we found there was no injury done to the external part, and the cranium was quite found; upon examining the brain itself, we found a large quantity of extravasated blood between the membrane and the brain, on the right side, the side he always complained of, from the time of his receiving the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. From the whole of your observation, what in your opinion was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Ioney. There is no doubt but the extravasation of blood in the brain, was the occasion of his death. No man could live in such a case.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you account for that extravasated blood?</p>
               <p>Ioney. No, but the concussion or shock might break a blood-vessel in the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not intemperate drinking burst the vessel?</p>
               <p>Ioney. Undoubtedly that is possible, from drinking or violent exercise.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have lived so long if the vessels of the brain had discharged any blood that night when he received an injury?</p>
               <p>Ioney. I think it is improbable, by reason the injury in the brain appeared increasing. I found nothing staid upon his stomach, and two days after he became paralytic, and that increased more and more to the time of his death; these are symptoms of an injured brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a man has lived in general a very intemperate life as to drinking, and should happen to fall with his head downwards, might that occasion the bursting of a blood-vessel in the brain?</p>
               <p>Ioney. Without doubt it may, the vessels being full.</p>

The next morning, at one o'clock, the watchman came and knocked at my chamber-door, and said my street-door was open; I concluded some lodger had gone out and left it open; I desired the watchman to shut it after him; I still continued in bed. In the morning, the young man that lodged with the prisoner, came and asked me if I had seen him; saying, he is gone, and has stole my coat and a pair of shoes. I then went down into the bar, and missed my tea-chest; I sent for a constable, and went in quest of the prisoner; we found him; he owned to the taking the things, and had the spoons in his pocket: (produced and deposed to.)</p>

I went into the stable about nine, there was the prisoner and two horses; the prosecutor's horse. I found to be what Cotterel had described to me; I said to the prisoner, That is a good likely sort of a horse, I suppose he is upon sale; no, said the prisoner, he is not; I said, If you have a mind to sell him, I can help you to a customer; he would put no price upon him.</p>

            . I was taking a walk with some company on Sunday was se'nnight. The prisoner was running after 2 sheep in a field by Sadler's Wells house; he desired us to stop her; we opened a pen; she ran in, and we catched her; I asked him who was the owner of the sheep; he said it belonged to a man in Swan-alley; he did not mention any name; I had a suspicion he had stole it, so I followed him; when he came into Goswell-street, he took the sheep to a butcher, who said he knew nothing at all of him or the sheep, so I stopped the sheep and prisoner there. I sent a watchman for the constable, and delivered them into his care.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Who catched the sheep?</p>
               <p>Goff. The man that was along with me did. The prisoner at first said it belonged to him.</p>

My father had bought me two new shifts, one I had on, the other was in the wash; the prisoner took away one of them, and had got my ear-rings in her ears.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given her any authority to wear them?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. No, never none at all; she had cloaths and things to wear of her own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the ear-rings in her ears?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. I did; she took them out of her ears before the Justice. I had been out about three weeks, and when I came home, that very night she was turned out. She had the shift on her back, and owned to it before the Justice that it was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is your father?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. He is sixty-four years of age.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these ear-rings your property?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. They are, I bought them with my own money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any such ear-rings as these?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. She never had her ears boarded in her life before the Saturday I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to have these ear-rings in her ears?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. She did as she would with my father, because he was sick in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these ear-rings in your father's custody?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. They were. </p>
               <p>Q. Was this with your father's knowledge?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. I cannot tell; I have known her to go and lie with my father when he has not wanted her; he did not want any woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your father give her some cloaths after your mother died?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. My father was not to allow her any wages; he was to find her cloaths, she agreed to that; he gave her mourning and second mourning, or he lent them to her while in his service; she gave it out that she was married to my father.</p>
