I am a builder and decorator, of 3, Gloucester Ter<lb/>racea, South Kensington—I formerly carried on business with a Mr. Williams—in February, 1885, we executed a deed of assignment to our creditors, and a trustee was appointed—an advertisement was issued calling on our creditors to send in any claim, on our estate on or before 31st March, 1885—in consequence of something I heard from one of my workmen, I went to 67, Strand, in January, 1887—I saw a plate outside with the name of F.H. Dougal and Co. on it, first floor—I went up and saw the name of Dougal on the door—I went in and saw an elderly man named Keyboard in his slippers, of whom I purchased this book, and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it (<hi rend="italic">This contained a list of person, whose next-of-kin were entitled to unclaimed moneys</hi>)—in this book I saw the name of my firm; "Charien and Williams"—I wrote to the defendant asking to be furnished with particulars—I received this reply stating that he would have the records searched and furnish particulars on receipt of a postal-order for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I sent believing I should hear something to my advantage—in reply to my postalorder I received from the prisoner this advertisement (<hi rend="italic">This was a copy of the advertisement in the Daily Telegraph calling upon the creditors of Scharien and William to send in their cliams on or before 25th March</hi>, 1885)—that was quite valueless to me—after this I went to the prisoner's office to try and pet my money back—I did not see him; I</p>

                  </hi>. I am 23 years of age—I am now living with my sister at 60, Orpingdale Road, Holloway—I have been acquainted with the prisoner about three years, he is a jeweller—during the time I have known him he has been in the employment of a Mr. Edwards, a jeweller—I first began to live with him in May last—some connection had taken place between us in the autumn before, and as the result I became in the family way—I was expecting my confinement, and went to live with him from May to 17th June, at 24, Roden Street, Holloway—I had a room upon the ground floor, and he had a room upstairs—about a fortnight or three weeks before 21st June I asked the prisoner what was best to be done, and he said he thought it best for mother to have the baby and for me to go out to service again—I had been both in service and in business before—my mother did not know the position I was in—he said he did not know what he should do without me—he was keeping me, and I was helping him with money I had saved—before my confinement I had noticed a box which he owned standing against the sofa in the parlour, and I had noticed a revolver there many times when he was present—I thought it was a six-chambered revolver, but it was eight-chambered—he only said what a nice revolver it was—the confinement took place on the 10th, and I remained in bed until the following Friday—the child, only lived about seven hours—Dr. Davis was called in by the prisoner on the 11th, and he attended to me after my confinement—on Friday, the 17th, the prisoner went to the American Exhibition, and came back about 5 o'clock—I was in bed at the time—he remained downstairs some hour or two, and he seemed very kind, but he didn't seem to be able to settle down, and he looked as if he had had a drop—he asked me if I would take any supper, and I said "Yes," and he went out and got some soles, and I think we had supper between 6 and 7 o'clock—he remained in the room during the evening smoking and drinking beer—we had a cask of beer in the house, and he went out of the room and fetched some up in a jug—he went for beer three or four times and brought back a full jug each time—we drank four quarts between us—I drank a quart, and he had three quarts, but I did not see any difference in him then or when he came back from the Exhibition—we kept talking together up to about 9 or 10 o'clock, and then he went down into the kitchen to have supper with the landlady—he came back in about half an hour—he said "You look as if you had been troubling, old girl"—I said "No, I have had nothing to trouble</p>

               <p>about"—he then asked me if I would have some more beer—I had some, and he gave me some strawberries—he kept on drinking, and I kept telling him not to have any more—he then said "Take hold of my hand, old girl, and try and pull it away," and I tried to pull it away, and he said "You are getting nice and strong," and I said "Yes"—he then said "It would be the death of you, old girl, if you saw me go away, and I said "Yes"—he then said "Will you die with me to-night, old girl?"—I burst out crying and said "No"—I fainted—he then caught hold of me and said "Hang me if I don't"—he said "Don't cry, old girl, it will soon be over; don't be frightened, old girl, I have got to go over to the box before I get it," and he pointed to the box that he used to keep the revolver in, but he did not go over to the box then; he stood by me—he then drank more beer, and stood by my bedside about an hour and a half, to near midnight—I then asked him for his penknife; I said if he gave me his penknife I should be happy, and he let me get it out from his ticket pocket—he then said he hid some brandy, would I have some—I said I did not want any, and he did not fetch it—he then said "You have never seen me cry before, have you?"—I said "No," and he burst out crying, and put his arms round my neck and kissed me—he remained there until some streaks of daylight came through the window, and then looked up to the clock and said "It is nearly 3 o'clock"—I said "Yes, it is getting daylight"—he then went to the washhand<lb/>stand near the window, as if he was looking out of the window, and then he took a revolver from his coat pocket, and fired towards me; I was then sitting" up—I cannot say whether he pointed the revolver first—I counted six shots, and I was hit by the bullets five times—I called out "Murder!"—he then laid down on the sofa and held the revolver to his chest—I managed to get out of bed while he was lying there and went upstairs and call out, and the landlady and her two sons came to my assistance—I knew he had one revolver, but I did not know of his having a second one—I saw nothing more of the prisoner till I saw him before the Magistrate—I was taken to the Great Northern Hospital, and remained there till 14th August, when I was taken before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have lived with the prisoner both at Seven Sisters Road and also at Gloucester Road, where I had a child—he has always behaved as a quiet inoffensive man; he was very fond of me and was much attached to me—during my last confinement he treated me with the very best kindness, and himself brought a doctor to me, and was very anxious about me—after the death of the child he seemed very different; he seemed very excited and worried about it, and complained of want of sleep, and that he could not eat—during my confinement he was not in the same room with me; he frequently used to come down in the night, and tell me he could not sleep—the night before this occurred he was down in my room nearly all night—I had never known him drink like this before—he did not complain of thirst—I did not think he was going to shoot himself when he talked about the revolver—when he began to cry and spoke about breaking my heart I did not know at all what he was talking about—when I first, knew him he spoke to me of a very bad fall from a bicycle, and he complained of pains in his head at Christmas time last—he said he was very bad.</p>

I was on duty in Roden Street on the morning of 21st June, about 20 minutes past 3, and heard some pistol shots coming from No. 24—on going towards the house I saw the prisoner come out of it; he was fully dressed, and wearing slippers—the last witness said "Stop him, he has shot his wife"—upon that the prisoner ran away; he put his hand in his pocket—I had a considerable chase after him, and in the end seized him and overpowered him—I put my hand in his right coat pocket, but found no revolver there, but I took a box from there containing 44 cartridges, and I afterwards fitted them to the six-chambered revolver—I told the prisoner he would have to come back to the house with me—he said "All right, constable, I will go back with you," and several times on the way he exclaimed "It will all come out"—when I got into the passage outside the parlour door the prisoner pulled at the door and said "There she is, in there," and tried to get into the room, but I would not let him—another constable then came in, and I handed the prisoner over to him, I afterwards saw the woman upstairs, and then came down again, and saw the prisoner straggling in the front parlour with the constable, and I took this eight-chambered revolver from the prisoner; it was loaded in every chamber—I then went with him to the station, and he there said "I tried to intimidate you during the chase by feeling in my pockets, but don't think for a moment I tried to shoot you."</p>

About 4.30 a.m. on this morning I went to Roden Street, and in the front room I saw the quilt and sheet on the floor, and saw the stains of blood in the bed and on the bed clothing—Dr. Cowie, of the Great Northern Hospital, gave me three bullets, which fit the six-chambered revolver—at the station the charge was read over to the prisoner—it was for shooting at Jane Hendy with intent to murder her—he said, "I understand"—that is all he said.</p>

I am a surgeon, practising at 135, Hornsey Road—on Saturday, 11th June, I was called in by the prisoner to see this young woman, who had just been confined; the midwife was with her at the time—the child did not live—on the morning of 17th June one of the Woods came to me, and in consequence of what he said I went to 24,</p>

               <p>Roden Street, and there saw the prisoner in custody in the hall—I then went upstairs, and saw the woman, in her nightdress, in a fainting con<lb/>dition—I examined her, and found that she had a bullet wound in the upper part of the right arm, the bone was broken—there was also a bullet wound in the left wrist, and a third in the left shoulder, and a fourth on the left thigh, and a fifth at the back of the left shoulder—I dressed the wounds as well as I could, and then took her to the Great Northern Hospital—I was present when her nightdress was taken from her, and saw a bullet fall from it; it had struck her and then dropped out—I was present when a second bullet was extracted from the left wrist—three of the wounds were very serious.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at the Great Northern Hospital, and attended to this woman when she was brought there on this morning by Mr. Evans—there were five distinct injuries, and two bullets are still in her, one under the collar-bone, and one in the wrist—the thigh injury splintered the bone—three of the bullets were taken from her and given to the inspector—she remained under my care until the 18th of August; she progressed very favourably—at the begin<lb/>ning she was in danger, but she has recovered and is now out of danger—the bullets in the body do not produce any danger—I think the lameness will go away—I took two bullets out from her, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one that dropped from her nightdress; it came from the right shoulder wound, and had splintered the bone and gone right through the shoulder; the bullet was nearly cut in half.</p>

I am head postman at Lower Edmonton—the prisoner was employed there as a suburban postman—he was on duty on 23rd April—this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is signed by him, and shows that the letter was received at 4.6 p.m.—it is "Received by E. Thomp<lb/>son"—it was his duty on receiving a registered letter to enter it in the general entry-book with carbon, and there is a counterfoil which should be signed by the person who receives the letter—a letter addressed to that place would be in the prisoner's delivery—I afterwards noticed that the receipt for the letter was not there—I asked him where it was—he said he would bring it next time; he had not got it with him—on the same day he brought this piece of paper signed as it is now "E. Thomason," which I believe to be his writing—on Wednesday, the 27th, he was suspended, and on the 27th or 28th he absconded and never returned.</p>

I am an expert in handwriting—I have ex<lb/>amined the writing on these three postal orders with the writing on these papers A and B, and, in my opinion they are the same, but disguised in the capitals—I have also examined them with the delivery-book, where the capitals are not disguised, and that is more clear—I have examined various entries against which a cross has been put, which are not Van White's writing or Mr. Dickenson's—all the d's in "Adams," which occurs six times in the postal orders, are made with an "o" and the top going round, and that is the invariable rule with the d's in the delivery-book and in the paper marked A—the word "Square" on the postal orders and on the paper are practically the same, and there are a number of other instances—I have doubt about the writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no doubt whatever that the prisoner wrote these three postal orders—the word Leicester is spelt in two different ways—I should say that the paper marked B was written when the man was in a state of nervousness and shaky, and he would try to alter his writing, which he has done in the capital R's—a man's bodily health affects his writing—a man who had been writing all day would not write the same in the evening as he did in the morning, but my belief is that this is the same writing, as the capital It's in the delivery-book agree with the postal orders; but the test writing is different—one is to prove a negative and the other a positive; one is made by one operation of the pen, and the other by two, but the second part of it is the same-there are three little s's in the postal orders, the word Adams finishes with an "s" which is written up in the air, and in the word "Thames" in pencil the "s" also goes up in the air, and on August 27th in the word "Catherines" the same feature occurs, and I have several instances in the book, of s's which agree with the postal orders—I say that the writing on the postal orders and in the delivery-book are the same—the writing in the postal orders is shaky, but it is nearer than the test writing is.</p>

I was on duty at South Kensing<lb/>ton Station, and in consequence of information I went to On slow Square, I saw a crowd; the prisoner was running away and the prosecutrix was lying on her back on the ground, insensible—I took the prisoner—he said "I have stabbed my wife, it is her fault; I am sorry for it, and if she is dead I will hang for her"—at the station he was charged, he said "I stabbed her, I hope she won't die; it is her fault and her friends'"—he repeated that several times—I asked him what he stabbed her with—lie said "I shan't tell you"—I searched him at the station, and found this long-bladed knife in his pocket; it had blood on it—I took the prosecutrix to the station in a cab and sent for a doctor, who put some plaister on the wounds and then sent her to the Chelsea Infirmary—the prisoner was drunk, but sensibly drunk; he seemed to know what he was doing.</p>

When I procured the steak I was crossing the road to Mr. and Mrs. Emmett, who stood on the opposite side, to give them the steak and the change, when the butcher tapped me on the shoulder and told me it was a bad two-shilling piece. I told him I did not know anything about it, as it was given me to purchase the steak." The Emmetts were then charged—in reply to that statement the Emmetts both said they were not there—Rose Emmett afterwards said "Emmett left us a short time previously by ourselves, that we might go round the corner for a certain purpose"—they were then charged—Manyon said "Both Emmetts were over the way when I went in for the meat; when I pro<lb/>cured the meat I was crossing the road towards them, when the butcher tapped me on the shoulder. I turned round, and they went away."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer—about 5.30 on Saturday evening, 27th August, I passed the three prisoners in the Haymarket, and as I did so one of them said "They nearly <hi rend="italic">rumbled</hi> me"—that means "They nearly found me out"—I followed them—Howell and Hancock crossed the road, and Lawler walked up on the right-hand side—I asked him for a match; he gave me one, and I lit my pipe, and still followed them—the three joined again just adjoining Glasshouse Street—I spoke to Simpkins, 77 C; he accompanied me—the prisoners went towards Brewer Street, and one of them (I could not say which, as I was round the corner) went into the post-office there—that was the last I saw of them—I told the constable, and he apprehended them—when one went into the post-office the others walked along to the corner of Brewer Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Howell</hi>. The day you were apprehended was the Saturday of the demonstration in Trafalgar Square—I was quite sober when I went to the police-station on the Saturday night—I had been at work the same day—I don't remember saying at the police-office that some one else, not Lawler, went into the post-office—the policeman told me to keep back—I could not get close to you because of the 'busses crossing along Glasshouse Street—I had a black eye on the Monday when I was at the police-court; perhaps some of your confederates did it—I have never been in prison—I was working for Wetherall, Lee, and Martin, decorators, of Mayfair, on this day—we left off work at 1 o'clock, and I was going to the demonstration—I followed you 20 or 30 yards.</p>

On Saturday evening, 27th August, I received information from Hagglestone, and in consequence I followed the three prisoners, whom I first saw in Sherwood Street talking together—they walked about half way up Sherwood Street to opposite Denman Street—Howell crossed the street and walked up on one side of the street, and the other two prisoners on the other—they joined at the corner of Brewer and Sherwood Streets—they turned the corner, and I lost sight of them for two or three minutes, and when I got to the corner of Brewer Street and Sherwood Street I saw the three prisoners standing at the corner of Air Street—Hancock and Lawler left Howell and went to the corner of Warwick Street—I passed Howell while he was looking into a shop—he went up the steps of the post office, 32, Brewer Street—I could not say whether he went in or not—as soon as he came out I went in and made a communication—neither of the other prisoners went into the public-house—I came out and followed the throe prisoners again—Howell had joined Hancock and Lawler at the corner of Warwick Street—Lawler had been in my sight up till then, except for two or three minutes, when I lost sight of him—I followed them half way up Warwick Street to the corner of Regent's Place—I then sent Hagglestone</p>

               <p>to follow them up Warwick Street to get assistance, and I ran round into Regent Street and met a soldier—I asked him to assist me in taking three men into custody—he came with me, and I saw all three prisoners together at the corner of Chapel Place, Regent Street, where I took Howell and Hancock into custody, and pointed Lawler out to the other constable, who took him into custody—I said I should take them for passing bad money—Hancock said "I think you have made a mis<lb/>take"—Howell said nothing—all three were taken to the station, where I searched Lawler and found on him nine florins and three half-crowns all bad—he put them into his right hand, and said they were bad—the three half-crowns were wrapped in one piece of paper, eight florins together in another piece, and one florin in another piece—I also found two half-crowns, two florins, one shilling, and three sixpences, and ten<lb/>pence good money—I found one shilling and three half-pence good money on Hancock, and nothing on Howell—Hancock gave a correct address and Howell an address at a common lodging-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a contractor of 106, Upper Fore Street, Edmon<lb/>ton—about 6.30 p.m. on 1st August I was standing at my door and saw the deceased and prisoner speaking together—the prisoner closed his hand to strike Hall, who was standing with his back to me with his hands down—I then saw the prisoner put his hands down, and then about a minute afterwards I saw him repeat the same attitude and strike the deceased, as it seemed to me, in the lower part of the face, and he fell into the road with his arms spread out, and his head struck the ground; and he never moved after that—he had never moved his hand in any way—the prisoner made off, and I went across the road and told him he must not go away as he had killed a man—he said "What is it to do with you?"or "Why have you to interfere with it? and if you have anything to say I shall serve you the same"—he then proceeded to walk away, and I told him he must not go, as I should follow him—he turned into Church Road and I followed him; he then turned round and came within a pace of me with his fist closed to strike me; a lot of people were congregated there, and some one cried "Run, Tom"—he then buttoned up his coat and said "If you want me you will have to run after me"—I said "No, I shall not, because I know you"—I then went and helped to get the deceased to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a basket-maker, living at Edmonton—I was sitting at my window between 6 and 7 o'clock on Bank holiday and saw the deceased, and the prisoner standing in front of him; Hall was in the road with one foot on the kerb and the other in the roadway, and they were having some altercation—I did not hear exactly what was said, but the prisoner said something of a threatening character, and I heard the deceased say, "Hit me," or "Don't hit me," or something of that sort—the prisoner then made a feint, or attempted to strike the deceased, and then in quick succession struck him two blows, one with each fist, about the head, and the deceased threw his arms open and fell backwards—I went down, and saw the blood gushing from his right ear—the prisoner walked away first, and then quickened his pace—I said, "He must not go away," and I went after him, along with Mr. South—I said, "The man is seri<lb/>ously hurt," and asked him to come back—he said he would not—I said, "You must," and he said something about "You won't hold me"—he also said he would serve us the same, but I don't know whether it was said to Mr. South or myself, as we were together.</p>

I am relieving officer of the Holborn Union—the prisoner is married—she was living at Leather Lane Buildings with her husband after the birth of her child, on 19th April—her husband was a deserter from the army, he had left her two years before to join the army; he came back and was there till 6th June—while he was there no outdoor relief was granted to the prisoner—a parish midwife was sent to her—her husband was in custody on 7th June; she told me he had assaulted her, and she handed him over in custody as a deserter—we have since given her some relief for four weeks—she had four children—she told me she was able to earn about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I first saw the deceased child on 30th July, that was about three weeks after the relief had stopped—in consequence of a complaint made to me by the police I went to the prisoner's place—I found the child there very dirty, very emaciated; I sent for some milk, which it took with avidity—I saw the prisoner and told her to look better after her children, she said she would—I thought the other children were in fairly good condition—the things in the room were very dirty, and there was a great quantity of vermin about—this is the doctor's certificate, it states that the child was suffering from improper food.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and medical officer of the City Road workhouse—the deceased child was brought there for admis<lb/>sion on the afternoon of 1st August, it was in a very emaciated condition—its weight then was 8 pounds, it ought to have weighed 12 pounds at least—the emaciation arose from starvation; whether that was from total privation of food, or mal-administration, I could not say; the effect would be the same—I saw it every day till the 5th, it then had an attack of diarrhoea, which continued till its death—the cause of the diarrhoea was the non-assimilation of food—its appearance did not show neglect when brought to me, it had then been cleaned and washed, and had clean things on; there were no sores, there was redness of the skin, as if it had been long in wet things—I made a post-mortem examination by order of the Coroner, it revealed no disease indicating diarrhoea, or any cause for death; the appearances were such as are found in cases of starvation—there was no disease traceable.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Rose public-house in Wimpole Street—I have known the prisoner for four or five years—I knew the late Mr. Hut ton, the bone-setter, by repute, and by serving him with bottles of wine at his establishment—on Saturday evening, August 6th, at 10 o'clock, I saw the prisoner—he said to me "Oh, Schwartz, will you cash this cheque for me?"—he gave me this cheque—I looked at it and said "Yes"—I made a sort of demur at first—he said "I have received it from a patient on whom I have performed an operation, and as I always like the money in these sort of affairs and they had not got a cheque form with them, they wrote it out on a stamped piece of paper; it is all right"(<hi rend="italic">The cheque was dated August</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi>,1887, <hi rend="italic">and was drawn on the West Hartlepool Bank in favour of R.B.

Hunter—on Monday morning the first thing I sent my man to the London and County Bank with it—they refused it, saying there was no such bank in existence—I have had many letters from the prisoner, but I never saw him write—he has acknowledged letters as his own—some three or four years ago when Mr. Hutton was alive I lent the prisoner some money, and he owed me a little money for goods, and letters passed—I know his handwriting—to the very best of my belief this cheque is all the prisoner's writing—I could swear to it, but I would rather not—on the Monday morning after my potman had gone to the bank, I received a telegram asking me to hold the cheque—I received another telegram, but did not see him till the following Friday night or Saturday morning, when he was taken into custody.</p>

D'Eickethal and Williams's desk, locked up the office, and took the key away with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, in partnership with Mr. Nottaman, at 4, Hart Street, Bloomsbury—in May, 1885, I was slightly, acquainted with the prisoner—towards the end of that month he called upon me and wished to borrow some money upon the security of some Brazilian bonds—I introduced him to Mr. Bourne, the Secretary of the National Guardian Insurance Co.—he produced some of these bonds to Mr. Bourne in my presence—I recognise these produced as the bonds—in the September following the prisoner called on me again to borrow money, he proposed some more Brazilian bonds as security—I deposited those with my bankers, these are those (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>). there were seven—I got a loan of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon them from my bank, the London and County, Bayswater Branch—I advanced that to the prisoner—in October I wrote to him to remind him that he had borrowed the money for a month; I saw him, and suggested that we should borrow a larger amount from the National Guardian, and take up the bonds from my bankers, no further security was suggested then—the bonds were taken up from the bank, and a loan of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was granted by the National Insurance Co. in December, 1885—at the time of the completion of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan I was present when Mr. Bourne asked the prisoner whether the bonds were his, and how long he had had them, and the price he gave—he replied that they were his, that he had had them five or six years, and that he gave 16, that was his answer—between December, 1885, down to June, 1887, I made other advances to the prisoner on the security of one other Brazilian bond and one Lombardy Venetian, these are them; that makes 14 Brazilian bonds in all—on 17th January last year I made an advance to the prisoner, and took 14 bonds; I kept them at home for some time, and then took them to the bank for safety, for fear they might be burnt—there were 14 Brazilian bonds and one South-Eastern—on 29th July last I received a communication from the manager of my bank, and upon that I communicated with Mr. Williams, of the firm of D'Eickethal and Williams—I met him and Mr. Gregson, their solicitor, and then communicated with the prisoner—I told him that the money was due upon the bonds, and requested immediate payment—he said if I gave him about a week he would pay it—I went out of town immediately after that, and was staying at Harrow—I there received this telegram from the prisoner—it was delivered at Harrow while I was at the seaside—this is the telegram, "Your cousin can sell 14 Brazilians to-morrow"—I received this other telegram, "Will see you to-night or to-morrow, do nothing till I see you"—I received also this telegram, dated 30th July, "Will not sell security, I shall see your cousin, if he likes, before 12 at your office."</p>

I carry on business as a stockbroker in copartnership with Mr. D'Eickethal, as D'Eickethal and Williams, at Wharton Court, and late of 14, Throgmorton Street—on the morning 22nd April, 1885, about 10 a.m. I arrived at my offices and went into my room in the usual way to look for my letters and did not find one there—I have seen the prisoner about Throgmorton Street and knew him by sight quite well—I had a cousin of his in my employ, but I did not know it at the time, he has now left—as soon as I discovered the loss I telegraphed to the gentlemen who have been called here to-day and received replies from them, ascertaining what the enclosures were in the respective letters, and then I communicated with the police at Old Jewry—I also caused an advertisement to be inserted in four daily papers, and it was published on 9th May—these produced are the placards—I also gave notice of the loss of these bonds to Messrs. Morton, Ross, and Co., who are the agents for the Brazilian railway—I heard nothing more of the bonds till July of this year, and I then recovered two from Messrs. Attenborough's, for which I had to pay 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one from a Mr. Hans, a money changer, I did not pay him anything—on 29th July last Mr. Chamberlain came to my office and I then communicated with my solicitor and in due course a warrant was applied for—I received the address of the prisoner from Mr. Chamberlain—I saw the prisoner on the 12th August after he was arrested, and he said first "I did not steal them, if you say these bonds are yours why not take them? what is the good of prosecuting? you will only cause a lot of trouble and bother and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188709120047"/>

               <p>we had to enter it in the register; that was the only book I saw; there was no ledger or cash-book or press letter-book—I was occupied up to about the middle of the day—the prisoner used to come about 10 o'clock, and leave soon after 11 o'clock, and as a rule I saw no more of him that day—on 28th May I told him I wished to give him a month's notice—he asked me why—I said the business was not as he represented; it did not come up to my expectations, and I was anxious not to lose my time, I wished to leave directly—I showed him an agreement I had drawn up, and asked him to agree to it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">This agreed to forego the three weeks' salary, the</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to be returned within a fortnight</hi>)—the prisoner filled in the date—I called at the end of the fortnight, and asked for my 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he was very sorry he could not pay it then; he would pay it on the following Friday—I said I could not give him till Friday; I would come on Wednesday—I did go on Wednesday, and he was not in—I left word that I would call—I then went to a solicitor—I have not received back any of my money;—there was no genuine business carried on at the office.</p>

Bank of England notes, and he handed me this promissory note for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I remained till 15th November—I never saw any business done—he sent me out to the auction mart, and if possible to get the names of the buyers, so that he might send on some property that he had for sale, but it was not possible to get the names of any of the buyers—that and going about and delivering letters was the whole of my business—there were two other clerks, and a third came just before I left—there were four books kept while I was there—I saw no account books or letter-books except one old one—I was not satisfied, and on 8th October gave notice to leave—I said I expected my deposit to be returned; he said of course it would be on 12th November, but it was not—I received about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in salary while there, but I did not get it till 27th October—not getting back my deposit I placed the matter in Mr. Cooper's hands; 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been returned through him, the remaining 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is still owing—I paid the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the statements he made to Mr. Cooper, which Mr. Cooper told me of.</p>

I live at 4, Croxted Road, West Dulwich—I acted on behalf of my cousin in effecting this arrangement—. on 4th August, 1886, I called at Chancery Lane and saw the prisoner—I told him I had called with regard to Mr. Armstrong's taking a post with. him, and I should be glad to have some particulars—after some conversa<lb/>tion I said "Why do you require the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit?"—he said "If I advertise for a clerk at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. salary I should have hundreds of applica<lb/>tions if no deposit was required, so I think it best to have a deposit; it also tends to make the clerks take more interest in the business"—I said "Do you want this money to pay a clerk that is leaving?"—he said "No" at first, but continuing the sentence, he said "Well, in one sense I do; a clerk is leaving, and I shall have to pay him, and if I arrange with Mr. Armstrong it will make no difference in my banking account"—I said that frauds had been perpetrated through similar advertisements—he said "Yes, they do that sometimes in the City, and that makes it hard lines for those who want to deal honestly"—I then asked him about his business, and said "Will your business stand 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year salary for a clerk?"—he said "Oh yes, much more than that; I am doing a good business, and hope to improve it"—he said he had got some mortgages on hand and was shortly going to have some sales at the auction mart—I believed his statements, and communicated the substance of them to my cousin, and three or four days after I attended and witnessed the execu<lb/>tion of the agreement—the money was paid on the belief of the state<lb/>ments that had been made to me—it was under my advice that my cousin afterwards gave notice of the withdrawal of the money—all I got back was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I walked to the entrance to the court on the opposite side of the street and I saw two men come over the gate"—I said, "Do you recognise any<lb/>one here?"—he said. "Yes, the men you have hold of"—the prisoners were then taken to the station—I and Miles went to 221, Upper Thames Street, but it was too dark to see anything—next morning I went there again, and examined the first-floor window—I found it open about 6 inches, and on the outside of the barred window the ground floor, on the other side of the gate, were footmarks on the ledge, and the rust was wiped away—just inside the window were piles of crockery, and glass globes, and stove tiles, standing one on top of another, in front of the window, close to it—the window overlooks a staircase, and at the bottom of the staircase were a number of these tiles and globes broken, having fallen down the well-staircase—at the station the prisoners were searched, and on Wilkins was found some money and keys, but nothing relating to the charge, and on Richardson a cabman's badge, and a knife which would force back a window catch, and some silent matches—Richardson's hands were very dirty.</p>

I am assistant to Teuton and Rowbotham, iron<lb/>mongers, of 221, Upper Thames Street—I examined the first floor stair-case window, and the premises right through, at 7.15 p.m. on the 10th; the window was fastened with an ordinary sash-fastener—just inside the win<lb/>dow are glass globes, stacked up on the window ledge, and under the window on the staircase iron goods are stored; the glass globes had fallen on those, and such a noise would be caused by that as to be heard at 29, Thames Street—the window communicates with a staircase which com<lb/>municates with all the rest of the premises—there is a large and very valuable stock on the premises—Richardson was in the employment of Teuton and Co. for from 12 to 18 months—he left some 12 months ago, I believe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a beershop-keeper, of 2, Haggerston Road—on the morning of 20th July I locked up my house at 12.30—the doors were secured, my property was safe at that time, and the fanlight was all right—I was aroused about 2.40, and came down and saw the prisoner in front of the bar lying on a. form, I could hardly say whether awake or asleep; a constable was close to him—I missed a clock, some cheese, cigars, and tobacco—I found, after I came back from the station, that the beer had been tampered with, I do not know if any had been drawn—I have only seen the cheese and tobacco since and some fragments of the cigars—the prisoner had been in my shop on Tuesday—when I shut it up there was no one in it.</p>

On the morning of 20th July I was passing the prosecutor's beershop—I tried the door, and it opened—I hesitated a minute or two, and then heard the bolts at the door at the other side of the house going—it is a corner house, and I was in the Clarence Road—I did not try the door that the ventilator is over—I went in; I went through the private parlour into the bar, and then into the public place, and saw the prisoner standing up—when he saw me he attempted to get away, making a movement towards the door, but I was too close; he then laid down on a form and pretended to be asleep—I called Mr. Woodford up—he told me he missed a clock—after we had taken the prisoner to the station I examined the front door, and found the bolts and screws of the fanlight over it had been forced off, so that the fanlight was forced completely off—we took it to the station—the door under the fanlight was locked—when the prisoner was charged he said "It was a pity, old fellow, you did not have any more bread; the cheese was all right, and the bitter ale was very good"—he was evidently under the influence of drink after he came into the air, he did not appear so in the public-house—I searched him at the station, and found five cigars and half an ounce of tobacoo on him—cheese was scattered about, and this was tied up in the prisoner's handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, of 74, Queen Victoria Street—up to March this year Wilson had been a casual customer at my shop, and on 8th March I heard him propose to my assistant that he should be supplied on credit with tobacco—I said that I would attend to it—at that interview a man named Burdett came into the shop, and Wilson spoke to him—I commenced to supply tobacco, cigars, and other things, in March and April, upon written orders to the amount of 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this is my account—Adams brought me this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is written on the back of an envelope, so that the bearer could read it if he chose: "Kindly let my manager have half a pound of tobacco, very best; do not send any more to my private address. Yours truly, George Wilson"—there is no date to it—I supplied that tobacco, and I have an entry of the price, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believed that Adams was Wilson's manager—Adams afterwards brought this latter written on a card so that he could read it (<hi rend="italic">The front of the card described Wilson as a sanitary engineer, of</hi> 3, <hi rend="italic">Albert Embankment, S. W., inventor of the crystal water filters &amp;c., and on the back was written</hi>: "Kindly let my man have half a pound gold flake, best tobacco; I did not like the last half-pound you sent me")—I supplied that tobacco—I also received this letter, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) (<hi rend="italic">This was on the same kind of card, dated March 23rd</hi>: "Dear Mr. Kettle, kindly let my foreman have two boxes of Larranaga cigars, also send account due up to March")—I supplied those two boxes—from time to time, up to April 7th, I was continually supplying goods, entries of all of which I have here—I think Burdett brought this next letter (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he wanted to present his friend, Sir Edward Lee, who was going to form the business into a company, with a nice amber cigar tube and a box of cigars, and requested the witness to address them to Sir Edward Lee</hi>)—I supplied Wilson with a cigar tube, price three guineas, and 50 cigars at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., believing that they were to be sent to Sir Edward Lee for a present, and I did them up and addressed them to Sir Edward according to his directions—I had sent a sample cigar with the parcel, and on the same day I received this other letter: "Kindly let bearer have the six boxes as per sample sent, they are good enough for visitors; Sir Edward Lee is delighted with the cigar-holder and cigars; I will introduce him and his friends to you"—I supplied the six boxes, thinking he wanted them for his visitors—I did not think he was going to pawn them the same day; the price of them was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I naturally Sir Edward Lee had received the cigar-tube</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188709120066"/>
               <p>and the 150 cigars, when the prisoner said that he was delighted with them—the next letter he sent was on Sir Edward Lee's note paper: "30, Cockspur Street, Charing Cross. Dear Mr. Kettle.—In case I have to go to Wales to-morrow, please send me two boxes of cigars of not more than 25 per box, and one box of Egyptian cigarettes with tube, &amp;c.;" and he enclosed a cigar wrapper showing the brand required—I supplied him with those two boxes and the cigarettes—the note also said, "You can calculate on receiving my cheque before Saturday"—I did not receive any cheque—I think I had sent in my account at that time—I accepted as true the statement he made of his having arranged for a visit to Wales—I next received this letter from him: "Please let me have 50 cigars, and charge the same to my account. Yours truly, George Wilson"—somebody called on me who I did not know, and I supplied him with these cigars, price 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had been to this engineering works and potteries at 3, Albert Enbankment, and I believed they belonged to Wilson, and that he carried on business there—I received other letters after this bearing the same heading, and I supplied him with other goods—Adams, I think, fetched the larger portion of the goods—I did not know when I supplied these goods to Wilson that he was an undischarged bankrupt, he did not tell me that—when the debt got to over 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I pressed for payment, and wrote letters, and ultimately put it in the hands of my solicitors—I have never recovered anything—on 23rd March I have two boxes of cigars in my account—I have identified some cigars since, but I don't know whether they are those or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RICHMOND</hi>. Wilson came to my shop several times previous to 8th March; he used to come in two or three times a week—I do a good business—I sent the goods on the representation that I should be a paid monthly, I had no other representation—I am not in the habit of letting customers run up their bills to 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not make inquiries about Wilson—I should have decidedly objected to supplying Adams with the goods if Wilson had not wrote on the cards that he was his foreman; I only supplied them to Adams because I thought they were going to Wilson—I should not have refused to have sent them if he had said "I want these goods to present to Sir Edward Lee"—I should have refused to have sent them if he had said "I went the cigars to present to Sir Richard Moon," but I thought Sir Edward Lee was forming these works into a company—if he had only said, "I want these cigars," I might have declined to supply them, because I should have been inclined to think he could not have smoked them all—nothing was said to me about pawning them—when the account had run up to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I wrote and asked for payment, and Wilson wrote and also called on me; he said the works were being formed into a company, and that the Admiralty authorities were practising some patents of his, and he expected a deposit in a few days, and I should then have a cheque—I went to the works at 3, Albert Embankment, and saw the name of Janaway up; I thought there was some mistake about it, and I then saw a gentleman standing at the door; he said "Who do you want?" I said "I want to see Mr. Wilson, but I think there is some mistake, as I do not see his name"—he said "It is quite right"—I said "Is Mr. Wilson in or can I see him?"—he said Mr. Wilson was not in—I then asked him when he would be in, and he said it was rather uncertain, as he was away on business, and he might return shortly, or he might not come back till late—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188709120067"/>
               <p>then said "I don't see the name of Wilson here at all, are these his works? it seems strange that 'Janaway' is over the works"—he said that Wilson was trading under the old name, that he had purchased the works, and that there were several uncompleted contracts in hand; and he gave me such a satisfactory statement that I thought the works were Wilson's—I did not see a big signboard up with the name of Wilson on it—I saw Janaway's name up—I had sent goods to the amount of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I made these inquiries, and after that I sent these others—I did not hear that Wilson had been successful in inventions some time ago, and that he had received large sums of money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I believed that Wilson was carrying on a business at 3, Albert Embankment, and that he was employing persons there—I don't know who the person was at the works who told me this—I relied both on the statements on the cards and on the inquiries I made—he said that they were having meetings daily for the formation of this company, and that the cigars were going to these meetings—I should not have sent them if I had known they were going to be pawned the same day—I have lost my 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides solicitor's costs and other expenses.</p>

I have potteries at 3, Albert Embankment, where I employ workmen, and manufacture things—m June, 1886, Wilson came to me and gave me an order for some filters, and spoke about taking an office there—ultimately he agreed to take two rooms at 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, pay<lb/>able in advance, and he paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and entered into possession in June, where he remained till February or March this year—he has paid me no rent since—I manufactured the filters for him, but have not been paid for them—they all remain on my premises with the exception of one—he had no other premises there but the two rooms I let him, and he worked his experiments in there—he made a proposition to me about turning my works into a limited liability company, and that his business of patent filter making should be connected with mine, and he showed me a pro<lb/>spectus which he had prepared with regard to it—it has never been sold to a limited liability company, and I have never received a farthing with regard to that—he has no name up either on the premises or offices—there was no agreement at all between us—there was a letter-box there which he had access to—I gave him no formal notice to quit, but I told him that all communications were to be stopped between us—he did no business there after March, or at any time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He had a right as a tenant to have letters addressed to my place up to July last—I did not say to Wilson "From this date you cease to be my tenant," but it was an understood thing—I made 50 or 60 filters, and they are still on the premises; some of them are not perfect—I was to have a stipulated sum for my business if it was sold—I made these filters from Wilson's model—he had one room for experi<lb/>menting,</p>

There were two persons named Thompson on our books—this card was in the letter: "George Wilson, civil engineer, Victoria Street, London, E, C."—I told my clerk to go round to Mr. Wilson to make inquiries, and I told the bearer to sit down until the clerk, returned—Mr. Baker made certain statements to me, and I gave Burdett, the bearer, three boxes of cigars value 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believed then that what Baker told me was true, and that Adams was carrying on a business at Queen Victoria Street as a timber and hardware manufacturer—if the letter had not been headed in that way I should have taken a great deal more trouble to ascertain what the people were—Baker also supplied other goods in my absence—subsequently Baker reported something to me about Adams' position—at that time I had received no payment for the cigars; correspondence passed between us, but no money was sent—on 9th June I went with my solicitor, Mr. Abbott, to see Wilson at 64, Queen Victoria Street, in consequence of what I had heard—I there saw Wilson talking to Burdett, Adams' messenger—I told Wilson that Adams' account was extremely unsatisfactory, and I wished him to explain how things were—he said he was sorry to hear about it, he had no idea but what Adams was thoroughly straightforward and honest in every way—he also stated that Adams owed him, I think, 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a bill, and I think he said that he had summoned him for non-payment—my solicitor said to Wilson "Well, we may as well work that together; you are suing Adams, we intend to sue him ourselves; will you give me the name and address of your solicitor?" which Wilson declined to do, but said that his solicitor should call on my solicitor, Mr. Abbott, next day, which to the best of my belief he did not do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I only know that my solicitor told me no such thing had taken place—Baker took the letter with him when he went to see Wilson, and asked for a certain quantity of cigars; the amount was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he knew how much they would come to—I relied on what Baker said and on the heading of the letter—I caused inquiries to be made afterwards, not on that occasion—I considered Wilson's reference sufficient as told me by Baker—Wilson did not represent that Adams had offices at that address—I sent the goods because my clerk told me that he had made inquiries, which were satisfactory—I had not seen Wilson—I cannot swear to what Wilson said to my clerk—my clerk said "Oh, this is perfectly correct, I have known this man for years, he has paid me large sums of money, and he is quite safe"—when I want a reference I give the referee some idea of the amount of the credit—I never saw Adams; he did not come to my place and have samples, but Burdett came, I should say, from what my clerk told me, on his own behalf, and had samples, that he might be able to sell them—I was not in the office at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I have not received the money—Burdett only had two or three cigars, to the best of my belief—if I had known that this was a fictitious cheque I should not have had any dealings with Burdett—the letter said "Please send me three sample boxes," I anticipated further dealings from that—I sent Baker with the letter to show to Wilson, and I considered when he came back, that Wilson had read it, and if Wilson</p>

Beddome—on 31st May I was managing the business in Mr. Beddome's absence, and Burdett came and handed me this card: "S. Adams, 415, Mansion House Chambers, and 11, Queen Victoria Street," on which was written: "Gentlemen, kindly let bearer have three boxes Carolinas, same as sent on Saturday, and I will send cheque per return"—I then gave Burdett three boxes of cigars, value 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., believing the statement on the card—next day Burdett brought this letter and order: "From Geo. Wilson, Sanitary Engineering Works, Lambeth. Dear Sirs,—The bearer has prevailed on me to try your Havannah cigars, therefore please execute the above order and supply me with cigars"—Burdett selected three boxes of cigars, which I said I would send to Wilson's office—before that I went to Queen Victoria Street, because Adams had promised us a cheque—I did not find Adams there, and went to Wilson's office, and said to him "I have been to Mansion House Chambers and find that Mr. Adams has been sold out of his office, he has not been there for four or five months; the secretary, who lives in the building, tells me that he is a very doubt<lb/>ful character"—he said "I always address him at his works at Hornsey"—I said that as he had given us a reference to Adams, I could not understand why he did not know all about it—he appeared surprised, and said "He gave me a cheque a day or two ago on the City Bank which was all right, but I will make inquiries; a bill for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is coming due very shortly, and I will see into the matter"—as I was leaving he said "Oh, you need not execute that little order of mine which I sent"—I went to Raleigh Road; it is a small house, there are no works there; the hall seemed bare, I did not notice any stair carpets, and the blinds were drawn down—a woman opened the door to me, the house did not look furnished.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor and a clerk in the Solicitor's Department of the Treasury at Whitehall—in November, 1883, the prisoner communicated with me in reference to the estate of John Kerry, who died intestate in 1882—he was then acting for Miss Wicks, who afterwards became Mrs. Hall—I received letters from him, and ultimately at the end of March, 1837, I took out letters of administration on the ground that Kerry died intestate and left no relations—that gave me legal right to the estate—I wrote to the prisoner, to hand over the securities (the Post Office Savings Bank book and building society's book) belonging to the estate, to enable me to get the money—afterwards, about the end of April, the prisoner came to me to the Treasury bringing me the Post Office Savings Bank book and the building society's receipts—he asked me to pay him his bill of costs as he had a lien on the securities—I said I would pay any charge fairly incurred by him—he produced his bill and I went through it with him—the total amount was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I disallowed two items entered under 1883, but which related to work done in 1886, preparing an assignment of certain debts to Eliza Hall and travelling and hotel expenses—I paid him the balance 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by an order; his receipt is on the order—on 25th May he called again and asked for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for Mrs. Hall—I said I should not hand him the money unless Mrs. Hall had authorised him to have it—he said "I wish you would let me have the money"—I refused, and then said he could have an order payable to Mrs. Hall, as her solicitor, and he said "Oh, very well, then, I will have that," and I had the order made out payable to Mrs. Hall while he waited, and he wept</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, of 163, New Bond Street, and trade under the name of Pain and Co.—on Thursday afternoon, 18th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188709120078"/>
               <p>August, about 3.10 p.m., the prisoner came in, and requested to be shown some gold watches—I showed him several gold hunting watches, and amongst them one price 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he selected that one, and then required to be shown some gold Alberts—I showed him a tray full, and amongst them was one price 11 guineas, which was the heaviest chain there—he particu<lb/>larly requested a chain of that pattern, and a watch as near like his previous one, which he said he had lost, so that his friends should not know that he had lost his watch and chain—he then said "I have an in<lb/>valid brother who requires a clock"—I asked him if he would like to select a clock for him—he said it was rather disagreeable to select for other people, and he should prefer my sending three clocks up to his house—I asked his address, and he put down this card, "J. A. Birch, 1, Queen's Gate Terrace"—after selecting three clocks he came back to the counter and said he should like to take the watch and chain with him—I got them ready for him, and he then said "I suppose you would like to be paid for this watch and chain?"—I said "Certainly"—at the same time he took out a cheque book and a banker's pass book, which he laid on the counter, with the name turned so that I could read it, it was "J. A. Birch, Esq."—he then wrote this cheque, which amounted, with the discount taken off', to 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">"Aug.</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th. Pay Messrs. Pain, or bearer</hi>, 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">J. A. Birch."</hi>)—he took the watch and chain away with him, and next morn<lb/>ing, as arranged, at 11.15, I took the three clocks to 1, Queen's Gate Terrace—I had some conversation with the servant, and found that Mr. Birch lived there, but that he had no invalid son or brother—I presented the cheque at the Sussex Place branch of the London and County Bank, and it was returned to me marked "Drawer's signature forged"—I had been to the police-station previous to that—I went again to the station on 24th August, and saw the prisoner standing with a number of other men—I went up and down twice, I had doubts about the prisoner's identity—he was dressed differently then to when he came into my shop, and he looked shorter, but after looking at him attentively I came to the conclusion he was the man—he was in my shop a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes, and was the only customer—in the evening I was again called to the station, and was then shown a cheque book and card case, and was asked whether I had seen them before, and they were the identical ones which he laid on my counter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first saw the prisoner at Vine Street he ap<lb/>peared shorter than the man who came into my shop, but when I saw him a second time he came out of the corridor erect, which he was not before, and I recognised him—I hesitated on account of his being shorter, and being dressed differently—the man who came to my shop had a slight moustache—I am as positive of that as I can be with casual observation—I did not notice the colour of his eyes—I do not recognise him by his voice; I have only heard him speak once since that afternoon, and a person's voice may change, I moan they may have a cold—he was a perfect stranger before—the other men were not like him—I won't be positive whether the man who came into my shop had whiskers or not.</p>

I live at 261, Vauxhall Bridge Road—the prisoner occupied two furnished rooms there for two weeks—I pointed them out to Inspector Langrish—he only paid me one week's rent, the other week was up the day he was taken in custody—I let other rooms in that house, I have two gentlemen there now; one is and one is not the same as lived</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector C.</hi>) About midday on 24th August I arrested the prisoner in Wilton Street, Pimlico—I had sent a letter to him at No. 261, which I found in his bed room afterwards—about a quarter of an hour after I had sent it he came out and looked round, and then bolted up the road; he then turned round again and went towards Victoria Station, I caught hold of his arm and said "You will be charged with obtaining a gold watch and chain from Messrs. Pain and Co., of New Bond Street, by means of a forged cheque"—he said nothing then—at the station, when I read the warrant to him, he said "I utterly deny the charge"—I went to his rooms, which Mrs. Stubbings pointed out, and found there these papers and pass-book, cheque-book, and card-case containing cards with "Mr. J.A. Birch, 1, Queen's Gate Terrace," on them—they are exactly similar to the one produced—the counterfoil to this cheque of 18th August is torn out of the cheque-book—Mr. Dunn was taken to identify the prisoner before I told him about the cheque-book being found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Hayes, of 52, St. Andrew Street, Wands worth Road—on 1st August I was in Gracechurch Street with my husband and son—I was getting into an omnibus; there were several people trying to get in—a gentleman spoke to me, and I put my hand in my pocket and missed my purse—it contained about 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a key, and some memoranda; it was quite safe not a minute before; I had my hand in my pocket while waiting for the bus, and only took it out to get into the bus—the prisoner was close to my left side where my pocket was; a man stood beside her—I said to her "You have picked my pocket; if you will give me my purse I will not lock you up"—the man beside her had his hand down, and she had hers down, and from the way they were standing I am positive that the purse was passed—the witness called a policeman, and I led the prisoner across the road by the arm and gave her in charge—she said "Be very careful what you say"—the man went away immediately I gave her in charge; I am very sorry I did not take hold of him as well, and then I should have had my purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Sunningdale Place, Suther<lb/>land Gardens, Media Vale—I first made the acquaintance of William Gordon at the latter end of December, 1886—he told me they had a flourishing business at Rangoon—he showed me several large orders and correspondence from Duncan Gordon to him in reference to the orders and the business generally, and he asked me if I would like to go out to Rangoon—I said "Yes," and it was arranged that I should go as manager—I was to have about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; I saw him at his office, Billiter House, Billiter Square—I went to Rangoon—a consign<lb/>ment of goods went in the same ship, consisting of tweed cloth, silk, umbrellas, and some piece goods; I don't know the value, I had nothing to do with the purchase, I think there were two or three cases—I arrived at Rangoon On or about 7th April, 1887, having left England about 21st February—I found Duncan Gordon at Rangoon; the establishment there was a kind of retail and wholesale business, it was one warehouse divided into the two departments; there were, jams, preserved fruits, pickles, potted meat, lime juice, and some paints; boots, millinery, jewellery, and fancy things—I could not estimate the value of the retail goods, but after Duncan left I estimated about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all—about ten days after I arrived there, there was a sale by auction by Duncan's directions, on the premises—all the retail goods were sold and taken away; part of the money was paid to Duncan; I think the sale realised about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. roughly speaking; the wholesale stock was afterwards sold off by my direction after Duncan left; he left on 7th May—he said the goods sent out were not suitable to the market, and he was going to the manufac<lb/>turers at Manchester and Liverpool to buy a better class of goods suitable for that market—he took about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with him; before going he told me to sell off the wholesale stock as quickly as possible—he did not tell</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188709120089"/>
               <p>me as to what prices, he told the clerk, but not in my hearing; they realised about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the consignment that went out with me—only one book was kept there when I arrived, a kind of cash book; there was no cheque book, price book, or ledger; there was a press letter book—I handed the books to Mr. Galloway, a solicitor at Rangoon, to be sent to a firm of solicitors in London—I ascertained the cost price of some of the goods sold after Duncan left, from some invoice copies sent from Billiter Street I suppose—they did not give the names of the persons they came from—there were two press letter copy books, one of them had a lock and key, Duncan handed me that book before he left; before doing so he tore out all the correspondence; he said "The correspondence in that book will be of no use to you"—between 7th April and 21st June I never saw any real business there—after Duncan left I started a new set of books, a letter book, cash book, and day book—my expenses were given to me by Mr. Galloway out of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which the wholesale stock realised, and also the clerk's—the remainder was remitted to Messrs. Sanderson and Holland, solicitors, in London, who now hold it—I think I know Duncan's handwriting—these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of 10th and 23rd May are his—when I sold off the stock there was nothing left; there were some debts—I arrived in England in July—I have had no salary, only my expenses—I saw no letters at Rangoon from the London house; I believe Duncan wrote to William every mail, once a week—I believe those letters were copied, but I can't say, I did not see them after they were copied, the book was always locked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Duncan had a banking account—he told me he wished to get rid of the retail trade, it was such a nuisance—he did not say it was in consequence of the wet season coming on—the transactions that took place under my supervision were all entered in the books—those books have not yet arrived in England—the Gordons have asked me for them once or twice—I did not render them any account of my transactions before I gave up the books to the solicitor, there was so very little done it was not worth while—I wrote every mail and told them what I had been doing—there was only one book of any importance at Rangoon—there was a pass-book—I never saw a sold ledger—there was a kind of stock book, badly kept—I saw an indent book—I saw no memorandum book—some goods arrived at Rangoon after Duncan left, a small amount of whiskies—before he left he instructed me to apply for a liquor licence; it was not granted—I understood the direction in the letter to sell by auction to refer to the liquor—I valued the whole stock at about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the stock after Duncan left—I did not value it on my arrival—I had very little to do with the business while he was there—I received about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my expenses out and home—after my return I received a letter from William Gordon, stating that I had disobeyed my instructions and had been guilty of embezzlement—I replied, referring them to my solicitor—I think the Rangoon letters were mixed, both business and private—the Gordons could see the accounts of the sale I held by their direction, if they wished, at the solicitor's—when Duncan left Rangoon he told me I was to get rid of the goods, as they were unsaleable; those were his words; that referred to all the goods—I held this sale on the advice of my solicitor because I found out they were bankrupt—I did not hold the sale at once, because I wished to sell them in a reasonable way—I</p>

"—I was not in a position to pay that sum—William Gordon knew that—I did not know that he intended to make use of my letter, in which I described my property, at the bank for the purpose of putting my name forward as a guarantor—I became guarantor because two names were wanted instead of one—these are family matters—I left the office in Billiter Street about the middle of January, in consequence of a family dispute about money—I had borrowed 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Gordon at that time—I have not paid it in money, but in salary—there was a dispute between my wife and other members of the Gordon family—I understood Mrs. Macdonald asked William Gordon about this time for a loan of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the Gordons were living with me at this time—I did not know it was William Gordon's intention to set his sister up in a costume business in London in connection with the Rangoon house—I did net leave the office because Gordon refused to lend my wife 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I brought this book with me when I left—that was in the morning, before Gordon arrived; he never came till 11 or 12 o'clock, I was there about 10—I was not there earlier than usual that morning—I produced this book at the Mansion House—I did not call on a member of the firm of Griffiths and Co. after I left Gordon—I know nobody of that name—I have called on Fry and Co. once or twice since, partly with reference to the Gordon's—I did not tell them William Gordon owed me a large sum of money, or speak unfavourably of the Gordons—I have visited Messrs. Barber and Co., the prosecuting solicitors, once since the circular of 14th March—I made their acquaintance since 5th August—I have not been in the habit of going about spreading unfavourable reports of the Gordons to their creditors after they left my house—all my property is settled on my wife—I have no house, and at present I am living apart from my wife—I</p>

Barber and Son, solicitors, who are conducting this prosecution with the authority and sanction of the Treasury under an order made by the Bankruptcy Court—I attended a meeting of creditors convened for the 6th of April—William Gordon was present, and was examined by various creditors as to the assets of the firm—it then transpired that letters were received by him from his brother about once a week—he was asked to produce them—he declined to do so on the ground that there were private matters in them—after pressure he consented to show certain of them to my principals—he did not produce them, and I have seen none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At the meeting of 6th April William Gordon said that he had made up his estimates from materials he had in his possession—I don't recollect his saying that he made up the circular without his brother's knowledge and on his own responsibility—in the first instance we endeavoured to get the English creditors to assent to the proposal of the Scotch creditors until we received certain information which we thought it our duty to lay before our clients—I think on one occasion William Gordon said would it be satisfactory to the creditors if he made arrangements for some person over here to receive the assets as they came from Rangoon, and to pay the money to the English creditors—I replied "We want to be satisfied that there are assets at Rangoon"—he did not propose to give us any proof of that—this prosecution was insti<lb/>tuted from what we ascertained from Messrs. Fry at the public examina<lb/>tion.</p>

               <p>then; Parker stood in a corner by the house next to mine, and I watched him—I then went out to speak to my husband, who was about five minutes' walk away, and as I went out Payne came out at the gate and Parker turned back and went the same way he had gone when I first saw him, and then Payne crossed the road and I saw them meet—as I went to my husband I looked round and saw them coming down the road behind me one on each side—my husband went to Mr. Knight's gate, his employer's, and as he stood there the prisoners passed and I lost sight of them—I was taken to Wanstead station that evening and picked them out from a number of other persons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Frank Cousins and others, wharfingers, of St. Saviour's Wharf, Dockhead, Bermondsey—I gave information to the police, in consequence of which they watched Brooks in his journeys—he is a carman in our employ—this bag is ours to the best of my belief—it is not sweepings, but best flour—even if it were sweepings Brooks had no right to take it or give it away.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PURCELL</hi>. Information was given to the police a week or 10 days before; I presume they came on watch immediately—Brooks's duty was simply to take away whatever flour was loaded on his van; it was no part of his duty to take flour from the warehousemen to put on his van—there is one particular team of seven men to load flour from the wharf—all deliveries would be made by the delivery team under the supervision of the delivery foreman, Field—he was on duty on 12th August—it would be his duty to see that only that flour was laid on the prisoner's van which he was entitled to take away, but when we are busy we have to put on a second team with another foreman, who might be Pow—Sales is general foreman of the wharf, and superintends the wharf—we can load three or four vans at the same time—I was not there on the 12th—Brooks would sometimes have to take away more, and some times less than two or three loads—it would be his duty to go to St. Katherine's Dock and bring consignments of flour from there to our wharf, or from different bakers—sacks are usually sewn at the top—the sacks and bags sent from our place have the name of the brand on them—thousands of sacks of that brand may be delivered at our place, and at many other wharfingers' also—I should not like to swear that these bags have ever been at our premises—Brooks would not be allowed to go into the warehouse and select anything from the bulk to be delivered to the cart—the bags are sometimes torn in transit—it would be very easy to replace any spilt flour although the mouth is sewn up—if the bag is broken in the journey, and the hole is big enough for flour to run out, it is invariably sewn up at the wharf—I have never known of sacks bursting when being delivered—if they burst when put into the van sufficiently for flour to come out it is discovered at once—Brooks has been two or three years with us—he was with Cornell before, I do not know how long—before that he was with Allen, who recommended him to us, but I do not know how long, nor do I know that he was with Horsenail and Catchpool for 10 years before that—there was then no gatekeeper at our wharf to examine vans as they left—the carman comes in, and a clerk would take his signature, and then he would go—Mr. Sale is here—he has left our service, we discharged him—the men at the wharf who used to load the vans are not here to my knowledge."</p>

I will tell you the truth, it was only two small cochels that I took out of the sacks with holes in, the Wednesday or Thursday before which I loaded from St. Katherine's Dock. I took them out for my own use. It is to my friend here I am very sorry; I gave him what I had left in the van for his wife and children, as he was out of work. This foreman, Mr. Sale, loaded two sacks in my van at St. Saviour's Wharf; he said 'Pull out,' and I drew out and made room for another van, and stood just opposite the office window and looked at the wheel of the van and went in and signed. I came out of the office and Mr. Sales stood at the door after I had signed. I went to the van and unloosed it and got up and drove to my own house first, to deliver the cochel there, and went from there to Fisher's Wharf, Rotherhithe, and there fetched the other twenty-eight bags. I stopped opposite Kohnlein's, and he looked at my horse's food and called me into his yard and showed me his; I had my horse's food bag in my hand at the time, and he said he gave his horses eight quarters of corn a day, and I said that was better food than what mine got, and out I came and put the sack up in the van. He asked me to have a drink, which I did, and then I loaded the twenty-eight bags and came straight away. No money was passed between us. What I say is the truth. I did not have it from the wharf, but on Wednesday or Thursday from St. Katherine's Wharf." <hi rend="italic">Rudd says:</hi> "When I met my friend he gave me this flour.

I am a mason, of 50, Belvidere Road—about 11.30 p.m. on 20th August I was in Belvidere Road, and had got to the door of my house when my attention was attracted by pitiful cries of "Help! Police!"—I turned and saw a crowd coming down the Belvidere Road towards me; the prosecutor was preceding the crowd—I heard someone using very violent language—I waited till they came up level with me and then I followed them—I saw the prisoners and another man confront Baldwin as he was about to turn up Edward Street, and Caufield struck him several times; they closed, and eventually the prosecutor got out of the scrimmage and got away; he fell—Caufield followed him about 15 yards and then kicked at him with all his force, but missed him, Baldwin went to the left and Caufield fell on his back—that somewhat annoyed him; he got up, went after Baldwin, and assaulted him again several times—the people cried "Shame"—they closed together again, and the women begged Caufield to let Baldwin go, which he did—Irwin then fol<lb/>lowed Baldwin about 30 yards and assaulted him several times, and they closed—Baldwin tried to defend himself, and Caufield, seeing his com<lb/>panion was in trouble, ran up to where they were having a scuffle, and licked Baldwin from the middle of the road on to the pavement, he fell on the flagstones on his head, with a fearful thud, at the corner of Edward and York Roads—Belvidere and York Roads are parallel—a crowd assembled and cried "Shame"—a woman exclaimed "If I were a man I would kill you"—I looked for a policeman, but could not find one—the two women got the prisoners and the third man away down Edward Street; I followed them—I saw a constable on duty at the Government Indian Stores—I told him what I had seen, and asked him to render the poor fellow some assistance—he said he was stationary there and could not leave his post—I pointed the prisoners out; he let them go by—I went back to the spot where I had left the prosecutor insensible, and saw a constable talking to him—I took the constable in the direction the prisoners had gone, and saw Caufield leaning against a lamp-post—I told the police<lb/>man he was the man I had seen commit this cowardly assault—he waited till Baldwin came—previously the three men and two women were talking together—I went to the station and gave particulars—Irwin came in some time afterwards with his mother—I had given a description of him and the women in the meantime, and through my identification he was brought in—he was taken in custody in Kennington Road.</p>

I live at 2, College Gardens, Dulwich, with my mother and sister—on 25th July, after 4 a.m., I was aroused by my sister, and ran downstairs in my night-shirt with a revolver, and found the glass panel of the door leading from the passage down into the kitchen was broken; the door was locked and bolted—I fired one shot down the kitchen stairs, and then ran down them into the basement, and saw the gate leading into the back area was open—I ran out at that door, and then saw a man disappearing over the garden wall—I got on to the dust-bin and looked over the wall, and saw a man picking up some plated articles that were strewn on the ground—I threatened to shoot him if he did not drop them, and he ran off with a coat, which he folded up in his arms—I saw a man walking in the road, and spoke to him, and then went back to the house—at the place where I saw the man stooping down I found a salad bowl, a teapot, and two egg-cups, all silver-plated (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); they belong to my mother, and are worth</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 36, St. Andrew Street, Wandsworth Road—I am a porter and meat carrier in the Meat Market, and I keep a general shop—I have only had this shop 12 months, but I have been in business 13 or 14 years—the prisoner lodged with us up to the time he was taken, about 10 months—he does odd jobs for me and also odd jobs outside—he was at home on Sunday night; 24th July—I was examined at the police-court—on Sunday he went out with us for an excursion to Hampton, and got home about 9.15—he then helped my son to put the hone away—we had some cold meat left, which we had for supper, and then he and my son went up to bed—they both sleep in the same bed—I saw him again next morning in bed when I called my son at 20 minutes to five to go to market—I then left the house, leaving him in bed—my attention was first called to this burglary on the Saturday night after—the prisoner was then charged at the police-court, and I went there to prove this, as I remembered having been at Hampton Court the previous Sunday—I gave the detectives every assistance I could—I saw this key when the detectives took it out of the cupboard—the prisoner carries keys, and he has a latch key of my door; this is it, I think.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman L</hi> 321). At 1.30 a.m. on August 26 I went with Williamson to 150, Vauxhall Street—when the prisoner was dressing he said to his wife that he wanted a collar stud and went to the table, on which a cigar box stood—I was requested by Williamson to seize it—I did so, and found two half-crowns with a lot more things—I handed the half-crowns to the detective at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The box contained pieces of work, ribbons, and so on; there were no cigars nor tobacco in it, it was used as a work box appa<lb/>rently—there was no other money there that I am aware of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the Neville Arms—I know the prisoner as a customer and as a man coming to the urinal—on 25th August I saw him in the morning in Miller's Lane, and at 9.30 p.m. I saw him go into my urinal—he was in there one and a half or two minutes, and then I noticed him come out—I noticed white on his arm then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In the morning when you came in I washing potatoes and so on—the door was open—you were in the habit of speaking to me and showing me racing telegrams and so on—the urinal was a small one, part of it was a w.c.—the urinal was intended for one or four at a time—there is a light there at night.</p>
