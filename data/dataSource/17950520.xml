I hired him about the 15th or 16th of April, the 15th, I believe, I had a sick horse, and I found him at the office at Charing-cross; and finding him very nigh, I ordered him home, and inquired into his character. I got a written character of him at the office, and he told me, he had been in London about eight or nine months, and had been six months out of place; and he told me, the reason that he left the gentleman that the written character came from was, because he did not like indoor work and that his wages were low. I told him, I would give him twelve guineas a year. I told him, as he had been so long out of place, I would lend him some money; I gave him the key of my corn, and at the expiration of the 13th day and half, I perceived I had lost two sacks of corn; and I took the key away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you take the key from him? - I took the key away from him on the Monday as he went on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood he was gone away? - Yes, I understood so, and that night he was taken at a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss on his going? - A new hat, with a silver band, a velveret coat, with some silver lace, a waistcoat, and a pair of leather breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they found? - On him; they were found on him at the public house in Marlborough-street.(The clothes produced)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no friends.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is that the hat that your servant were? - Yes, they were livery clothes for his wear.</p>
               <p>RICHARD FOOT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am Mr. Foot's nephew; I was going with the prisoner, on the 30th of April, to the stable, to take the horse out to an airing. He told me, that he had left the key at home, and asked me if I would go back to fetch him the key of the stable? I went on for it, and while I was gone, he went away without telling me where he was gone. I see him afterwards; about the middle of the day, in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is that from your uncle's house? - Nearly a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him? - I asked him what was the reason that he left my uncle in that manner? he told me, I should know in a few hours time; and that if I would go with him, he would go with me to my uncle's. I followed him, and he went up May-fair, and he went through Collyer's livery stables, a very narrow place that I could not yet down with my horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see you follow him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he walk away, or run away, or how? - He was walking very fast, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200004"/>he turned round the corner, and I looked round that corner, and could not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more of him afterwards? - Yes, at a public house next to Swallow-street after eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that public house near to your uncle's? - About a quarter of a mile off; it was a public house that he used to lodge at.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he lodge at that house when he was at your uncle's? - No, before he lived with my uncle. I went to my uncle, and told him where I see him, and he told me to go to the constable, and I went, and he and I, and another man, went to take him up. We took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the public house when you took him up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing when he was taken up? - I did not go in, the constable did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass? - He said something to the constable; I don't know what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the constable? - He is not present.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I say, I am very willing to go home with you, and deliver up the livery, but I have not a pair of small clothes to put on? - He did say, that he had not a pair of breeches to change his clothes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The clothes have been locked up in my house ever since they were taken from him. This is the coat and waistcoat that he had on, they were made about a fortnight before, for a servant that wore livery, but they sitted him very well.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had he the clothes on at the time? - Yes; instead of dressing in a stable jacket he put these things on in the morning at six o'clock, and they were taken from his back at Marlborough-street, before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Const: It is usual for him to wear his jacket to do his work in of a morning? - yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was he to have put on these clothes? - After he had cleaned the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the stable from your house? - It may be a hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt but what these clothes belong to you? - Not the least doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to believe that he would not return again? had you any other reason than he did not return with his clothes? - That was my reason.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you strike me? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no small clothes to put on, and nothing to put on, and so I put on them things. He told me to put them on over night; I had no other things at his house; me struck me, and did every thing by me he chose; and I never was struck by a master before. That boy is a witness that the gentleman did strike me.</p>
               <p>Court. Boy, you hear what he says, speak the truth between your uncle and the prisoner? - He had his hat on one day, and my uncle struck it off.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That was in consequences of my charging him with the corn.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it a silver table spoon? - It is. He offered it to me to sell; I asked him where he lived? - he first told me he lived in Grosvenor-square; he said he had only lived there two days, and he could not tell me justly the name. I asked him more closely, and then he told me he lived in Grosvenor-street. I immediately thought that the spoon was stole, and I inquired about it; I found it belonged to Lord Malden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any application to the servants about it? - I did the same morning. I have kept it ever since; it is the same I had from the prisoner, in the same state as it is now.</p>
               <p>Q. To Smith. Is that the same spoon you lost? - Yes, it is the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this gentleman, the silversmith? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. On that you knew it was lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more missing? - No, there were no more missing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I plead not guilty.</p>
               <p>Court to Sutherland. Do you know whether this boy was an apprentice, or only a servant? - He was only a servant, his master sent for him out of the country to carry out things for him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give her the beer? - No, the boy drew her the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day? - It was in the afternoon about half after four o'clock. I went after her myself and took her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the pot, in her pocket? - No, in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was she from your house? - About two hundred yards. When I overtook her (Produced) she said somebody had been playing the rogue with her in the room. There was nothing in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200010"/>pot, only some snuff that she had turned out of her snuff box.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you kept the pot from that time to this? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever sold pots since you kept house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine to see if any of your pots were missing? - I found this missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count your pots? - Yes, after I had taken her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the woman in the habit of using your house? - No, I never see her before; the people that kept the house before me knew her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that she might have had beer out of your house? - Yes, the might. I have lost six dozen.</p>
               <p>Court. She had the pot in her hand, was there any beer in the pot? - I cannot say; there might be the least drop in the world; but I see nothing else but snuff in it, which she put in on purpose to clear herself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I asked you for the change of a shilling, and you did not give it me. I had two quarterns of gin. Did I steal your pot? - You called me a b-ch and a w-re.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BOND sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant out of place, I was going along Duke-street; the prisoner had the pot in her hand when I see her.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she carry it open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.In her hands, as any other person might carry it? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she going from or to the house? - From the house; the landlord came up to her, and he said, she had stole the pot; and she said, she had not; but that he had played the rogue with her; she said, she would go into the doctor's shop with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any snuff in it? - There was something in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her put the snuff in it? - I cannot say I did.</p>

               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. This woman lives in the neighbourhood? - Yes, she does.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen her in the house? - No, not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did she ask for the beer? - She called for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she was going to carry out the pot of beer? - No; it is my pot, Wm. Young is on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Last Monday week I went to this man's house. I was told that the landlord of my house was there. I went there, and he was drinking with two more men; and I called for a pint of beer, and they asked me to drink. I called for two pots more, and the last time that I had the beer to drink, they said, O, you b-b, you have put jalap in the pot; and I thought it was jalap that somebody had been playing the rogue with, and so I said, I will take it to the doctor's, to see whether it is jalap or snuff.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did she give you the money for the beer? - No, to the man; she paid the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the two men with her? - I did not take notice; there were two in the room.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they come with her? - No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, about the snuff, who put that in the pot, do you know? - She put it in; I see her do it.</p>

               <p>Q.They told you they suspected the prisoner, I suppose? - Yes; I went to where the prisoner lodged (Tooley) who lodged with the other prisoner at the bar, and a child, they were all three in bed together, in fact I desired Susanna Tooley to get up and dress herself, and took her away, when I got her into the street, she asked me where I was going to carry her?</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the other? - The other at that time was left behind; when I got her about had my down the street she wished me to call her matter back, and she would confess the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her any thing? - Not any thing; she said that the property was very safe, and he should have it in the morning, I told her that would not do , we must have it to night; I asked her  where it was? she told me in the Curtain-road, at one Mrs. Duboix's; I went with her according to her directions, and found it under the bed, in the room where she said it was.</p>
               <p>Q. In Mrs. Duboix's lodging house? - No, I believe not, she is a lodger in the house, I don't know who is the landlord of the house.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you find the things contained in the indictment? - In a bundle under the bed, she shewed me the room, and told me it was under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoner's lodge where the bundle was found under the bed? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing else? - She said she received them in the sight of the other prisoner, that she waited for her while she committed the robbery, and advised her to do it likewise, it was a voluntary confession of her own;

               <p>Q. You are a shopman to Mr. Atkinson? - Yes, he is a linen draper, in Bishopsgate-street without,No. 17, in the City of London. On Tuesday the 28th of April, the prisoner, came into our shop, to buy a piece of muslin; I shewed her several; believe it was about four o'clock in the afternoon; she said she wanted about a yard and a half; - I shewed her several; she said she fixed none of them. I left the wrapper before her while I went to the other end of the shop, to get another piece I thought would suit her, and while I was gone; I see her move her arms, which I suspected she had put something underneath her arms; when I came to shew her this piece of muslin, she did not like it; I shewed her several others but she would not give the price for them; I though she had got something; as she was going, I had a mind to see; I reached over the counter, litted up her cloak, and found the muslin under her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the muslin? - The constable has got it, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he your husband? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose? - A gown patche, I believe the 22d of April.</p>
               <p>Q.What did the gown patch contain? - Five yards and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you lose it? - It was taken out of the shop. This man took it out of the shop; the prisoner was introduced to me as an injured man, I allowed him to come to my house to eat and drink as often as he thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been accustomed to come to your house? - From two to three months, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was this taken? - He took the opportunity to take it out of the shop, by seeing no person present.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he took it? - I only believe it by my servant telling me of it. It was brought to be glazed to my house. I did not see it taken; I was out at the time.</p>
               <p>JOHN BATCHELOR sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 23d of April, I was working at the bottom of my master's shop, and this gentleman was in the shop, it was about two or three o'clock in the afternoon, as near as I can say; I see him go out of the shop, and I immediately had a suspicion that he had done something.</p>
               <p>Q. This prisoner was in the shop? - Yes; he was there a good while by himself, and he went out of the shop, and there were a great many cottons and callicoes laying by the door, and I had some suspicion that he had taken one; I knew there were ten gown pieces laying, and I took the little boy with me to a pawnbroker's, and they knew nothing of it; and coming back I see the prisoner in Carter-lane, and he went into a chandler's shop. where he had left the gown patch.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't know that of your own knowledge? - The people told me so.</p>

            Are the people here? - No. He came out of the chandler's shop, I and put the patch under his coat, and I followed him down into St. Paul's Church-yard, and stopped him with the patch under his coat, and told him my mistress wanted to speak to him; as we were returning back to our house he took the patch under his coat, and told him my mistress wanted to speak to him; as we were returning back to our house he took the patch and threw it into a pawnbroker's shop, the corner of Sermon-lane and Carter-lane.</p>

               <p>I am going of fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live with Kavannah? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As an apprentice? - No. I went out with this gentleman, and he brought me to a pawnbroker's shop, and the gown was not there, and we were going down Carter-lane, and we saw the gentleman(the prisoner) coming down after us, and we turned into a street, and waited there a good while, thought he would come by, and I went up Carter-lane, and I see him come out of a chandler's shop, and put the gown patch under his coat; and we went after him into St. Paul's Churchyard; and at the corner of Sermon-lane, he threw it into a pawnbroker's, and I went in and took it out.</p>
               <p>(The patch produced.)</p>
               <p>Batchelor. This is the patch; I know it by 259 on it.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you seen that before you gave it up to the constable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. To the best of my knowledge is mine; but the boy knows better, because he received it from the porter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The first beginning of my acquaintance with Mr Kavannah was by a countryman and his wife; one Sunday in particular, I happened to meet this countryman, so in course we went in to drink together, and I told him I was going to sell part of my land, and go to sea, to try my luck; and he told me he would help me to a person that would buy my land of me, and he took 'me to Mr. Kavannah; Mr. Kavannah was to give me four hundred pounds for it, it was worth six hundred pounds, and so he was to get two hundred pounds by me. in a fews days after we went down to counsellor Gould, and he refused the deeds; at last we had a contract between us, which I signed, and I was to give him a meeting at Glastenbury, in Somersetshire, where this land laid. Mr. Kavannah, before I came there had been and too possession of this land, and ordered the tenants to pay no rent but to him; I had a thought of his doing this; I was persuaded to go down into the country, and I went to Mrs. Kavannah, and I asked her for little money; I told her I was determined to to go; so she let me have three half guineas, two shillings, and five shillings in had halfpence. I told them I meant to go down next morning, and they would insist on my sleeping there that night; I went to bed that night there, and instead of putting my breeches under my head, I put them down by the bed side. The next morning I found two of my half guineas were gone; at last it was found out that the servant maid had got the two half guineas; so I had the two half guineas back again. I went down to the Swan with two Necks, Lad-lane, and took the coach directly, and when I came to Glastenbury, I understood that Mr. Kavannah had been to my tenants; and I wrote to Mrs. Kavannah, and she sent me down the gown patches while I was there. It is a swindling job. I am very glad it is now brought forward, or else if I had staid longer in the house I should have been hanged.</p>

            What do you say about taking this gown patch away? - I was to have gown patches of them, and they wanted me to have a watch, and ten pounds worth of these halfpence, or any thing that they could not cleverly tell what to do with.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Kavan ah. Had this man any right to take any patches? - I under stood that he had been in prison for fourteen of fifteen months, that his wife had kept him there; I thought he was a very much injured man, in concequence of that, I told him he might come to my house, and eat and drink till he could do some thing for himself, the land that he talks about, by inquiry, we found it was so embarrassed that he could not fell it; Mr Kavannah had a power of attorney, and i quired into the situation of it, and found that he had made away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What could induce you to give a man money that you knew nothing of? - The person that introduced him to me said, that he would have done it if he was able.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I came up to Mrs. Kavannh, she had put by some gown patches and a watch, and several other things. I was kept enticed both day and night, stupid and drunk every day and night ever since I had he concerns with Mr. Kavannah. I have got no friend here in town.</p>

               <p>I am a bricklayer. I was going along Grub-street, the 11th of this month, and I see the prisoner Barker before me, it was between two and three, he had got a parcel of nails on his shoulder, as though he had been coming from the ironmongers, I knew that he was a carpenter, and had worked in some premises of mine for Mr. Patch. I see him go into an old iron shop, and Grub-street; curiousity led me to watch what he was going to do there, and I walked backwards and forwards by the iron shop and I heard something rattle in the scale like nails, and going by the second time, I heard somebody say, there is four pounds; I watched him out, and see the paper much reduced. I could not see any body particularly in the shop, it was so barricadoed with iron things. I then watched him home to his master's shop, and see him deposit the remaining quantity of nails that he had on a work bench. I sent for an officer and had him taken up, knowing Mr. Patch to he gone into the country. I then went into Moor-lane and go an officer, and went to the house where I see the man go in and come out again. I went into the shop and asked this prisoner whether she had bought some nails? she said she had bought four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200017"/>pounds; says I, there are the nails I believe, pointing to a quantity of nails that laid in an old frying pan or stew pan, or something like it; she said, yes, they are. The officer that was with me then took the nails to weigh them, and she said there was another quantity in the pan before them, and they were not all of one sort, but on examining them they appeared to be all of one sort, and they weighed seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they new or old? - New nails. I asked her how she could be so imprudent to buy new nails coming from an iromongers and out of a paper as they were of a man that she must know to be a carpenter by his apron? she said they were not shot out of a paper, they were shot out of a bag, I gave the constable charge of her and the nails.</p>
               <p>Jury. What nails are they? - They are what the ironmongers call threepenny trunks.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the parcel of nails that he laid on the board? - I gave them to the officer, they weighed ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You was merely passing by at this time that you see the prisoner? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. He had something that appeared to you to be nails? - Yes.</p>

I asked what woman? He said, Mrs. Smith; they called her Mrs. Smith. I went down the court immediately, but saw neither the child nor the woman.

Many people went, but could hear nothing of her, until the publican where I have my beer came and told me, Sarah Rutlidge came in and said, that a person had seen the prisoner have the child on her lap at the end of the Chequere. I could not find her out for an hour and a half after. In the mean time,

               <p>Mrs. Moon. I know it to be the property that the child wore at the time that I missed her, by the oldness of it, and the mending of it. I have not the least doubt about it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I came from Wapping last Wednesday was a fortnight, to the best of my knowledge, when I came to the town I went to Mrs. Rutledge's, where I had a glass of ale; I had not drank any thing all the way coming along. I went out of their house, and was not in the house all the day afterwards. I met with a person that I had known some years, and she asked me to go with her and drink. I went with her, and I came back, and went to Mr. Jenkins's office, to see for a place. He said, I might call to-morrow. I met with this woman again, and I had something else to drink, which, not eating any thing, it got quite in my head. This woman said to me, let us take this child, and take a little bit of a walk. We bought the child a basket, and went in to have something to drink. About four o'clock in the afternoon, the woman asked me what money I had in my pocket? I said I had nothing. She said, let us take off the child's frock and skirt and pledge it. I said, I would not; I have had children of my own. She said, she knew the mother of the child; and she took them off, and pledged them; and the next morning I went in to Mr. Rutledge's, to have a glass, and to hear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200021"/>if I could hear any tidings concerning the child; and they took me up to the justice. I sent for this woman up to the justice, and they would not let her speak a word. They said, they would hang me if they could.</p>

               <p>The Recorder immediately passed judgment as follows:</p>
               <p>Prisoner, the wickedness and profligacy of your crime is so much superior to any thing that we have heard of in this court, at this session, that it makes it necessary that your judgment should be separated from the common felons, and that you should immediately receive the sentence of the court. The stealing of a few articles of wearing apparel, would not, itself, receive a very severe sentence, but when that theft is attended with a very aggravated circumstance of depriving parents of a child, it becomes, in my opinion, a most gross and a most heinous offence. It is, in my mind, very little short of the crime of murder. I have not words, nor will I attempt to describe the feelings of the unfortunate parents, who may be thus deprived of their children. I have to lament, that the law in this land does not provide a distinct punishment, equal and adequate to this act of profligacy of your's. But, collaterally, the court has a power, and so far as they have a power, considering the offence of which you are convicted, so far they will consider, that you, not having any feeling for the happiness of others, are in a situation to receive the just resentment of the law. I shall proceed to pass on you the severest sentence that the law of the land will permit me to pass, lamenting that I have not power to pass one more severe than that I am now about to do. The sentence of the court is, that you be <rs id="t17950520-14-punish83" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>Q. What did she give you? - I don't know, the articles that were in the bundle; they were pinned up in a dimity petticoat. The first bundle were Mr. Dillon's things.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you have from Mr. Dillon's? do you know what they were? - No, they were tied up in a table cloth for me. When I was coming from Mr. Dillon's man met me, and asked me if I did not live with one Mrs. Johnson, that washed his linen for him? I told him, no. He then asked me, where I did live? I told him, with one Mrs. Roberts; and he asked me, where I had been? I told him, to Mr. Dillon's and then I went down Mary-le-bone-street, and I met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you come from? - Out of Francis-street, Tottenham-court-road. She asked me if I did not wash for Mr. Dillon? I told her, yes; and she said, she came from Mr. Dillon's cook, and she desired her to send me back directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to send back? - To go back myself to Mr. Dillon's cook. I told her I was going a little further, after another young lady's linen. She told me to make haste, and she would stop at the corner of Titchfield-street; and I went after this Miss Roberts's linen.</p>

               <p>Q. You left her there? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You found her there in the same place when you came back? - Yes, in the same place where she said she would stop. She told me, I had better not stop any longer, for she could carry home the linen as well as me. I asked her what was the master? She said, she did not know what was the matter. I delivered the bundles to the prisoner, one under one arm, and one under the other.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered both of them? - Yes, both of them, and I returned back to Mr. Dillon's again.</p>
               <p>Q. And what became of the prisoner? - She went up Portland-street, to take the bundles home. She was by when I met the man, and she said then, when I said I lived at Mrs. Roberts's, it was No. 109, Great Portland-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Mr. Dillon's? - Yes, and when I came there, I asked if they had sent for me? They said, no. The servant asked what was the matter? I did not make any further answer, but went out of doors, and went home, to see if the woman had brought the linen home, and there had nobody been.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of your property since? - No further than I employed a constable to search the pawnbrokers, but they could not find any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any part ever been found at all? - No, there has not.</p>
               <p>Q.How did you get at the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200023"/>again? - She was taking a bundle from a little boy in Oxford-road; a person sent for me that heard of it, and I was sent for to the watch-house in Mary-le-bone-lane, to see if I knew her.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after? - It was about four o'clock when I went, and they said she was taken up about one, the next day but one. Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there, did you see any bundles belonging to you? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same woman that took the property belonging to you? - Yes, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where was it you first see the person that afterwards got your bundle? - Between Ogle-street and Titchfield-street. I was going to this young lady's for her bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the young lady live? - At. No. 13, Norton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not far off from there? - No, only a little way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave these bundles with her then? - No, I took the bundles with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave Mr. Dillon's bundle with her then? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see this person before in your life? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, she had told you a story, that you was desired to go to Mr. Dillon's; that something amiss had happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You inquired of Mr. Dillon's whether they sent for you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell them at Mr. Dillon's what a strange fool they had made of you? - I did not say any thing further; but I was frightened; I was afraid the woman had robbed me then.</p>
               <p>Q. This is just by Portland-street where you parted with the two bundles? - Not far.</p>
               <p>Q. Hardly a hundred yards from your house, is it? - Rather better than that.</p>
               <p>Q. It would not take you above three minutes to go from there to your own house? - No, I could not walk it in less than five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. She went towards your home? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Miss Roberts's, was not she extremely angry? - She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she threaten to take you up? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she tell you that you must find them out? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, you was a good deal frightened, and thought you would come to harm on the occasion? - Yes, I did; I did not think I should come to any further hurt than my friends must pay for the things.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never been able to find any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not see the person to whom you imagined you delivered them till three or four days after? - Not till the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say before the justice, that you had delivered one of the bundles first, and that the person waited with that bundle till you brought the other? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she take off? - A piece of printed cotton, it was folded up in a small fold. A woman came up to the door, and called one of them out.</p>
               <p>Q.What did she do with this printed cotton when she took it up? - Put it under her apron.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that before you made this discovery or after? - After. The they were going out at the door; I jumped over the counter and pulled her back again; then I immediately asked her for the print, and there were two pieces dropped on the ground from between them; but I only see her take one. One piece dropped from under her apron; the other I did not see drop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they printed cottons, both of the same pattern or different patterns? - Different patterns. The property is at home; Mr. Johnson would not let me bring it, he said the trial would not come on this afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a cotton you are sure? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any cottons in that house that did not belong to your master? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that belonged to your master? - I am certain it did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold her any at this time? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. What might be the value of that piece that she dropped from her apron? - Five shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose the things in the indictment? - Yes, I did. They were taken from the prisoner in the kitchen; she was a servant; she came the 27th of April; she refused to do her work, and her mistress told her she might go about her business; and she went up stairs and packed up her things, and when she came down we observed she looked very think about the waist, but did not suspect the robbery at that time; she was fondling over the child to take her leave of it, she took up her apron to wipe her eyes, and Mrs. Pussord discovered the gown through her pocket holes.</p>
               <p>Q.Is your wife here? - She is not, I was present the whole time. It was round her waist under her gown, this led to the discovery of the other things, we made her turn her pocket out, there was some tristing things there not mentioned in the indictment, they turned her apron up, where she had concealed two of the stockings I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find about her person all the articles in the indictment? - The whole of them. I delivered them to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver them yourself? - No, I believe it was my wife delivered them into his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the things again? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not discharged her? - No, I believe Mrs. Pussord would have continued her, if she had not found these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a single woman? - I believe she is.</p>

My master used me very ill at the time that he sent for the constable to take me up, and so did my mistress; and when I came here to the prison, I had the black and blue in my arms where he pinched me, and threw me down, and he served another poor girl the same before, that old cotton gown my mistress said that she would give it me, and how it came in my box I don't know. I told her the work was too hard for me without she could get a woman to help me to clean the house, as the house had been white washed, and painted all over.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She had no box.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was due to her at this time? - Three Shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. She says she complained the work was too much for her? - Not a word of that kind.</p>

               <p>Q. Then not taking your stock for a month before, and having frequent dealing with him in these fort of articles, will you take on yourself to say that these clothes had not gone out of your shop? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never any quarrel with him? - No otherwise than he used to come to the shop and put all into confusion on purpose to take the advantage of me, and I begged of him not to come asking for money.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, this good man, this prisoner at the bar, he lived in the same parish about six doors from you, and he pawned the things about six hundred yards from you, your stock you had not taken for above a month before, and you had frequent dealings with him in the same article? - Yes.</p>

            Had they any tickets on when they were taken away? - They had; the tickets have been taken off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You can safely swear to them coats? - I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to every coat that is pawned with you? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had these coats been pawned with you? - These were pawned the second of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them particularly yourself, could you swear to them any where? - I don't know that I could, if I was to see them promiscuously in a strange place.</p>
               <p>Smith. This is the coat I pawned, the blue coat, there is a hole under the left arm, the buttons are yellow, and a little grazed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You mean to swear to this coat by the buttons being yellow, there is nothing particular in these buttons, and the other things that you swear to is the hole under the arm, because that is very particular. Why it has the appearance of a coat that has been worn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Dalton. This is my coat, I know it by the hole under the arm, and the yellow buttons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had you ever a blue coat before? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q.But you have seen many a blue coat before with yellow buttons? - I have nothing further to say against the prisoner, only that is my property.</p>
               <p>Macklane. This is my husband's coat, I can swear to it any where, here are six buttons on the outside of the sleeve, and it is what they call a slash sleeve; and I was going to clean the buttons, to see if the buttons would clean, and here is one of the buttons brighter than the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - No, it is my husband's coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Is your husband here? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this by the flash sleeve? - Yes, it is a very remarkable one.</p>
               <p>Q. And one of the buttons is brighter? - Yes, and the pockets want mending.</p>
               <p>Q. That is an additional circumstance by which you are enabled to swear to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If you look at that gentleman's duplicate, it is pawned in the name of a black coat. That night I wanted some money, and I took my own coat into Mr. Murray's, and asked him to let me have some money? He said, he had no money. Says I, then I must go to Mr. Kemble; and I took my two coats, and the rug off my bed, and pawned them at Mr. Kemble's.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character, and also Mr. Kemble, who said, he never knew any thing bad of him, but he had heard things.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the property? - I cannot say; and I assisted them, by taking hold of the prisoner, and conducted him to the house from whence he came; No. 78, in St. Martin's-lane.</p>

He dropped the handkerchief, and I catched up the handkerchief, and ran after the man, and they pursued me.</p>

               <p>I was going along Newport-street that morning, and I heard the cry of stop thief, and I immediately lifted up my head, and I see the man coming running with a handkerchief in his hand, running a great pace. He tried to pass by me, and I made an attempt to stop him; I caught him in my arms. As soon as I had hold of him, he dropped the plate on the flag stones, and when he dropped it, the handkerchief fled open, and I saw the girl gather the plate up, and put it into her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - He said to me, pray, sir, let me go, I have done nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else? - No. The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character, said that he worked with his father, who was a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Whiteman. By your lordship's permission, I will say one word. When the prisoner was brought to Bow-street, it was inquired of the officers if any of them knew him; and they said they did not, none of them.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol of Bow-street; I saw the prisoner on the morning of the 12th of May, on Mount-pleasant, with the boards against a waggon.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts is Mount-pleasant? - Just at the end of Elm-street, the lower end of Gray's-inn-lane. He took two of the boards and laid them by the side of the fence, and left a child to mind them; I see him take them from the side of a waggon, and laid them down, and left his child to mind them, and then took the other two to carry home; I asked him where he was going? he said he was going down to the lower end of Warner-street; then I insisted on his bringing the boards back to the place where he had taken them from, which he did, he brought them back to the buildings in North-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from there that you see him take them? - No, he said he took them from there himself.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this from the place where you found him? - It may be as far as from the end of Newgate-street, of somewhere thereabouts. Then I took the boards to my own house afterwards, and made an inquiry for an owner for them, and I found that they belonged to Mr. Pitcher, he came and owned them in my yard, there is the name in full length, in two places on each board.</p>
               <p>Pitcher. They are scaffolding boards, deal; I have no doubt about them in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Why is not your brother here? - He thought it was not necessary; as I knew the boards as well as he.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you nois them? - No, we cannot, we have so many.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was taking a walk one morning, and I see two or three old boards lay down, and being a poor man who had served my King and country, I thought it no harm to pick these boards up to light a fire, to make the kettle boil, I instantly picked them up, I thought they were bits of old wood; this gentleman, Mr. Kirby knew me when my uncle was sheriff, Mr. Baker, four years ago; and they brought me away last night suddenly from Clerkenwell; I have some friends to send for to give me a character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes. I have been in that concern three years, and he has been my <rs id="t17950520-22-deflabel128" type="occupation">servant</rs>

Between the hours of nine and ten, on the 29th of April, I went down to the manufactory to look after my business, he was then printing a piece of green cloth, which they call India mat, I told him the demands for goods was such that we wished to finish every thing as fast as we could, that there was a piece of cloth that had been damaged in the drawing up after the printing, some months before, and I wished him to mend it as he was using this colour; I apprehended by this reply that he misunderstood me, and he said what piece of cloth, the Italian bat? which was another piece of green cloth; I said no, what is that gone? which on inquiry in the manufactory we found it was gone, and a piece of green cloth also. Having lost goods before, I said we must have got a thief within the premises, on inquiry among the men none knew any thing of it, in consequence of which I went up to the house to Mrs. Barnes, I mentioned the circumstance of our loss, and we thought it advisable then to have a search warrant. I went to the Police office and got a search warrant.</p>
               <p>Q.Are those premises out of the city? - They are. I asked for a warrant to search every man's house on which the magistrate told me. -</p>
               <p>Q.Did you go with a search warrant to the house of the prisoner at the bar? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you? - Mr. Taplin. He keeps a house and lets it out in lodgings, in Buckle-street, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from your premises? - It may be half a mile. On entering the house I see Mrs. Clarke, she appeared very much discomposed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you acquaint her with the nature of your business? - I mentioned it to her. I went into the back yard with Mr. Taplin, seeing her come out of the back yard, and there I saw a sheet with a quantity of unwrought cloth tied up in it; unwrought floor cloth. We call it canvas.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was it altogether? - About eighty square yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces were there? - I believe there may be thirty or upwards. I told Mr. Taplin these were not the things that I expected to find, I proceeded to the end of the yard, and in the conveniency at the end of the yard, I see a man of the name of Hart. He makes baskets for me, I supply the government with stores.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know whether Hart was acquainted with the prisoner before? - Yes, I have seen him with the prisoner in the factory. Mr. Taplin thought it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200037"/>necessary to stop Hart, and he proceeded to examine the different rooms, and in the press he found the things mentioned in the indictment. In the press in the attic room, he found there the paper patterns, the vegetable green, the other things were found in the cellar; that is, the red lead and the piece of painted cloth; some of the painted cloth was in the press. In consequence of that we waited till the prisoner came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the press belonged to? - It was Mr. Clarke's. I left the matter to Mr. Taplin to do as he thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing besides these patterns? - I left Mr. Taplin to take them out, there were more things.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got these things, did you apprehend the prisoner; I waited some time, and the prisoner not coming home at his usual time to dinner, I went to go home, and I met the prisoner in Haydon-square. On his return home, I shook my head and said, I was very sorry for what had taken place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any answer to the expression? - He spoke, but in such a low tone, I could not understand him; he then went to his sister's in the same street, and there he waited till I believe Mr. Taplin went and took him, he did not go home. When he came into the house we shewed him the things that were there, and he confessed they were ours.</p>
               <p>Q. What he came home afterwards? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he get to his own house? - It may be a quarter after one.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you see him going towards his sister's? - It might be within the space of half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.First of all, did you, or Taplin in your presence, before he said any thing, promise it would be better for him if he gave you an account of it? - No, when he see these goods, he confessed these goods were ours. These goods in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - I said I had found out the thief at last, or something at least to that purpose. I said these are not the things that I expected to find, what have you done with the manufactured goods? he said he knew nothing of them; I then promised him, provided he would confess, that I would not go on with the prosecution, then he did confess.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them, are they worth ten or twenty shillings? - Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Const. You, I think, have told us that you sent the constable for him? - I went with the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. And that after you met him going towards home? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q.What, he knew the constable and you were there? - No, he did not know from us. I suppose there were repeated intimations from his own friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in consequence of these messages you apprehended he was coming? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The value of the things I see is trifling? - I laid them at twenty shillings the whole. I could not buy them for that money, they cost me more than five guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. I recollect you told my lord what you said to him, to induce him to confess the property, what did you say? - I did not say any thing to him with respect to these things that are in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the promise was made were not the things laying before you? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you wanting to know the particulars of these things? - No, it was the manufactured goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he confessed voluntarily? -He did.</p>
               <p>Q. This man has been very long in the business? - He has.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us what you found there? - A quantity of raw cloth. By entering of Mr. Clarke's house, with Mr. Bates, I met Mrs. Clarke in the passage, seemingly coming from the back yard of the house. Mrs. Clarke seeing Mr. Bates, she ran up stairs; I called to Mrs. Clarke, and told her I had a search warrant for the house. I desired Mr. Bates to go backwards. By opening the door going into the back yard, there laid a large bundle of canvas, tied up in a sheet, in the back yard, just without the door. I and Mr. Bates went further back to the privy, Mr. Bates see one there whom he knew, George Hart. I asked him if he knew any thing of that property that was there? We proceeded then up stairs, and by searching up in the garret, we found some paper parcels, which Mr. Bates took out himself, and some other canvas, up stairs. (They are all here.) There was one piece of canvas found in the parlour, where Mrs. Clarke was sitting, and some paint in the cellar, a pot of red paint, (it is here.) There was a great quantity of paint, but it was very old, and took no notice of. The prisoner's sister came up to Mr. Clarke's house; as soon as she came in doors she was very much alarmed, very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of her coming, what did you do? - I went back with her, and found him there, and took him back to his own house, where Mr. Bates was, and Mrs. Barnes; then I heard Mr. Battes make him a promise.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you did not hear any thing before a promise was passed? - No; Mr. Bates told him, that the goods that he had searched after he had not found; that if he would produce those goods, he would look over these things, which, he had no doubt, were his property.

               <p>Q. I want to know what you know of these goods that were found at the time you were in Clarke's house? - I happened to call that very day promiscuously in the warehouse. Mr. Clarke gave me a key, and desired me to carry this key home to his house, that there were some old things there that he wanted moved out of the way. He said, there was a disturbance in the work shop, and his master might have some suspicion of some things that he had got at his house.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you do with the key? - I carried it to his wife.</p>
               <p>Q.What was she to do with it? - To remove some things out from up stairs, and carry them to his sister's.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were they to be carried to his sister's? - I don't know; he gave me no reason at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, some little while ago, that his master might have some suspicion? - It was about the things at home, because some things had been missed.</p>
               <p>Q. You said something about some old things at home? - He did; he thought his master might have some suspicion, as they were things missed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she get any things with this key? - She got the things out of the press, I believe, I know she did, because I see her.</p>
               <p>Q.What did she get out of this press? - A good many things; I did not count them. I heard them call them raw cloth. I believe, to the best of my knowledge, them are some of the things, but I cannot particularly swear to them.</p>

               <p>Q. You were carried before the justice? - No, I went to the justice, but I was not asked a question there.(The things produced.)</p>
               <p>Bates. These patterns are ours; no person in the world has the patterns besides ourselves; the prisoner printed them in the warehouse himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear to the floor cloth? - I do not; but these are not in a saleable state; It could never have been sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you then believe, without undertaking to swear pointly, that they are your property? - Yes, I have reason to believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that canvas the same as you use? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he empowered to take home canvas? - On no account whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the red lead, that has no mark by which you can swear to it? - No; I am very tenacious what I swear to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. I believe you have twenty times said, that you swear to nothing, but the paper patterns, what value do you put on them? - At the Police office I put them at a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they were of his own striking? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it unlikely for a man who strikes a pattern of his own making, not to take a duplicate? - I found patterns at his sister's; he has been treated indeed as a brother through the whole of the business.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you know that he has traded with other people, and had the articles of you? - He has.</p>
               <p>Q. In this shilling you value his time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you miss such patterns as these? - We had different impressions struck off, and at different times, we could not tell where they were gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have only this to say, that Mr. Bates always asked me to print them patterns, and when I printed them I always printed a set for him, and one for myself, and my set was on my own paper.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Buckle-street; I have known the prisoner many years, he is a very sober honest man, and a very industrious man; I was at the house when Mr. Bates was there, and Mr. Clarke came home; Mr. Bates told him to look at these cloths; Mr. Clarke told him that the cloths was not his; Mr. Bates told him, that if on condition he would say the cloths were his, he would forgive him, he would not expose him, but he could never more expect to work in his warehouse; Mr. Clarke made answer directly, that on those conditions he would say the cloths was his; Mr. Bates directly said, you have confessed to this, but there is something else; Mr. Clarke made answer, and said, he knew nothing of any thing else, he never saw nothing; Mr. Bates made answer that was enough, he did not doubt but that all the men in the warehouse were alike, but he would punish him for an example to the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200041"/>Mr. Knowlys. What is your name? - Elizabeth Burkitt.</p>
               <p>Q.And you are sister to the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q.So that past when Mr. Bates and Mr Taplin were present? - Yes, and Mr. Hart was at the time present likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. All these three persons were present, and Mr. Bates said, now, if you will own that these cloths are mine, I will forgive you? - He did, indeed; and I said directly to Mr. Clarke, do say they are his; then directly he said, then I will say they are your's, take them; but he directly said, that is not all, you have confessed to these, but there is something else; says my brother, I know nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken immediately to the magistrate's? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found that Mr. Bates was so far from forgiving him, that he did not forgive him? - No, he was for persecuting him very violent indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. So then as you went before the justice, you told this story there? - No, I did not; I was asked no questions there.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you did not tell them at the magistrate's that Mr. Bates had promised to forgive your brother? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that your brother did say that that cloth was Mr. Bates's? - O, yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Because Mr. Bates has forgot it? - He said, I will say on them conditions, them are your's.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Bates. Did you at the time that the man was in his house, say to him, if you will confess that cloth to be mine, I will forgive you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say, on these conditions, then I do own the cloth to be your's? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. To Taplin. Did you hear Mr. Bates say to Clarke, if you will own to the cloth being mine, I will forgive you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say, on these conditions I do own that cloth to be your's? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Did you attend to the whole of the conversation between them? - I did not; I was backward and forward, I did not attend at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it might be said, and you not hear it? - It might.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know about the jack ass belonging to Mr. Nash? - I see the prisoner at the bar on it, Brackley, in Page-street, Hendon, on the 26th of March, soon after nine o'clock in the morning; they were driving some more asses to bring them to London.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the other man doing? - He was on another ass by the side of him. They were driving three more asses before them; I had seen the prisoners before. I keep milking asses myself, and that made me take particular notice of them. They wanted me to buy a mare ass of them, but we did not deal.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you at all know Nash? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there singular about the ass, was it a mare ass or a jack ass? - A jack ass, but cut. It was remarkable by being very high, and by being cut, which made me know him again, and his tail being cut, and I took particular notice of it as I could, expecting them to be stole.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it since that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see it afterwards? - Last Wednesday evening, a week before yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see this ass? - At my own door; Mr. Nash brought it to me to know whether it was the ass that I see this man upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you veature to swear that you made observation enough to be positive? - Quite certain.</p>
               <p>Q.That is the one that you see Brackley upon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was this offered to sell with the mare ass? - No, only the mare ass. I did not offer to buy that, I did not want such a thing as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where Mr. Nash lives? - In the country in Buckinghamshire, somewhere near Wickham-common.</p>
               <p>Q. How far may that be from where you saw the man? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Nash. I suppose it may be upwards of thirty miles from where I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean the place where the prisoner was seen on this ass, offering it to sell? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it, before you lost it? - The 24th.</p>

             I was coming up to sell five asses that I had got then; I had got one that was rather heavy in foal; as I was coming along, this man see me, and he asked me the price of it; I told him, and we could not agree. With that I came and brought them all up to Smithfield, all of them, and I sold it to a man whom I could have got to prove that he bought the ass of me that day, in Smithfield, but I thought I should have been tried in the country, and that is the reason that I have no witnesses here now. I used to drive asses with earthen-ware. My father bought it in Smithfield for my purpose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cogdal. I know nothing about it, it was his ass for any thing I knew; I was coming up to Smithfield to buy me a horse; therefore I was walking along after him.</p>
               <p>Court to Ivory. Were these men in company together? - They were in company together, and both stopped together, and I talked to them both about dealing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200043"/>as though they belonged to one another, for the space of a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both offer to sell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that where these asses were offered to sell, was in the county of Middlesex? - It was in the parish of Hendon, and Hendon and Millhill is in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Jury to Nash. Do you know either of the prisoners at the bar? - I know then both very well; John Cogdal used to drive five or six asses with a waggon and a horse behind them; and the other used to sell earthen ware, loaded on asses.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value of it? - I gave two guineas for it; I have been offered a guinea and a half for it since.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live? - At Penn, in Buckinghamshire.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Coophan? - I suppose it may be eight or nine miles. I believe it was the 2d of April, it was the day before Good Friday; when I got into the road, I looked behind me, and I saw two men bringing three asses along, they were at a distance behind me; I stopped a little for them to come up; they did not come up while I stopped, they seemed to slacken their pace; I goes on into a little farm yard, there I stops till the prisoners came up opposite the yard gate; I then stepped to the gate and asked them where they were going to drive those asses? they said, home; I made answer and said, home! yes, home, they said, the other side of Wickham Heath. I followed them for about five or six hundred yards; I thought to myself I would go home, and take my horse and ride to Mr. Nash's, who had informed me that be had lost an ass the week before. I took a horse and went and informed Mr. Nash. We went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200044"/>to a wood, and placed ourselves at a distance to see them come through the wood. Mr. Nash he gave me the signal that he had seen the asses; when I came up to him, says he, are those the asses that you see in possession of Brackley and Cogdal? I looked at a particular mare ass that seemed to be very big in soal, marked with a R. and F. Mr. Nash says, the prisoners are gone home and left the asses there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners live far from thence? - No, it may be a quarter of a mile, or half a mile, for what I know. I says to Mr. Nash, this is a very odd thing. I thought they would come in the evening to take the asses away; and Mr. Nash and I went in the evening, about seven o'clock. When we came to the place where we lost the asses, we could not find them there. I supposed they were strolled away at a distance, and it being dark, we could not find them. About nine o'clock, the two prisoners came to the place where they had left the asses; Mr. Nash being a little thick of hearing, he did not see them till they popped on them. As soon as they see him, they turned towards home.</p>
               <p>Q. To Turner. Was Fowler's ass in soal? - Yes; we looked for it to soal every day.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of April I see the two prisoners and three asses in Penwood; I see them going towards their home; I went a little way further, and saw three asses; they appeared to me to be very much in a sweat, and then at night I went to see who fetched these asses; and between seven and nine, I cannot exactly say what hour, these two men came up very near me, the prisoners. I asked one of them, if they had seen any thing of a grey horse, on the common, as they came along? they said, no. I said, somebody had left my gate open, and my horse had got out on the common.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the asses? - Yes; there was a black ass, R. F.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners with these asses at all? - I see the prisoners, five minutes before I came up to the asses in the road. Then coming up to the asses, I asked Mr. Clarke if they were the asses that he had seen before in their possession? he said they were. In the evening I went to wait to see who came for them, with Mr. Clarke; and between the hours of seven and nine, both the prisoners came near me. I was very near where the asses were left, and seeing me and Mr. Clarke, they crossed away over the common. I went still in pursuit after the asses; in about quarter of an hour after they came across me again. John Brackley said, have you lost your horse Mr. Nash? Yes, said I, I have. He then said, he had turned four of his asses up on the common that day, and could not find them. I saw neither of them again, nor the asses, till the 14th of May; there I see it in the possession of Mr. Jordan, at Finchley; he had bought it. Hearing of

            When did you first hire him? - On the 7th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with him? - Yes, a twelve month's character, of a Mr. Moggridge, at Turnbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you missed your property, was he still in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you make the discovery of the loss? - On Friday, the 1st of May, the prisoner at the bar and I slept together in the pantry, and I got up a quarter before seven; and the prisoner intreated me to take a walk up the road, as, being May-day, there were many people walking. I went walking with the prisoner; I returned about eight o'clock. The prisoner and I went together in the kitchen, on our return; and after I had returned to my pantry, and cleaned my plates, and the prisoner at the bar assisted me, after that I washed my hands, and set the tea things, and put five tea spoons in a slop bason, and a silver tea strainer, and went to the pantry to cut a slice of bread and butter, the prisoner was in the kitchen the while, I came back to the kitchen, to take the things up into the parlour, and immediately missed the tea spoons from the tea board, from the bason in the parlour; I came down and asked him why he took them out of the bason, to make me come down again for them? (he had before that hid some plate, which I supposed he did it on purpose to vex me) He said he had not. I went up again, to be satisfied I had not overlooked them; and while I was in the parlour, he brought me up eleven tea spoons, and a pair of silver sugar tongs, wrapped up a paper, and said, here are the tea spoons, where you put them yourself, why did you make a noise to me? I said to him, these are not the spoons, John, you know that as well as me.</p>
               <p>Q. You perceived that they were not your mistress's spoons? - Yes, they were my mistress's spoons, but not the same that were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, you placed these spoons there just before you went into the kitchen, and therefore you are positive that the spoons that he brought you back, were not the same? - Yes, I am positive of it. I returned to the pantry, and opened my closet door, and immediately missed the rest of my things from my tray that I had set them in.</p>
               <p>Q. I see in the indictment that there are six silver spoons, tea spoons? - I missed five out of the bason, and a pair of sugar tongs, and one tea spoon from a cup and and saucer.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to the pantry, what else did you miss? - Five table spoons, five desert spoons, a gravy spoon, two sauce ladles, and a marrow spoon. When I missed these other spoons, I begged to know what he had done with them; he still denied knowing any thing about them; that he had never touched them; I went up stairs to acquaint my mistress, but she was not up, and I came down again and still intreated to know what he had done with them, not thinking he had stole them, but thinking he had done it to vex me. When my mistress came down she asked him what he had done with the plate? I then sent for a constable and took the prisoner into custody; the constable searched the prisoner, and searched every part of the lower part of the house, and could not find any thing; he was in the house for two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he find any thing about the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any of this property been found? - No, it has not been found.</p>

He went into a back room, and brought a small quantity of seamens powers of attorney in his hand; and I said, I would have two. I asked the price? and he said, six shillings and threepence. I paid him twelve and sixpence for them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not let any circumstances of apprehension, or any thing prevent you from speaking the whole truth, you are now under the protection of the law, and therefore I desire you to speak the whole truth. How long have you been ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200057"/>quainted with the prisoner at the bar? - Six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you call yourself? - I used to do business for the navy, and in the mercantile line.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his brother, who is deceased? - Yes, the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first had any communication with the prisoner, on the subject of forged stamps? - About four months before I was apprehended; on calling at the late Idswell's, in St. Maryaxe, in the prefence of Soloman Idswell, the late Idswell asked me, what I thought of having a six shilling stamp made? if I had anybody I could sell them to, I might make my fortune? I then told him I had a friend at Portsmouth, and mentioned one Mr. Wolfe; he then asked me whether Mr. Wolfe could be trusted, and would have no suspicion? I told him he would not, for he was a man that made use of a great many himself, and therefore he would have no suspicion. A few days after I see Mr. Wolse in town, whom I had known many years; in the course of the conversation I told him that I expected some stamps on credit, from a stationer, and wished to know whether they would said him, being six shilling stamps for powers of attorney and assignments? he then said they would suit him; I then told him I would send him about two hundred pounds worth; Mr. Wolfe said they were too many, that he could have a better use for his money. Then we parted without coming to any agreement, and then I went to the late Idswell's house, and acquainted him what had passed between me and Mr Wolfe.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did the late Idswell live? - No. 57. St. Mary-axe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this conversation pass in the presence of Solomon Idswell? - No, it was the late Idswell.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you see Solomon? - Then the late Idswell and me went to buy some paper stamps, in order to get them stamped; we went to a shop in Lombard-street, and bought two quires of blank powers of attorney without stamps, for which he paid half a crown, or three shillings, I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Q. You met Mr. Wolse, you have told us what past between him and you. Had you any talk with this man about Wolfe again? - No, I had not. The late Idswell went the same afternoon to Messrs. Mount's and Page's, stationers, on Tower Hill, and he bought several quires of powers of attorney, and assignments not stamped, and took them home to his own house; and he also desired me the next day to attend, to call on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call the next day? - Yes. When I came he took me up three pair of stairs into a back garret, where I see in the middle of the room, a bench fixed with a small press fixed on it, and a fly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the press in working order? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was fixed in the middle of the room? - Yes, and

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200058"/>Q. Before you went down stairs, did you try this press? - I tried one myself, and I spoiled the power, I could not make the impression perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose desire did you make it? - By my own fancy.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked him leave to do it. Well, when you went down stairs, you left him at work? - Yes. I returned again at four o'clock the same afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you what sort of a thing it was that they stamped these papers with? - It was a brass metal with a stamp engraved on it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was it done? - The paper was laid on the bottom of the press, and then the brass plate laid on it, and the fly with a handle forced the screw down on it.</p>
               <p>Q. The stamp was not thrown down with the fly and up again, it was laid down? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. So that for each one it was necessary to take it up, and lay it down on it? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You went down stairs and returned at four o'clock in the afternoon? - Yes. After I came, there were three hundred and twenty-three packed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation while you was in the room or before you left it, with respect to the operation? - The work shook the room, and I mentioned it to Solomon, and he said there was no danger.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed to him, what did you say? - I told him it caused to shake the room very much, and I was afraid it would alarm the neighbourhood; and he said, there was no danger.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned at four o'clock in the afternoon, there were three hundred and how many? - Three hundred and twenty odd packed up, and a direction wrote upon it, to Mr. Wolfe, at Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was it told you there were three hundred and twenty odd packed up? - The late Idswell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the presence of Solomon? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with them? - They were taken to the inn in Gracechurch-street, where the mail goes out.</p>

What was the next thing that happened? - I also wrote a letter to Mr. Wolfe, by the post, in Hebrew, and acquainted him that I sent him such a parcel, and desired to have some remittance; two days after I received a letter, at the New York Coffee house enclosing me a Portsmouth bank note of fifty pounds, and a banker's checque for ten pounds, on Sir James Esdaile and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the note if you was to see it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What did it purport? - That there was a remittance according to my desire, of this banker's note, and a banker's checque for the stamps.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the bank note? - I gave it to the late Idswell to carry to get it accepted, and the ten pound banker's checque I went and received the money for it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next thing that took place? - In a day or two after the late Idswell desired me to draw a bill on Mr. Wolfe for forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. In a few days afterwards did you draw a bill on Mr. Wolfe for forty pounds? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. What was done with that bill after you signed your name to it? - I don't know, I gave it to the late Idswell to convey it to Mr. Wolfe. I always wrote a letter to Mr. Wolfe acquainting him that I had drawn such a bill.</p>

            Idswell? - The late Idswell's.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the next thing that took place? - I wrote a letter to Mr. Wolfe, acquainting him that I had drawn a bill on him him for forty pounds, and I hoped he would acknowledge it; about eight days after I received a letter from Mr. Wolfe, desiring to have a quantity of stamps on parchment; there was an order wrote in English, which I tore off and gave to the late Idswell.</p>

               <p>Q. How much was the amount of the order for parchment? - Twenty pounds ten shillings it came to after it was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered that order to the late. Idswell? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it? Was there any remittance in that letter? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.What was done with that order for the parchment? - I gave it to the late Idswell, and he went into Birchin-lane; I went with him, and he shewed the order to Mr. Weatherby, and left it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the parchment order was left there to be executed? - It was. After a few days the order was got ready, and the lateIdswell went himself, and paid for it, and conveyed it to Mr. Wolfe the same as the other. About three weeks after I received another letter from Mr. Wolfe, where in he mentions to have some twopenny, sixpenny, and fourpenny stamps; I also carried it to the late Idswell's house, and myself and him went opposite the India House, at a stationer's, and there we purchused them, about five pounds and upwards, which I paid for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. The Idswells were not provided with any stamp except the six shilling; so that the other order, and the order for parchment, you were obliged to get executed elsewhere? - Yes, we were. Mr. Wolfe requested me not to send him any more six shilling stamps, unless he should first acquaint me. I wrote a letter to Mr. Wolse, that I should comply with his order for small stamps, and also send him four hundred powers of attorney. I then went by myself to Mount and Page, on Tower-hill, and bought fourteen quires of blank powers.</p>
               <p>Q.Unstamped of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And what did you do with them? - I brought them to the late Idswell's house in St. Mary-axe.</p>
               <p>Q. The same place where the others had been stamped? - Yes. They were also stamped the same as the others were. I went up stairs for a little time that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find in the garret when you went up stairs? - Solomon Idswell.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing? - The same as before.</p>
               <p>Q. He was at work? - Yes, stamping.</p>
               <p>Q.Now how long might you stay with him the time that he was stamping these papers, that you brought from Mount and Page's? - I did not stay with him above five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you go again; how soon were they finished? - I did not come the same day. They were also conveyed to Gracechurch-street, to be conveyed to Mr. Wolse.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were sent? - Because I received a letter from Mr. Wolse acknowledging them, and that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200060"/>night I wrote a letter to Mr. Wolfe that he would receive them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were sent? - Four hundred, all powers of attorney, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go back to St. Maryaxe that night? - No, I went to the prisoner's own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner's own house? - In Baker's-buildings, Broad-street.</p>

               <p>Q.What you call fine gold? - Yes; not coin gold. Then he gave me half that money, half the fifty pounds, and half of fifty-five pounds, the late Idswell did.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you do with the fine gold that you got at Pratts? - He disposed of it, he gave me the allowance of that.</p>

               <p>Q.How soon did you see them again? - I see the late Idswell almost every day. In about a fortnight after the late Idswell went to Smith's house again, the late Idswell took me up stairs, and shewed me a table in the room.</p>
               <p>Q.Then the late Idswell went up stairs with you, did this man go up stairs with you, or did you find him in the room? - I found the table and the press, and the press fixed on a very strong board, stronger than in St. Mary-axe.</p>

               <p>Q.How long might you stay while this man was working at Smith's house at that time? - Not long, I did not stop but a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.From the quantity that appeared to be done, did he seem to have been long at work at that time? - No, he did not. The greatest part was unstamped at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity might there be laying there for the purpose of stamping? - Not above fifty. I returned again in the afternoon, and took away from Smith's what were made.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see this man either on Monday or Tuesday? - No, I did not. On the first Sunday I see him there, and the Wednesday following they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, you and the late Idswell were apprehended? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.This man was not apprehended for some days after? - He was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see these in possession of this prisoner? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is not material on this indictment, so I will not pursue it.</p>
               <p>Court. You don't know who took this first parcel to the mail coach in Grace-church-street? - I have forgot whether it was Solomon Idswell or Idswell Idswell, I am not positive.</p>

               <p>Q. This you say you believe to be the one that you saw in St. Mary-axe, and at Smith's; the board is not the same that was in St. Mary-axe, but the iron work you believe is the same? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. When was it the late Idswell first applied to you? - About four months before I got into trouble.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you never was in custody on no charge? - I was once, in the year 1791, doing my business I happened to have a misfortune concerning the navy; there was a probate of a will brought to me, and it was supposed to be a forgery; I was ordered by the navy board to attend the board, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not then taken into custody at all for that? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a man of the name of Welch, concerned in that business? - That was a woman, recommended by a man, of the name of Welch.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave in some bail for attendance on a future day? - No, I did not to the navy board.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you this fact, whether nobody passed their word for you to attend the second time? - Not at the navy board; I received a letter from the navy board to attend on Tuesday, which I did; when I came there, they asked me where I came by this paper? and I told them it was brought to me by a woman, for to receive the money.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you ever in custody on any charge at all? - No, I never was; the gentleman of the navy board were satisfied, if I would promise to detain the man and woman, when they came; at the same time the advocate for the navy board laid, they were not satisfied, and then I came away, and never came forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you whether you did not give bail to come the next day before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200063"/>the justice? - I asked your advice, and you advised me not to come forward, and I left the country, and it has been the total ruin of me.</p>

               <p>Q. How long were you in Hamborough? - Four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in London in this four or five years? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever appear public in London again, till Mrs. Welch, who had something to do in this transaction, was dead? - I don't know that she is dead, I did not hear so.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not in consequence of hearing that Mrs. Welch was dead, that you publickly appeared in London? - People might say it, it may be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not? - It might, I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not?Did not you keep out of the way till you heard Mrs. Welch was dead?</p>
               <p>Court. What signifies pursuing it?</p>

               <p>Q.Never? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to swear that under Barnard's commission, you never claimed more than fifty pounds? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor ever, swore that he owed you three or four hundred pounds? - Never swore it.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean publickly, but by affidavit? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What might you have been, the greatest part of your life? - I was in very good business in the navy; I have been as well to do as some of the first merchants in London, till such times as I got acquainted with the late Idswell; I have done business for twelve or thirteen years in the navy.</p>
               <p>Q.Now I take it for granted, you have always got your livelihood as an honest man? - I did always, till I became acquainted with the Idswells.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as you were an honest man, Idswell Idswell did not seem to be under much difficulty to persuade you into the plan? - In fact they got me under so much, that any thing they asked me to do, I should have done.</p>
               <p>Q.When you were taken up you expected to be prosecuted, did not you? - Why, yes. The advice I received was that opinion, the person advising me to go off, as they might commit me.</p>
               <p>Q. I am now asking you about the last transaction; when you was taken up, you expected to be prosecuted? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. No! when you was taken up for this forgery? - Certainly I did expect it.</p>
               <p>Q. And in order to prevent your being prosecuted, you stated this charge against Idswell? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing of Mrs. Welch's death? - She is not dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Who furnished Mrs. Welch with money to go to Ireland, just before you came from Hamborough? - I could have brought the man to justice, but I did not choose to do it.</p>
               <p>Q.Who furnished Mrs. Welch with money to go to Ireland, just before you came from Hamborough, and just before it was reported she was dead? - I did, but she is not dead.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had given the account to these persons who are carrying on this</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200064"/>prosecution, you had a copy of your evidence? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember stating to any body, that the contents that was put on that paper, was not true? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said there was a great deal more put down than you could positively swear to? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ask any friends advice, how far it would be necessary to swear, in order to save yourself? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You never consuited with any body about the evidence you should give when you came into court? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as true as all the rest you have sworn? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.What was Bryant? - He was late clerk to the prison where I was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same prison in which a person of the name of Norwood was in custody?</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. That is extremely irregular, Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am not going to ask what Mr. Bryant said to him, or him to Mr. Bryant, I only want to bring Mr. Bryant's name on your lordship's book, then in order to ascertain the locus in quo, I ask whether that is the same prison in which Mr. Norwood was in custody.</p>
               <p>Witness. I slept in the room with Bryant.</p>
               <p>Court. Who is Bryant? - He was clerk to the keeper of the House of Correction, where I was; we were friendly together at first, but I found him quite different at the latter end.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been for many years engraver to his Majesty's commissioners of stamps? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q.Employed by them in engraving the dies with which the stamps are impressed? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you by their direction engrave a die for a six shilling stamp, with the letter E? - I did, by a warrant from the commissioners.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had the opportunity of looking over a great many stamps, which were suspected to be forged? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q.Who produced them to you? - Mr. Whittard.</p>
               <p>Q.Were all these that were produced to you, genuine or forged? - They were forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least doubt about that? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it to you obvious without a glass? - I cannot see without a glass.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you made observation on particular parts that I shall not examine you to, except one that is so striking; you see at the bottom of this, one shilling, one shilling, sixpence, one shilling, and one shilling; between these several things that I have now been remarking there is something impressed, what is that in the genuine stamp? - It is a small flower.</p>
               <p>Q.What is it in that you call a forgery? - It is a cross, and very heavy, and different in shape.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at this, and tell us whether this is a genuine one, impressed from your die?(one shown him) - That is genuine.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200066"/>Mr. Garrow to Jury. Be so good as to look at the genuine one with the glass, to that part that I have pointed out, and you will see that it is a flower.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at your left hand, reading upwards you will see a sixpence, look at the shape of that? and then look at the forged one, and you will see it much heavier, the ball of the P.</p>

               <p>Court. I see this is so badly impressed, that half the sixpence on the right hand side, has made no impression at all? - No, it is very imperfect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Major. You who have engraved the one, have no difficulty whatever in stating that the other is a forgery? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that all that Mr. Whittard shewed you were forged? - Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q.And the die of the one that you produce; the genuine one has been the one used by the commissioners, which you made under their direction? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. How long has that stamp been used? - Since the year 1788; I have the warrant in my pocket, it is the 27th of May 1788, and finished by me by the August, pursuant to that order.</p>
               <p>Court. And been used ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Whittard. Did you shew to Mr. Major all these that are here produced? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that include that one that Wolfe himself had taken, that power that he had spoken of? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. To Major. Cast your eye on that, and see if that is a forged one. (the power shewn him) - It is.</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner did you fix it? -  I put two braces to it, from the ceiling, and from the wainscotting,from the bottom to the stand, to make it stronger, and one I put at the end.</p>

               <p>Q. But it was required by the prisoner to be made more solid, and therefore you put two braces to it, who made you a complement for your trouble? - That gentleman, he gave me a shilling.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the founder that did it? - Brodie, in Cary-street.</p>
               <p>Q.After that, did you see the prisoner again? - No; the porter came for it, and he paid my wife for it.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon after this did you see the prisoner again? - I had it then, I believe, five or six weeks before I had done it; about a month after I had it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came to you about it then? - I was not at home when the gentleman came; the next day he came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the press been left in the mean time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. While you was out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean when you speak of the gentleman? - The prisoner; and he ordered me to get it done as soon as I could; it broke in the middle part.</p>
               <p>Q.What reason did he give you? - That he had got some business to do for a friend of his, that was to go into the country, and I finished and sent it home.</p>
               <p>Q. And what would be the conse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200069"/>quence, did he say? - He should lose his order.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he promise to give you any thing for making it get on? - No, farther than he said, he would satisfy me for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Q.In consequence of this you got it done, and sent it home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, be so good to look at that, and tell us whether you are certain that is the same press that you repaired, by the order of the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the one that you got cast at Brodie's? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt? - I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. There is your own repair on it? - Yes, there is.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, looking on it, there is no doubt in your mind that that is the same that you had to repair from the prisoner, Idswell? - No, no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Have you been used to make these sort of instruments? - Yes.</p>

I said, between eleven and twelve; and I said, we were rather watched by a person. He said, he did not do any thing that was unlawful, and that they might come home and see what was transacted; as he did not do any thing that he was afraid of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he try the press, to see if it went easy? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever, in your presence? - No, he did not in my presence; he never put any thing to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any observation on the instrument going either free or stiff, or any other observation on it? - He said, that the sliding bar would go stiff; and I said, it will go better when you put some oil on it.</p>

               <p>Q. You told Mr. Idswell that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same that the braces were put to? - It seems to be the same. It is one like it in the same form.</p>

               <p>Q. Be so good to look at that instrument that stands here; tell us whether the cast part of that was cast by you, by the direction of Cheshire? - I have seen it before at Bow-street. I apprehend it is; it has the same appearance of the one that I cast by his direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cheshire give you the direction for that you see in Bow-Street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200071"/>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar at all? - I had no knowledge of the person at all. The first time that we made a small press of this description, there came a strange person to order it, and Mr. Cheshire came the next day for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you don't now know the person? - I don't know that I do.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever seen the prisoner at the bar, upon your oath? - That person looks like the person.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not seen him since he has been in custody, and therefore you may be very honest for what I know. Do you believe the man at the bar, to be the person that you describe as a stranger that came to you giving the order for the press? - Yes, I believe it is, and I thought the paper described the person that came about the press.</p>
               <p>Q. You see an advertisement, and you thought that described the person? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Looking at him, do you think that that is the man? - Yes, I really believe to my conscience that that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. And the press which you verily believe in your conscience the prisoner ordered, was fetched away by Cheshire? - It was.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not this press, but a smaller? - Not this, a smaller.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. These presses are made for a great many other things? - Yes, they are manufactured to the weight of five hundred weight for clothiers.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray were you present when the person came to give the order? - I was present in my own house, and called out by the clerk of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Cheshire, or the stranger, the prisoner? - I took it of a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q.Which stranger you believe to be the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that press was afterwards took away by Cheshire? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. But you never saw the stranger, whoever he was, about that press after? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. When was the order given to you about this small press? - About the beginning of February.</p>
               <p>Q. To Cheshire. What did you do with the small press that you received in February? - It was the same size as this; the porter took it away after I put it together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was the one that your wife went home with? - It was.</p>

               <p>Q. What day? - I cannot tell, I believe about the 5th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. They came together, did they? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Be so good to tell us what past between them when they came to your house? - The young man, he that is dead, asked me if I had a room to let, and I told him yes; and he asked me if I had a garret, I told him yes, and he went up stairs to see it. The young man ran up stairs by himself as far as I know, he went up stairs and did not stay any longer than to go up and down; and I said, sir, will it do? he said he did not know, but he would call in a day or two and let me know. The young Mr. Idswell he called a day or two after, and asked me if I had a key to either of these garrets? - I said, I believed there was one in one of the doors. I advised him to have the biggest, because<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200072"/>it had two windows, but the young one said he would take the least, and he gave me half a guinea earnest.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they come and take possession of the place? - They never had their things in my house to my knowledge. On Shrove Tuesday he asked me, says he, what time shall you be up to-morrow. I said, I shall be up between six and seven; says he, I shall send in some things. The next day Mr. Jonas called at my house, about eleven o'clock, and asked me if I had seen either of his brothers; and I said no, and he went away, and in ten minutes he returned with the prisoner at the bar; then they rested at the school room door and spoke to each other, and I spoke to Mr. Idswell. I said to Mr. Idswell, your brother is a pretty gentleman. I thought he was to bring his tools in and come to work; says he, Mrs. Smith, my brother he is under a little dilemma, he is arrested; then they went out together, and about eight o'clock the prisoner and Jonas called again, and I asked if they had seen their brother? they said, no, they were going to see him, and if they did not make haste, they should not see him before he was locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at the board before you. Did you ever see it before? - About six o'clock that day a man brought it down from the garret, and took it down into the school room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same day as Mr. Idswell was arrested? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen this before? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. It was no part of your property? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know that such an article was in your garret? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not there before Idswell took your garret? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was brought down into your school room, was it as it is now, or had it legs to it? - Then it had. The man put it in the wash house, and when Mr. Idswell came, I told him that a man had been to take a table out of the garret, and it was in the wash house, and he said there let it be, and I asked him what I was to do with the legs? there were two pieces of legs loose laying down; he said, I might have them for fire wood.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe they were in fact cut up for fire wood? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. The officer came to your house very soon after? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did they come to your house from Bow-street? - It was not ten minutes before they came; I don't know where they came from. I was had up to Bow-street, and I told them where that board was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Idswell drinking tea at your house? - The brother did.</p>
               <p>Q. Not this man? - I don't know that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come at the same time? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring any thing? - He brought a piece of iron in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew it to you? - I should not know it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give it you to feel the weight of it? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it look like? - It looked like the bit of a top of a wedge broke off, to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it look pretty weighty? - Not a great piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing that to be broke, what part of that would look like it? - I don't know that that is like it.</p>
               <p>Court. You see that board brought into your house. Did not you? - No, indeed I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How often were they in your house? - The deceased Mr. Idswell, was several times at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner there several times? - The prisoner was not there above<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200073"/>twice or three times. He was twice, that I know of, on that day that his brother was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you recollect a man of the name of Moses calling on him? - There was a man called but I don't know his name;(looks at him) I believe that is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was out of town part of the time? - I was out of town from Thursday morning till Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at Moses. - I really think he is the man, but he was not powdered nor dressed so when he was at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. To Moses.Is that the woman that you saw? - That is Smith's wife.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Smith. Did you ever see that iron part before? - No, never at my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You remonstrated with the Idswell that is dead, that he never came to work there? - No, it is the brother.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been for some years acquainted with the Messrs. Idswells? - About two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the proprietor of the house where they reside? - I have got the lease of the house, and I let it for one year, and they staid two in it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you lodge in it? - And I lodge there as a lodger likewise; I was landlord and lodger.</p>
               <p>Q.Be so good to look at a gentleman of the name of Moses; have you ever seen him there? - Yes, I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Used he to visit your tenants pretty often? - I have seen him often at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house used he to go to generally? - I never took notice where he went to; he might go into the kitchen, or parlour, but I never took notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the garret in the hands of the Idswells, or of you? - The Idswells.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that you did not know what was going forward there? - Not of late. Originally they gave me leave to keep some rabbits there, but they wished me to remove my things out; and since I have not seen what was in the garret; they kept it locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. You used to hear a thumping now and then? - That was not in the garret, it was in the next room to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Originally, when you had the use of the garret, the thumping was not in the garret, but in the next room to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.After they took possession of the garret, where did the thumping use to be then? - I did not hear it.</p>

            While you had the garret, there was a thumping in the next room to you? - There was. I said to my daughter, when I see blank paper go in, it is my opinion they are making stamps. It was like the turning of a printer's press,but not fast, one after another.</p>
               <p>Q. What rooms did you occupy? - I keep a room in the one pair of stairs, and one in the two pair.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You never heard any thumping in the garret? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If there had been the same thumping in the garret while you lived below, might it not be without your hearing of it? - It might very easily.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. This man has been in the gallery all the whole trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How dared you to continue in court? I move, my lord, that he be committed.</p>
               <p>Witness. As I was subpoenaed on both sides, I thought there would be no objection to me.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you communicate that you had been in the gallery during the trial? - I did not communicate it to any.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to stop, that you might not be examined? - Nobody desired me to stop.</p>
               <p>The witness was ordered out of court, while the propriety and legality of examining him was argued by the counsel on both sides. Mr. Garrow concluded, that he should not examine him, but begged he might be called in, and committed to Newgate. The witness was accordingly called in.</p>
               <p>Court. Where have you been during this trial? - I was up in the gallery.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you come in? - When they were calling over the jury.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard what the witnesses have said? - I did not give any attention to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear me say, that no man should be examined that remained in court? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you? - I am a shoe-maker; keep a shop in Bartholomew-lane, near the Bank. I did not understand it; I never was in court to give evidence in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the prisoner to know that you was in court? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you dare to remain in court? the only way to prevent this in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200075"/>future is, to commit you to Newgate tonight? - Indeed, I was ignorant of it; I never was in a court on evidence before; I hope your lordship will take it into consideration, not to send me to any place to confine me.

               <p>Q. You have had frequent occasions to see them write? - Not so well this; but the other I knew very well; he has been a client of mine; I have done several things for him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow desired the short-hand writer to be particular; asked him if he saw him sworn? and as he could not say he saw the witness sworn, he was now sworn again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Isaacs. You have been acquainted with the deceased Idswell from his infancy? - I knew them both.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with this prisoner? - I knew them both from the same time.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you had an opportunity of seeing this prisoner write? - Never in my life, excepting once, about four or five years ago; that was in his putting his signature to an affidavit to arrest upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good to take this bill of fifty-five pounds into your hands, and attend to my question. I don't ask you to swear positively. On the oath you have taken, whose do you believe that hand writing in the body of the bill to be? - I cannot believe to it; I do not believe it to be Solomon's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.On the oath you have taken, whose hand-writing do you believe the body of that bill to be? - I am positively at a loss what to say. I do not believe that to be the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you believe it is not? - Attend a little, have you, besides seeing him write his name once, have you seen writing which you have known of him to be his? - Never in my life. I have had some writing, but I did not know they were him. I was concerned for a bunch-backed man in the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know from this man whether these papers that related to this bunch-backed man were his writing or not? - I never see him.</p>

             whether the paper was his handwriting or not? Do you mean to say, that looking at that, you cannot form any belief whether it is his hand-writing or not?</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I object to that question.</p>
               <p>Witness. I have known both the Idswells; I was in the habits of using the coffee-house where they used every night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then you choose to say, that you have no knowledge of his hand-writing, and can form no belief of it? - I cannot; I only see him write once, Solomon Idswell.</p>
               <p>Q.Be so good to look at that, and tell me whether that is the hand-writing of the deceased Idswell Idswell? - That is the deceased's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.You have no doubt about that, I dare say? - No, that is his hand writing. When Mr. Escott shewed me these two papers, both men were living at the time, therefore I said that I knew Idswell's hand-writing, and this is it. This is a month or six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q.(Another paper shewn him) Now, tell me whose hand writing the body of that is? - Idswell Idswell's; I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at it; have you any doubt about it? - Very little; I have no doubt about it; but it is a very great thing to swear to a man's hand-writing.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Moses? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I lately was clerk to the New Prison, Cold Bath-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the prison to which Moses was sent? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Moses when he underwent his examination at Bow-street? - I took Moses up once to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that when he was examined there? - I took him up on another circumstance, not on the subject of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Moses say any thing respecting giving evidence on this occasion? - Moses was in my apartment when I was clerk. When the prisoner at the bar was committed to our prison, I made a tender under the circumstances to the governor, Mr. Ayris, that he should have my room, that he should sleep in my bed chamber; and I would sleep in my sitting room.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you still in the gaol? - No, I am not; I left it about three weeks. I have the misfortune to be in the king's bench for debt. I am brought up now by Habeas Corpus.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What conversation had you with Moses, on the subject of this case? - There was hardly a day ever past that Moses was not continually speaking to me about his situation as an evidence; always continually. I dare say if we talked of it once, we talked of it two hundred times.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - He expressed a deal of sorrow that the two brothers were likely to lose their lives by the situation in which he was placed, but he must do the best for himself, and for the sake of his family. He said that he had lived in intimacy with the two brothers for years, and that they had always behaved as men to him, and that they were on strict terms of friendship.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing that you can recollect at any time? - I don't recollect that he ever said any thing else than wishing they might get through their difficulty both of them; and when the other brother was shot, he was agitated for several days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Moses had a copy of his examination at any time? - Yes, I have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how he came by it? - I took the case by a messenger that came from the Stamp office; I took it to Mr. Ayris, the governor. He often wished to have a copy, and I asked Lavender for it at first, and Lavender said it would come from the Stamp office.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200078"/>Q. Did you ever hear any person say any thing to Moses respecting his examination? - I don't recollect any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You can tell us of some very handsome offer that was made to Mr. Moses on this subject? - I never heard one in my life, never heard directly or indirectly.</p>
               <p>Q. You are discharged from your situation now? - No, I resigned; I wrote two letters to that purpose.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses with whom he had dealt, who spoke of him as always paying them for what he had, and that he was a general trader.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing that passed between you and your mistress, whether she expected him? - Yes; she wondered to me why he did not come; she had wrote several letters to him. When he came he knocked at the door, and I let him in; he asked me if Mrs. Phipoe was at home? and I told him yes, and I asked him in, and shut to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she expect him that night? - No, I don't know that night particularly that she did expect him. After I had put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200079"/>to the door and let him in, I went into the back parlour; I shewed him in the hall, while I went to my mistress; she was in the back parlour, I went to my mistress and told her that Mr. Courtoy was come, and would be glad to speak to her. My mistress then said, Mr. Courtoy! tell him I am very ill up stairs, and that I have got a fire in my room. and as soon as I have got my night cap on, I will come down stairs to him. So I immediately went and told Mr. Courtoy that my mistress was very ill up stairs, and as soon as she had got her night cap on she would come down to him. He was in the front parlour then, and he said, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did Mr. Courtoy go to? - He went into the front parlour; which my mistress went up stairs and down two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What before she went to him? - Yes; and after she had gone up stairs and down two or three times she went into the parlour to Mr. Courtoy, and says, O, you are come; he says, yes, I am come to settle the business; mistress replied, very well, would he come up stairs, for she had got a fire in her room, she was very ill; which the gentleman replied could not the business be settled here? mistress replied no; could not he come up stairs, was he afraid? Mr. Courtoy said, no, he was not afraid. My mistress went up stairs then, and Mr. Courtoy followed her, and I followed with the candle. My mistress went up into the two pair of stairs front room, Mr. Courtoy followed after, and I with the candle. As soon as we had got into the front room in the two pair of stairs, my mistress seized hold of the gentleman's collar, as soon as mistress had hold of the gentleman's collar, she said to me, Mary, take hold of his back; which I did take hold of his back; and mistress and me pushed him into a two arm chair; which the gentleman called out for mercy; the gentleman says, have mercy. Theresa; my mistress replied, do you think a lady like me will be served so, by such an old rogue as you; which down by the side of the two arm chair there lay two pieces of cord.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the chair from the fire? - It was not a great way off; about the middle of the room With the two pieces of cord there lay a broad blue ribbon. My mistress put down his right hand to the arm of the chair, endeavouring to tie it down with the broad blue ribbon; which the gentleman resisted, he said he would do any thing that he could, but he would not be tied; he said, he would do what she desired him, if she would not tie him. Mr. Courtoy then got his right knee into the two arm chair, and with his left endeavoured to hold mistress off. My mistress had got a carving knife in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she get that? - From the table; there was another laid with it, it was a common size one, two of them we have in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else lay on the table besides this caraing knife? - Yes; the table was covered with black silk all over it; on the table were two brass candlesticks covered with black silk; there were two pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they were loaded or not? - No, I do not know. There was a wine glass had got some gunpowder in it, and on it some balls; that was all that laid on the table.</p>
               <p>Q.How were the knives, were they in their usual state? - No, they had black silk about the handles, both of them.</p>
               <p>Q.The gentleman still continued in the same posture with his right knee in the chair? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.For how long? - I cannot tell how long; but he was endeavouring to hold mistress off at his full length; at the same time my mistress held him by the collar, and had the carving knife in her hand;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200080"/>my mistress was talking very much to him, and calling him a great many old rogues.</p>
               <p>Q.What did she say to him? - I don't know; but she was threatening him very much, and talked a language I did not understand, French, or some such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Conrtey reply in English, or in any other language? - No, in French, the same as my mistress. After that mistress was continuing the same language and Mr. Courtoy; I still had hold of the gentleman's back at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue in this posture? - I don't know exactly how long. After some time being in that way, mistress says, now I will tell you in English, it is not sit this girl should know what we are going to do, so she shall be sent out of the room; Courtoy replied, yes, yes; then I was sent out of the room, and left my mistress in the same posture as usual. After I had been down stairs about the value of a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, I don't rightly know which, my mistress then knocked with her foot; I was then in the kitchen, which the gentleman that was drinking coffee with my mistress in she back parlour, Mr. Caddle.</p>
               <p>Court. Had there been a gentleman drinking coffee with your mistress that afternoon? - Yes; he came there about four o'clock that afternoon. That gentleman heard my mistress knock with her foot, I being in the kitchen, he calls out, Mary, your mistress wants you; on which I came up stairs and went into the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistress was not there? - No, she was up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the back parlour? - Mr. Caddle. And I asked had for the candle, to be so good to lend me the candle, as my mistress had got mine; which the gentleman replied, yes, you may take it; or, by all means, or some such words. I went up stairs to my mistress; I found my mistress in the same posture as when I left oher, with the carving knife in her hand; Mr. Courtoy was in the same posture; my mistress said, is that gentleman still in the back parlour? - and I said, yes, ma'am; my mistress bid me desire him to walk up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire him? - Yes; by my mistress's order. After my mistress had bid me, I went out of the room where my mistress and Courtoy was, then I went down stairs into the back parlour, and I went to Mr. Caddle; and I told him that my mistress would be glad to speak to him; and he replied, very well; and went up stairs directly; and after he had been there sometime, he came down; he went up stairs by himself. After he had come down again, my mistress still remained with Mr. Courtoy, and I was in the kitchen, and the gentleman came down, and went into the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the back parlour? - As soon as you come into the house there is the front parlour, and then the back parlour. After Caddle had come down stairs, my mistress remained a quarter of an hour up stairs, and Mr. Courtoy too; and after a quarter of an hour or twenty mimy mistress knocked again with her foot very loud, which I heard in the kitchen; I went up stairs to her, and when I got into the two pair of stairs front room, she asked me if Mr. Caddle was staid in the house, in the back parlour? which I told her yes. My mistress was still in the same posture, with the knife in her hand; and Mr. Courtoy was still in the same posture as when I left him; she desired me to tell Mr. Caddle to come up stairs, she wanted him. I went down stairs and went into the back parlour to Mr. Caddle, and told him my mistress wanted him; which he replied, very well; and went up stairs directly. After a little time he came down, in the value of ten minutes or a quarter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200081"/>of an hour, and staid down for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, it was not a great while. My mistress knocked her foot again, and I went up stairs, after I had got up the two pair of stairs I see the gentleman, Mr. Courtoy, sitting down in the two arm chair, with a table drawn before him, and writing on the table; my mistress gave me a pen, (she was still by the side of the table, with the knife still in her hand) she gave me a pen, and desired me to take it to Mr. Caddle that was in the back parlour; I took it down to Mr. Caddle, because my mistress said it wanted mending, and Mr. Caddle mended it; then my mistress knocked with her foot, and I took up the the pen and left it with my mistress and Mr. Courtoy both together.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Mr. Courtoy was sitting at the table, what was there on the table? - There was a pen, ink, and paper. I left the pen with my mistress and went down stairs again, and went into the kitchen then. After I went down stairs my mistress knocked again; after she had knocked, I went up stairs to her, and still found the gentleman writing, and she standing at the table; mistress had then got the carving knife in her hand, and which was covered with black silk; when I went into the room, she says, this man has spelt something wrong; which my mistress gave it to me, and desired me to take it down to Mr. Caddle.</p>
               <p>Q. What size paper was it? - A small piece of paper. (The bill shewn her) That is the piece I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read writing? - Yes, I can a little.(Reads.)</p>

               <p>Q. You say that is the piece of paper. Did you look at it or no at the time? - I did; I looked at it to see which was spelt wrong of it; and I took it down to Mr. Caddle; he went into the back parlour, and he said it was spelt wrong, and he would copy it out how it was to be spelt; which he pulled out a pen and ink that he had got in his pocket, and after he had pulled it out, he wrote down on a piece of paper, and desired me to take it up stairs; which I took it up stairs to my mistress; my mistress looked at it and said, that would not do, she would have a fresh stamp; the gentleman that was sitting down in the two arm chair said, he could make that do; when he said he could make that do, I went down stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. What did your mistress say? - She did not say any thing. I went down stairs and stopped for some time down stairs; after about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour, mistress knocked with her foot again, she knocked so loud that I heard her while I was in the kitchen, when I heard her I went up stairs again; mistress asked me if Mr. Caddle was still in the back parlour? which I told her, yes; and she bid me tell him she wanted him; which I went down stairs, and told Mr. Caddle my mistress wanted him up stairs; which Mr. Caddle went up stairs directly; then he stopped up stairs a considerable time. I don't know rightly how long it was, he went into the room by himself. After he had been up stairs for a good while, then mistress knocked with her foot again; when mistress knocked with her foot, I went up stairs, and see the gentleman, Mr. Courtoy, in the two arm chair, sitting holding the pocket handkerchief to his fingers and his pocket handkerchief was very much bloody; my mistress desired me to go down stairs into the kitchen to the dresser drawers, and bring out a bit of white linen rag; she told me that Mr. Courtoy had cut his fingers and wanted a bit of rag to put about them. I went down stairs, and out of the dresser drawer in the front kitchen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200082"/>I brought up a bit of white linen rag; I took it up stairs, and put it down on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. For Mr. Courtoy? - Yes; Mr. Courtoy was still in the two arm chair, and when I was there mistress gave me the key of the cellar, that she had, the wine cellar, and desired me to bring up a bottle of sherry; (Caddle was up stairs in the room with my mistress) I went down stairs, and went to the cellar, and brought up a bottle of red sherry, my mistress called it; and the cork screw, and two wine glasses; the bottle of wine Mr. Caddle took out of my hand, and he took the cork screw and pulled out the cork; I put down the two wine glasses on the table; my mistress took the bottle and and poured out the two glasses of wine; after she had poured out two glasses of wine, she offered Mr. Courtoy one to drink; Mr. Courtoy refused to drink it; my mistress said, do you think I want to poison you? no, I will drink one before you; I heard my mistress say she would drink one before him; I went down stairs, and they continued for some time, and after a while Mr. Courtoy came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards? - I don't know; not long first. My mistress followed after, and Caddle after; which my mistress had the two pistols in her hand when she came down stairs; my mistress and Mr. Caddle went into the back parlour, the same parlour where they had been drinking coffee; after they had got into the back parlour, Mr. Courtoy went into the front parlour, and when he got into the front parlour he took out his hat, and went out of the front parlour into the hall, and then went out of the door, when I got to the door with him, he said, good night, and God Bless you, and then shutting the door after him I came in, and went down stairs in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was that Courtoy left the house? - Past eleven o'clock. When I went down stairs my mistress and Mr. Caddle were still in the back parlour; after they had been there some time my mistress rung the back parlour bell; I went up stairs to mistress, and went into the back parlour to her; my mistress gave me a key of a bureau, that she had got up stairs, and desired me to go up stairs and fetch down the green pistol cases; she told me that Mr. Caddle was going to take the pistols home; I went up stairs, and in the first floor, back room, in the bureau, there I found the green pistol cases; I brought them down to my mistress. she was in the back parlour, still with the gentleman; when I got into the back parlour with the green pistol cases; mistress had got one pistol in her hand, the other was laying on the chimney piece; I put down the green pistol cases, and my mistress took them up; then I went down stairs into the kitchen again; then I left Mr. Caddle and mistress still in the back parlour together; about twelve o'clock Mr. Caddle went out, I heard mistress let him out; then after mistress had let Mr. Caddle out, I heard mistress go up stairs; when she went up stairs she brought down the two knives, and the black silk she took off the handles of them, and put them in a cupboard that there is in the front kitchen; after she had done she went up stairs, after she had been up stairs some little time, she came down stairs again, and went into the back parlour, and after being in the back parlour some time, she rung the bell for me to come up stairs, and I heard the bell ring. I went up stairs to my mistress; my mistress desired me to go up stairs, and go into her bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you usually sleep with your mistress? - No, I never slept with her before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200083"/>Q. You slept with her that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe your mistress's gown? - She had not got a gown on, she had got one of these dark wrappers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observations on it? Did you see any thing on it? - I did not, I did on the blue sash that she had on, I see some sprinkles of blood; my mistress ordered me to go up stairs, I went up staris to bed, my mistress came too, we went to bed, and my mistress never said any thing more that night about the affair; the next morning I got up and got breakfast ready, and mistress came down to breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before your mistress was taken up after that? - After I got breakfast ready mistress came down to breakfast; after she had got her breakfast I went up stairs to make her bed; my mistress came up stairs while I was making the bed; she cut off a piece of cloth, which was on the two arm chair, that Mr. Courtoy had set in the night before; after she had cut off the piece of cloth, she was going about the room, and she said, make haste, Mary, and fetch the hair dresser, make haste, for I am going to town on some particular business; I made haste and went to fetch the hair dresser; she got herself cleaned, with a white dress on; after she got herself dressed, she desired me to go and fetch a coach, I went and fetched the coach, and brought it to the door, as she bid me; when she got into the coach, she desired me to tell the coachman to drive to No. 9, Mary-le-bone-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who lives there? - Mr. Caddle, who was drinking coffee with my mistress. The coachman drove away, and at about twelve o'clock my mistress came back again in the coach, and after she came in she went up stairs, and she went up stairs and took off her white dress that she had on; and after she had taken off the white dress, there came in a gentleman, who, my mistress told me, was the king's hair dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before your mistress was taken up? - After the king's hair dresser had been there a little bit. The gentlemen came about one o'clock, the officers from Bow-street, and took my mistress and me up.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know the sash? - Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the cloth after it was cut from the chair? - I see it down stairs in the back parlour; my mistress had took it there I believe. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing was done to it there? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the gown that your mistress wore in the evening of the next day? - No, I did not; It was not a gown, it was a wrapper. (The note read by the clerk of the court.)</p>

               <p>Q. You are the officer of Bow-street? - Yes, I am. On Wednesday the 15th of April last, about one o'clock, I got to the house of the prisoner at the bar, No. 5, Han's-place. I knocked at the door. A young man came to the door. I asked if Miss Phipoe was at home? he said, no. In the mean time I was talking to him, in the passage, Miss Phipoe came up in the passage, the prisoner, in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200084"/>mean time Mr. Courtoy, Carpmeal, and another officer came to the door. She ran down the kitchen stairs, shut herself into the back kitchen, I left Carpmeal and Mr. Courtoy in the passage with the young man, while I went down stairs after her. I found the back kitchen door fast; I forced it open, and there was the prisoner. With, that, I put my arm round her waist, in order to take her up stairs before me. We got about half way up the kitchen stairs, and she began to struggle very much with me, and at the same time had her left hand in at her pocket-hole. Carpmeal hearing the scuffle, came to the top of the stairs, and laid hold of her right hand; with that, with some difficulty, we got her into the parlour, and then set her in a chair. She kept her left hand very fast under her clothes, through her pocket-hole. I kept hold of her left arm. By two or three times forcing it, I got it out from under her clothes, with this pocket book in it, which contained the note. After I had taken this pocket book out of her left hand, which she had clinched in her hand, she said, there was a note in it. We made a further search about the house, in order to find the pistols that were mentioned, and the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the note? - The note was in the pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the note? - (a note shewn him) it is, my name is on the back of it. We searched the upper part of the house. I did not find any thing there, but some letters, and a bond. This letter was in a drawer in one of these rooms. I think in the back room one pair of stairs; that was all I found up stairs. The prisoner at the bar went down along with me into the front kitchen, and in searching in the closet of the front kitchen, there were a quantity of knives and forks and there were two in cases. I looked at them, and on this one I found some blood which I brought away that is all I know of it. We brought her and the servant girl away to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any part of any body's dress? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to apprehend any other persons indicted? - I went down to Chatham, after Mr. Caddle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Brown. How often had you seen Courtoy at your mistress's before? - Twice before this happened. He had been about a week before. My mistress denied that she was at home; but she was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see your mistress at any time when you see him there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(Shewn the knife) Was the knife that your mistress had in the evening like that? - It was like, but the handle was covered with black silk; we had two of these knives.</p>

I told her, it was not in my power, nor no body else would discount such a note as that, being two thousand pounds; after that, I read the note again, and I see it was dated about a fortnight back; and I told her, it would be better for her to keep that note, be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200086"/>cause a note like that would not be discounted.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Courtoy, the prosecutor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you, at any time before this conversation in this day, my conversation with her on the subject of Mr. Caurtoy? - She told me, about two months ago, that she was going to settle her affairs with Mr. Courtoy, and Mr. Courtoy was to make the note with her, at one, two, or three months. I told her, I was very glad that they were going to settle. And she wished for me to give the form of a note. I told her, I could not write it properly in English, but I would give her the form of it; but she did not tell me what sum. She asked me what sort of a stamp? I told her there was from sixpence to two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Courtoy's hand writing? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be his handwriting? - (The note shown him) Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. About two months before. she told you that she was about to settle her affairs with Courtoy, and that he was to give her notes at particular dates? - Yes, at one, two, or three months, and she would be very glad if I would give her the form of a note.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by that? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I object to that question.</p>

               <p>Mr. Shepherd now contended he might call Mr. Courtoy to prove other facts, though not to the question of the note. To which Mr. Fielding objected; which objection the court allowed.</p>

            . Is that your father's hand-writing? - I can swear, on my oath, it is not my father's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it like it? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding addressed the court, that in his opinion, the accomplice did not appear confirmed in a tittle of her evidence, therfore there was no case to go to the jury; on which account, he considered it to be unnecessary to ask her a single question in in the way of cross-examination. The court replied, the jury must be the judges, as they were to pass their belief on the evidence of the accomplice, and not him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Brown. You had lived with your mistress but five weeks before this happened? - Perhaps it may be two or three days above five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you had not lived with her. six-weeks? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mistress keep a good deal of company, or not? - No, not a great deal of company.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you leave her? - I went to prison, and my mistress too. I come from prison here.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen your mistress since you have been in prison? - No, I have not seen her since I came from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in separate prisons? - -Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen Mr. Courtey? - No, I have seen him only at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had some talk with him? - No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever come to you in prison? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nobody from him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you kept on the prison allowance? - No, the governor of the place gave me money whenever I asked for it; and Mrs. Phipoe sent me a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were taken up, and went to Bow-street, what did you think would become of you? - I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you afraid of any thing happening to you? - No, was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not conscious of doing any thing that was wrong? - No, I was not afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you had been there six-weeks; no further intimacy with your mistress than during that six weeks? - It was not quite six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q.I don't quarrel about a day, about five or six weeks, and not more. You let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200088"/>Mr. Courtoy in that day yourself? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You let him out, and he said, good night, God bless you? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now we have the first and the last; now, little girl, what candles were alight this night? - Two brass candlesticks, covered with black silk; the candles in them candlesticks were alight in my mistress's bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many more were alight? - The candle I followed up with my mistress up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. And down you came, I suppose you knew your way in the dark? - Yes, I could find my way down.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Crddle, had he any candle? - Yes, one.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in the kitchen, had you any candle? - No, I had none there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you had two journies up and down stairs from the knocking? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went into the room without any ceremony? - Yes; but the first time I did not hear the knocking.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you went up stairs backward and forward, you went in at pleasure, there was no interruption? - I went in when mistress ordered and came out again.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Courtoy went up stairs, and saw these two pistols, you did not know they were loaded? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The knife you say was covered with black silk? - Yes, two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you had seen this so, you came down, were not you frightened? - Yes, but when Mr. Courtoy came there before, Mrs. Phipoe had made very free with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was comical, but you was not very much frightened? - No, I was not much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. This black silk about the candlesticks, and about the knives, they all appeared very comical, but you were not very much firghtened at them. However, you never went out of doors to get any assistance, or ask any body to come in? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. All through this you was not at all alarmed, and when Courtoy went away at last, he said, God bless you, and you thought there was no harm? - Yes, I see him go away.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you went to bed and slept hearty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I want to know how you get out of this fcrape, recollect where you put the candle, and by what light it was that you contrived to read that note? - I took it in my hand and looked at it, and went down stairs. I could not read it as I was coming down stairs, because I had no candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry it to Mr. Caddle? - Yes, I did. I just gave a look at it as I went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read pretty well? - I am not much of a great scholar.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot write? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. But you can read a little? - I can make out a little bit, no great matters.</p>
               <p>Q. After all this was over that night, you and your mistress went to bed, and there was nothing more said about it? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you a great deal surprised the next day, when you were taken by these fellows to Bow-street? - Yes, very much surprised.</p>
               <p>Q. All that had passed you thought comical, but it did not strike you at all to be dangerous; you only went in and out of the room where Mr. Courtoy and Mrs. Phipoe were, you went in once, and she sent you down for a pen, and she sent you down for another thing, and you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200089"/>say Mr. Courtoy sitting by the table writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the paper, pen, and ink, provided by you? - They were on the table when I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never staid for any length of time to see what they were doing? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And they spoke French together the greatest part of the time? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a sort of thing that you did not understand? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, it is a very odd thing that there should be a little English in this, as to sending the girl out of the room, because it was not sit for her to know what they were going to do? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see Courtoy when he cut his finger? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How they came cut you don't know? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Being cut, of course there must be a good deal of blood get over the towels and napkins, and things that were there, and Mrs. Phipoe, being near she must have some on her? - Yes, I see it on her sash.</p>
               <p>Q. But what was done by Mrs. Phipoe and Mr. Courtoy, you don't know? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor did you see what they were doing of, except as you described? - No, they were writing.</p>
               <p>Q. But what was before the writing, or after the writing, you don't know as to their behaviour? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you at any time, while Courtoy staid, see him with any thing by which he could cut himself? - No; nothing but a pen in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. But he made no complaint to you at all? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you hear him cry or mourn? - Yes, he called out for mercy several times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. But he made no complaint to you? - No, he said nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding addressed the court, that there was not evidence sufficient to go on a Jury, as this promissory note could not be the subject of a felony, it having not been proved to have ever been in the possession of Courtoy at any time; he was followed by Mr. Gardiner; but the Court over-ruled the objection.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you serve them any check? - No, another did. As they were going out, they stopped at a wooden horse, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200090"/>looked at some pocket handkerchiefs, and they said they could get as good handkerchiefs as that for ten-pence. The price of them were sixteen-pence, and they stopped there a long time. I was busy with another lady, and the lady after that nodded for me to take particular notice of them. I took particular notice of them; I never took my eyes off from them afterwards. A little time afterwards, I went to the bottom of the shop to take some goods to put in another place, and as I returned up the shop again, I missed something off from this horse, and I said, halloo! and I immediately pursued the prisoners. They were gone out of the shop, and I laid hold of

The handkerchiefs were pinned at the top, it was impossible to get them away, and they hung one from the other, from the top to the bottom of the horse. When they were both in the shop together again, Elizabeth Walker said, that she would swear that she see me bring the petticoat, and put it by her sister's side. The value of it is six shillings, the petticoat cost Mr. Gibson nine shillings, but it is rather out of condition.</p>

Then I asked the young man what the price of them were? and he looked across the counter, gave me no answer, and said, there is something gone.</p>

He went to the door, and I followed him. for I thought they had got nothing; when I came to the door I heard him ask Warner what she had got? and she said she had got nothing; she said, nothing; he said, you have got a a petticoat, and he turned her gown back, and under her apron there was a petticoat.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are there any other persons in the firm of that house except the three you have mentioned? - There are not.</p>

               <p>THOMAS PARROTT sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 13th of April, Sir Richard Glyn came up to the Mansion House, he desired me to come to his house, and take porter; and then I went to the inn, and took the waiter and master, and prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you find the prisoner? - In the coffee room of the Bell and Crown inn, in Holbon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You found the prisoner in this very place? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q.What time was it you got there? - I suppose it may be about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Halifax. What time was it the draft was presented? - Between the hours of two and three.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Guy-How long do you think it was after the note was delivered to the porter, before he returned with it in the custody of this man? - I think it was an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not more than an hour? - I don't think it was more. The prisoner at the bar seemed to think that he stopped.</p>
               <p>Q.I want to know the exact time that he was absent? - I cannot say more than I have done.</p>
               <p>Court. You had given this draft to your waiter and he gave it to the porter, and he was gone, and returned about the time you expected? - Yes, but I was in the coffee room; and the prisoner seemed uneasy about the porter staying; and I said, I dare say he would bring the money, it was a man that I could trust; and he said, bring me my bill, and I will call again for the change; and he was in the act of preparing to when the porter came in; he had paid his bill to the waiter,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200094"/>and just going out of doors, when the officer came.</p>
               <p>Q. To Parrott. You took them all to the Mansion House? - Yes. I wanted them all to get into a coach; I took the prisoner in a coach; the master and waiter desired to walk, and they did.</p>
               <p>- HURLOCK sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you are agent to Mr. Gepp, that lives at Chelmsford? - I am. I have been accustomed to his hand writing for three or four years, corresponding with him and his agent.</p>
               <p>Q.(The bill shewn him) Do you believe this to be Mr. Gepp's signature? - I do not.(Read by the clerk of the court.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Const to Halifax. You said that Mr. Gepp kept cash at your house many years? you know his hand writing? - Yes. There has been some mistakes in Mr. Gepp's account before, and that was the reason of its being found out.</p>
               <p>Q. To Guy. Look at that note, is that the same that you received of the prisoner? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Halifax. Was the balance, at the time this note was presented, in Mr. Gepp's favour or otherwise? - Taking the forged drafts out of the account it was in his favour.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you then, or have you since given him credit for these notes, which he says were improperly obtained? - I don't know that we have at all yet.</p>
               <p>Q.Then at that time, as the account stood in your book, the balance was against Mr. Gepp? - I know very little of the accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his accounts? - I have not seen it yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any person here that has seen it? - No, there is no clerk here but myself.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Halifax. Sir Richard Glyn is not the present proprietor? - He is dead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I now stand before you in a most awful and distressing situation, and have involved in my misery a dearly beloved wife, with five young children, by giving credit to a person, which I supposed an honest man On Monday, the 13th of April last, a person, who said his name was Birch, and lived at, or near Uxbridge, he bought goods at my shop, and asked me to change a banker's bill, I told him I had not cash enough to change it, but possibly might be able in the course of the day. This was in the morning; he then said he would leave it with me, and call for the change in the afternoon, but desired to have the goods, as he wanted to send them down into the country; and he consented to leave the draft, I had every reason to believe it was good, and therefore consented for him to take the goods. Having some business in Holborn, I went to the Bell and Crown there, and asked the landlord if he had any body to send into the city, to get cash for it. The man, after waiting a length of time returned, I found the man when he returned had been stopped, and consequently I was apprehended. I have always borne a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200095"/>good character, which can be testified by many respectable gentlemen of fortune; and others, which I believe, and expect are in court, and to whom I have the honour of being known for many years. I therefore, throw myself on the merciful goodness of the court, as my life has been hitherto unimpeached, humbly confiding that they will restore, a wretched and miserable individual, to his heart breaking wife and family.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to shew it the landlord? - Because he should see that I had such money in my pocket,</p>

               <p>Q.Either you suspected the prisoner, or you had a foreknowledge of what would happen? - No such a thing; I had no reason at all for shewing him. When I paid for the gin I shewed him the money in my hand.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened to you when you went to bed? - I took and put the money again into my pocket, and took hold of the pillow in my right hand, and laid my breeches under my pillow. In the morning I went to get up, and I found my breeches were moved from where I put them, part of them drawed out from under the pillow, and I searched my pockets, and I found my guines and some silver, as I thought, gone.

               <p>Q. Was it a guinea and twelve shil<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200096"/>lings? - No, it was not so much as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - I was not in liquor, I was sensible what I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many drams had you that day? - That I cannot tell, not many.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you guess at it? - Not many. I was steady. I know what I did, I was not out of my senses. I had been drinking great part of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you begin? - In the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was it you took this last dram? - Eleven almost at night. When I came down stairs, I told the landlord that I lost such and such money.</p>

               <p>Q. You are the landlord of this house? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place was Smith sober? - He was a little disguised, but he was very sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not dead drunk? - He was not. The man was drinking a little to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. But he was sensible to call for more gin at your house. Was the other man sober? - Yes, solid sober. I lighted them to bed, and I left one candle in the room for the half pint of gin with the other, and when I came up I handed them a glass of gin a piece, and drank one myself; Smith had got his breeches off, and he got into bed, and he pulls out his money, and turns over a guinea and some silver, which he had in his hand. He took all his money out of his pocket to pay me the half pint, one sixpence, and he put it all into his pocket again.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not offer it to you to keep for him at all? - Not at all. When they were both in the room, I see Smith take his breeches, and put them under the bolster and gets into bed himself; in three or four minutes Carter gets into bed likewise by the side of him, I staid to see them both in bed. Then I took the candle and wished them good night, and went to bed to my wife immediately. In the morning I got up at five, according as I do the year round; Smith got up and came down, having missed this guinea, and he was asking me if I know any thing about it; while he was asking me, the prisoner came down directly. I said to Carter, do you know any thing of Smith's guinea? and he says, no; and knowing myself there was no other person in the room, I could think nobody else had got the guine but Carter; accordingly Carter still denied. I thought the best way was to get the constable, and take charge of Carter, and take him before a magistrate. The constable came up, and we gave him charge, Smith and me together, and we persuaded him always to produce the money. We taxes him to Queen's-square, Westminster, and he was committed for prison, and after that he owned where the money was, that was after he got his mittimus to go to prison.</p>

I saw one of the prisoners at the bar (Davis) with a sack of coals on his back, some distance from the waggon. I was on horseback. I thought it was uncustomary to see them carry coals from the waggon, to stop in Whitechapel, when there was such an open street to draw up as Red Lion-street is. I stopped to see where he went to; I see him go up the second turning in Red Lion-street; the name of the street I hear is Buckle-street, I don't positively know. I then went forward into Whitechapel, and did not see the prisoner any more till I see him on the waggon, placing the empty sack on the waggon, under a coat that was in the waggon. I then stopped in Whitechapel, and see the waggon go on; they went on a considerable distance, and they stopped at a public house; the two men did with the waggon. They went into the house; they came out of the house, and drove on towards Whitechapel church; I see money pass between them, but what, I did not know. I then stopped at Mr. - , a cheesemonger, the corner of Osborne-street. I asked him to let me leave my horse there (I told him the circumstance) and I would follow the waggon, to see where it was going I followed the waggon till it went to a Mr. Burten wood, and embosser, in Mile-end New Town. I then stopped till I was certain they were going to his house, and I went in, and informed Mr. Burtenwood of it. After I had informed Mr. Burtenwood of it, I know no more of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say, at the time you observed this man, he was at some distance from the waggon? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem to be very circumstantial, and very exact; I ask you, how you know they were coals? - I see them at the top of the mouth of the sack, as big as my hat</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it for granted that the top of the sack was open? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not possible, that they may be a mixture of coals and cinders? - I will venture to swear, that what I saw were coals.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you get by coming forward on this occasion? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose name was on the cart? - Wright and Wolfe.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you know the prosecutor before? - No, nor the person where the coals were going to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Were you by at the time that these coals were delivered? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many sacks of coals were delivered to this gentleman's house? - I cannot swear that, to my own knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you? - An embosser, in Mile-end New Town. I work for Mr. Burtenwood and Mr. Yarrow. Mr. Burtenwood carries on trade for Mr. Yarrow; Mr. Burtenwood ordered me, the 8th of May, to go to the waggon, and look under a coat, and there I should find an empty sack. I jumped up into the waggon, and took the sack down. I said to the prisoners, for this sack there is an information against you; so I took the sack down, and kept it separate, while the rest of the sacks were shaking, and after it was shaked, I counted the red that were shook, which were four and thirty.</p>

            Independent of this one? - Yes. They were emptied in our yard, after the coals were emptied; I counted the sacks over three different times, to know how many there were. I asked the man for the note. He said, he had none; so my master came out, and he gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Court to Wright. Have you no other evidence? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury to Wright. Were they, or were they not measured by a coal meter? - They were not; they were what we call in the pool.</p>

               <p>Q.What is the name of the court? - Dean's court; I was coming out of Smock-alley, and going along Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Q.Who were the girls that dragged you into the court? - These two, and another; there were three of them. It was not quite day light.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the lamps lighted? - Yes. They dragged me while they got to the top of the court; and I said, I will not have any thing to do with you; I would rather give you sixpence or a shilling, than have any thing to do with you. I pulls a shilling out of my waistcoat pocket, and my watch, to see what o'clock it was, and one of them immediately snatched my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before you was dragged up the court, or after? - After.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you dragged up by force? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they carry you into any house? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the court a thoroughfare? - No, it was no thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you try to get away? - Yes, I did, but I could not. One snatched the shilling, and the other the watch. The biggest snatched the shilling,(Thompson,) and the least my watch,(Smith.)</p>
               <p>Q.Where was this shilling at the time? - In my hand. I told them, I would give them that, to have nothing to do with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the reason that you put the shilling in your hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this watch? - I had it just in my hand, out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do when these things were snatched away? - They gave me a push, to push me down, but I did not fall; I catched my arm against a door post.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after they took your watch? - After.</p>
               <p>Q. When they made their snatch of the shilling and watch, was it done in a moment, or did you make any resistance? - It was done in a moment.</p>
               <p>Q.There was no pulling for it? - No.</p>

            They were suddenly jerked out of your hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they hold of your person at the time they took your money and watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. But they laid hold of you when they dragged you up the court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did they get this money from you after they dragged you up the court? - Directly.</p>
               <p>Q.Had they loosed hold of you? - Yes, when I got the things out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they loosed hold of you? - Not five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, for five minutes, they had not their hands on you before they took your money? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after they had taken your watch and money? - They told me I might think myself well off that I did not get a black eye or two.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them? - I don't know, they were gone before I could look after them. I went out of the court, and could not find any thing of them, and I could not be easy, and I went in again directly, and I went up the court to the top. On my return I met three men and I durst not look at them; I thought I might get the worst of it, so I made the best way out of the court again, and I went into the court again, and I got hold of the girl that got my shilling and she flew into a place, and I got after her, and got hold of her, and brought her to the light. I thought it had been her that had got my watch. When I brought her to the light, I said, let me look at your face, and see whether it is you that has got my watch, or you that has got my shilling; and I said, O it is you that has got my shilling. Where is the person that has got my watch? Says she, I don't know; what I have got I mean to keep. I says, if you will but tell me where the girl is that has got the watch, I don't care. Says she, I don't know nothing of her. So I let her go, and came out of the court, and I went home to my lodging. I lodge in Cockhill, Bishopsgate. I got up the next morning, and there was a young man that lodges in the same room, that advised me what to do; and we went after the girls, and got them the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them the next day? - Not till night; I was in company with the officers. I had often seen them before; they were in the court in custody of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that they were the same girls? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you was robbed, were you near a lamp? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When the officers took them, were the girls searched? - Yes, the biggest, Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found on her? - No. The other girl was not searched. The watch they had found, and Mr. Bare and I went to a place, and there we got it.</p>
               <p>Q. The money has never been found, I suppose? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your watch? - I see it the Friday night that we took the girls up, about half after eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know your watch again? - Yes, I can tell the number, 39267, maker's name, Richards.</p>
               <p>Jury. In what position were you pushed up the court? - One got hold of my collar, on one side, and another on the other, and a third behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the girls before? - - I live close by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you visited them at their apartment, or only known them by sight? - Seeing them walking about.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever spoke to them, or had any intimacy with them? - Never in my life.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to the police, Whitechapel. The prosecutor came to me, in company with Mr. Bare, and said, that he had been robbed; and we went down to Gillams-court, and see the girls. We see the short one first (Smith) and afterwards the other, at a public house door, (Thompson.) I searched them both, and they had nothing concerning the robbery, only some duplicates of their own things.</p>

When I came into the town I went into a public house, and asked them if they could let me sleep there for three or four days till I got a place?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the Crown when you came into town? - No; afterwards I went to the public house, to ask for a lodging, and they could not let me have any, and I went up and down two or three streets, and I met an old woman, and I thought she could recommend me to a lodging that was creditable.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you robbed? - In Union-street, in a house where I went for a lodging; my things were in a trunk, and immediately as I went in they took my trunk out of my apron.</p>

            Who were the persons that did it? - Them two persons at the bar, I am very positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you permit them to take it? - No; I told them I would rather keep it myself, and they took it away by force. They kept me locked in the little parlour all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first room where you went in? - Yes. After they had taken my trunk, and gone about half an hour, they came to me again, and I had my red clock on, and they took my red cloak up, and asked me why I wore a red cloak? and I said, I did not care what I wore, so I had it honest; and they went away and came in again in about half an hour, and brought three gentlemen with them; and they asked me whether I was a country girl? and I told them yes; they chucked me under the chin, and said I was a pretty country girl. I was locked in all night; about seven o'clock in the evening they came to me again, and asked me whether I wanted any breakfast? I said I had trouble enough, I did not want any breakfast, and they went away, and locked me in, and by force I pulled it open, the parlour door, and I went to the other door, and the key was in, and whether it was locked or bolted I don't know, I got out and ran away, and I ran as far as St. James's Park, where I met an old woman, and desired her to shew me the way, and I went to dinner with her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go back for your trunk? - The next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that woman here? - No, she is not. The next day I went for my trunk; she went with me down to Union-street, walking down the street I looked up at the window, and I see the young girl up at the window, and I said, that is the young woman that took my trunk and clothes; it was the tallest one (Burrough's.)</p>
               <p>Q.Was that the window of the same house where your trunk and you had been? - Yes; I goes and knocks at the door, and the young woman (Burroughs) came to me; I asked her if she pleased to let me have my trunk and clothes? and she said she had not got them; and the landlady came and asked me to walk in, and I refused to go in; I went away from the house, and went to a public house; and asked them if they could tell me where a constable lived? and they recommended me, and I went to the office; I found the constable, and went back to the house.</p>

               <p>Q. And the constable searched the house where you found them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your things there? - No, there was no such thing in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. The trunk is not found, not the things since? - No. When the constable was in the parlour with me, there was a black beaver hat of theirs; and I held it up in the young woman's face, and I says to the young woman (the shortest) had not you this black beaver hat with white ribbons on, when you came to take my clothes? yes, she said, she had the constable took them in custody, and took them to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. When that conversation passed about the hat, was the tall one by? - Yes. The constable was forced to pay my expences, they took every thing I had, I had three and twenty shillings in the trunk, all in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the articles in the indictment in the trunk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this trunk locked at the time they took it from you? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they open it in your presence? - No, one took hold of one end, and the other of the other, and they were gone as much as half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever ask you for the key? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Then all the rest that you have said is as true as this, that you came to town on the 29th of April? How came you to tell my lord is was the 30th? - It was the 30th that I took the girls.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you was examined before the justice a day or two after you were robbed? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. The examination says it was the 27th. When did you leave your friends? - About sixteen or seventeen days before I came into town, I will not say to one day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I tell you before I go any further, that some friends of these poor unfortunate women, have been down to your own mother. Do you now swear positively that about sixteen or seventeen days before you came to town you left your mother at Dunstew, in Oxfordshire? - Yes, I left my mother and father.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you for sixteen or seventeen days before you got to town? - I sleeped at the lodging houses coming on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Dunstew from London? - It is eight miles from Woodstock.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you when you set off? - I had six and twenty shillings in silver when I set off, and two or three shillings in halfpence. I walked two days and had not a bit in my mouth, and only paid three pence for my lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any places that you came through? - I came through High Wycomb.</p>
               <p>Q. You went before the justice almost immediately as you came to town. Did not you say before the justice that you had one lodging at a chandler's shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know their names? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what town it was? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There are coaches and waggons go through Dunstew? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never attempted to get a list or saw a waggon on the road? - Yes; one day I rode in a butcher's cart for about five miles, and I did not pay them any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. The waggon or coach would have soon brought you to town? - I had no money. I thought perhaps I should be out of money before I got in place; and if I had come in the waggon or coach, I must have supped and done as they did.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no waggon or coach comes through Dunstew nor Woodstock? - Yes, there is Mr. Burridge's waggon that belongs to Woodstock; but no one comes through my town.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it the day after you was robbed that you went to the justice, or the day after that? - The next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you know the day of the week? - I came in on Wednesday, and I went on Thursday before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it could not be Monday that you was robbed? - No. I think it was Wednesday that I came in, about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are sure it was the day before you came to the justice. After you got out of this house, you met with a woman that was kind enough to give you a dinner and refreshment. How long did you stay at this woman's house? - After I had my dinner I staid along with her.</p>
               <p>Q. About what hour did you get your dinner? - About one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay with her after? - About an hour. I don't know the name of the woman; she is a music maker's wife, who lives in Carpenter's-street, near St. John's Church, Westminster; I should know the name if I was to hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. She was kind enough to go and find out these people that had robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This woman was with you when you found out these people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This music maker's wife was examined before the justice? - Yes, she was; she went with me to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she examined like you? - No, she was not examined like me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the justice that was the lady that went with you? - Yes; and the justice said he would advise the lady to go with me the next time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go home with that lady after you went before the justice? - Yes. I slept there that night, and the next day I went to my service.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come with you here? - No, I think she is out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to bring her with you? - The gentleman that was at the office told her she would be of no service.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go with you to the grand jury? - No, she went up the day before to the office, and they told her she had no occasion to attend.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, my girl, what time did you go to this house where these two women robbed you? - Between five and six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the town did you come to when you came into town? - I came in at Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was shewn the house. When you went into the house, did you see the two people directly? - One of them opened the door, and the other stood by, the little one opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you they took in lodgings? - A woman that was wheeling a wheel-barrow in the street with oranges. As soon as I got in, they locked the door on me, and then I went into a little parlour, on the right hand, with a small bed in.</p>
               <p>Q. In which room did they lock you in? - Not in the bed room.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200106"/>Q. Then the room you was locked into, looked into the street? - Yes, with yellow curtains to the windows, the sashes were all down; the curtains were fixed with things across, so that I could not open them without I had tore them. I thought if I tore the curtain, they would be the death of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you made no noise at all? - No. I thought at first when I came, they were not such girls as I found they were, till they took my red cloak up.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of girls did you think they were? - Girls of the town; because I know by the noise up stairs that there were several gentlemen in the house, and there were several more young women, but they did not make or meddle with me; I was not near them to speak to them; I only see them when I first went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you knock at the parlour door, or scream out? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was light, was it not? - Yes, it was very light when I first went in.</p>
               <p>Q. You could see the people pass in the street? - The curtains were drawn, and the windows were very dirty; there were two panes above that were open, the upper part of the window. I was not used to curtains nor to sash windows; the curtains were fixed along both of them; one curtain came from the top of the ceiling, and the other only half way of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could see over the other curtain? - The windows are very high.</p>
               <p>Jury. They are very high windows in Vine-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was the curtain so placed that you could see over the window? - I could see nothing but the houses facing.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you did not see these persons for half an hour; when they came in did you ask them to let you go? - The second time, when they came in they asked me whether I would have something to eat, whether I would have some wine? I told them I never drank any wine. They went to the glass beauset, and brought a wine bottle out, and said they should be with me presently again. The fourth time they came in, there came four gentlemen with them, with blue clothes turned up with red, and cockades, and one with a spangled waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell these gentlemen that they had taken your box - No, I never made any complaint at all. The gentlemen laughed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the gentlemen see them lock you in? - No, they did not; they went into the bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the four gentlemen go into the bed room with these two girls - Yes, for about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when these girls came in with the four gentlemen, did they lock the door then? - Yes; and the two young women went into the bed room with the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q.Then when these four gentlemen amused themselves with these two ladies, you might have got out? - No, they took the key out of the little parlour door. I was frightened to death.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the gentlemen say, it is very odd that you lock us all in? - No, they did not make any observation on that at all.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not say, pray, sir, why do these girls lock me in? - No; they frightened me to death.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cried very much? - I did, after they went out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave off crying while these gentlemen came into the room? - I had been crying so long I could not cry any longer.</p>
               <p>Q. And then the moment these gentlemen left the room, you began crying again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200107"/>Q. The time that these gentlemen came in, was it dark? - I think it was eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, was there a fire in the room? - There was a fire place, and coals on, but no fire in.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the gentlemen to see you? - The young women opened the door and made their obedience to the gentlemen, and asked them if they would please to walk in and the first man that came in, he said you are a country girl, are you? and I said, yes; and the other man in the spangled waistcoat chucked me under my chin, and said, I was a pretty country girl.</p>
               <p>Q. There were six persons went into this room, I thought you said it was only big enough to hold one person? - No, I said the bed was big enough only to hold one person.</p>
               <p>Q.How did they get out? - They returned through my parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any offer to go out when these people were going out? - No, the girls told me they should be back with me presently.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you crying when the girls came back again? - I had been crying while they were in the little room. I held my head down on the mahogany table when they came out.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the watchman go by? - Yes, I heard the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you was too frightened to sleep? - No, I laid my head down on the mahogany table, and slept about a quarter of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did these young women get up in the morning? - They came to me about seven o'clock, I don't think they had been to bed, there were no beds in the house but sofa's, when I went to search the house, I knew that.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they making a noise all night? - There was a very great noise one part of the night.</p>
               <p>Q.How were these people employing themselves; where were the gentlemen? - The gentlemen were with them I dare say, I heard them go up, but I never heard them come down. About seven o'clock they came to me, and asked me if I wanted any breakfast, and I told them I was in trouble enough, I wanted no breakfast, and they gave themselves a snatch out, and then I got up, and pulled the door open by force.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity to try whether you could open the door all the time you was confined? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got out, what time of the morning do you think it was? - Between seven and eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you speak to any body in the street? - No, only to a woman that had got tin kettles on her back with milk in.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from this house? - About three or four streets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any complaint as you went along? - No, not till I came to this woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you made your first complaint? - There is a little place where soldiers stand in with their horses. I was standing under, and this gentlewoman came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in any other room that night? - No, only that back parlour.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer at the police office, in Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Stockford. The music seller's wife was with you till you got to the justice, then she heard what you said about the hat, and yet the justice told her it was not necessary for to attend? - No, it was a gentleman at the office. The justice told her it was necessary.</p>
               <p>Kennedy. About the 29th or 28th of last month, I am not positive which; the prisoner came to the office, and described the way as she has related before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200108"/>that she was robbed; I and another officer went with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day of the week? - No, nor the day of the month for certain. We went with her by her directions to Union-street, just behind Middlesex Hospital, No. 46.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the music seller's wife with you? - Yes, I don't know her name. When I went to the door, the prosecutor went first, and pointed to this tall girl and said, that is one of the girls that took my box; that was Burroughs, she was at the door; the street door was open, we pointed to her then, I took them both in to custody, and searched all the house for the property. There was a black hat laying on a sofa with a broad white ribbon round it, she pointed to the little girl and said, she had on that hat when she robbed her of her trunk. The girl did not deny any thing about the hat, she said there were more black hats than one with white ribbons, or something of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainly, that that was the answer? - Why yes, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose any person had given a different account about this hat, would you venture to say that they had swore false? - Yes, I should rather think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not mean to swear positively? - No. We found none of the property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. These girls had two examinations? - I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day of the week that the first examination took place? - I think it was the 27th or 28th, But I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day of the week that they were fully committed? - I think it was on a Thursday.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the first examination the day the girls were taken up? - Yes; there were two examinations two or three days between each.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did any conversation pass between you and the prisoners in Union-street? - We asked where the property was, and they denied it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it for granted that you used your usual vigilance in searching every where that could lead to a discovery? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found trunk, articles, or duplicates that could lead to the least discovery? - Nothing at all; I found duplicates of their own property.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it is the corner house? - I think it is the very next house to the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a good many people passing by in an afternoon? - There are a good many people passing.</p>
               <p>Q. This window is quite close to the street? - There is only rails between the window and the pavement</p>
               <p>Prisoner Burroughs. On five o'clock on Tuesday evening, I was sitting in the parlour window, I see this woman and another as if looking for a place; and I went and opened the door, and she asked me if there were any more girls in the house? I said yes, and I asked what was the matter, and she said she had left a trunk the night before with somebody, and she wanted to speak to the same person; and I said if she left a trunk there she would undoubtedly have it, and I fetched the landlord to the door, and he said she had better come in. or else go and get a warrant, and have the house searched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Evans. I never see the woman before the Tuesday, and then my landlord told her to get the officer, and search the house, which she did. I never saw the woman before; she is a stranger to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you through the window, see the door of the back parlour open or shut? - I did not particularly look at the door; it is a common size room. The woman, the prosecutrix came the next morning, and complained she was robbed; I says, I believe you make a mistake in the house; says I, will you walk in? she says, no; says I, it is a very improper way to stand here, you had better go to Marlborough-street, and get a warrant to search the house.</p>

               <p>Q.Do you know any thing of the prisoner at the bar? - She lodged with me seven weeks before I went. I was a lodger myself with Mr. Jarvis, No. 11, Charlotte-street, Grosvenor-square.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the pay you for your lodging? - Yes, I had been in the house ten days before I saw that room unlocked in the two pair of stairs, the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked when you went into the house? - I believe not; but I did not go to see till I had been in the house several days.</p>
               <p>Before that day, you had not observed whether it was locked or unlocked? - Yes, before the tenth day I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the tenth day, did you observe it had been locked - Yes. It was then unlocked by a person, a friend of Mrs. Stents, who brought the key and unlocked the door; several ladies and gentlemen came to look at the house; it was to let. On the tenth day I went to the person that put me in the house, and told him I could not open the door. That person called on me the same day and came and opened the door; she came from him to me, and we opened the door with another key, then when we opened the door, we see the large trunk standing in the room, and a bundle laying in the chair, pinned up in a check apron; the person opened the bundle to shew me what was in it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stent. Her name was Helen, my mistress's sister's maid</p>
               <p>Q.What was in it? - Two silk gowns, two shifts lay at the top; I cannot pretend to say what more.</p>
               <p>Q.Were these the things that were stole? - They were part of them. The same week, on Thursday or Friday, I see the same two shifts.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you lock the door of the room after you had been in it? - No, I left it open; but I put the bundle in the wardrobe, which was not locked, in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you see the same shifts, where? - On the kitchen dresser, marked S. S. in red letters; the prisoner was out at that time, she came home in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that in the morning? - The same part of the day. In the afternoon she asked me if I had seen a couple of shifts lay there? I said, God bless me, yes; and I told her that I thought they were some of the same that were in the bundle up stairs, that I had put them in the ban box that stood just by. She stood a while, and said, they were marked with S I told her, yes, which made me think that they were some of the same that were in the bundle up stairs. She said no more to me nor I to her that time; she took them out of the band box, and went out of the house immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. You see her take them out of the band box? - I did. She came home at night. The Sunday after she went into Wales; after she was gone I missed the bundle; she came on Sunday and was to call back to bid me good by; in the afternoon; when she came, I taxed her with taking the shifts; she said she knew nothing of the bundle, she never see them, and she said, as to the shifts they were her own, she had a dozen of the same, and that the woman, Mrs. Pottle, knew where she had left her box; I told her I would swear to the shifts, that they were the very same that I had seen in the bundle, and that they were marked with red letters; she said, her's were marked with blue, that she had brought them with an intent to mend them. She went away to go into Wales; the night before that the taylor brought her home a new riding<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200113"/>habit, and the bill with it, and it was five guineas, but she paid the man four guineas and a half for it; she said, that was what she had agreed to give his master for it. On Sunday she set off, and I did not see her any more till we took her up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You had the curiosity to examine into this bundle on the 10th of January? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray when did you first become acquainted with the prisoner at the bar? -About a twelvemonth ago.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation of life were you in? - I was a lodger; I took in needle work. I believed I lodged in South Moulton-mews.</p>
               <p>Q. You know where the prisoner lived at that time; she lived at my Lord Kenggall's? - Yes, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you received largesses of her as she could afford? - She had nothing to give; what I had from her came from her sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you never had any thing from the prisoner herself? - I cannot recollect that really; I may have received small things that I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in such assluent circumstances that you cannot recollect a kindness that you received from a person almost a stranger to you? - I cannot say that I have received any thing of any kindness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, on your oath, that you cannot recollect? - I may have received something, but very small; I cannot say that I have received any.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed then as a single woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what apartment did the prisoner come to live in with you? - She asked me to let her come and live with me. I had a room to myself, rather small.</p>
               <p>Q. A room, I believe, that you paid three shillings a week for, in fact. Was the room furnished or unfurnished? - Unfurnished.</p>
               <p>Q. How many beds in the room? -One.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you support yourself? -At needle work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that was the only way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the prisoner first came and asked to lodge with you? - Yes, I am certain of it. I did say that I had engaged to pay three shillings a week, and that a young woman had promised to come with me into the room, and she did not come; then she asked me if I thought the bed was large enough for her to come?</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, that in consequence you was unable to pay the rent with ease? - I don't know but what I might, most likely I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I ask you, on your oath, did not you ask her to come and live with you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.You have a child, I believe, and that child, at this period, was in the small pox, and you desired the prisoner would come with you into that house, and take care of that child? - I asked her if she would go with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us, that these two shiftslay on the kitchen dresser, and when the prisoner returned, she asked for these shifts? - She did. I told her, I thought they belonged to the bundle up stairs. She said, if I wished to have any further proof of her word, she would let me look into her boxes.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray, do you know whether Mr. Hawkins had any intention of returning to that house, or not? - It was to be let when I first went into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell, whether it was in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200114"/>contemplation of Mr. Hawkins's mind to return to that house? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he ever return to it? -He did, after I came out.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SUGG sworn.</p>
               <p>I live opposite to the house where the robbery was committed, Mr. Hawkins's. I was then porter to Green and Constable. I saw the prisoner come out with the things, (I cannot say the day of the month) with two bundles, one under each arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what day of the week it was? - I do not. I see her go round the corner with them; I see no more of her that day; and I see her another day carry a bundle up the street, the other way, up towards Vigo-lane.</p>

               <p>I belong to Marlborough-street. On the 28th of January last, I had a search warrant, to search two boxes, in No. 11, Charles-street, Grosvenor-square, in the apartment of Mrs. Pottle. When I went there, there was only one box. I asked where the prisoner at the bar was? Mrs. Pottle told me she was gone to Wales, but she could not tell me in what place. I searched that one box, and found nothing in it, but only rubbish. I never heard more of the prisoner till the 28th of last month. When I heard she was servant to a lady in Gower-street; I took her from there to the office.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the lady's name? - Stimson. I searched her boxes there; I found nothing but only her own property; the prosecutrix was along with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have not any thing more to say, than that as soon as they accused me of the robbery, I came back to town; I told my prosecutrix before I went into the country, that if she was willing to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200115"/>search my box and disputed my word she might; she said she had no such opinion of me.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Kelly. When had you notice of the robbery? - On the 24th of January, from the footman that came to town.</p>
               <p>Sugg. I forgot to mention that one of the bundles that I see her take out of the house was in a check apron, and the other in a pillow case, as it appeared to me.</p>
               <p>Jury. How do you know it was in a pillow case? - I was right opposite to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This was publickly in noon day? - It was.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any character with her? - A very good character. On the 8th of May, Friday, yesterday fortnight, I got up in the morning towards seven o'clock, to open my shop; when I came down stairs, I found myself fastened into my back room; I could not get out. It is a room that leads from the stair case into the shop, I made a violent push against the door, at last the door flew open; when the door flew open I got admittance into the shop; my shop seemed in disorder, the shutters were half open and half shut. The bar that went across was taken from its place from the shutters; I found it in the middle of the shop. I also found the sash of my glass door taken down and placed about the middle of the shop. When I came to unlock the street door I found there was no key in the lock, but the key taken out of the lock some where else towards the window of the shop; I went up stairs to my wife and asked her if she had sent Mary out for any thing and my wife said, no. I went down into the street and inquired of my neighbours if they see my servant go out that morning? and I was informed that she had gone out; then I went to my wife and the went up stairs in the maid's bed chamoer, and the found all the things gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go up and see the things gone? - I did not. My wife did. My wife went down into her dining room and found there was thirteen shillings and sixpence lost out of a drawer; says she I am robbed. My wife went in search of her, and I went in search; I went and traced the prisoner and found her at the Golden Cross, Charing-cross. About the hour of one or two o'clock; I went into the inn belonging to the Golden Cross, there I found the property booked, going off by the Gosport stage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it booked? - I did not. I charged her with the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you keep her in custody? - Not till the officer got there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your property? - I did. I found it at the inn, in the warehouse, packed up in a box and bundle.</p>
               <p>Q.Were all the property mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200116"/>in this indictment in that box and bundle? - It was. The indictment contains all that was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that box and bundles delivered up to you? - Yes, it was, to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against the other prisoner Bryant? - We went and searched with the officer at Bryant's room. I have seen her come different times to my servant with a letter. I found them both together. I found Bryant in the cellar of the Golden Cross afterwards, with the prisoner in the tap room of the Golden Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have her detained too? -Yes, I did.</p>

             to the inn, with my neighbour; she screamed out the minute she saw me and told me that she had wronged me, and that the other prisoner that was with her was the insigation of it, I did not know that she had got the things at the time.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you made her any promise? - No. I was there before my husband; I was down in the cellar when the other prisoner came to set off Ann Batt; I see them in the cellar that they go to wait till the coach sets out. The other prisoner was not with her at first but she came in about three minutes after I came in. I asked Batt how she could think of going off in the morning so before I was up; she told me that she was very sorry that she ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing more when the other prisoner came in? - She said, she had been her ruin, and had persuaded, her to rob her master and mistress; and the other said, that she had never persuaded her to do any such thing. When I was going in pursuit of Ann Batt, I met the other prisoner before I found my servant, and I asked her, what she had done with my servant; that I was informed that they were both gone off together; Bryant told me, that I might go to Hell and seck her, for she had sent her to chapel; and she made many bitter reproaches at me; and she told me, I should never hear of the prisoner no more; and that she had got my property, and patted her pocket, and said, that she had the value of my property in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention what the property was? - No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that your property was at the Golden Cross? - I only missed a shewl, and thirteen shillings and sixpence, that is all that I knew of. I see the property booked at the inn in the name of Bryant. I see the property in my servant's bundle, and two boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both of these boxes taken to the watch-house? - Yes, both of them, and the bundle likewise.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose boxes were they? - My servant's own property; she bought one, and paid for it honesty, while she lived servant with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200117"/>Q. Had you seen both of the boxes in her room? - Both of them; I speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. I only want to know the fact. I dare say you speak the truth; one was a bonnet box? - The other box I see her buy it, and it was made out of some tea chests, covered with paper, figured paper, when she bought it, there was a bit of paper tore off at the bottom, so that we could see what it was made off, and I knew it by that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these the same boxes that you see at the warehouse? - Yes, they were the boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the same at the watch-house? - Yes, because I was with them all the time. There was nothing of mine in the bundle but two coloured aprons; they are valued sixpence. One box was tied, and the other was locked. They were opened in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are all the articles in the indictment these things that were in the two boxes and bundle? - Not in the two boxes; in one box there was nothing but her bonnet and bat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the locked box that your things were? - Yes, except the apron. I always found her very honest till she got acquainted with this other woman at the bar. I have intrusted her with money and property, and she was always an honest girl.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see the other woman in the house? - I had never seen her in the house. I had seen her at the place whrer we occupy our business, at the Change in Rosemary-lane, coming to my servant, bringing her repeatedly a dirty letter.</p>
               <p>Q. All the property that belonged to you was in Batt's box? - Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>I am a master baker, No. 13, Nightingale-lane, East Smithfield. On the 12th of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going along <placeName id="t17950520-37-crimeloc213">Leadenhall-street</placeName>

                        targets="t17950520-37-off210 t17950520-37-crimeloc213"/>, to a lottery office, to buy a sixteenth; going homewards, towards Aldgate Pump, just opposite Catharine Cree church, I observed two men run past me, with a single horse and cart, they were in the cart; after they past me twenty, or twenty-five yards, I observed them clap along side of a country cart, loaded with dung, and some boxes on the top of that dung; I see them get up and cut a box from the top of that cart; they got up on their legs, and they could reach it in their own cart; as soon as they had lifted the box over the wheel, they whipped it into their own cart, and made a stop with their own cart while the country cart went past them; as soon as there was room they whirled round to the left, and went back again; I perceived that, it struck me that it was a robbery, having never seen any thing of the kind before; then I popt my eye on them, to see which way they went, they turned down Billiter-lane; then I looked the other way, and see the countryman stop his horse, then I thought he was robbed of his box; I directly ran to the corner of Billiter-lane, to look after the men; they had just turned the corner, I see them turning down the street as fast as ever they could, driving down; thinks I, you shall not have that box, if I can hinder you now; I pursued them; it was coming on hazy weather, but I had a great coat on. When I got to the bottom of Billiter-lane, they had just turned the corner into Fenchurch-street; when I got to the corner I did not see them, with that I shoved into Mark-lane, thinking they must be that way; I see them again in the middle of Mark-lane, opposite Crutched-sryars; there I see them squeesed in among some carts and coaches, or something or another, I don't know what, I see them squeese in as far as they could there, and one man slid out of the cart, on the near side of the cart, as I was running; directly as I came up to the cart I laid hold of this box, and charged the man in the cart with the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q.What became of the man that got out of the cart? - I see him when I laid hold of the box, but laying hold of the box, and so many people gathering together, I could not challenge him afterwards; he got away; the other man, the prisoner, the first word he spoke to me was, d-mn you, and the box to, I know nothing of the box, nor what is in it; at that moment Mr. Maine, oilman, came out, and asked me what was the matter; it was just opposite his door; I desired him to send for an officer, I had nobody but myself; I told him that the man had committed a felony, and ought to be secured; he sent for an officer, and he was secured. There was a gentleman says to me, what is the master, sir? I told him; says he, have you nobody to send for the countryman, the driver of the cart? he went, and came back again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200120"/>in about ten or twelve minutes, and said, the countryman could not leave his cart, he had more boxes, and he was afraid of the others; I see him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You see two men in this cart; could you observe which was the man that cut the box? - I was not near enough for that; to the best of my recollection they were both on their legs.(The box produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. It is a pretty large box? - It is not a great weight I believe, there are all the things in it that were in it, it was opened before the Lord Mayor. This is the man that drove the cart.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever seen the other man? - I believe I have, but I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Can you take on yourself to be certain whether both were on their legs or not? - I can, they both took it; I was near enough to see they were both on their legs.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before to the best of your recollection? - I am certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Now another thing; the other man got away, and was nimble enough in getting off? - He stood before the house when I charged this man with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this man extremely drunk indeed? - He did not appear so to me, I don't think he was drunk, I dare say he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a Mr. Callow, who lives in Mark-lane, a dealer in meal? - Yes, I have dealt with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not repeatedly offered this man, that if he could ascertain who that person was in the cart, so far as you could contribute to it, he should have his liberty? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that offer made before the Lord Mayor when you attended? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Another thing; when the box was produced, was not the woman who claimed the property, asked if she knew the contents? - I believe she was.</p>
               <p>Q.Was she able or not, before the box was opened, to ascertain the contents? - Yes, she was sturried a good deal, and with some reluctance mentioned to my Lord Mayor what there was in the box.</p>
               <p>Court. The two men that were in this cart, were they sitting together at the front of the cart? - They were both sitting together.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you see them drive close to this country cart? - Yes, to the off side wheel.</p>
               <p>Q. And then they both stood up, and you don't know which was the hand that took it? - They both stood up to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>- SCOTT sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You drove the dung cart? - Yes; just by Aldgate Pump I was robbed of a box.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you receive that box from? - From Sparkes Moline. That is the box.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that box in your cart? - On Thursday, the 12th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you lose it? - By two men, that were driving a chair cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them take it? - No, I was on the near side of my horse.</p>
               <p>Q. And they took it on the off side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard it was lost afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boxes had you there then? - Four.</p>
               <p>Q. How many ought you to have? -Five; It was tied to the side of the ladder, with a string.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure as to the box? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Was he not a great deal flustered with liquor? - I believe he was a great deal more flustered with the charge than with the liquor; when I had him in custody he told me that he was going to buy some flour cheap in Mark-lane.</p>

               <p>I am a neighbour of Mr. Brookes. On the 2d of May, in the morning, about half after seven, I heard the cry of stop thief! I come to my own door, I see a woman; turn out of the gate of Mr. Brookes's house, about ten yards from my own house; the house shuts in with a gate.</p>
               <p>Q. How far may this gate be from the house? - I suppose it may be about half a dozen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, was she that woman? - Yes, she is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her person before? -Never, to my knowledge. I went out to my own door, and by then I got to the corner, where Mr. Brooke's lives, I see her drop the clothes on the ground, two coats, loose. She was going to run through a passage to get away into Hoxton-square, and she was stopped; I cannot say that I see her stopped, but I see the man bringing her back again from where he took her out of this passage.</p>

I cannot say any thing at all about the thief. I see the two coats about ten minutes before they were lost, before the outcry of thief was called, in my bed room where I slept. I have the first floor there, and I went into the other room to breakfast. I have nothing more to say then to swear to my property.</p>

               <p>Q.Was the house broke open? - No, the street door was open, and she went up stairs and unlocked the door, and took the property out. I was at work in the house; I heard an alarm of stop thief; I ran down stairs immediately to give my assistance. When I got down stairs the prisoner had got the property in the street, and she dropped the property. I did not see her drop it; the first thing I see, I see her running away when she had dropped the property, running from the house. I pursued her; she ran through a passage in Paul's-alley, which is a throughfare into Jewin street. I stopped her; but she had jumped over some railings.</p>
               <p>Q. You had her committed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the property that she dropped, picked up? - No, I did not see it picked up. I see it in Charlotte Pike's hands; she is not here; one was a great coat, and the other was a close bodied one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Charlotte Pike is not here? - No, she is not.</p>
               <p>Q.You told my lord that the prisoner went up stairs, and that she must have unlocked the door, you did not see her? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. I thought you did not know so much about the business as you supposed.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you kept the coats from that time to this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Price. Can you say that these are the coats that were dropped by the prisoner? - I believe them to be such.</p>
               <p>Q. To Headbury. Were those the coats that you saw at the woman's feet? - The top coat looks very much like the colour, and the other coat was a blue one, I believe them to be the same.</p>

               <p>Court to Brookes. Are those the coats that you saw in Mrs. Pike's hands? - I will swear they are the coats.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear to all the property that belongs to Mr. Catman? -Why I think I could, but these I am certainly able to swear to. My father is a taylor.</p>
               <p>Catman. They are my property; I paid for them both. I suppose I have wore them above half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. How many coats have you in your possession? - I suppose I have got six.</p>
               <p>Q. Any of the same colours? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any injury done to the house? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that you turned that lock? - I am perfectly sure that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that, when a person's life depends on it? - I will swear that I turned the key, and left it in the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You see this woman's life depends on the turn of a key? - That is more than I know. I will swear that I turned the key, and I left the key in the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always turn the key of that room? - Always.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it happened to you to forget it? - I don't know that it has upon my oath. I may have left the key, but however, I have locked it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always leave the key in when you lock the door? - Not always; but however, I did that morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where have you been this afternoon waiting? - Here, paying attendance.</p>
               <p>Q.Been over at the public house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Been over to the Rose? - Yes; but what does that signify my sentiments are always the same.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank nothing? - I don't say so.</p>
               <p>Q. How much have you drank in the course of this afternoon? - What is that material?</p>
               <p>Q. How much, just for the sake of curiosity? - Am I to answer all your impertinent questions?</p>
               <p>Q. I desire to have the question answered.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you been drinking or not? - I have been drinking.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How much have you been drinking? - I never stipulate, I think as you think, that it is strange nonsense.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, what liquor have you been drinking at the public house? -What have I been drinking; why sir, I have had some rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. How much? - What is that to you?</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been drinking freely, or have you not? - Rather too free, more that I ought to have done.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very indecent in you to be getting into liquor, when a woman's life is at stake.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave her a good character, said she was a lace maker, and came out of the west country.</p>

I secured the place and went up stairs again, and came down at my regular time as I always had done, and I made all the inquiry where I thought these bad people lived; and I got an information and I sent for a peace officer, and I gave him intelligence where I thought he could find such people, and he went and the watchman went with him, and they found halfpence; they sent for me and shewed me what they found.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were these halfpence loose or in crown papers? - In crown papers, five shillings in each paper.</p>

               <p>I had an information that Mr. Sole had been robbed. I went to that young woman's lodging, Mary Fitzgerald's, it was as near half past seven o'clock as possible, on Saturday the 18th, I found her, the boy, and two more men, I knew them to be thieves before, they were eating of boiled eggs. I told them I was come to make a search for something that had been lost. She told me I was very welcome, there was nothing there that she was afraid of; searching the bed, I found this parcel of halfpence between the blankets and the bed. The bed was in the same room, I told her that was what I came after. She told me to take it and keep it to myself. I made her answer again that would not do for Mr. Sole to lose his property in that manner. I immediately sent for Mr. Sole by the watchman, and while the watchman was gone, one of the men that were there said, why cannot you keep it for yourself? I told him I could not think of making a property of what I know another to be robbed of; says one of the other men, (not her) d-mn him, we will do Mr. Sole out and out. Mr. Sole came up into the room. I opened the bundle of halfpence, and asked him if he could swear to that property before the prisoners? he said he could, he picked out these three farthings which he said he could swear to; he said he knew it was all his property, though he would not pretend to swear to it all. I charged him to aid and assist me to take the prisoners; one of the men said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200127"/>d-mn your eyes, it shall not be six of you that shall take us.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that? - One man that is not taken, Ward his name is. Immediately Mr. Soles ran down stairs to get more assistance to take them, in the mean time they rushed by me, and insisted to go down stairs; all the men, that boy and all. I followed them, they got before, and got out of my sight. I followed on after them as fast as I could till more assistance came; this boy, the prisoner Parker, jumped into a river that parts from Turnmill street to Saffron hill, between them. A man who see him go down, said, he was under that bridge, I looked under the bridge; a man went down to this river or ditch; or whatever you call it, and assisted me to pull him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner? - It was. I pulled him out, and tied his hands behind him, and took him back to Mr. Sole's, and then I went back to the woman's lodgings, and took her afterwards; she made no resistance at all against me, she said that how she knew the boy to be innocent at that time, and then I took them to prison.</p>
               <p>Q.Now this room, whose room was it? - It was her room. I knew she lived in the court, but I did not know that that was the room before. She delivered up the key, and acknowledged it was her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any body lived with her there, whether it was the room of any one that was with her as well as her's? - I do not.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LARCHER Sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman of that district, coming round the hour of three. I saw Mr. Sole's shutters broke, which here is a piece of it, and I saw a pane of glass broke; and I immediately rung his bell to alarm him. After that Mr. Sole came down and struck a light, and I asked what he had lost? he said five pounds worth of halfpence, but after that he found two papers out of the five pounds, that they had not taken, which were four pounds ten shillings he lost, which he has sworn to.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is it from Fitzgerald's to to Sole's? - Not above a hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the constable? - I did. When I went up along with the constable, he told her that he came to make a search from information that he had got; he immediately turned down the bed clothes, and found the property of the prosecutor's underneath; he immediately sent me for Mr. Sole. Mr. Sole came, and thought of his opinion it was his property, by finding them three farthings particularly that he could swear to. After that Mr. Sole went for more assistance; because they d-mned and shugg-ed their eyes that six men should not take them. Immediately, while Mr. Sole was gone they flew out of the house, and ran down stairs, I catched hold of one by the collar, and one Ward that is not taken,

             a knife about half a foot long. I followed them along, with the constable, two or three alleys, till they got over the shore that goes up to Saffron-hill, there is a shore there that comes from Hampstead, runs quite down into Fleet Ditch, and so into the river, and there this lad jumped in out of the three, the other two made their escape by that time, there was assistance came, and ran after them two down Saffron-hill, they were not taken at all. I went back again after Mr. Brown, the constable, had taken that lad, and the woman was in the room; I brings her down to the party at Mr. Sole's house, that is all; I have told the truth.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot pretend to say any thing but to one halfpenny and farthing, the farthing I have had in my house between two and three years; it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200128"/>a bit of brass of some foreign coin, that I never see the like.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the bit of brass found? - I papered the halfpence the Wednesday night before. This was on Friday night that this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the brass farthing? - In one crown's worth of halfpence, as we always put three penny worth of farthings in five shillings worth of halfpence. The halfpenny is marked with an M. and a crown, I do not remember seeing it till the Wednesday night to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put that with any of the halfpence? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put the halfpence in a particular parcel to the farthing? - That I cannot say. The reason of my remarking the halfpenny was, there are many cutler's use my house, and they are used to stamp the halfpence, and seeing this halfpenny stamped in this way, I remarked it, because, I do not remember ever seeing one stamped so before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Parker. I got up about seven o'clock in the morning, I had no money, I went to pawn my coat to get some victuals, and coming by this here court, I met with this young woman at the bar, and I was always brought up in the parish, and I knew this young woman; and I asked her where a pawnbroker was open, to pawn my coat to get some victuals? she said they were not up yet, and she had something in a stone bottle, some peppermint, and I asked her to give me a drop, and she said, if I would come up stairs the would give me some. I had not been up there above a quarter of an hour before this gentleman came up, and they said that Mr. Sole's house was broke open, and robbed of some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fitzgerald. I was filling water at the end of the court; two young men came through the court that I had drank with before, and they asked me if I would have any thing to drink, I said I did not care, and I went up stairs with the water, and they followed me, and then I went down and fetched half a pint of peppermint, and I met this boy, Parker, at the top of the court; and he asked me to go and pawn his coat, and I said the pawnbrokers were not up. I said if he would go up stairs and wait a bit, the pawnbrokers would be open presently, and directly as I came up stairs, there was the constable in the room with the watchman; and they said they came to search my place, and I said he was very welcome; and he asked me if the bedstead turned up? I told him, no; and he searched on the bed, and there he found these halfpence; and he said, he supposed that was what he came to look for, for Mr. Sole's house had been broke open, and he had lost some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Parker. I have not a friend in the world.</p>
               <p>Court to Brown. When you went into Fitzgerald's room, who were the first people you see? - I met her coming down stairs. I found all the three men in the room up one pair of stairs. I told her I had come to search the room.</p>
               <p>Q. To Larober. Were you with Brown? - I was.</p>
               <p>Jury to Brown. Why did you suspect these persons in particular? - It was not me that suspected them particularly myself, but Mr. Sole that directed me, having derived some particular information.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inquire of them how they came by such a quantity of halfpence? - I asked them how they came by such a quantity of halfpence, which I thought belonged to Mr. Sole? - they told me to keep them myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they did not tell you how they came by them? - No.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Do you live in the neighbourhood of Mr. Hodges? - Yes. On Sunday morning, the 10th of May, I got up about four o'clock and looked through the window, and saw the prisoner at the bar, I live servant at one Mr. Dottle.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he live opposite to the house of the prosecutor, Mr. Hodges? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a very wide street? - Not very wide. I see the prisoner at the bar looking on the shutters of Mr. Hodges.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put the shutters to? - Yes, and he opened them, and then he walked off as far as Lamb's-passage.</p>
               <p>Q.How far is Lamb's-passage from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200130"/>your house, a hundred yards? - No, very near; he walked backwards and forwards several times; in a short time he returned again and opened the shutters, and looked in again, and he received a piece of iron from a person that appeared to be inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a man or a woman within, did you see? - I did not see the person that time, and he walked off and put the shutters to again, I looked and I see him return, and give a man a piece of iron at the end of Lamb's-passage, and they both walked down Lamb's-passage together. In a short time the person who received the piece of iron came back again, and walked past Mr. Whitbread's brewhouse, then the prisoner returned again in a short time; he came back and opened the shutters, and I see a man pitch two large bundles on the inside of the ledge of the window. The prisoner at the bar beckoned to a person to receive a piece of iron, and he received it from him, and the prisoner received one of the bundles, and then the person on the inside got out, and took the other, and the boy put the shutters to again, and they all three went down Lamb's-passage together, and I saw no more of them. I am perfectly sure the prisoner at the bar is the boy.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you know the lad before? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You was up two pair of stairs, and the window not open, of course you was looking down upon him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he a round hat on? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Q.This was in Chiswell street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any watchmen there? - They were not in the street then.</p>
               <p>Q. Any patrol? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you remember that before the magistrate a patrol appeared, and he was asked whether he could swear to the prisoner, and he could not? - The patrol was not there when I was there.</p>
               <p>Q.Chiswell-street is a pretty wide street, is it not? - Not very wide there.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not as wide as the Old Bailey? - Yes, I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q.What part of the street is it? - Close to the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not that as wide a part as any? - I don't think it is.</p>
               <p>Q. It was close to Whitbread's brew-house. There are a great many working all night long? - I don't know that, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out watch? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You immediately went before a magistrate the next morning? - No, not till the Friday after.</p>

               <p>Q. Prisoners that were charged with robbing Mr. Hodges's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not been to make any complaint to the justice before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any part of Mr. Whitbread's servants or family was up at this time? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body passing during all this time? - Nobody passing at all.</p>
               <p>Q.How long a time might it occupy from the time you looked out of this window, till the time you see them all go? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.During the quarter of the hour; did you see nobody passing? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean (now you know that this boy's life is in question) to say, that from a two pair of stairs, and looking down on the boy, you can swear to him? - Yes, he attracted my notice so much that I can swear to him.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol in Bunhill-row. The watch goes off at four o'clock in the morning. I was going off the night this robbery was committed; I went down Bunhill-row, across Chiswell-street; I stopped at the pump, to get a draft of water.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that pump from Mr. Hodges's house? - About twelve or fourteen doors. I see a man, after I drank the pump water, advance towards me, a tall man, and made a full stop, and walked back; which I thought very suspicious. He then immediately crossed over the way from where he was, to Grub-street, and stopped there to make water. I went slowly after him. He looked round at me. After he had done, he crossed over the way to me, and went down Bunhill-row and through Cherry-tree-alley, into Chiswell-street again. When he came into Chiswell street, he came up to a gentleman's door, as they told me had been robbed, and he rubbed with his finger against the door or the shutter, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from the man who was knocking at the door or the shutter, at that time? - About eight doors from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long a time were you in Chiswell-street? - I look upon it, till high on half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.How near were you ever to Mr. Hodges's house during that time? - I was within sight the whole time. I see a man come out of there, but that was another man that came out of there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a third man? - I never see a third man.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - About ten minutes after four when I first came up to the pump.</p>
               <p>Q. To Hoshaw. What time do you six it to be that which you saw? - A few minutes before four struck.</p>
               <p>Q. To Austin. Were either of these two you saw the prisoner at the bar? - No, that is not the person that I saw there. I was sent for by a police officer, to know whether I knew the two prisoners at the bar to be them that I saw in Chiswell-street that morning? - I told his lordship, that they were not the men that I saw that morning, that was one, the other I do not see here.</p>
               <p>Q. That being one that you saw at the police office, was he one of these men that you saw that night? - No. He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was ten minutes after four when these men walked up to you? - Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. You say one knocked at a door, or shutter? - Yes, and another came out about three minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you not to stop them? - When he came out from there, he had such a clean shirt, clean neckcloth, I thought the one had called the other up to go and take a walk out, it being so fine a morning.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did not you venture to speak to him? - Never spoke a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the state of the house? - Yes, I did, and I saw it was all fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any part of the house appear to be forced? - Not by me; I only looked with my naked eye at the door.</p>

               <p>I am a shoe-maker; my wife sells salop, and that time she laid-in in the City Hospital, in the City-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you sell salop? - Facing Chiswell street.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is that from where you sell salop to Mr. Hodges's house? - About sixty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing particular that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200132"/>caught your attention during that night? - I was out about a quarter before four, as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any men about that night? - Not to my knowledge. A person came to me, on Friday evening last, and asked me if any body was there that sold salop. He said, I must come to the magistrate's office in Worship street immediately; and after I was sworn, the justice asked me if I recollected any body that came up to my stall that morning in a brown coat, a tall man? I told him I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever see the prisoner at the bar in Chiswell-street that night? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you selling salop? - From a little before four till nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Lamb's-passage? How far may that be from you? - That may be about a hundred yards.</p>

I found nothing on her.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you detained her? - Yes; my servant found the gown,

I instantly said, yes, and she took the gown from me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go into the room and find him alone? - No, I was the next person that went into the room, I went in for my cloak, and he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the room by himself? - Yes, and he came to the bar, I see him through the bar window, by himself, Mr. Smith was gone out about some business, and I said to Mrs. Smith -</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your cloak? - Yes, I was going home, and I called at a pawnbroker's in Shoe-lane, and I found it at the pawnbroker's; I knew it by the lace, and two joinings in the hood, and it is my own making.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This little room where you went with Mr. Smith and his mother, opens into the tap room? - No, it opens into a little passage, close by the tap room.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the day? - The 16th of April, on Thursday; I believe it was about five o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner came into the room soon after; there were two or three people there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any cloak was missing of Mrs. Clarke's? - I had occasion to go out on a little business, when I came back I was informed that a cloak was lost; a person was going into the country from my house, I told her I would see her to the stage, and after that would go to as many pawnbrokers as I could; that evening, going down Shoe-lane, I went to Mr. Cottle, and found the cloak there; Mr. Clarke was with me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Who were these other persons who were in the tap room? Do you know their names? - I know each of their names, I have known them for some time, they have used my house.</p>
               <p>Q.And so had the prisoner? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not come in with these other persons? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your house is a house of a good deal of business? - We do a good deal of business.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a good many people in the tap room? - It is a time of day that we are rather slack of business; our business runs in the morning, middle of the day, and evening,</p>
               <p>Q. Probably not less than ten or twelve at that time? - I cannot say the number; in the course of the time the prisoner at the bar was in the house, there might be fifty people, but not to stop.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner came the next morning again? - No, I see the prisoner the same evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you inform him there had been a cloak lost? - I did. The day following likewise I see him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you then inform him again of a cloak being lost? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, though he knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200137"/>of a cloak being lost, attempt to make his escape? - No, he did not; I told him that I thought he was sober by this time, and spent all his money; he told me that he had not spent all his money, and particularly mentioned the cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. That he had not spent all the money that he had got for the cloak? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was examined before the justice, was not you? - Not till after he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. You were then on your oath. Did you ever mention any thing like this before the justice? - I was not asked any question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this then or not? - Yes, I perfectly knew it, for he insulted me when I went to him, he acknowledged he had spent the money he had got for the cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. He insulted you? - He made use of language that is not proper to mention in this court, nor any where else.</p>
               <p>Q. So you knew this before the justice, and never mentioned a word of it? - I considered it would be impertinent in me not to mention more than I was asked; the justice put many questions to me, and when I was on an argument, he said, it is not necessary for you to say any thing, but answer the questions I ask you. I I give you my word I forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. I should like some how or other, to know what he said to you, because we see how far your forgiveness goes. How did he abuse you, did he call you a thief? - No, he did not; when I went in, he says, Smith, how are you, my boy? you are a good natured fellow; I said Mr. Thomas, I am come about more serious business; he said -</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this? - This I think was the day following.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the day that he told you that he had not spent all the money for the cloak? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you took him up that day? - I will recollect myself if you please. He was taken up on Saturday, but I think he told me this on Friday. The prosecutor lives in the country. He was taken up at the Coach and Horses, in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the very place where you had seen him before, in the same place where he had made this confession to you as you would have us believe? - He certainly did.</p>

               <p>Q.When did he bring the cloak to you? - On the 16th, on Thursday night, between six and seven, I am not positive to a few minutes. The prisoner said, that he had a little money to raise, that he had a bill or execution to pay, and he had but an hour to pay it, and he was short, and he had taken his wife's cloak to raise the money with. I see the cloak, but I can say nothing about it, I was big with child.</p>

               <p>Q. Had it lace on it? - Yes. He said he could not go out of the place, because the people were after him, he wanted some person at my house to go to a pawn broker's with it, he asked me to go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This cloak was pawned as your cloak? - No, I suppose not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry it yourself? - No, my little girl.</p>

               <p>HUGH EVANS Sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Clipstone-street, No. 2; I keep a shop. On the 13th of May, I was serving a person in the shop, and I noticed the prisoner turning into my passage; knowing my yard was full of linen, I suspected he wanted to steal the linen. As soon as I had done serving the person, I stepped out of the parlour; there is a door that opens out of the parlour into the passage, and I opens this door, and I see the prisoner standing near to the top of the kitchen stairs; I asked him who he wanted? he told me that he wanted a person up stairs; that was all I could get out of him. I took hold of his collar and told him, I believe you are a thief; he had his right hand under his great coat; I perceived some bulk there, and I felt it, and found it was a quart pot; I looked out to see if I could see any of Mr. Llewyn's men about the door, he lives opposite me, and I see the boy, and I desired the boy to send his master over to me; and in the mean time, just before Mr. Llewyn came over, the prisoner stooped down and put the pot on the ground, and said that he had no pots. When Mr. Llewyn came over I told him that I catched that man stealing his pots, and I shewed Mr. Llewyn the pot that came out of his pocket; Mr. Llewyn took up the pot and said it was his property; Mr. Llewyn took the pot in one hand and him in the other, and led him out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the pot had been before this man came into the house? - Some of my lodgers, I suppose, had beer in it; I had not seen it till he pulled it out of his pocket. I thought he was going after my linen in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the back door open? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did not catch the pot on me; It was set down in the passage.</p>
               <p>Llewyn. After I had dragged him into the street, I took him twenty yards, and I felt something else come against my knee; and I said, you have more pots about you; and there were two more quarts and three pints on him at that time, none of them belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had no more pots about him? - Yes, he did say so before we took him out. After the neighbours came, and we took him into our own house, tied all the six pots together, and went to the public office; we marked our pots with different marks at the bottom, and he was committed from the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you serve Mr. Evans's lodgers with beer? - I serve some of them, and some of them I do not; I believe there is one in the house I do not serve.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I picked up these pots and put them in my pocket. I work for Mr. Cliff, in Swallow-street, he puts me in possession very often; he has attended these two days, but to day he has got an appraisement. I have a wife and six children; and I have been forced to be beholden to a friend to keep me since I have been in this predicament.</p>

On Friday night I packed up all my dirty linen, and laid them under the table; the next morning my husband went out to work and left the parlour door open, and at the same time the prisoner took the opportunity of coming into the parlour and taking the property out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did your husband get up in the morning? - At six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock did you get up? - About seven, I was all the time awake after him till I got up; and when I got up I went to open my little shop, and Ann Martin was sitting on the stairs at the time, and she took the opportunity of going and taking the things away. In about half an hour after I went for an apron that was in the bundle, and missed the goods and her; and I had a suspicion that she had committed the robbery. I looked after my property, and I met her five weeks after, with my cap and handkerchief on her; I met her in a public house, a good way down Drury lane; I charged her with the watch, and accordingly he detained me in the watch-house, as well as her; and she openly declared, in the watch-house, to stealing my clothes, and selling the whole to one Mr. Stevenson. I thought that she had pawned the things, and that was the reason I said I should be very glad to have nothing to do with her, if she would give me the duplicates; she told me she never had pawned them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was that woman that was on the stairs that very morning that you lost your things? - Yes. I believe she laid in the passage all night. I spoke to her before the robbery was committed; I thought my little was in danger, by her laying in the passage; she had come in and out of my shop three or four times before.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep a clothes shop? - Yes, in King-street, Seven dials. I bought them on the 18th of April, Saturday, about twelve o'clock, of the prisoner I believe; I rather think it is the same, but I have so many people come into my shop that I can hardly tell the features.</p>
               <p>Q. You see her at Bow-Street? - Yes; and I see her in my own shop when the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200141"/>officers brought her. I believe she is the same, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you doubt it in the least? - I don't know as for doubt, I have so many people come into my shop. I think it is the same, but I cannot justly swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt when you was before the justice? - I could not really recollect her features, I think it is the same I bought these things of. I cannot produce them all, I have sold part. I have a sheet, table cloth, pillow case, two mens neckcloths, and two odd stockings. I sold a shirt, a pillow case, and one pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of day did you buy them? - About twelve o'clock, she came and said she was distressed, she had got some things to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she ever been in your shop before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Will you swear that I was the person? - I rather think it is the person, It was the 18th of April, she sold these things, and the 15th of May when the officer brought her in.</p>

               <p>On the 14th of May, I was on duty, and the prosecutor and one of our watchmen brought the prisoner as a charge to me, and the prosecutor there declared, that this cap and handkerchief that was on her person was her's, which I have had in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor gave me the cap and handkerchief, about a week before she said she lost these things, and perhaps she said I might get something better to do than be in the manner I was. When she took me a prisoner, she said, she would hang me, and that the cap and handkerchief I had on was her's. I said, Yes, they were; she said she would to swear to them, and took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This cap had a burn in it by the candle, and I put this piece in myself, the handkerchief had a tare in it when I lost it, the sheet is mine, the things were wrapped up in it, they are all mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give her any of these things? - I tied them all up for my own use in a bundle.</p>

Last Tuesday afternoon the prisoner at the bar came into the shop about two o'clock, I cannot exactly say; Archer asked to look at a muslin handkerchief, with a striped border; I persuaded him not to have one, as they were out of fashion; I told him I would shew him some jackanott muslin; the first he thought was too large, I shewed him then one, of which he had a square, and paid for it; I went up to dinner; Mr. Thirlwall knocked, I came down from dinner, and Mr. Thirlwall desired I would go for a constable; as I was going up the street I heard the cry of stop thief.</p>

               <p>I am a coach-wheelwright's wife; I was at Mr. Thirlwall's, these people were in before me; while I was getting a receipt for some taxes, some poors rates; I see the man put his hand on the counter, and take something and put it in his pocket, he turned out of the shop, and I told Mr. Thirlwall of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what it was he took? - No. He sent the shopman out after him.</p>
               <p>Q. You see him take something. Did he go out directly? - No, I believe he was looking at some stockings, he bought the stockings afterwards, and paid for them, and then he went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go out together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the woman do any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them brought back? - No, I went home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What was it that I put in my pocket? - It was something that you took out of a blue paper, the blue paper was on the counter; and it was something from under that paper, while the shopman was gone to get the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what it was? - No, I cannot say what it was.</p>
               <p>Court to Stevens. When the alarm was given you went in pursuit of the persons immediately? - I went towards Smithfield, I mistook the way; and after going towards Smithfield, coming back I looked up St. John's-lane, and see them crossing St. John's-lane, I went up St. John's-lane, and met them, and told the man he must come along with me; almost at the same time Mr. Dobson called, you have lost your handkerchief, sir. I turned about immediately, and picked up a remnant of cambrick, I was convinced at that time the man was a thief, and I seized him; then Mr. Dobson called out, there are more goods you have dropped, or something to that purpose; I looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200143"/>about, and see the two other remnants laying on the ground; I begged Mr. Dobson would give them to me, he seemed to hesitate, till I told him the man was a thief, and where I came from; he gave them to me, and I took the man home with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman? - She ran away in the mean while, she ran under an arch way, and was out of sight immediately; when I passed the arch way she was out of sight; I told Mr. Thirlwall to take care of the man, while I went in search of the woman; I went back again, and searched two or three houses in this yard, it was no thoroughfare, and I was told she was hid, and she ran out of a front door, and a woman told me, and I ran after her, and took her in George's court, in St. John's-lane, and took her home, and the constable was charged with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you got in your hand there? - The three remnants that were picked up, a remnant of buttiller, a kind of muslin, and India article, and two remnants of cambrick.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of those been sold by you? - Neither; he had bought some cambrick, one eighth, which was in the parcel that I took from the woman; I searched the man's pockets, nothing was found in them belonging to us; I did not search the woman, there was a lady in the house that did, there was nothing found on her.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the things that he bought? - I gave them to him at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had them in possession when they were taken? - The woman, she gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did these remnants drop? - I did not see them, I supposed the man dropped them, Mr. Dobson said it was the man dropped them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why were not three pieces brought against me at the first hearing at the magistrate's? there was only two brought then? - In the hurry of the moment I forgot the piece that I picked up myself, and put into my pocket.</p>

               <p>I am a grocer in St. John's-lane, Clerkenwell. On Tuesday last, between the hours of two and three in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar (Archer) passed by my door, and dropped two or three pieces like handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to drop them, by accident? - That I don't know; I calls out, you have dropped your handkerchiefs; at that instant I see the prosecutor's servant take hold of him, and to him I gave the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they dropped from the prisoner? - I am certain of it, there was nobody by, I was unloading a load of sugar, and the carman was in the cart, consequently it could not fail from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the woman? - I see nothing of the woman at that time, about ten minutes after that I see Stevens in pursuit of the woman who ran up George's-court, and Stevens took hold of her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to know the reason he did not swear to the things the first time I was before the justice? - It is not to be supposed that I can swear to things that I had not above a moment in my hands; one piece I think I can remember by the small stripes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Stevens. These are all the same pieces you received of Mr. Dobson? - Two of them are.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property were they? - Mr. Thirlwall's, all three of them, I know them by the shop mark.</p>
               <p>Harris. They all three belong to Mr. Thirlwall, I sold him no cambrick at all, only a square of muslin.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen your vice that night? - Yes, I had worked on it till seven o'clock; I don't know as to the square, I am sure as to the vice and burnisher.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner with it - News was brought me that he was taken, and I was told there was a vice found much like mine, and I went to the place with the constable; that was three weeks after I had been robbed; I said when I was before the justice that it was much about a fortnight, but it was three weeks.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed on this night of the robbery? - A little after eleven o'clock, on the 5th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose business was it that night to take care to secure the house? - It is my business, and I always make it my business to fasten my own windows up; I fastened them up the 5th of April, at eleven o'clock; we shut them up every night at eleven, except Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make your door fast then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon did you discover the robbery? - We did not discover at all till we were going to bed, a little after eleven, we discovered it unlocking the door, and going into the bed room and finding my drawers open and the window open.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is it from the ground? - I really cannot tell you. I fastened it down my own self, at five o'clock the 5th of April, and I found it up when I went to bed, my drawers were open, and my clothes were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your window fastened? - It was fastened by a little iron that hooked into an iron nut; there were no shutters at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was fast? - I am quite sure of it. I fastened it myself and afterwards went back to try if it was fast myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How late had you seen it safe? - I see it safe at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You say all your drawers were open? - No. Some of them. I missed my gowns, a black silk gown and coat, a brown silk gown, &amp;c. and several other things, part of my bed furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any bank notes? - No, my husband had the bank notes unbeknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they undo this sash fastening? - I really cannot tell but I think they must force it open some how or other on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is your window from the ground? - It is a one pair of stairs window. I have no idea of the height.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the thirty pounds bank note again? - Yes, I have seen it since, but I have not seen the number, but only the value of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever seen the three hundred pounds one? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How lately had you seen these bank notes? - At four o'clock that afternoon, when I went up to shave myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the manner in which these persons had got in? - They got in at the window; the sash was up as high as it could be lifted.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is that window from the ground? - About ten feet.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the furniture of the room? - The drawers were all about the room, some of them on the bed, some on the toilet, some on the floor, some in one place, and some in another.</p>
               <p>Court. You say the window was about ten feet from the ground? - More than that, I suppose.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they seen about there at all in the neighbourhood? - No, I cannot say that; I had seen them that evening.</p>
               <p>ARMSTRONG sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You belong to Worship street? - Yes. On Monday the 6th of April, at night, I went, in company with Ray,&amp;c, to a house in a place called Queen's square, or King's-square, in the neighbourhood of Brick-lane; there I found the four prisoners, in the lower apartment. I searched Wybrow, I found four guineas, which I returned him, I searched Skiving on, and found some money on him, which I returned him. On searching Mrs. Wybrow, or Phillips, I found a new five pounds bank note, and a guinea and a half. There was no money taken that night. I then went up stairs with Wybrow and the woman, and he put his hand in a basket, and took out this little box; there was nine guineas in it. I took that and kept it. One woman was taken into custody that night, two of the men, and Mrs. Wybrow. In the morning they were taken to the magistrate's, and I had orders to search him afterwards, which I did at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200147"/>the office. In the morning of Easter Tuesday I went to the Bank, and, being a holiday, it was not open. I went to a number of linen drapers; at last I came to a Mr. James's, in Bishopsgate-street, and I asked them if they had changed a thirty pounds bank note? they said, they had. He went with me to Mr. Freeman, that lives in that neighbourhood, a hatter or an haberdasher, in Bishopsgate-street; and Mr. Freeman produced it. I then went and apprehended the other woman, and brought her to the office. I then had orders to research them. I searched Skivington, and he had only two guineas; and on Mrs. Skivington I found half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it in King-square, Brick-lane? - Wybrow desired the place to be locked up, and the goods to be taken care of.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the other prisoner live? - I don't know; I never see him till that night, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. This thirty pounds note you have had in your custody ever since? - Yes, ever since the day it was delivered; it is marked on the back.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search him? - I did not. After a little information that Mr. Arm strong and I received, we went to the Bank, and being holiday time, we heard nothing about the notes there. We, according to a little information, went from the Bank to the different haberdasners and linen drapers in Bishopsgate-street, and that way, and we went to that linen draper where it was changed, and we went and apprehended Wybrow's sister afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q.What note was it? - A thirty pounds note. I have these things that I found at Wybrow's lodgings. This here property is the property of Wybrow's sister, that she bought at the time that she changed the thirty pounds note, and here is the other property I found in Wybrow's lodging, all new property, the property of the two young women at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Wybrow's sister? - Her name is Lee.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does the other belong to? - All the whole belongs to the two young women.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say it was her's? - Yes, I believe she did. Here is a counterpane taken from the lodgings: that never was owned by any body, but I was told to keep it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. These people were not all committed for a burglary, two for a burglary, and two for another offence? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a reward of forty pounds a piece for a burglary? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was Ray with you? - Yes, he was at finding these things at the lodging.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you with the last witness at the lodgings of Wybrow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these things found? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what you know of this matter? - I was in company with Armstrong, and two or three others of the public officers, on Monday the 6th of April. I went to the house of Wybrow, and searched the house, and in a closet, among some rubbish, I found two guineas wrapped up in a bit of paper. We secured the prisoners, and they were taken before the magistrate, on the Tuesday following. I was in the yard where they were locked up, in different lock-up-houses; I heard some conversation pass between the two prisoners in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200148"/>public office in Worship-street. There are some lock-up-houses for prisoners be hind the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the conversation between? - Skivington and Wybrow.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know these men before? - I knew Wybrow perfectly well; I knew his voice perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons in these lock-up-houses but these two - There were not; they were in separate lock-up-houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they see each other? - No, they are situated one joined to the other. I heard Skivington say to Wybrow, provided it was not found out where the thirty pounds note was changed, all the rest of the property was quite safe. Skivington then said, they were gone to bone Joel. Wybrow made answer, and said, I am sure they don't know where he lives.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by boning of him? - Take him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood it so? - Yes, it is a word that is made use of very frequently. Skivington says, they will find him, and if they do, he will split; I imagine that is telling the truth, impeach.</p>
               <p>Q. After they said Joel would split, was there any other conversation? - Skivington said, that Harper and Armstrong were gone round to all the linen drapers, to see if they could find out where the small note was changed. Wybrow said, I hope they will not hit on the right; and there was some conversation about a cloak that were taken out of Wybrow's house. Wybrow said, that the landlord, White, seemed to own the cloak last night. Skivington said, no, Bill, you are wrong there; he did not, on account of his wife's not being there. Wybrow said, if he was examined before the magistrate, he could point out a thing in the cloak that they knew nothing at all about. Skivington said, my mother came to me in the watch-house; I gave her all the money that I had, except one half guinea. Skivington said, I told her that there were nine guineas, which his mother had agreed to come and swear it was her property before the magistrate the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any more conversation? - No, I believe that is all the conversation that I heard pass between them. I communicated it to the magistrate immediately I heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce any thing yourself? - Only the money that I found among the rubbish.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long have you been an officer at this Public office? - Nigh three years.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not recollect your ever coming here before to recollect conversation? - Yes, I did once.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day did this pass? - It was in the forenoon; it might be between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. How are these lock-up-houses situated with regard to each other? - They join to each other.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any window that commu nicates to the wall of the two? - There is a window to each that looks into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q.There is no window between the partition of each? - No, there is a very thick partition that parts the lock-up-houses, and they are obliged to speak very loud, or else they cannot make one another understand.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards is this from the office itself? - It joins the office; there is a door that goes into the office only, it is a few steps, or else it is in a line.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any one of the justices sitting at this time? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. And I suppose as it almost always happens when the justice is sitting, a great number of people are in the justice room - In general there is a great number of people.</p>

            Is there any body else come to prove this conversation besides yourself? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. It did not disturb the justice as he was going on with the examination? - There were two doors that were shut.</p>
               <p>Q. But what I want to know is, whether the justice sent out to quiet these two noisy fellows, because you know they talked very loud, as you and I do now? - They did talk very loud.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what I want to know is this, whether the justice did not send out to quiet these two noisy fellows that disturb ed him while he was doing his business? - The justice if he had been on the bench, could not have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you say that the door of this lock-up-place goes into the office itself? - No, I do not; there is a door opens, then there is another door, and then another door after that, before you go into the office.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a public house near this lock-up-house, a little nearer than the office? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. They could hear them in the public house plain enough? - No, there is a very high wall that is built.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you happen to be when this conversation took place. I was standing on the step of the passage door that comes out of the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was one of these doors removed? - But there were two after that.</p>
               <p>Q. But you describe three doors, you had opened one of the doors; they did not perceive you of course? - They did not.</p>
               <p>Q. As you found him going on, did you make any sign to any of your brother officers to come and hear this pretty story? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. That would have been unlucky, if any body else could have proved it as well as yourself, because you are a man of that character, that you don't want con firmation? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it depends on your single testimony? - What I have said is nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no reward in case if either these people are convicted - Yes, there is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reward in case Wybrow is convicted? - There is forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reward in case the other is convicted? - Just the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Just the same. Stroking the chin is a very easy thing. So this lucky conversation, you believe, will entitle you to eighty pounds reward? - Very likely part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. On the serious and solemn oath you have taken, do not you expect to receive a part of eighty pounds reward, if they are convicted; don't you expect to have a considerable part? - I might, it is left to the discretion of the Court, it lays entirely with the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you expect that the evidence you have given will entitle you to part of that reward? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no manner of doubt about it? - As being a public officer, I cannot be unacquainted with it.</p>
               <p>Q.On your oath, had you any doubt about it at all when you told me very likely? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, good Mr. Ray, it was no secret that the officers were gone round to search the linen drapers? - No, I did not know they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. But they informed you when they came home what they had been out upon? - I communicated it to the magistrate, and before the face of Wybrow and Skivington.</p>
               <p>Q. You were with Harper and Armstrong before you gave this evidence against these people? - Undoubtedly I was. I was there the next morning after they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200150"/>Q. You knew they were gone to the Bank to make inquiries? - They were not gone to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.You had been with these people before they had been at the Bank? - In the morning we met at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not you know they were gone about the thirty pounds bank note? - I did not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you consult together what you were to do about this? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.If the two other women who are indicted with them are convicted, there is eighty pounds more to be divided among you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, does not that yard which you go through to put their people into the lock-up-houses, belong to the public house just by? - There are three ways to the yard. It belongs to the office; there is a yard belongs to the public house; but this yard belongs to the office, no one can go in it but the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Any persons who were in the public house yard had just the same opportunity of hearing as you had? - I cannot say that. I stood nearer than the people of the public house could stand any way.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body may come out as far as that door from the public house? - They might.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were speaking so loud, that you heard them through the door? - No, I don't say so, I said there was a window to each lock-up-house, and I heard them from the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you wonder that these men who were giving such material evidence spoke so loud on the occasion? - It is not to be wondered at at all when there is nobody else in the lock-up-houses.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were the two windows from each other? - I suppose about five or six yards from window to window.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there being only an occasion to convey the voice five or six yards off from the lock-up-house in which Wybrow was. Yet they were speaking as loud as people could speak? - Yes, or else they could not understand one another.</p>
               <p>Q. So then these people were hallooing from the bottom of the den. They did not take the precaution to get up to the window? - I did not say they were hallooing they were talking very loud, and the instant I did hear what they said, I communicated it to Mr. Colquohon, one of our magistrates. They talked much louder than the ordinary way, and then they stopped three or four minutes before they went on again, and they now and then called out, Bill, which they spoke very loud.</p>
               <p>Q.What persons did you see come out of the public house? - I could not see any person coming out of the public house, it is impossible for me to tell, for there is a high brick wall that parts this yard from the public house yard. In some places nine or ten feet, in other places it is seven feet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was there any in this yard besides yourself? - No, nor no other persons in the lock-up-houses but themselves.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they know you were there? - No they did not.</p>

Accordingly we went and did not see them that day. Three of the officers of Worship-street after that came, Mr. Harper, Mr. Armstrong, and another gentleman, I don't know his name. On Saturday we went up to see them; we were detained and sent to gaol, I and Cox, on suspicion that we knew something about this affair; but I was discharged when I came up for reexamination. When I came up on Wednesday I was discharged, and she said she would go and speak to the magistrate, and see if she could not get discharged; she went in and staid for about two hours and half; she was not discharged. I went the next day to her; she did not tell me any thing of the affair. I think she came up again on Wednesday following; I was there, and I stopped for about two hours, and I asked her what she had been about? and she said she would hang jack Skivington by fair means or by soul, because he would not cohabit with her.</p>

               <p>Court. You know this woman for four years intimately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Knew her affairs and secrets? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How does she get her bread? - By prostitution.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get your bread? - In the same way; but since I have been in trouble I have thought better of my way of life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Who did you live with at the time that Tomlinson was tried? - One Stacey.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he a witness against Tomlinson? - I don't know. I was taken with the man; and when I found what he was, I mended my way of life. I think it is about six or seven months ago, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have lived particularly with nobody since? - No, nobody at all; I have now mended my way of life. I come up here now from Gravesend.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they all pledged in the same name? - Yes. On April the 16th, in the morning, about half after eight o'clock, he brought two more desert spoons, which he offered to pledged; by his appearance at that time of the morning, I thought every thing was not right; I interrogated him particularly; he told me that he lived at No. 12, Green-street, Liecester-square; I asked him if he should have any objection to my going to the house to know if he lived there, as he was an entire stranger to me?</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your shop? - St. Martin's-lane, No. 32. He said, no, none in the least; I might go and make inquiries, and find that he did live there; he was a lodger in the house. I went and made inquiry, but there was no such person lived there, nor they did not know one of the name.</p>
               <p>Q.He did not go with you? - No, he did not; he was kept in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What you left him in custody? - Yes. I came back and told him I had been where he told me to go, and that they told me there was no such person lived there; he said, you have been wrong, I will go with you and point out the house to you; and going up Clement's-row he walked slowly, which made me believe that he would run away, and in Remmings-row he said, to tell you the truth, I do not live there, but in Duke-street, Westminster; I asked him if he really did live there? - he said, yes; says I, then I will go with you. At the bottom of Castle-street, I then asked him again, if he really did live there? - he said, yes; and going down the passage that leads to Mr. Paine's, the bookseller, I again asked him; and he trembled very much, and attempted to run away. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200156"/>immediately secured him, and by the assistance of some that were coming by, had him conveyed to the watch-house. In about an hour afterwards this here bill(produces a bill) was brought into my shop, which led to a discovery to whom they belonged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There were three several pawnings of these? - No, he came three times, but two pawnings.</p>

               <p>Q. You found him in charge of a constable? - Yes, and I said to Mr. Terry, we will go to your lodgings. The officer went with me and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the same afternoon? - Yes, directly. In looking about the room, in a little closet, I found a pair of men's half boots; I said, Mr. Terry, did you take them for your wear? - he endeavoured to make some apology, that I had some time before promised him a pair of shoes. In looking again into the same closet, I found another pair of half boots that laced; the prisoner's wife opened the drawers, to shew us what we pleased to look at; among the rest was a pair of womens shoes, in the indictment, which the prisoner's wife said, she brought with her cut of the country some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing of the prisoner? - Yes; in examining these shoes, I saw the customer's name that they were made for, of the name of Turnbull, and I know the shoes likewise. In some other part of the room, I believe the officer opened a little bag, which contained some upper leathers of mine, some of them marked. The constable has had the property ever since. He first said, that some of the leather was his, but when I came to look at them he confessed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Before any conversation took place on this business, had you held out any hopes to him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you threatened him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it should be better for him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him he should not be taken in custody? - He was already in custody. The first thing that passed was, his telling me that I had promissed him a pair of shoes; and when I looked over the leather, when I came to some part of the skin that was marked, he said, I am very sorry; and his wife said, she was sorry to say that I had not one honest servant about me, for they all robbed me; he said he had not robbed me more than the rest. He acknowledged he had took all the articles. I said to him, if there is one article that is not mine, be cautious what you say, and don't let me take it; he acknowledged they were all mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200160"/>Mr. Knapp. Have you any journeymen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that your journeymen don't work for you out of hours at home, and bring the goods back again the next morning? - No, it is not the practice of my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. If this man without your knowledge worked out of doors, you did not know it? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a person of the name of Greenwood lived with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Does he live with you now? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here to day? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he ceased to live with you? - Since this affair my mind was not easy, on account of the prisoner charging him with robbing me likewise. I went to his apartment to satisfy myself, and I see nothing in his apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that information you certainly did turn Greenaway away? - I did. I found that they were both going to quit my service, and set up in the trade for themselves.</p>

He came into the box and asked half a crown on them, and I gave him two shillings, and I wrote a ticket for them; and about two o'clock in the afternoon, my master sent me with two pair of shoes to Mr. Murray's shop, and when I came in there I see the prisoner at the bar, and I came home and acquainted my master of it, and my master went with me to Mr. Murray's shop, and sent me for a constable, and I fetched a constable, and then my master sent me home.</p>

Mr. Murray was not then at home, I sent my boy for a constable, and took the man into custody, and the prisoner at the bar owned and confessed that he took the shoes from Mr. Murray's shop. Mr. Murray came home and I shewed him the shoes, and he said they were his property. I accompanied the constable to a house in old Bedlam, and we went into a room there, where his wife was making of shoes, and Mr. Murray found several things of his own on the premises; he found some shoes, boots, and leather.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner give any account, how he came by these things, that Mr. Murray found? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he know it? - Yes, he did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take the prisoner into custody? - Yes, by order of Mr. Purse. When I had him in custody in Mr. Murray's shop, Mr. Murray came in, and Mr. Purse informed him that he had had a pair of shoes pawned at his house, and he suspected they were stolen. I asked the prisoner whether he lived in the house? he said he did Mr. Murray says, I am over-run with thieves, I have found one out. Mr. Murray and Mr. Purse consulted together, and asked him if he was willing for us to go and search his lodgings? he said, yes, by all means. Accordingly, we went and searched his lodgings, and we found the contents of this bag all but one pair of shoes. (The property produced.) He first of all said, they were his own property; but Mr. Murray seeing his own private mark on them, he could not deny but that they were his master's.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened when you got up? - I was asked if the place was all fast when I went to bed, I told them it was. I fastened the door and shut it, and went to bed about ten minutes after twelve, and I was alarmed by a cry, Mr. Rawson! Mr. Rawson! there are thieves in your shop.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the India house. When I was coming home, on Tuesday morning, the 19th, there were two men at the end of the lane. It was just about a quarter before two; I did not altogether like it. I stepped up towards my door, and would not open it till they were gone by; No. 69, Fetter-lane, exactly opposite Mr. Rawson's, and I see the prisoner at the bar, and another taller man pass me as I was standing at the step, and directly as he had passed by, I opened my door and went in, and shut the door after me. It was where I lodged, I went up stairs. I struck no light; the window was open, and through the curtain, I saw the prisoner and this tall man, walk up and down four or five times; I thought they had no good intent. So previous to that, I had taken out eight marbles that I had in my drawer, and I tore the hole of the curtain bigger to look; it had a hole in it before; and they walked up to the door, and the shutter appeared to be down by the blackness of the glass. The tall man stood up against the side of the door like, it is a folding door. St. Paul's had struck two I suppose, about ten minutes before; the watchmen were crying two; they went off and came back again to the door, and they see all was clear, and they both went in and shut the door after them. Then the day was breaking, it was plain enough to discern any body then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to distinguish the features of a man's face? - I don't think there was, at least I could not discern it. I took three of the marbles and throwed them, in order to alarm Mr. Rawson, which missed the window, and struck the shutters, and alarmed them, and they paused then in the house. They were two minutes then in the house before they came out, and then I called out Rawson! Rawson! with the noise of my calling Rawson, they came out. The tall one took towards Holborn, and the short one towards Barnard's-inn. The watchman being by Barnard's-inn-gate, I called to him to stop him. There was no other person in the lane whatever, and the watchman took him about twenty yards from the door, by Mr. Langdale's steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watchman stop him? - Yes. He was not out of my fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see enough of his face from the window where you were, when the watchman stopped him, to say that was the same person? - I could not. It was such a person. Then a Mr. Blanchard, in Dean-street, and an officer came up likewise that there might not be any rescue, and after that I went down to the watch-house, and gave my charge; Mr. Rawson, the prosecutor, and the watchman desired me to come.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You told the judge just now that it was about break of day, you was up two pair of stairs, and looking through a curtain? - Through a window open, and the curtain tore down the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that window a casement? - No, a sash.</p>
               <p>Q.Could you see the person of any one of them? Could you know them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200163"/>again? - I could know them again by not quitting them out of my fight.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any candle light? - No, but there is a light at out door, that shines directly opposite the way.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing you had been down stairs on the other side of the way, could you not discern their faces? - No, I don't think I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was about day break; if I had been as near to you as I am now, could you have discerned my face by the break of day? - I might perhaps, I would not pretend to swear. I did not look at the man's face.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing you had chosen to lock at a man's face, was there not light enough to discern him? - I might.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was day break? - I did not; I said the day was breaking.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, if you had been in the street, instead of being as you were, up in the two pair of stairs, could you not have discerned his face? - I will not take my oath on that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been a witness before? Did you ever hear of a crime of burglary? - Yes, I am not so void of sense, but I may know what a burglary is as well as yourself, though you are so high learned.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about a reward on conviction of a burglary? - I come not expecting to be paid for what I do, and you do.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know there is a forty pounds reward on a conviction of burglary? - I do; but upon my oath I do not come with that intent.</p>
               <p>- CONNER sworn.</p>
               <p>I was calling two o'clock on Tuesday morning, and at the same time one of the men that were there, that lived up two pair of stairs, he cried out, watch! watch! stop him. Accordingly at the same word, I laid hold of the young fellow,

            , as he was going by running; coming up Holborn way, going towards the Strand way on the same side of the street where the house was broke open. When I laid hold of the young fellow, he says, it is not me, it is that man that has gone forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other forward? - No other man that I see than this man that I laid hold of. I suppose it was twenty yards from the door where it was broke open, that I laid hold of the young man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you after you laid hold of him? - Called up Rawson and the patrol; and I went to the door and there was a mob inside of the door; and at the same time we thought it better to take the young man inside of the house, and to let the mob disperse, until such time as we see what was the matter. The patrol examined the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether it was light or dark? - It was break of day, just about a quarter past two, between there and ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to distinguish the features of a man's face, to know one man from another? - Yes, there was.</p>

On Monday the 27th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200164"/>of April, I came home about eight o'clock, which is our usual time of leaving; when I came into the gates I turned my horse about, and this prisoner at the bar came by me; and I said, John, you have got something in your pockets; this was in the yard; and he said, I have got no thing. He goes into the street, I called him back again, and I insisted on his going into the house, to know what he had got in his pockets; when he came into the house, I put my hand into his outer pocket, there was nothing there; when I came to his inner pockets there were the articles that the indictment states. I sent then for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found? - Six pounds weight of tedges, pewter; I have got the patterns belonging to them. They were taken off the work bench. They had been clipped off the bottoms of quart pots in the course of that day. I gave them to the officer. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate You are a pewterer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost a good deal of pewter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any partner? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they not the refuse what is left in the mould? - No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose your moulds are the same size as other peoples? - I can tell that my moulds are standard measure; but whether they are of the same shape I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. They are cut off after the pot is cast? - Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they in any particular shape after the pot is cast? - These tedges tally with the bottom of what they are cut off from.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever go out of you shop? - I certainly do.</p>
               <p>Q.How do you know you have nothing brought into your shop when you are out of it? - I have pewter and things of that kind, but not such tedges as these.</p>
               <p>Q. Them pieces it seems are so extremely peculiar, that when a man is standing at the bar for his liberty, you know that they are cut off your pots? - I know they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us something like a tradesman's reason why you know them; and and not a female woman's reason, that you know them only because you know them? - I could not explain myself further than I know them.</p>
               <p>Q. Probably your reason is because you found them in the pocket of the man that was going out of the shop? - I found fifteen pounds of them in his pocket one time.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing you had found them at a pewterer's bench in York, should you have been able to swear to them? - I certainly should not.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not know them by the smell, I take it for granted, not the shape. Is not the mixture of metal, which you call pewter, much the same in all pewterers shops? - I cannot give an answer to that question.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you never served your time to a pewterer? - Yes; I have been in business for forty years. We have block in come from Cornwall, and we cannot work it in that state.</p>
               <p>Q.Them articles that you hold there in your bag, are clipped off with shears? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, I suppose, the shears of other pewterers are very different from your's? - I don't go to other pewterers shops.</p>
               <p>Q. These things that are cut off, are they sold or melted down again? - Melted down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them pieces of metal before you found them in the man's pocket? - Certainly I did; and three times more than this.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mark them when they are cut off? - I do not; it is not the custom. Our servants are in the shop from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200165"/>morning till night. I see them on the work bench.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you took them out of this man's pocket that you see them? - Three hours before.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know how you know they are the same pieces? - Because I missed the quantity, and they were found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this man worked with you? - About four months, and prior to that for two years. I looked on him to be an honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attend his duty? - Sometimes he did, and sometimes got drunk Prior to this, a fortnight, I had a very great suspicion, or else I should not have stopped him when I did.</p>
               <p>Court. When you took these things, did you go up stairs to see if any were missing? - I did, and I found it missing, by my eye I see there were some gone.</p>
               <p>- HUMPHRIES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these tedges on the prisoner? - Yes. I took them from him. He said if Mr. Perry would forgive him, he was sorry for it, and he would never do so any more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate. What did you say to him to induce him to say so? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. To Perry. Do you happen to know this, that this man was in the habit of hanging up his coat any where? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had other men in the shop that afternoon? - There were only him and the apprentice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The day that master took the metal out of my pocket, he happened to be out that day, and he came home on horse back, and he called for a pail of water and brush, to wash his horses legs, and I went to do it, and he told me he had ordered his boy to do it; and I went to turn round to go home, and he took hold of me, and said, what have you got here? and he took these pieces of pewter out of my pocket. I know no more of it than the day I shall die.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever miss any property received at the bar? - I thought there was a shortness in the money several times, but it was impossible for me to tell the exact amount that was received there; I marked sixty or sixty-one halfpence and placed them in a box in my bed room, where I put the halfpence when I had more in the till than I can cleverly pull it in and out with. I missed ten of the marked ones on the Saturday that my daughter see the halfpence in her box.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200166"/>Q. On what day did you mark these halfpence? - On the Sunday morning before.</p>
               <p>Q.And what day did you miss the ten? - On the Wednesday following, the 29th of April. In consequence of that I sent for an officer; he asked her to go out, and I thought it was proper to have her searched, as the money was missing, to see whether my suspicions were well founded or not. When she went up stairs to clean herself, I followed her up stairs, and told her I had some reason to suppose that she had robbed me; she said, she had not; says I, if I accuse you wrongfully, I must ask your pardon; she said she had not robbed me; I said, I have a constable below, and I called him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her box? - Yes; when we went up into her room, (where I spoke to her first was not in her room, it was in the one pair of stairs, her room was in the two pair of stairs) I insisted on searching her box; and it was with some reluctance she would permit it to be done; but at last she pulled the key out of her pockets; and unlocked the box.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find the articles mentioned in the indictment there? - Yes, and in her pockets; and thirty or forty pounds worth of new clothes, never wore, only one pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things that were found, delivered into the hands of a constable? - Yes, they were, and sealed up. When we were taking the things out, two parcels of halfpence were wrapped up in some of her clothes, and she took up the two parcels of halfpence and laid them down; I said, what is that? it was two bags of halfpence, and I found one halfpenny that I had marked in each bag. There was some other things that I found besides the money, a knife and fork, &amp;c. she said, she had locked them up for safety.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This woman was your servant? - Yes, to my misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. You marked a quantity of halfpence, and in the halfpence that you found in this woman's box, there were only two of the marked fort. This woman was intrusted to sort your halfpence, was she not? - I did it myself; I never sent her up stairs with halfpence in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. It was stated that she was bare of clothes, in the opening? - You did not bear me say so. She made a decent appearance.</p>
               <p>Q.Whom this matter was a little more recent, you went before the magistrate, and laid your information before alderman Le Mesurier? - No, I went before the Lord Mayor, and he advised me to mark my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, on your oath, whether you then mentioned at all that she made any reluctance in opening her box? - I do not recollect that any questions were asked me; the alderman he see the quantity that were there, and he asked very little about it.</p>
               <p>Q. The box was opened when your daughter was there alone? - That was the Saturday before; that was not the same box; this was a new box that had come home from the box-maker's but two days, and my daughter lent her two shillings to pay for it; and she had thirty shillings in copper in it in less than two days after. As for the knife and fork, she said she had locked it up to keep it safe; as soon as the officer took hold of the cloak pins, I said, they are my cloak pins, what do they here? she said, they are your's, I put them there that they may be safe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Had you any reason for knowing, at any previous time, that she had much or little money? - I had. I don't know whether it is according to the rules of this Court, to speak respecting her coming to my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It is not.</p>

               <p>Q. You are the daughter of the prosecutor? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever look into the box of the prisoner at the bar? - Not before the morning that I discovered the halfpence there, on Saturday the 25th of April. I went up stairs in order to look in a closet, that was in the prisoners room, before I could open the closet door I was obliged to move a trunk that belonged to the prisoner; and as I moved that trunk, I heard something gingle that I thought founded like halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the trunk locked? - No. It was not. I lifted up a few things and discovered a white slannel sock with a parcle of halfpence in it.</p>
               <p>Q.What quantity might there be? - About seven shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Wednesday following were you present when the box was searched by the constable? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing while the search was making? - No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say any thing that day? - Yes, after the constable had searched her, and she had produced the money that she had in her pockets; the prisoner and I went into my bed chamber; when she was in there, she asked me if I would call her master?</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after she had been examined? - Yes; when my father came into the room, she said, there is all the money I have of your's; and if you think I have bought them new clothes with your money, you are welcome to take them, on condition she said that my father would not carry her before them gentlemen.</p>

               <p>Q. Before this was said, had there been any promise made to the prisoner, to induce her to say it? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any threat? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your father was called up to hear this? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q.He was called up for the very purpose of hearing it? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner and you used to differ occasionally, a little, I believe? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Not about clothes? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never made some such remark as this, that when you went out to balls occasionally, that you never could dress smarter than she? - No, I never made any such observation.</p>
               <p>Q.You used to go out frequently to balls? - No, I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Never perhaps? - Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q.Never had any quarrel with her at all? - No; my mother and the prisoner has had words sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. The box where you see these halfpence on Saturday was unlocked? - It was, and the lid was open.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you see the halfpence that were found? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was one marked halfpenny in each parcel? - Yes, no more, nor no less.</p>

               <p>Q.Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever receive any paper from the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I did, on the 7th of May. On the 5th of May he came and bought some sewing silks, to the amount of five pounds and upwards, and said, that he was leaving Mr. Searle, whom he had lived with and should go into business for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - Yes, I did. On the 6th he came again, and bought to the amount of between two and three pounds; he gave me four guineas on account of what he had then bought, and what he had bought on the 5th it left four pounds and upwards in my favour. On the 7th he came again, about one o'clock, and looked out a parcel of died sewing silks, to the amount of twenty-one pounds and upwards; after he had looked them out, he gave me a thirty pounds bill, a promissory note.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got it about you? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the drawer of that note? - Richard Ball.(Produces it.) My account came to twenty six pounds three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200169"/>shillings, with the balance of what he had on the 7th, and he gave me that note, and said, it was his brother-in law's, who lived at Greenwich, and had married his sister, who kept a reputable boarding school at Greenwich. I think it was Church-row, from what I heard since; and that he had a place in Woolwich Warren of near two hundred pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you asked him who the drawer was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that note again; I see there is thirty pounds in figures, and the 9th of July; were those on at the time you received it of the prisoner at the bar? - No; they were not. I believe either my son or clerk did it.</p>
               <p>Q.Before or after he had tendered it to you? - After.</p>
               <p>Q. I see it is dated the 6th of May. The 9th of July is when it becomes due of course? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner at this time live? - No. 22, Golden-lane, Barbican.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take this note in discharge of your balance? - I was to give him three pounds seventeen shillings in cash as his balance, and I had not so much about me, and I promised to give it him in two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. What past after that? - He gave me an order of fifty pounds weight more of silk. In consequence of that I went to Mr. Scarle where he had lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards entertain any suspicions about this, and what did you do in consequence of those suspicions? - I thought it was a bad bill and I went to his house in Golden lane.</p>
               <p>Q.How long after you had received this note? - I suppose in two or three hours, and I asked whether he was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him at home? - No, I did not. I then see his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards make any enquiries at this place where he had described the bill was to be paid? - My clerk went down to make enquiries.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been able to see any such person as Richard Ball from that time to this? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this that the prisoner was taken up? - He came to my house Friday evening with four men, I had had the note a day then. He came between eight and nine o'clock, he himself and four men, to take me up for a felony, that I had taken away his property for which he had given a very good bill. You will observe that I was out of the house when this man came first, and he came again on Saturday morning about eleven o'clock with a constable and fourmen, and carried me before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you then taken any of his goods? - I had not taken any thing but part of my own property.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you done at his house? - I see some sewing silk lay there, and I said it was my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things part that you sold him? - Yes, part.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after that you received information that gave suspicion of the bill? - After, On Saturday he came, and I was taken before the Lord Mayor, and he made a charge against me that I had taken his property, and swore that he had given me a very good bill.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the information taken in writing? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that matter end? - He accused me of this robbery, and my Lord Mayor said it was a serious charge against me; he gave me my liberty, he did not require bail if I would appear when I was called upon. In the mean time Mr. Searle arrested him for a debt of twenty-one pounds, Mr. Searle told me so. Then on Tuesday following he was had up again to make good his charge against me.</p>

            And you see him in custody of a sheriss's officer? - Yes. He then said that he had taken this bill of a person that had gone to sea.</p>
               <p>Q.Was what he said taken in writing? - I really don't know, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.What was done in consequence of that? - Mr. Davenport and my man, on Saturday, went down to Woolwich, and they came forward on Tuesday, and the Lord Mayor committed him for forgery. He discharged me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I see this note purports to be payable at the house of the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he lives there, No. 22, Golden-lane, Barbican? - Yes. He gave it me as his brother-in-law's.</p>
               <p>Q.It does not look much like a forgery, for a man to be in possession of a note payable at his own house. I believe you know, in point of fact, that he has a brother in-law of the name of Ball? - He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Saywell, with respect to these goods the prisoner had of you, you went to his house to reclaim these goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have a care what you say Mr. Saywell. On your oath, did not you take some goods that he had not had of you? - Upon my oath, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I would have you be cautious? - I shall be cautious. I took none but my own property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems the prisoner first made a charge of felony against you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And by way of doing away that charge you impute forgery to him? - He certainly gave me that note, and said it was his brother-in-law's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember taking away any black silk from the prisoner's house when you went to reclaim these goods? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you sold these goods to the prisoner, you gave him a bill of parcels? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, if it should turn out in the bill of parcels there is no black silk mentioned, what will you say to that? (The bill of parcels shewn him.) - There is raven grey, and that is black.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you had suspected this note not to be a good one, and had called at his house, and could not find him at home, on which you took the silk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He bought goods of you on the fifth and sixth. Did you give him a bill of parcels with these goods likewise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Another thing. His charge against you was heard before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you communicated at his house that that note was a bad one? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. This raven grey, does it pass for black silk? - It is a lighter die than black.</p>
               <p>Court. Were all the goods that you took away, goods that you had sold to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. You do distinguish between raven grey and black? - Yes, we do.</p>

               <p>Mr. Davenport. If it is not out of order, I would beg leave to state a circumstance, which I hope will operate greatly in favour of the prisoner. I had occasion to go to Mr. Saywell's, in order to go with his young man to the attorney, for the purpose of consulting what was best to do in this affair; and while I was there the prisoner at the bar came in along with two officers of justice, and he betrayed such a degree of wildness and distraction in his looks, and he acted with such a degree of anxiety on his mind that it struck me he was suffering under a temporary derangement of mind.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the two prisoners at the bar coming to your house? - Yes, on Monday, the 30th of April, Biddy Cane, about half an hour after four in the afternoon. She asked for half a quartern of gin, which I served her directly.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the price? - Three halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q.What did she tender you to change? - Sixpence marked with a letter G. on it, a very bad one. I had taken many such, which made me immediately know it. A little girl of a neighbour came in and says, that woman passes bad money, I knew her, and I immediately ordered her into custody. She was going to give me another out of her mouth, but the girl making that reply, she did not, she stopped. The little girl said, she passed it for her goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband in the way? - No, I sent for him; when he came she wanted to give a girl four sixpences, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200174"/>she would not take them, and she dropped them on the ground, and my husband picked them up. I believe she was immediately searched by the constable, she went into my back room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found? - Four shillings bad, and about three penny worth of halfpence to the best of my knowledge, the four shillings were in a box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the halfpence good or bad? - Very good, as halfpence goes now, such as pass.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see the other prisoner Conway? - At the door; my husband brought her in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Conway come in with her at first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She was brought in immediately after the other woman dropped the sixpence? - Yes, immediately after. I see her with her left hand take a sixpence out of her mouth, and let it fall on the left side of her, that I see.</p>
               <p>Q. Who picked up that sixpence? - Myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it good or bad? - Very bad. I gave it all I had to the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. You keep the King's Head, opposite Cripplegate-church? - Yes. I was sent for from a Smith's shop, that I keep up the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Conway there? - No; at that time I got up to my door she had left my door, and I got up as far as Mr. East's, in Whitecross-street; when I went into the house, I told the people to detain Cane, while I went for the other. Accordingly, I went out and told her, good woman, those is a dispute, and I will be glad if you will come back to settle it, I brought her back with the child in her arms. She was walking up Whitecross-street, from my house; accordingly I brought her back with me, and set her on the first bench, and I said, it was proper to send for an officer and have these women searched. Accordingly there was a neighbour came in, a milk woman that lives over the way, and she says, how do you do Mrs. Conway? and accordingly Biddy Cane put her hand to her mouth and took out some bad silver to give it her, and it dropped on the ground. A constable came in, and I told the costable it was proper to take her back to search her, and I took her, with the constable, into the back room, and found a Christmas box with four bad shillings in it.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you find on her? - About three or four penny worth of halfpence; middling to pass, so as to pay for what she called for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing on Conway? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you deliver the money you found? - To the constable; four sixpences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oliver. I gave two separate ones.</p>
               <p>Q. There was one that she tendered to you? - That I delivered first to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any mark on it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him another, did you tell him which was which? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury to Oliver. What reason had you to suppose that Conway was concerned in this business? - By a person that lived right opposite, who told me they were both concerned together.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Cane. I keep a house and have lodgers in it, and I had this money given me by one that had lodged with me, and had been to sea; I met him accidently in the street, he owed me twelve shillings, and he paid me six out of the twelve.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Conway. I took the sixpence for spinning of some hemo, not knowing whether it was good or bad. I ran away with the fright. My husband is serving his king and country, and I had no other way of getting my living but by spinning of hemp. I had some witnesses last session, but I have none this.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to deal with Mr. Saywell? - We have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever send that man for any silk? - Never; nor I never see him till I see him at the police office, Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How many partners have you? - Two.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that at separate times you give separate instructions? - Certainly. The prisoner never was in our employ at any time.</p>
               <p>Saywell. I never see him before, till he came to our house for this silk.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to he taken up? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that this is the man? - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Why he did not drop from the skies into the office, he was brought there by somebody? - He was brought there by the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. To Goodall. How came this man to be taken up? - In consequence of an information we received from a man of the name of Moss, and he undertook to take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the person? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. To Beaumont. Look at that man, was he ever in your employ? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Could your partners employ a man without your knowledge? - Certainly not. It is very seldom that we ever send for goods; we generally go ourselves, and the goods are sent by a porter.</p>
