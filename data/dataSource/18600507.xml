               <p>he allowed her to make use of them during the day; and she had a room on the third floor, for which she paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she said that her friend was a brother officer serving in the same regiment with her husband—I gave her half-a-crown and told her I would see what I could do for her—I called again next day and left her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she called at my shop on 7th July and I gave her a letter of recommendation to the German Benevolent Society; they allowed her a sovereign, which I took to her on the following day; she thanked me and I thought I had done with her, but about the middle of August she called again with the child; she cried, and was in great distress—I enquired how it was she waa not better off; she said that all the money I had given her went for the purpose of paying the interest on pawn tickets for goods of some value which she had pawned—I told her it was no charity for her to receive money to pay the interest on pawn tickets—she said that she did not know what to do with them—I suggested that it would be better to sell the tickets than be paying twenty per cent. interest to a pawnbroker; it being quite impossible under her present circumstances to redeem them—she said that nobody would buy them, and she could only retain them as long as the goods would be redeemable—I said that I would look over the tickets if she brought them, and see whether the articles were of any use or value to me; and she brought about twenty-three tickets to me on the same day; consisting of silks, shirts, and other trifling articles—I questioned her whether she had come fairly by them; she said that she had brought them from Germany or Vienna where her husband had been in quarters, and if I should like to have them, she would give them to me altogether for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. so as to get money immediately, and do some business—I thought the goods were worth more than the money for which they were pledged, and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I arranged that they should be taken out of pawn—I gave my foreman 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he did so—he then sorted them; and one third which I considered of no use to me I returned to her—these were female's clothes and coats; the other two thirds were sorted out; and having ascertained the value of the silks, they were left at my shop, and my people had instructions to ask my friends to buy, but they all said that the price was too high; they consequently remained at my shop till October, and during that period she had repeatedly received money; it amounted to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. including the 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was beyond the full value; they had been in pawn and were knocked about—during that period I saw her once or twice only, because I was out of town—after my return I received a communication which caused me to go to Charlotte-street—I made a list of the money which she had drawn, and gave her a few shillings to go on with—she came to me on 18th October, 1857, in a state of illness—the child was not with her—(I believe she had brought the child on two other-occasions)—she said that she had been very ill in consequence of having a child, and had had Dr. Stancoff, who had advised her to go to the German Hospital, which she decidedly refused—I could not get rid of her, and to pacify her I said that I would send my doctor, Mr. Louth of Brook-street, to see her, and he did—during her illness I frequently called to see how she was getting on—up to the period of her illness I had never seen Edward De Welzenstein, or Jourdan; but one evening when I called, Madame Jourdan was there, or rather Madame Poninska she called herself—I first saw her about three days after 18th October—Madame De Welzenstein said during her illness, that her friend Sternfeldt's wife would not allow her to occupy the bed, as she might have a disease which might be dangerous; and she was to occupy a sofa in the front room—she was ill about thirteen</p>

               <p>or fourteen days; Poninska was not present on the occasions when I spoke I about Sternfeldt—I saw her about three days after the doctor first called; and when she heard my name she said that she was most happy in haying met me on such a good occasion, and would I come and see her—I did not see her there again till a fortnight after, on a Sunday, but she said scareely anything—they were at tea—I had occasion to go there about 6 o'clock—De Welzenstein had some work at Eaton-piace—Madame Poninsks wished me to get some work for her among my Mends as she had known her some time, that she was a most excellent woman whose husband had gone away, and all that story over again—I had no reason to disbelieve her—she said that Sternfeldt was merely a friend who was very kind to her, and assisted her as much as he could, but believed his means were not very large, and he could not entirely support Madame De Welzenstein out of the means that he had, having a wife who was ill herself—when De Welzeustein got better I told her that I should be glad if she would send her friend to me, as I could arrange with a man about her future position much better than I could with her, and if he would come to me I would talk the matter over with him; and he did call at the latter end of October at my place of business, and said, "I have been asked by Madame De Welzenstein to call on you; my name is Sternfeldt, you wish to see me"—I said, "I have done a good deal, and she is not in a better condition that when I first knew her"—I related the case of the sale of the tickets, and asked him if he had seen the note I had made of the tickets, and if he was satisfied, as the friend of Madame De Welzenstein—he said, "Yes; you have paid much more thai the value of it"—I said, "I do not mind, provided I have done some good to her;" and referred to that I had done—he said, "Unfortunately what you have done she has very little benefit out of, because she was so deeply in debt to a variety-of people, who came as soon as they found she had some money"—he stated that he had known her and her husband in the Austrian service, that De Welzenstein was a most honourable man, and he could only speak in the best terms of Madame De Welzenstein, and had supported her in her husband's absence, who had gone to America in search of an uncle—he gave me the address, but it was simply "New York"—I did not keep the paper, I agreed to communicate with America—he said that he was in the same Austrian regiment with the husband, who was superior to him, and that he regretted much that they had not had any information from the husband since he had gone, and could not account for his not writing to his wife, as he was such an excellent honour<lb/>able man, and it was quite uncertain when he would be back—at the interview with Madame De Welzenstein, I said that I must Bpeak to Madame Poninska, as a better woman of business, as to how to put her into something; and I Baw her, I suppose, the next day at her place in Mount-street—she asked me to come and see her and to speak about the position of this woman—she repeated that she was in a position to recommend Madame De Welzenstein to customers when she was in a respectable lodging to receive them, and of course she wanted some ineanb—on a Sunday evening in October, about 4 o'clock, I called at Charlotte-street, and found the four prisoners all together, and a person named Watford—I did not stay more than twenty minutes, because the people were all unknown to me, except seeing Madame Paninska about twice, and Sternfeldt having called on me once a day or two before, at my house, between 18th and 26th October—when I left, Madame De Welzenstein followed me down stairs; she complained that she was still very ill, and that it was very wrong for Sternfeldt to have brought company to</p>

               <p>the house on a Sunday without bringing a servaut to wait on them—subse<lb/>quently to that visit, a person named Corn came to me, and in consequence of that I went a day or two afterwards to 5, Charlotte-street—I knocked at the door and asked the servant whether Madame De Welzenstein was within, she said, "Yes"—I was in a cab, and she came down at my request—I told her that Corn had stated to me that she and the person named Sternfeldt were man and wife, that her name was Statina, and that the child which she exhibited as her own was one she had borrowed—she asked me where I had the information from; and when I told her the name, Corn, she said, "How could you believe such a scoundrel as that man is?" and denied it entirely—I then left, after asking if Freicke who lived in the house was at home, and if she would send him to me at the club—the club and the society meet in one house—Freicke called, and I told him that Mr. and Mrs. Corn had called at my house and stated that Madame De Welzenstein and Sternfeldt were man and wife, and that the child was a borrowed one, and I wanted him to tell me the truth how the matter stood—I said, "You must be aware of the facts, and I want to know from you how it is"—he said that Corn was a liar and a swindler, and in fact everything that was bad, and he very much regretted that his sister, Mrs. Corn, should be a party to such a false transaction; that it was all a fabrication of Corn's, and advised me to see Corn again and get proof of the fact—I called on Madame De Welzen<lb/>stein the same day, and said, "I am afraid the case in Charlotte-street is not quite so clear as you have represented to me"—after relating the circumstances, she asked who had given the information—I said, "Corn;" she burst out, and asked how I could be such a dupe as to be imposed upon by such a person as him, that I ought to have known better and not have believed it—she then told me she would bring me proof that it was all a fabri<lb/>cation—Madame Poninska afterwards called at my place twice; the second time she found me at home, and asked me to come with her to Charlotte-street to see the truth that the child was not a borrowed one—I got into a cab with her and drove to 5, Charlotte-street—we were asked up stairs and shown into the first room—two females were in the back room, Madame Bordfeldt and Madame De Welzenstein, but nobody else—after some general conversation, one of the women went out and brought up the child which I had seen with Madame De Welzenstein before—Madame Bordfeldt spoke to the child and coaxed her, stroked her face, and said, "Go and bring your mamma"—she desired me to sit down on a chair and listen—the child went straight away and brought Madame De Welzenstein—she said,"Is this your mamma?" the child said, "Yes"—she then said, "Are you satisfied, Sir?"—I said, "Not quite"—I said to the child, "Who is that other lady?"—she said, "That is aunt De Bordfeldt;" "Now," said she, "Are you satisfied?" and if you are not, you must be an unbelieving Jew"—the farce was then over, and I thought it was all right—during the next week or fortnight Madame Poninska called on me, and also sent letters; she invariably reverted to the circumstances of Madame De Welzenstein, and the trick that Corn played, and how unfortunate she was—of course I regretted it, and she asked me if I would be good enough to go and see Madame De Welzenstein, as she was in a most dreadful state of mind under the circum<lb/>stances, and that I should be perfectly satisfied by her future conduct that she was a respectable woman—I went about 8 in the evening and found Madame De Welzenstein by herself—after being there a few minutes she had said nothing, and I had very little to say—I said that I called at the request of Madame Poninska, and that I understood she kit very much hurt</p>

               <p>at my believing the imposition of Corn; that I was informed so and was I obliged to enquire, and she ought not to blame me in it, it was Mr. Corn—she said, "I am most happy to find that I have met you, you have been like a father to me, you are my saviour"—I went about kissing my hands—just as I this was taking place, the door opened and I saw a head, but could not I recognize the person as I had not my spectacles on—she jumped up, and I said, "What is that?"—she said, "It is Sternfeldt"—I said, "Why does not he come in"—I heard an extraordinary <hi rend="italic">screech</hi> and it rather startled me—she ran towards the door, and they went into the back room—the door between the two rooms was not open—I heard a very loud con<lb/>versation and stood three or four minutes; nobody came—I thought it was not a very pleasant position, and thought of Corn and that perhaps it might have been a trap—I went away, and in about an hour and a half, Madame De Welzenstein and the woman called at the club—I went and asked what, they wanted—she said that her friend Sternfeldt had made such an extraor<lb/>dinary assertion, and would I be good enough to go home with her and explain to him that what she did was nothing wrong at all—I refused to go, because I thought the woman had insulted me, and did not go; I promised to write a letter and state what had occurred, as she said that it would be of great com<lb/>sequence to her when her husband came home from America—I wrote the letter next day and left it myself at 5, Charlotte-street—from that time I never heard anything more about the occurrence at the house on that night, until the action was brought—soon after the letter. I have spoken of, I called on Madame Poninska at her place in Mount-street—I had a conversation there with her and with a person who was there who represented himself as Sternfeldt—that must have been a few days after; a couple of days—<hi rend="italic">what took place was respecting taking the house</hi>—I believe Madame Poninska introduced the matter; she stated it to be the best, and that Sternfeldt had ample means to furnish the house, and it only depended on Madame De Welzenstein having some money to furnish the ground floor, which she was to occupy for the purpose of carrying on the business of a milliner—Sternfeldt seemed to take it as a matter of course; he had sufficient at the time, he was certain of it—he said he should have means coming from Vienna—that applied to the means of furnishing the place; and Madame Poninsks proposed that a subscription should be made, and a raffle—that matter I dare say occupied three or four days, con<lb/>sulting about the means—Madame Poninska told me that Sternfeldt had no money at present, but that his wife was in possession of jewellery which she would partly pawn; and as a proof that sfie had them, she pulled out a pawn ticket from her pocket which dropped on the ground, she picked it up, and it was for a diamond bracelet that she had pawned the same day for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Madame Poninska told me that Sternfeldt had means, and the wife was, she believed, some person of very great consequence in j Germany, and that they married privately, that he was not Sternfeldt, that he; was a nobleman of large property—a fortnight I think elapsed before they could get a house, because they could not get any reference, and Madame Poninska proposed that she would be part towards paying the 201. that was required for furnishing the ground floor for Madame de Welzenstein, if I could give reference for the house, which after some deal of persuasion on the part of Madame Poninska, I consented, more particularly as I knew the landlord—Sternfeldt once asked me to accompany him down to the place where likely houses might be to let, and I did so—when we were at Pimlico, and he had consented to take the house, I said I understood his</p>

               <p>name was not Sternfeldt, and I expected he should tell me who he was, and take the house in his real name, as I did not wish to have any more fiction about it—at the time I had this conversation with him they had found a house in Eccleston-terrace—he said that he had left Austria for having been implicated in political matters, and he was obliged to go away; in fact, he had been in arrest and made his escape with a forged passport; consequently he was obliged to retain that name; but his name was not that, his name was Edgar Von Schwannenfelt; we usually oall them Baron, it defines the same position as an English baron—he afterwards came to me, and said he had taken the house, and he removed there immediately, and I paid for the carting of the furniture—I gave to Madame Welzenstein 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was to furnish the ground floor for her to carry on the business—I afterwards received a note from him, asking if I would not come to see him at his new lodging—I went there, and I necessarily made inquiry about the progress of the furniture, where it had gone to—the place was not at all furnished, no progress was made—I asked him the reason, and he said his means from Vienna had not arrived, and Madame Poninska, who had promised to assist him had failed, and consequently he could not go on at all, and he asked me if I would not lend him some money—I lent him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion, and took this I O U from him—I wrote the body of the I O U and he signed it—about a week subsequently he made an application to me for further assistance, and I then lent him 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—for that he signed this I O U—I wrote it myself in his presence, and in the presence of Madame Welzenstein—he showed me a large number of letters, which I did not read, several of them showing that the bearer was So-and-so, with large seals in front—several letters were addressed to my house—some progress was subsequently made in furnishing the house—I occasionally called there—in April the next year I called there one evening—they were at variance about some matters, and some expressions were used by Madame Welzenstein which caused me subsequently to say something to her—the next time I called she was by herself, and I told her that from what I had noticed and from various circumstances I had seen, it was perfectly evident to me that he and she must be man and wife, and unless she told me there and then I certainly would not relieve her in any other way; in fact I would not in any way, and I would get my money back in the best way I could—she said that they were man and wife—I asked her how she came to tell me such a number of different stories about her career—she said as she had given a full history of her life to the Austrian embassy, which history she knew that Count Kotheck had given me to read, and Count Apponyi had promised on the strength of that history to intercede with her uncle, who was an Austrian field-marshal—that she was obliged to tell me the story that Sternfeldt was not her husband—it was also stated in the letter to Count Apponyi that she had a child—on that occasion Sterufeldt was not at home—she said if I considered their I distressed state, the letters written to the embassy, and the various circumstances, I would surely forgive her the imposition she had practised upon me, and she begged me not to tell her husband that she had revealed the facts to me—I thought it might be likely, and I wrote a letter and asked him to confess that he was her husband—I called at their place—he made a large number of apologies—he said their circumstances were such, and having once written to the ambassador, they could not possibly deviate from it, and they were obliged to carry it through, but that I should very shortly be convinced of their respectability, and also that any money I had advanced should be shortly paid—I then said, that knowing they were man and wife, it was</p>

               <p>impossible for me to support them any further, and they must do their beat, they could not let lodgings—this letter of 13th May, 1858, is Welzenstein's writing; it came to me by post—(<hi rend="italic">This letter being ready implored the witness to aid him in Meeting a bill which was coming due on the 15th instant</hi>)—before this time he had handed or sent to me that which he called a history of his life—this produced is it—in consequence of this letter I advanced the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Welzenstein—I think it was about three or four days afterwards, at my own house, or rather in front of the bank—a female called at my house on 13th May for an answer to the letter—thia letter is also Welzenstein's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 27th May, 1858, and was put in and read</hi>)—I did not reply to that letter—they called repeatedly at my house, Madame Welzenstein particularly—in June, Welzenstein sent to me about the rent—I went down and he told me that the rent had been already due for the previous quarter, and there were various debts about the place, and they were not able to let the house for some cause or another which he did not know—they wanted to let the upper part of the house, and they had not let it; in fact, they had taken no money—there was a person there for a week, and they had not paid—in consequence of what they told me about their difficulties I advised them to move away from the house, for of course there was the difficulty of paying the rent—I then suggested to him that he could not move the furniture without having paid the rent and the tradespeople in the neighbourhood, and I suggested they should be sold by auction and the proceeds go to pay his debts, and with the remainder take some smaller lodging—he told me he owed from 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he subsequently handed me this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as an inventory of the furniture, and the value of it—it is in his own handwriting—this states the value to be 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he gave me a list of debts that he owed, which came to about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave him altogether 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in order to pay all his debts—the furniture was to be sold at Oxenham's—the mosey was to be given to me and I was to give him any surplus that remained—the furniture was sold there—I received 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd as the produce of the sale—there was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for expenses—shortly after, in September, in consequence of something I heard about the way in which the money had been disposed of, I told him that he had misinformed me as to having paid all his debts—he had previously told me that he had positively paid every shilling he owed, and he showed me some receipts—I told him that the butcher had called, whom he had not paid, consequently he had deceived me—he said the deception must have bean, practised by his wife, he was not aware of it; he had givan her the money—when they left Eccleston-terrace, they moved to lodgings in Seymour-street, and then into Manchester-street—the reason of selling the furniture was for the purpose of goiug to America, and the surplus money was to furnish the passage money, which was minus my debt of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Welzenstein then complained that he was worse off than he had been before—I stated "If you, choose to go to America, as I have relieved you so far, if you take your wife with you, I will give you 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of taking you off;" which 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I consider you—(<hi rend="italic">a part of the letter here was burnt</hi>)—that you will destroy this. I remain your friend, J. Stohwasser"—"October 22d, 1858. Esteemed Mrs. Von Welzenstein. Manage matters this evening that Mr. Freicke is not there, and that you are alone—I will call upon you, and we will talk about the bazaar—I hope to find you well to<lb/>night, and that you will lay aside your resistance, for nothing will be of avail to you any longer—all obstacles are removed, and I think I have been waiting long enough—<hi rend="smallCaps">J. STHOWASSER</hi>."—several of the words and letters in those letters are similar to my writing—I call it a tolerably fair imita<lb/>tion to the best of my belief—I heard Madam Jourdan swear that the letter she produced, I handed to her—that is not true, I did not give her that letter; I never saw it before it was produced in the Queen's Bench at the trial, nor the one produced by Madame Welzenstein either.</p>

               <p>the Austrian embassy about three weeks before I brought the affair before the German society—Count Kotheck subsequently showed me a roll of paper, about 10 sheets, which was said to be got from Madame Welzenstein—this is the cheque for 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I gave to pay the execution. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 30th October, 1858, on the Western Bank of London</hi>). I believe I only saw any person from the embassy once in reference to these people—that was when the Count called on me—I saw Count Apponyi last year—I returned the paper that Count Kotheck brought me—I kept it about a day—I received the letter signed "Sternfeldt" the same day that the Count called, relating the circumstances in a similar way as the Count told me; the Count said to me, "You being in London, may be able to make inquiries about the woman, she is a most deserving woman as far as we believe:" I am not aware that the embassy ever furnished any funds to give her: not through me—all the monies I have spoken of except the pound came out of my own pocket—I paid two visits to the residence of these people during the three weeks that elapsed between the time I saw the Count at the German Society—I did not see Madame Welzenstein more than twice elsewhere in that interval—I think it was about a fortnight after I got her the money from the Society that she came to me with the pawn tickets—I can't positively say how many pawn tickets there were; more than twenty—I do not exactly remember the quantity of things that were pawned—there was a large quantity of silk amongst it, I should think more than 100 yards—there were four sheets—I do not know of any silk cushions—there were two feather pillows covered with silk—there was a quantity of damask table-cloths of about twenty yards not made up, and also some pieces of damask napkins—there was not a great quantity of towelling, not above half-a-dozen or a dozen yards I should think—I can't say exactly, because, as I said before, after the things were taken out of pawn, they were lying in my shop, and we offered them to various persons for sale—some were bought by Baron Nicholay, a customer of mine, and he left 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which Madame Welzenstein had—I can't tell how many towels that quantity of damask would make—there was not enough to make three, dozen—there was not a quantity of French embroidery, you would not call it so if you saw it—there is a pattern of it (<hi rend="italic">producing a piece</hi>)—no person who knows anything about cotton would call it embroidery—I call it printed cotton—this is what they called French embroidery—there was a hassock covered with velvet—there were some china plates and some larger plates, and some glass which they called antique—I do not recollect a bronze console for I a clock—there were some sheets, and two shawls—I could not state what things they were, that I handed back to Madame De Welzenstein—there were a few things of wearing apparel, shifts, and a variety of other things—I did not hand back any of the things you have read—I was obliged I to keep them—I could not sell them—at the time I was getting these things I heard that her husband was in America—it did not occur to me that I ought not to have bought them of a married woman whose husband was away—it was on 18th October, that she became ill; that was perhaps six weeks after the sale—she appeared very miserable when she was ill—I sup<lb/>pose I piqued her—I used to go into her bed-room, and saw her lying in bed several times—each time I called she was in bed—I always used to call at night—I can't say that I was particularly attentive to her; I once gave her a cup of tea—it was not necessary to put my arm round her to enable her to drink it, she could sit perfectly upright in bed—I did not help her to sit up—I am perfectly sure of that—I never put my hand round her when</p>

               <p>she was in bed—I once gave her a partridge—I took it with me in my pocket one Sunday when I went there, and I sent her soup from the German Club at my expense, and they sent her generally at dinner-time as much as should last her the whole day—I took the partridge to her ready cooked, it was wrapped up in a piece of paper by my wife—I did not tell my wife that I was going to give it her in bed—I told her I was going to see her—I think the partridge and the soup were the only delicacies I took her during her illness—I will swear it—I took the partridge myself—what the proprietor of the hotel sent I could not positively say—I should think I visited her twice in a week, I could not positively say—I may have been two or three times in a week—it is three years ago—that went on during the time she was ill—I may have been to various women in their bed-rooms if they were ill—nobody was present on the occasions when I visited her, except once or twice the servant was in the room while I was there—she did not always remain in the room all the time I was there—she came up while I was there and walked away again—I remained talking and chatting very friendly—she had been ill about three weeks, perhaps less, when Sternfeldt came to me—I cannot positively say the day—Sternfeldt told me directly he came in that at my request he had come to see me respecting something that was to be done for Madame De Welzenstein, for the purpose of setting her up in busi<lb/>ness—he introduced himself as Sternfeldt, and said that he was the person who was sent by Madame—he said, "I am Mr. Sternfeldt, you have requested me to call"—I may not have asked him whether his name was Sternfeldt—I have not got the address that he left with me, it was lost or thrown away because it was of no consequence—I should think it must have been about the first week in November that he called upon me—that was the first time I had seen him—I swear that—I am not quite sure whether it was on 26th October that I called at their house, and saw tax persons there, I am not positive as to the date—His Lordship said the 26th, and I said, "Yes"—I did go to the house on 26th October—I did not see the six persons at the house at supper before Sternfeldt called on me he had been at my house before, and I afterwards called on Sunday—if you will bear in mind that to tell every circumstance of these transactions three years ago, is almost impossible, so strongly as you want me to do, and when you have not the slightest idea at the time, and when persons come and make it their business to assist persons of this kind—I may have sworn that I saw them on 26th October—I either saw Sternfeldt first at my house, or I saw the whole of them first at the house in Charlotte-street—I really could not tell which it was—I remained about twenty minutes that Sunday when I called—I joined them at supper but partook of nothing—I was introduced to the party, their names were men<lb/>tioned—I do not know whether it was before or after that supper, that Sternfeldt called—I have no mode of discovering or telling you—I should think it was a week after that Sunday that I saw Mr. Corn; he is an Hungarian refugee—he was not employed by this German Society—he was occasionally relieved by the Society before he was better known, but when they found out what he was, they would have nothing to do with him—I had given him relief out of my own pocket some twelve months before that—it was long before the story that he told me about the De Wellzen<lb/>steins, that he was found out to be no better than he should be—I knew he was a bad character when I told the story—this affair of the child was about the middle of November, from the 6th to the 12th—I had not been visiting frequently there before then—I had about once a week—I will swear I</p>

               <p>only went once a week—I am not as sure of that as I was about 26th October, because as soon as she got better, I did not see the necessity of calling—I heard from the evidence in the Queen's Bench only, that the assault took place on 7th December—I generally went there after I left off work, going round to the club; it was half-past 7 or 8, not later—Madame de Welzenstein was always by herself—she was generally in the sitting room when she was well—I sometimes stayed a qnarter of an hour, and sometimes an hour, not administering charitable consolation—she used to tell me about her misfortunes and I remained listening—I did not always give her money when I went—she did uot exhaust her story after that repeated number of visits, there was always something very fresh—if I was a good deal excited by it, perhaps you might have been the same if you had seen the person—there was always a lamp in the room, because a lamp gives a better light than a candle—there were two sofas in the room—I had been there somewhere about 10 minutes on the night of the assault, when some man put his head in at the door—I was generally so uncivil as to have my hat on—I do so in a lady's presence when I see a poor person, because I like to leave when I like—my hat aud gloves were on on that occasion—I was not near the sofa—I was between the table and the fire-place—the <hi rend="italic">screech</hi> I heard was from a man, I suppose—I thought it was Sternfeldt—it must have been either a <hi rend="italic">screech</hi> of surprise, or an attempt at surprise—after the wife left the room, I heard two people talking very loudly in the next room as if they were quarrelling, and after three or four minutes I went away—I did not inquire what the quarrelling was about, there was no occasion—I only saw Sternfeldt twice, I knew who he was—she came after me that night to the club, and said that Sternfeldt had made an extraordinary assertion, which was, he accused her of taking improper liberties with me—she asked me if I would be good enough to go back with her and explain to him that the position she was in was nothing improper—she told me the quarrelling had been about that—I did not go back at once and explain the transaction; I wrote a letter—I considered myself insulted by his manner; he ought to have come in, and not opened the door and slammed it in that way; it was rude, and I did not go back—I met Sternfeldt the next day, and he said that he was perfectly satisfied with the explanation I had made—I told him he need not explain it any further—he did not afterwards tell me he had destroyed the letter, and I never suggested it to him—he did not send me an answer to that letter—I saw him, I should think, ten or twelve days after I wrote it—I did not, as soon as he said he was satisfied, suggest that the letter might be destroyed—I said nothing about the letter—about two days afterwards, I called on Madame Poninska, she said that she was very ill—I said, "What is the, I matter?"—she said, "He is partly out of his mind, as something has occurred I to him;" and I did not see him for about ten days—when I did see him, I am quite sure I did not say, "Let it be all forgotten, and let the letter be destroyed"—when it was suggested that they should go into that house in Eccleston-street, the ground floor was to be made into a milliner's, and Sternfeldt was to take the upper part of the house—I gave a reference—no person came to me upon it, but I called upon an auctioneer, Mr. Goldsmith—other persons came to me, to whom I did not give other references—I said to Mr. Goldsmith that they had been recommended to me by a very respec<lb/>table person, who was Madame Pouinska, and that I had known them for some time, and that he was a Baron; a nobleman of large property—we saw several houses—it did uot occur to me that it was very strange to call</p>

               <p>himself Sternfeldt in one week and Baron De Swanfeldt another week—I did not tell Goldsmith one word about this former deceit—when I gave Madame De Welzenstein 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to furnish this house, I did not get any voucher from her—it was in gold—all the money, I gave these persons was gold, except the cheque—I have no memoranda of these large sums of money which I say I have paid to them from time to time—I used not to put my hand in the till and fetch the money, I sometimes wrote a cheque and fetched it from the bank, because I do not like to give cheques to persons I do not know—he was a Baron, but if I gave him a cheque I must cross it, and then how was he to get it? that was the reason I always gave sovereigns—no human being out of the dock ever saw me give the prisoners a farthing—I keep a cash-book—when I make a gift of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I make no entry in the business accounts, but I have my own accounts—these sums are not entered in tho private accounts—this is not the only occasion when I have given money to this extent—I have given 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. away to poor persons—some have paid me, some have not—the female prisoner was by when he signed the I O U—the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a cheque I drew on my banker—I do not think I kept the cheques—I gave him the money in gold, I may have got it at my bankers—I did not get this from my bankers—I cannot say that this 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or the I O U was got on a cheque drawn by me on my bankers—I said so just now because you put so many questions that I got perfectly coufueed—I am perfectly sure that I opened my drawer, took out 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and lent that—I am pecfectly sure of that—I gave instructions for an action to be brought on these two I O U's—I did not abandon that action—I know it was not tried—I said to my attorney, "I will leave it entirely in your hands;" I did not instruct him at all—Mr. Lewis had better answer the question, because I do not know what you mean—he has not told me that he had abandoned the action—I have not asked him what has become of my claim for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on two occasions, because I know it is in my pocket—I did not visit them at Eccleston-terrace very often: not once a month; occasionally—the door was usually opened by Freicke, and I said, "Are they at home?" and walked in without saying any more—I used to ask the boy whether his master or mistress were at home—I did not usually mention the name—I do not know that they passed over the whole neighbourhood under the name of De Welzenstein—she went in that name at the house—I first heard that Sternfeldt was passing under the name of De Welzenstein, somewhere about the end of March or of April—Madame De Welzenstein told me that his name was De Welzenstein—they had been living in the house about three months at that time—I only once had refreshment there—that was not after I found out that his name was De Welzenstein—I had it with the two parties together—I was very ill in the cab, and I asked them if they had got a drop of brandy in the house—I did not know that they were man and wife, and when I saw them together I never believed it—I did not give a reference with them to many other places besides that—there was a person named Shrul who I knew very well, but he never referred to me about these people—I went once to him to inquire whether he knew whether she was not De Welzenstein—that was at the early part, when Corn gave information—I requested him to go and prove what he had stated, but he refused—he did not tell me her name was De Welzenstein—he said that her name was Statina—that man (<hi rend="italic">A policeman</hi>,) may have been in my shop, but I do not recollect his face—I have no knowledge whatever of a conversation with him about the Do Welzonsteins and about some clothes—I do not</p>

               <p>money, and on another occasion I left money in the cook's shop—there was not a sofa in Lisle-street at first nor did one come afterwards exactly, it belonged to the things that were seized, and as I had paid 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it remained there for the purpose of being covered—it is not there now—I never kissed her in Lisle-street, that I swear; nor did I sit with her on that sofa—I always sat on a chair with my hat on—my gloves might be on—I do not know where she moved to from Lisle-street, I never visited her after—I went to Duke-street in 1857 to a tailor, a friend of mine, named Ritters-camp, who said, "Are you answerable for her respectability?"—I said, "Yes;" and paid the rent for her for the first quarter—I looked out for lodgings for her because she could not talk English—I mentioned Madame De Welzenstein to my friend Ritterscamp as the person I wanted to take lodgings for—he was formerly one of my workmen—I will undertake to swear I did not give a different name to Ritterscamp or the woman's name; how could I?—I asked him if he would take a person in, and said that the person's name was De Welzenstein—Madame De Welzenstein met me in the street and stopped me very often, that was in February 1859—she kept that up during the whole of the month a good deal, stopping me every night—I have seen her write, I swear that; and I will tell you the occasion too—she produced a marriage certificate at Little St. Thomas-Apostle, City—I asked her if she would give it to me because I wanted to see whether it was genuine—I said, "Be good enough to write your name on the back of the paper," and she did so on Sunday morning, and I took it to the Church and asked leave to compare it with the register, but the man could not satisfy my inquiry, and I took no further notice of that bit of writing—when it was produced before me in the Court of Queen's Bench I said that I did not know it—I do not remember whether the Lord Chief Justice called her upand asked her whether it was her writing—you have got a short-hand writer there—it was only last February, but I have a good deal to do and cannot remember a little trifle—I remember the Judge calling her, and I suppose she came up and that he put the paper before her—that was the paper you showed me just now—I saw the Lord Chief Justice write on it, and should think this is the paper he wrote on—I could not swear it, but His Lordship ordered it to be impounded, and there it is—I have taken no trouble to ascertain whether it is true that Madame De Welzenstein is the daughter of an Austrian field-marshal.</p>

               <p>was in English—she does not speak English; she speaks German—I have never had any conversation with her in English, and don't know whether she understands it—the pawn tickets were there—she wanted to sell them—she wanted Mr. Stohwasser to give her 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and take them, because she wanted money—he said that he would not buy them, and talked to me and said that we were not dealers in pawn tickets—it was a very interesting child, with no father to work for him; and we came to an understanding to get the things out of pawn, and make the best effort for her, and not for ourselves—there were a number of tickets—Mr. Stohwasser afterwards gave me the money to redeem the articles—she did not leave all the tickets, she left about 23 or 24—Mr. Stohwasser reckoned up the capital and the interest, and gave me 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to start with, with which I took the pawn tickets, and took the things out of pledge—I paid upwards of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., got the goods, and brought them to Mr. Stohwasser's shop—they consisted of a good many lengths of silk, sheets, damask—I cannot recollect the whole of them, because I had everything in a memorandum book, which I bought for the purpose; but it is so many years ago that I cannot recollect—Mr. Stohwasser directed me to have some of the things valued, and I took some of them to Hodge and Lowman's, the silk mercers, who valued them, and wrote the value on little slips; and I reported to Mr. Stohwasser what I had done—after I had done that, the woman came to the shop again—Mr. Stohwasser spoke to her, and said that the things which were of no use to us, such as a woman's dress, and a second-hand coat, she might take away when she liked—he gave up about one-third of them, or a little better—I made it the best of my business to ascertain the worth of the other things, and Mr. Stohwasser told her that he would get rid of them the best way he could—I remember he gave her some money, in the shop, from time to time, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, it may be more or less, on account of these things, and when the settling day came she had overdrawn the constable—she came to me, and I gave her some small sums of money, and Mr. Stohwasser said to me, "If you want to give away money, do not give it away without my permission"—he gave her other sums, including the 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have relieved her once or twice—she was always very much obliged—I did so because she said she had no money; and as Mr. Stohwasser was out of town, I gave her a trifle on account—she was very thankful indeed; always very pleased: she used to try to kiss Mr. Stohwasser's hand—I believe it is a fashion where she comes from; to show her gratitude, I suppose—he did not like it; he got out of the way the best way he could, and I have heard him tell her not to have any of that nonsense—the 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the full value of the stock—I would not value it so high, but I had an interest for her, and in the interesting child, which she called her daughter—I did the best I could, not to wrong my governor, for which she was very thankful.</p>

I am an interpreter—I was in attendance at the Queen's Bench on this trial—before the trial came on, I saw Madame Poninsks at the Guildhall, Westminster—I did not speak to her then only to say "Good morning"—she had spoken to me at her own house some days before I had business transactions for her—on this occasion I think she sent for me—I went down and found Mr. De Welzenstein there: he asked me if I was engaged in this matter to act as interpreter, I said "Not on the part of the defendant, Mr. Stohwasser, because he did not require one," but I certainly should be there to prove the translations, and therefore I could undertake to act as interpreter for the plaintiff; nobody could object to that; and I would act as such if they would engage me—at that time. I had only heard about this case; I did not know much about it myself—they told me what they thought was necessary to understand the matter, in order to be aware of the case a little—Madame Poninska said it was a pity that Mr. Stohwasser should be exposed in this way, and one thing and another, and that he had already offered 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to settle the matter; but that was not enough, and if I would interfere perhaps another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would settle the matter; 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would do it, and I should be handsomely rewarded—De Welzenstein was there at this time, and he also promised me, I think he, mentioned, the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I could bring about a settlement—I don't think much more was said on that occasion, but a day or two afterwards I went for a letter, a document, or something, I don't know how it was; and then Madam Poninska asked me how the matter stood, and if I had been to Mr. Stohwasser—I said I had not been, that I did not like to mix myself up in the case one way or the other—she said "If he does not settle it, Monday morning is the last day; perhaps he thinks we have no money to go on with it, but in this he is quite mistaken, because I can show you that we have money to go on with," and she said she had just given to Mr. De Welzenstein</p>

I am the wife of John Black, of Billiter-street—I went out on 1st May, left my door securely locked, and took the key with me; I had it in my hand when I returned—I was gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, the door of my room was wide open when I returned, and the prisoner coming out—I would not let him pass me, he wanted to escape, and he was speaking something that I did not understand—I scuffled with him down the stairs and called "Thief"—a young man named John Stainton who was in the house assisted me—when a policeman came, I went into my room—I missed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. off my drawers by the side of a little tea-caddy—the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was rather plain on the <hi rend="italic">wreath</hi> side—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I was in this house where the last witness lodges on 1st May last, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I went out, and saw the prisoner escaping down the landing—he tried to get away, when he was on the landing he was rather too quick for me, but in running down the stairs he slipped and fell—I ran down after him, caught him, and gave him in charge—I kept him till the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman, of White Conduit-street, Pentonville—on 18th March, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was going along South Conduit-street, Bethnal-green, arm in arm with my wife—I saw the prisoner and two others coming towards me; I made way for them to pass—on their coming up, one of the prisoner's companions made a blow at my head, which was stayed by the rim of my hat, and the prisoner made a grasp at my watch, which was in my waistcoat pocket—he did not get it; he got hold of my waistcoat, and I felt a sharp tug at my pocket—on that I turned round and there was my brother-in-law—he tried to secure the prisoner, and we were surrounded by a great number of men and boys—the others escaped—the policeman came up and I went into the next street and pointed out the prisoner—the moment I charged him he knocked the officer down, and either he or his companions knocked me down—a large crowd was collected—I was knocked down and lost my breath.</p>

The landlady says she never saw me but twice, and if I had been living there I must have been there more than twice in a week; the coin was in my possession, but the moulds were not.</p>

I had taken change for half-a-crown down in the City, and if the shilling was bad I did not know it.</p>

                  </hi>.

Morris's cigars—I particularly recognize these eight bundles, as being made from a new quality of Havannah tobacco—these were the first that were made from it—some of these I had made up on the night previous to the robbery, and put this ribbon round them on the night previous to the robbery—this ribbon was brought in previous to the robbery, and the first time of using it I put it round these cigars—we had thirty-four lbs. of that kind, and they were all gone—when I saw these cigars at the prisoner's bar, some were in a case, but the principal part were in two boxes on the floor—they were intermixed, but have all been sorted—some are worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., some 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., some 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., some 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., some 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., some 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and some 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told the prisoner they were our cigars, he said, "Had I known you had been coming I would have cut my throat."</p>

April I paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for; that was the value of them at cost price—the cigars I bought on the first and second occasions were not from the prisoner personally, but he was in the room—he used to go round with a box of cigars—I had never been there before—there were lots of people in the room—there is singing and concerts there, and persons sit there and smoke and drink—when I said to him, "These are our cigars," the officer Smith was with me—we were all together—Smith was in plain clothes; he first spoke to him; he told him he was an officer—I did not go in with him, I went in afterwards—he said, "If I had known that you had been coming, I would have cut my throat"—his words were not, "If I had known it"—but H If I had known that you had been coming."</p>

I was sent for to this public-house on Sunday night, about half-past 11; and saw the prisoner in the bar parlour—she was given in my custody—Mr. Clark said in her presence, "This ring and things were found on her person"—Mrs. Clark was present—there were three rings, two gold ear-rings, and a silver thimble—I said, "How did you come by these?" she said, "Sweeping up the bedroom, under the drawers"—I said, "How did you come by the thimble?" she said, "I was going to sew, and I took the loan of the thimble out of my <hi rend="italic">missus's</hi> work-box"—I said, "What about the petticoats?" she said, "They were old things, and I thought I might take them"—I said, "Come along with me and see what is in your box"—I went up and searched the box—there were some things lying on a chair by the side—I found the purse under the bottom of the box, amongst a lot of old rags—it contained 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "What about this purse?"

                  </hi>. I live at 72, Three Colt-street, Limehouse, and am a baker—on 26th April I went to bed about a quarter past eleven—I left my house safe, locked up—on the following morning at about a quarter to 5 o'clock I was awoke by the police—I let the police in—from what they said to me, I looked about the house—I found the parlour in great confu<lb/>sion, and several half-burnt lucifers lying about the floors both of the shop and parlour—they had not been lying about the floor the night before—the parlour was in good order when I went to bed—I also missed some currant cake and pastry from the shop, sugar tongs from the parlour and spoons from the kitchen—I then went up stairs, and on the second floor the window opposite the staircase was unfastened—that overlooks the adjoining premises, which is the yard of a public-house—there is a grammar-school next door</p>

               <p>but one—that is at the back of my place—that was all I missed till I went to the police-station, where a quantity of property, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was shown me, which was mine, and had been in various rooms of my house—these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all mine—they were safe that night when I went to bed—there is a window at the top of my house that was closed but unfastened, when I went to bed—there were evident marks, inside and out<lb/>side, of somebody having been there—inside there were marks on the wall as though a person had placed his foot or toe against the wall; and outside there were some broken slates—the marks of the toe or foot were just on the skirting—I do not know the prisoner at all.</p>

About a quarter to 4 on the morning of 27th April I found the prisoner lying down behind a sign-board on the roof of the grammar-school, the back premises of which are very near to Mr. Marsh's—he had a bundle in his hand, and I ordered him to come down; he did so, and threw me the bundle—I asked him what he did up there; he said he got up there to get out of the way—I asked him what he had in the bundle, and who it belonged to—he made no reply—I then took him into custody, and took him to the station-house—I found on him two coats, a pair of trousers, boots—he was dressed in them—the flannel was in the bundle—I also found sugar-tongs, three tea-spoons, and the coin—they were all in his pocket—the coin was loose in his pocket, and the little bag also—after searching him, I went back and found that the premises of Mr. Marsh had been entered by a window at the back I believe—there was a slate broken outside, and the marks as if the print of a man's toe or boot had been against the wall—it would be possible to get into Mr. Marsh's premises that way, over the roof of the bouse—the things I have produced to-day are the same that I took off the prisoner; I have not changed them at the station, nor anybody else.</p>

I assisted in taking the prisoner in custody—I took him to Clerkenwell police-station—he was afterwards identified by Jewell and Levi, whom I sent for—I asked the prisoner how he came by his wound; he said he did not know—on the following morning he said something to mo which I do not remember—I got this hat off his head; part of the interior of the lining is burnt out with a lucifer, or something of that sort, and there are spots of grease—it was rather worse then, as some of the burnt parts are fallen off, and some of the grease is hardened—I was present when he told the surgeon, Mr. Taylor, who I sent for to examine his wound, that it was done with a piece of iron; that was the only explanation he gave—I took him in Arlington-street near Sadler's Wells Theatre, on Wednesday, 21st March.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stone polisher, of 8, Old Pye-street, Westminster—on Thursday evening, 29th March, I was going home, and saw the pri<lb/>soner's wife and her sister-in-law ill-using my sister—the prisoner came down afterwards, took his wife away, and then he began ill-usiug my sister—I said that he was a cowardly fellow, and asked him whether he would fight me—he said that he had something in doors which would fight me, and ran in; I ran away home—next evening about 6 o'clock, I was coming from my work, and saw the prisoner standing by my door; there were about twenty or thirty people there—I heard the prisoner say, that he would have my b—liver—I was stopped from going into my house, but the prisouer was taken away by some of his friends—I then went in and had my tea, after which I went out and spoke to a policeman on the beat, telling him that I was in danger of my life—about 9 o'clock I saw a crowd pass near the corner of Strutton-ground, Westminster—a man was being pursued by a constable—I ran about ten yards to the corner of Grey-coat-place, where I stopped, and all of a sudden I had a tremendous blow on the forehead; I fell to the ground, looked at the prisoner and said, "For God's sake, Ingram, do not kill me"—he said, "I will do for you, you b—"—I do not remember a second blow, I fell to the ground and became insensible—I came to myself as they took me towards the police-station—I was taken from there to the hospital—I never had any quarrel with the prisoner except on the previous night, about his acting in a cowardly way—I had this cap on when I was struck (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), here are two marks on my forehead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Elizabeth Maria Pasley and another, wholesale milliners, of 2, Forster-street, City-road—the prisoner came into their service in 1858, as traveller—his salary was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and 2 1/2 per cent commission on what he sold; which made his salary over 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—his duty was to sort out the stock, and go to the customers—the stock was kept on the premises, he selected what he thought fit, and put it in his own boxes—two or three times he used to tell us that one, or two, or three lots were taken—I never checked the stock that he had selected—it was his duty to take it to our own customers—he used to make a duplicate of the invoices he left, to give one invoice to the customer, and bring one home—the one he brought home ought to contain the amount he received for the goods; and there was a general statement made of what he had sold, and what he had received during the day—that would not be made in duplicate—here is an invoice, of 18th March, in his writing—the a, mouirt, is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the goods to the amount of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. had been sold to Mr. Gibbons, and the money received by the prisoner—we ought to have had the impression of this—the marks are on the back, showing that this has been prepared with the apparatus, but the one that we received of this same date, 18th March, is only 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the difference between the two is 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the second</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether he has been compli<lb/>mented; but if you had not you had no reason to suppose he acted dishonestly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—we have found eighty or ninety such invoices as this, where he has made double invoices, and given one to the customer, and one to us—I went through the stock from January, 1859 to December 1859, and found the deficiency was just upon four hundred dozen—we take stock every twelve months—I took it in January 186O—the prisoner's stock was checked on Monday mornmgs—I had not any means of checking it, except by the statement that he gave me of what he took out, so that if he had taken out twice as many as he told me no discovery would hive been made—I found this out three days before the letter was written—it took me about a week or ten days to go round to the various customers to ascertain this—I was pursuing it at the time this letter—was written and I went on with it—I did not ask the prisoner for an explanation—Misses Pasley employ perhaps fifty or sixty persons making the articles but whatever number of persons are there, the warehouses ate quite distinct, and the counting-house distinct—we take stock every January from year to year, and our stock would show what good or harm we have do, by going through the stock, and entering the quantity made up, and the</p>

               <p>there had been screws taken out of a patent lock of a door, which led into the passage of the house, out of Mr. Walmsley's warehouse into the general passage of the houso—I found up stairs that a panel had been taken out of the door—I also found an iron safe broken open—a person could have got in through the panel—the place was in confusion—I also found a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> that was brought from Angua's house—I compared it with the marks on the iron safe and the cash-box, and the marks exactly corresponded, especially on the iron safe—afterwards, in consequence of some information I received, I went to the Eastern Counties Railway; I saw there the man who went with Mr. Loveridge get out, and three other men get in—I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of them—they drove away and got out at Club-row—I then lost sight' of them—I saw them next coming out of Nichol-row; the prisoner was carrying a bag, and Angus following him—I jumped out of our cab as quick as I could; the prisoner saw me, dropped the bag immediately, and ran away—I followed him round two or three streets and had almost overtaken him; I just touched him as he ran through the door of a house; I hit my hand against a post; it knocked me backwards—the prisoner went through the house and jumped out of a back window, and when I got assistance we could not find him—I afterwards went to Hare-street, I went up stairs; the prisoner was in bed—I got some violent blows from persons up there, and he escaped again—on 27th I went to Spitalfields, to a house there, with some other officers, forced the door, and found the prisoner in bed; we <hi rend="italic">dropped</hi> on to him, and handcuffed him directly; we partially dressed him, and took him to Bow-lane police-station—he was told there what the charge would be, and as we were going in the cab he said, "You will not prove the burglary home to me; I had a little to do with the silk, and I thought I might as well make a few shillings of it as anybody else."</p>

On 1st September, I went to the Eastern Counties Railway, and saw three men get into a cab—the prisoner was one of them—Knight and I were in another cab—I saw the prisoner afterwards throw down the bundle and run away—I captured the other man Angus—I took up the bundle that was thrown down; there were thirty-nine bundles of silk in it—I showed it afterwards to Mr. Surr, and it was identified by him as his property—it has been given up to him, together with a large quantity besides, which was found at Angus's house—Mr. Loveridge went to the house, asked for the silk, and it was given up by his wife, and brought to the station—this crowbar was found in Angus's house.</p>

               <p>silk at the price it was bought at, was not a fair price, and that I had been led into error. When Knight and Funnell came to take me in Hare-street, they told me they wanted me for being concerned in a robbery in King-street, Cheapside, and said I had better put my clothes on and come; I said I should not go, as I knew nothing about it. Funnell tried all his exertions to wrench my hands behind me; I told him if he would allow me the privilege, I would put my things on and go quietly; he immediately began picking up the things, and threw them through the window. I said, "Funnell, you are not in my place, don't destroy the things like that;" and in the confusion, he trod on one of my children, and injured the child.</p>

I have been in England eighteen months—I am a watch-maker, and live at 15, St. John-street-road—on Saturday, 3d March, the prisoner came into my shop between 6 and 7 in the evening—Skaines had a moustache—he asked the price of a clock—I asked him where the clock was, and seeing I did not move from my place, he said, "At the further end of the shop"—I moved from my place; I had a gold watch in my hand, I laid it down, and Schlegel took it up—he gave Skaines a push with his elbow, and they went out of the shop—I thought there was something wrong, and jumped over the counter—there were two gas-burners in the shop, and I had an opportunity of seeing their faces—I next saw them in prison, about ten or twelve days after the robbery—I saw</p>

I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and medical officer to the City of London Union—on 7th April a female child was shown me by the last witness, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning—it was in a feeble, weakened condition—I prescribed for it—it died the same day—I should say that the enfeebled state was caused by the convulsions it had had during the night—they were described to me—it was weak and very enfeebled—on May 4th, the child, having been buried, was disinterred, and I made a post-mortem examination—it was not decom<lb/>posed—I found nothing to account for death—in my judgment it died of convulsions—the exposure to the cold, by leaving a child on the pavement at night-time, would produce convulsions—children die of convulsions with<lb/>out it being able to trace the cause—it was in every respect a healthy child, well nourished.</p>

Could you trace it satisfactorily? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the absence of finding any other cause, I should connect the two things—if, towards the afternoon, there was a little catching of the breath, as if it had cold, I should connect that with an exposure which ceased at twenty minutes before midnight on the 5th—I should not fancy that it would take effect sooner with a young child like that—healthy children have convul<lb/>sions—supposing that I were called upon to see a child that died of convul<lb/>sions, and which I knew to be an healthy child, I should not know what to trace it to—it might be error of diet—milk and water would be quite proper to give to the child—if the milk had been a little too rich, the child would have been sick, and rejected the food.</p>

I am a coal merchant, living in Barking parish, llford—On Wednesday night, 11th April, I lost a quantity of fowls from my yard—they were kept in two hen-houses, one of which was locked, and the other not—I lost some out of both—there were nine stolen and two injured—they were all Hamburgh, except two Spanish—there was not a</p>

                  </hi>. I am brother of the last witness—on the evening of 10th April, I was in the shop, there was a cry at the door that the soldiers were coming after the policemen who had the man in custody—there were about eighteen or twenty soldiers, they had sticks in their hands and were throwing stones—the police were not able to contend with them; there were too many of them, and the police brought their prisoner into our shop—the soldiers came in after them; they got into the private part of the house, and into the garden, and every part—they poured in and filled the house, and they were all in action throwing stones and potatoes and anything they could lay hold of—they broke the window and burst the door open—the prisoner Murray took a quarter of a cwt. and threw it at me, saying, "Charge, you b—r"—it did not hit me, for while he was throwing it at me another soldier came to the scales and got another weight to throw at me, that broke the fall of the weight, so that instead of hitting me it fell on my toes—Murray's manner was very violent—one of them got the scales down, there were three of them about the scales—they took one of the shutters from the door and tried to burst the private door open—we had shut it, and it was broken open again—Murray was intoxicated—those who were outside were throwing stones and potatoes into the shop.</p>

On that Tuesday night, I was in my back parlour, and was alarmed by hearing a tremendous noise outside—I ran to the front door to see what it was, and saw a number of marines and other soldiers standing outside—they said, "Turn the b—r out"—I did not know what they meant—I shut the door and went to the other door leading to the adjoining shop—I saw two policemen in the shop, they had got a soldier in custody—when I shut the front door it was burst open—I shut the door, as the soldiers were trying to get in, and it was broken open again—I went to shut it again and one of the soldiers outside gave me a blow on my thumb—during the time I was shutting the door my daughter conveyed the two policemen and the soldier through the back-door into the yard, and they got away—I then saw Murray strike Sergeant Atkins with his fist in front of my shop—I saw Murray rush by into the shop, he knocked down the scales and broke them—he took up a quarter of a cwt. and said, "Charge, charge," and threw the weight at my son—there were other soldiers in the shop, and I saw potatoes flying in all directions, and stones also—Murray made a stumble in throwing the weight the first time and it fell short—he got up, picked it up again and said, "Charge, charge," and threw the weight again—there might be a hundred soldiers outside my shop—some of them were throwing stones and potatoes in my shop and outside as well—I felt a stick—this was going on from half an hour to three quarters—I was very much alarmed—I went outside my shop and stood on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Walter Hodsoll, an auctioneer—Mary Ann Gouge was in my service three weeks or a month—she left on Saturday fortnight, my husband discharged her—I missed a silver spoon, two pieces of cotton print, some artificial flowers, and three lace collars—I cannot exactly say when I last saw them safe—it was about three weeks or a month before she left—one of the collars I had worn—this printed cotton is mine—it is now in children's dresses, but they were not made up when I lost them—what I lost was like this pink and this lilac—the pink was four yards and a quarter, and the lilac two yards and a quarter—I have some like these with me now—I am certain these three collars are mine—they were made a present to me—I had had them about twelve months, and had worn them constantly—these flowers are mine, I can swear to them—I have no doubt of them—this teaspoon is one that has been in my house a long while—I have brought another spoon like it—it is one of a set we have had long in the family—there are initials on the one I produce, and on the one the policeman produces there is a slight mark of erasure—I have noticed that the stamps are the same—I had them before I was married—I have the remaining parts of these prints—they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070161"/>
               <p>are the same pattern as these two children's frocks—I did not cut the pieces off—this lilac was fourteen yards and a quarter, and two yards and a quarter of that are gone; and the other was twelve yards and a quarter, and four yards and a quarter of that are gone—I did not cut off either of these, nor did any one by my direction—my husband has measured them in my presence, and four yards and a quarter and two yards and a quarter are gone; the quantity in these little frocks corresponds with the quantity I missed—I gave the prisoner one collar, but neither of these—I never gave her, or authorised her to take any of these things.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the report made by the Magistrate laid before you afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The report is sent by the Magistrate to the Board, with a copy of the evidence certified by the Magistrate, and all the documents exhibited in the case, and the Board of Trade form their opinion upon it so far as their jurisdiction is concerned. Here is the report that has been transmitted by the captain in this matter and which was sent to the Board of Trade, and the evidence which was given by the captain before Mr. Traill, and also the evidence given by the mate—there was also this protest marked A.—on the foundation of those documents the captain's certificate was suspended for twelve months—I cannot say that that is a very high amount of punishment, it is an ordinary amount of punishment, of course punishments differ very much; in this case the cer<lb/>tificate was suspended for want of seamanship and losing the vessel, it had nothing to do with any criminal charge; not taking into consideration the charge of wilfully scuttling the vessel, had that been proved the probability</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070163"/>
               <p>is that the punishment would have been very much more severe—we should have still been called upon to pronounce it—it is of course, as you may be aware, a very difficult thing to distinguish the criminal from the other charge, but the Board and Mr. Traill did not proceed with regard to the criminal charge—I was not present at the inquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SEYMOUR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the event of the captain disobeying the rules of the Shipping Company, would that be a case for suspension? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The Board of Trade have nothing to do with the rules of navigation, but they would no doubt take notice of it—in a recent case a captain was suspended for twelve months for negligently losing a ship in the West Indies—we have the power of cancelling a certificate as well as of suspending it—it is difficult to say what course the Board of Trade would have adopted—if a graver charge, a criminal charge, was laid before them, they would be called upon to cancel it altogether, but it does not come within their jurisdiction to enter into criminal charges of this nature—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the original depositions—I produce them from the custody of the Board of Trade.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you that the Board of Trade would not form any opinion as to the evidence upon the criminal charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They endea<lb/>voured to put that out of sight altogether—in their letter to Mr. Traill they stated that they threw aside the evidence on the criminal charge altogether—if a captain was convicted of wilfully losing a ship they would cancel his certificate; they would no doubt take into consideration whether the evidence was sufficient in their minds.</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the Germans all examined through an interpreter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and the evidence given by them was taken down from the interpreter's lips—the inquiry was a very lengthened one—the captain and mate were both represented by counsel; the inquiry being conducted by the solicitor to the Board of Trade—I am not aware that Mr. Traill held that no counsel could appear on the part of the men, nor do I recollect that there was any such application—the prisoners were produced as witnesses by the Board of Trade—the report marked A. was handed in on behalf of the owner, by Mr. Rutter, the solicitor—the protest was produced by the solicitor for the Customs and the Board of Trade—both those documents were read—I think the captain was not called till the fourth or fifth day, but the protest was put-in—I believe an inquiry was made whether there were any people there from Lloyds' with instructions to prosecute the captain—Mr. Traill said that he should deal with it under the Merchant Seamen's Act—he gave no judgment except the written one which he sent in—I cannot tell how the witnesses were produced or where they came from—the captain's evidence was taken—his statement was not on oath.</p>

Before that intimation was given as to the first portion of the inquiry, some obser<lb/>vation was made to Captain Anderson, and then the charge was entered as one under the Merchant Shipping Act—the counsel who represented the captain, pressed the Magistrate that his evidence and that of the mate should be given on oath, and the Magistrate declined, it not being the practice on these inquiries—no nautical assessor appeared—it is usual generally for these inquiries to be conducted in the presence of a nautical assessor—the Magistrate in reporting on the nautical part of the case had no aid of a nautical person—Captain Hewitt and the mate were bound over afterwards on the application of counsel, to prefer this prosecution.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the examination and cross-examination conducted through an interpreter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not feel it to be my duty to hear counsel on the part of the men—after they had made their statement it appeared at the early part of the inquiry that there was matter of an extremely criminal nature imputed to the captain, and I called the attention of the gentlemen of the Board of Trade to the nature of the evidence which assumed a criminal character, and asked if there was any person prepared to prosecute the case in the event of it being sent for trial—on the first occasion a gentleman who is present here, Captain Anderson, expressed a desire that it should go on—the evidence was then before me, and I intimated that I should expect, if that were the case, that a prosecutor should appear to conduct the case before a jury, and I adjourned the case for a day to enable that gentleman to undertake the prosecution—on the following day another gentleman appeared who is here, and I conferred with him, but he did not consider him<lb/>self as authorised to take the part of prosecutor—I then said that I should exclude certain evidence as not bearing upon the point, and proceeded to make the inquiry as if those witnesses had not been present at all—I founded my report exclusively upon the statement of the captain and the mate and the witnesses they produced, stating that I would not entertain a belief one way or other on the testimony given by the former witnesses, as I was not in a condition to form an opinion one way or other, and I put it out of my mind in forming a judgment of the case—the protest came out of the hands of the Board—the paper which appeared to be the foundation of the protest was produced on the part of the owners or of the master and mate—it came out of that custody; from the gentlemen in attendance who they said were representing the ship, whether owners or masters I do not know—it was produced on behalf of the captain.</p>

               <p>went before the Board of Trade—on the fourth day, speaking of one witnedd and only one witness, I said to Mr. Bull that it was quite clear that the Board of Trade would not make any inquiry dealing with it in a criminal character if they had to deal with such evidence as that—the upshot of the matter was, that having heard the case till the fourth day, I determined not to act at all upon the evidence which pointed to a criminal charge, but to treat it generally under the Merchant Shipping Act, and I can explain why I took that course if necessary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master mariner, and was lately Captain of the British barque <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>—I was appointed to the command in 1859 by Mr. Wilson, of Liverpool—I sailed on 13th December for Adelaide, with a general cargo—there were 16 hands, including myself—we shipped the prisoners as part of our crew; four of them are foreigners—I do not know whether they are all Germans—before we left London my attention was called to the ventilator holes which were in the stem of the ship—this model shows their position on each side—the ventilator on the starboard side was a brass one, the glass of which was broken—the vessel was then taking in heavy cargo, going a long voyage, and for the sake of the ship I thought it would be better to take those lights out, as they were not wanted in the ship—I believe the vessel had carried troops—we were not going to carry passengers, and the ship might have struck and the glass broken, and she would have sunk, so we took them out—this is one of the original glasses (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I plugged the holes up and drove a large fender in from the inside as <hi rend="italic">taut</hi> as we could get it—it was wider inside, and narrow on the part outside—I then wedged it from the outside all round the edge of the fender, and then <hi rend="italic">keyed</hi> it <hi rend="italic">trunnel</hi> fashion—I had the projection cut off, tarred it over, then put a piece of tarred felt and a piece of deal board over that—I made it as safe as I possibly could, and in my opinion a moderate force would not be capable of opening that hole again; especially from the inside, it would be almost impossible—I had no share in the ship whatever—the value of my personal effects on board was about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had asked Mr. Pugh if he would put 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my goods, and I ascertained, when I returned to England, that they were assured to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which I had to make good my instruments which I had lost—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my policy—it has never been handed to me before—I received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which I made good my chronometer, the price of which was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took my wife with me, but left our little boy behind—the ship was lying in the water with her cargo, about 16ft. 9in. aft, and 16ft. 3in. forwards—we had tolerably fine weather when we left London, which continued pretty</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070166"/>
               <p>well going down channel—the wind was north—we crossed the Bay of Biscay, and I think the first sensible change of weather was on the 21st or 22d, when the wind veered round I think, and I put the head of the ship round W. N. W., it freshened into a gale either on the 22d or 23d—we were under close reefed topsails—we had not, up to that time, been making any water—on the 23d we had very heavy weather—I cannot say whether the ship strained much, but we shipped some water, and I think it was on the 23d a very heavy sea washed away part of our bulwarks forward, and a portion aft also—I think that was the day that the ship commenced to make water—I sounded the pumps that day, and kept them going after that—we had very heavy weather on Christmas-day, and the cabin sky-light was broken in by a sea—we had then close reefed topsails, and part of the day close reefed main-topsails, and I believe we had also a storm trysail only—more bulwarks were then washed away—from the 25th to New Year's Day the weather con<lb/>tinued very heavy, and on New Year's Day, Hodson, the chief mate, stated that either the carpenter or cook had told him that there was water coming into the ship forwards—I went down into the lower forecastle, and saw water coming in through a leak in the bows—it was an opening in the wood ends—I think the water was a little above, and a great body of water came in every time the vessel dipped—I made every effort to stop the leak, and the chief mate and the carpenter helped me—the leak was two or three feet, I think, and my impression was that the ends had started—the carpenter, myself, and the chief mate were slung over the bows, and we got a piece of wood and a piece of flannel nailed over the wood end—I was over the bows several times that day, but it was impossible to stop over any time together, the vessel was plunging too much—I did my best to stop the leak, and it kept a little water out, but not all—one pump was kept constantly going, and the other for an hour and a half, at the end of every watch as the watches were relieved—there is a watch every four hours—the pumps suck at 6 inches, and I tried to keep the water down to that depth, and was able to do so down to January 4—I was then trying to make a W.S.W. course—I used one of Norrey's charts, I think—on 4th January we were lying-to under close reefed topsails—it was blowing very heavy indeed, and between 11 and 12 in the forenoon, I was in my cabin with Mrs. Hewitt, when a very heavy sea struck the ship forwards, and I felt it tremble—I went on deck, met the mate, and said, "What is that?"—he said, "A very heavy sea has struck the ship in the bows"—I went forward and examined the state of the bows—I found almost all the gear, immediately below the cutwater, gone—this is the cutwater, these are the knees, and these are the head-rails—the head-rails were completely washed away on the starboard side, and the two lower knees completely washed off—the upper knee was washed from the cut<lb/>water, and the wood ends all completely started to the water's edge—this is so constructed as to fit into the stem of the ship—the stem slightly overlaps the end, so that with the knees, and all together, the effect is to brace the whole together—the straining of the cutwater caused a dislocation of this end, and the planks were completely disjointed; they sprang out at the extreme end—it exposed the wood end, and that made the opening—I think the stem must have <hi rend="italic">slued</hi> and forced the plank out—I saw the wood ends completely started out—(<hi rend="italic">The witness went to the model, and explained where the damage was</hi>)—the sea struck the vessel right in the bows, so, and the great leverage here must have <hi rend="italic">slued</hi> the stem and forced the plank out—I distinctly saw that the planks were started out, and an opening made; I saw nothing else to account for it—the cutwater was loose and moving—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070167"/>
               <p>when I discovered this I immediately put the ship before the wind—most of the gear on the port side also was gone—the head-rails were gone, but the rails were there—water was also coming in on the port side, but the principal damage was on the starboard side—as soon as I got the ship before the wind, I gave orders to bring a blanket, which we tried to get nailed oyer the bows, and were about an hour about it, but it was washed away almost before our eyes—I next tried a piece of blanket, but it kept on for a very short time, and was then washed away—when both these efforts failed I hung a sail round the bows, and made one part of it fast to the cat-head in this way, but cut a slit to allow it to come up to the bows, and these two parts were all <hi rend="italic">taut</hi> with the cutwater, and as the vessel was running before the wind, it kept a little of the water out—it was passed over the bows—it remained there till about 4 next morning—I kept the pumps constantly going all night, and next morning (Thursday) I tried to get at the leak on the inside—we cut away this inner plank, called the ceiling, from the outside, for the purpose of getting at the planking outside; but I found that it would be very dangerous to wedge the opening from the inside, for fear it should wedge the planking and make it worse, and we were only able to keep poking oakum in the holes, which the carpenter kept doing with some oakum which was got from the fore-part, where it was kept under the direction of the carpenter and steward—finding I could not do anything more effectual than poking oakum in from the inside, I resolved on bearing away for Cadiz—I did so—we saw a schooner next morning (Thursday, the 5th), and ran up the ensign, with the Union down—that is a signal of distress, but the schooner never saw it, as it came on foggy, hazy weather—we saw St. Vincent's light on the coast of Spain, on Friday morning, the 6th, at 4 o'clock—the wind was then about N.W., and we were about 160 miles from Cadiz—we had both pumps going that forenoon constantly up to dinner-time, which was at 12 o'clock—the men had not had breakfast—they were very bad with regard to strength, and were all complaining of sores, and chaps, from their clothes constantly rubbing up and down with the salt water, and their physical strength was getting worse from pumping all that time, and from the sea constantly washing over them—after they had had their dinner at 12, the ship was getting down in the water—we bad no tea that day, because the galley-fire was washed out—I gave directions to haul the chains up, and the men commenced doing so after dinner—it took about three hours altogether—I had, at that time, altered my intention about Cadiz, and in<lb/>tended to try and get the ship in under Cape St. Mary—I did not abandon that intention, but we did not make Cape St Mary, because the wind would not allow us to reach there, so I altered her course—the wind headed me all the time, so that she broke off that course—after hauling the chains up we pumped again with all hands—I think it would then be approaching 5 o'clock—they continued pumping about three-quarters of an hour or an hour, and then refused to pump any more—I tried to encourage them to pump longer—I rallied them, and asked them if they would not pump a little longer—I entreated them to do so, and said that the land was not a great distance from us—they said, "No, captain, you see the state our hands are in, and we cannot pump any more"—I said, "Now there is less wind, and there is a chance to save our lives"—they said, "We cannot pump any more"—my efforts were unsuccessful, and the pumps were abandoned—the ship was then getting further down—the deeper she went, the greater the rush of water would be—we had all the light goods on the top; not on deck; I mean the upper stratum—if I</p>

               <p>had ventured to risk letting the men leave the pumps for the purpose of throwing out the cargo, a very great deal of water would have gone down the hatches—it would have consumed a considerable time before we got through the light cargo to the heavy cargo—when I found that the men would not really pump for me any more I gave orders to put the boats out—we commenced doing so about 6 o'clock, and in doing so, the pinnace got broken—that was not done by my directions, for I had nothing else to fly to but my boats—we had nothing then left but the long boat and the gig; and the chief mate and eight of the crew got into the long boat, and myself, my wife, and six others, into the gig—I was the last person on board the sinking ship—the water was then washing over her—she was level with the water's edge—there was a heavy sea—the wind was light—neither of the boats had masts—I rigged a mast with oars—the long boat, under the command of the chief mate, pulled away—I stayed by the ship as long as I could; then got into my boat and pulled in the same direction—my wife sat at the stern, on the stern sheets—it was a narrow-sterned gig—we had no ballast in her—there is a seat round the stern, and we had to seat ourselves as well as we could—I had my desk in the boat, the sextant and case, and one bag of clothes—my desk contained the log and the ship's papers—I had not my octant—I did not, before I left the ship, throw out an octant or sextant from the vessel—it is not true that I threw any instrument, or any box, from off the ship, before I left it; in fact I had not an octant—the second mate, Beschott, steered the fore part of the night, and I steered the remainder—he sat on the top of my desk—I agreed to change places with him before day<lb/>break, I think, and took the steerage—the wind was freshening all the time, and the sea was getting up too, and running higher—when I took the helm I had to sit on the box—it raised me so high that it nearly threw me over the quarter, two or three times as the boat plunged in the sea; and in my opinion it was necessary for the boat's safety that I should get lower down in the boat—I therefore threw my desk, my box with the sextant, and the bag of clothes overboard—that was all that belonged to me—anything else that had been at my hands at the time, I would have taken—the desk con<lb/>tained personal valuables of mine—I made a sail with a piece of old canvas which was thrown into the boat, and used an oar for a mast which was broken when the wind freshened—we were shipping water—I saw smoke about 8 o'clock in the morning, and then saw a steamer, which turned out to be the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi>—we bore for her and tried to attract her attention but did not succeed; she steamed past us—it was about three-quarters of an hour after that that I threw the things overboard—we were then I think about thirty or forty miles from any accessible shore; I cannot say exactly; and if we had not been picked up next day, I do not think there was the slightest chance of saving our lives, and I did it as an inducement to the men to throw their things over if it should become necessary—I could not order them to throw theirs over unless I showed them the example—two or three hours after that the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi>, commanded by Captain Doll, picked us up—there was then water in our boat and we were very wet—the boy Cox was in very bad health previous to leaving the vessel—he was not in a condition to attend his watches regularly, and did not do so—he was not able to leave his berth for six or seven days up to a day or two before the ship went down—he was not able to discharge any duties up to the time of leaving the ship—the boy Wager, waited on him, and sometimes the steward, and sometimes I did—the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi> brought us to Newport—I wrote out, on board of her, a memorandum of what happened to the ship, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070169"/>
               <p>after doing so I asked Beschott, the second mate, whether he would come aft and hear it read over and sign it, if it was correct, in the presence of Captain Tuck; he said, Yes, if I would give him two months' pay—I am quite sure that document was not read over to him before he claimed the two months' pay—I said that I could not give him anything of the sort; I could not give him two months' pay out of my own pocket—he said that it was German fashion to give two months' pay when a ship was lost—I said that he could only claim wages from me up to the time the ship was lost—he then refused to hear the paper read—I then asked the carpenter Lehmann, if he would sign it—he said, Yes, if I would give him two months' pay—I said, "Will the crew sign this document?"—he said, "Yes, if you give them two months' pay"—I called them a set of rascals and told them I would put them all in gaol when I got home—upon that the second mate shook his finger at me in this way and said, "There are ten of us, and not so many of you, what you speak is for nothing"—I do not know of any holes being bored or cut or made in any part of the ship—I never directly or indirectly sanctioned or directed the making of any holes—I did nothing after leaving London to the ventilators that were filled up, nor do I know of anything being done—they could not have been driven out without my knowledge—I never directed any of the men to say when they got ashore that there was fourteen feet of water in the ship—the chief mate did not say to me "We have made a hole, and we have made another one, or we should have been there till 12 o'clock"—the mate did not come to me on the 6th in the forecastle and speak to me, laughing—before I totally abandoned the ship, and after putting up the signal of distress, I put the name of the ship in a bottle, with a short account, and threw it overboard—the chief mate prepared it—he kept the log.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The throwing over of the bottle was on the 25th, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The bottle went overboard the day before the ship was abandoned—it was thrown over on the 5th, about noon, after the mate had written his log—I asked Besohott and the others to sign this report, because I wanted to have the document with me, as something to report the loss of the vessel—there had been no suggestion that I had anything to do with the loss of the vessel—I never heard of a captain asking for such a thing before—I believe it is usual for the captain and second mate to certify—I asked the carpenter to do so, and I asked him whether the crew would not sign—I wanted the crew to sign, because I really thought the second mate and the carpenter had been saying something to these men—I thought so because the carpenter said, "If you give them two months' pay they will sign it"—I had no particular reason for the men to sign it; all I suggested was for the officers to sign it: I suggested that they should; through asking the carpenter, and his answering on the part of the crew, I naturally thought that there must be an understanding between him and them—I had drawn up the report at the time the carpenter said, "The crew will sign it if you give them two months' pay"—I did not ask the crew to sign it—I never had such a thought in my mind until after the carpenter answered on the part of the crew—I asked the second mate and the carpenter; and then I asked the carpenter if the crew would sign it, and he said, "Yes, if you give them two months' pay"—I knew nothing about the claim for two months' pay till the carpenter told me—I drew that statement up in the cabin for the purpose of having the carpenter's and second mate's signatures to show the loss of the vessel—I never asked them to sign it; I did not want them to sign it—I asked the second mate first</p>

               <p>and then the carpenter, and he said that he would sign it if I would give him two months' pay—this report is true as nigh as possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it half true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my oath there are not half of the occurrences in that document—nobody signed it at all—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is my writing—I had not heard any demand about two months' wages when I signed it—I drew it up on board that vessel—(<hi rend="italic">The report was here read</hi>)—we had very serious damage done to the ship on 1st January—a very heavy sea struck her, and a fissure about two and a half feet wide was made by the blow of the sea, which caused a straining of the ends of two planks—there was an opening there (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to the place in the model</hi>) and the waves came in every time the ship plunged—I make no mention of that in my report—I did not consider it so serious a matter as the second occurrence—the leak was two or three feet wide, and a heavy sea came in every time the vessel plunged; but I considered the next occurrence was more im<lb/>portant to mention—I wrote this report only two or three days afterwards, when I was on board the steamer that rescued us—I did not think, when I wrote it, of what had happened to the vessel on 1st January—we were a con<lb/>siderable distance to the west of Lisbon Harbour on 1st January—I quite forget the latitude and longitude of the vessel on that day, though I give you the latitude and longitude on the 22d and 24th—I remember it on the 4th January because I was compelled to remember it—I had to run for some place and had to shape a course—I think Lisbon might be the nearest harbour, but we were a long way to the west of it—I made no attempt to get into Lisbon Harbour—the gale was N.N.W. to S.W.—when the heavy sea struck the vessel on 1st January, I talked to the chief officer about getting her into harbour and getting her repaired—I considered it a serious injury—it was after that injury that I was slung over to remedy the injury that was then effected—I was also slung over on the 4th—I discussed the matter with my first officer as to the propriety of running for Lisbon, but we were uncertain of the position of the ship, and had I run down and missed the Lisbon bar, the ship was not in a condition te ride off it—I knew at that time pretty well what our position was, but I have forgotten now—I cannot give you any idea of latitude and longitude, nor of the position of the ship when I thought the bar prevented her entering Lisbon—I can give you no idea about it—I discussed it with the mate—I dare say there might be some talk about it—the discussion would not be entered in the log; it was a short discussion—I have forgotten where we were—I dare say the injury was entered in the log; I have not the slightest doubt of it—the particulars of the latitude and longitude may or may not have been entered—the mate would keep the log—I saw it almost every day—I will not speak positively of the latitude and longitude at the time this happened—it ought to have been reckoned, and if the log was properly kept it would have shown the position of the vessel when this occurrence took place; but the position of the ship was so uncertain that it was only a rough account—the vessel was struck on Wednesday and went down about 9 o'clock on Friday night—the ship sank on the 5th, the sea having struck her on the 4th—that is according to this report which I wanted these men to sign—there may be a mistake in it, but the days and times I cannot be mistaken in—I wrote this report myself, and may have made a mistake, but it was on Friday night that the ship went down—I did not consult the second mate or read it over with him; I read it over with the chief mate—he and I were both acquainted with the terms of it—the men refused to work the pumps just before I gave orders to get the boats out—several days before the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070171"/>
               <p>ship went down, I saw them very sulky at the pnmps—they refused to work them the day before the ship went down—I did not receive so flat a refusal to work the pumps that day as I did the next, the day the vessel sank—I cannot account for the mistake, so important a thing occurring that day; omitting the intermediate day altogether—the last entry was made in the log the day before the ship went down, on which day a bottle had been thrown over, and yet I omit that day from my report—I forget the date on which I drew up my protest—the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi> arrived At Newport on the 14th; I think it was Saturday—I entered my protest at Newport—I had it formally drawn up at Liverpool in conjunction with the chief mate and the steward, who were acquainted with its contents—(<hi rend="italic">The protest teas here read</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I need not go over the same ground again with you; you say in Liverpool, in that formal document, that the vessel went down the same day that she was struck by the sea? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say anything further; only that it was by mistake—there are many things that I do not mention—I did not leave out intentionally from the report that I threw the log over—there are many things that I left out and did not mention that really occurred in the ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The log as you know is an extremely important matter on board a vessel; did you leave out of the report you wanted the men to sign, that you threw it overboard by accident, or negligently, or by design? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not mention it—I suppose it was forgotten—there were many things occurred that I did not think of—I remembered it at Liverpool because I was getting the thing done in a proper manner before a notary, and I took paina of course, and recollected many things which transpired—I forgot all about the bottle on the intermediate day—I mean to say upon my oath that my omitting that there was one day's interval between the injury done to the ship and her sinking, was a mistake—it must be a mistake, for she was struck on Wednesday and foundered on Friday night—I never thought anything at Liverpool of there being a day's interval—I did not at the time I was making this protest, think how long the vessel sank after she was injured—I did not know at the time that I had made a mistake, or it would not have been there—I did not write the protest—I do not know that this is a true copy—I went in personally and gave the notary the facts in the chief mate's presence, but not in the steward's—I cannot say whether I gave the fact of the sinking of the vessel, in the chief mate's presence—he was in London on the night the protest was drawn up—I suppose the chief mate did not see the mistake any more than myself—I did not find this mistake out till Mr. Traill or some gentleman mentioned it to me at Greenwich—I was not aware till after that that the protest contained that false statement—I do not recollect whether it was before or after the men had given their evidence, that the mistake was pointed out to me—I think the first I heard of it was when I was in the witness-box, after one of the men had been examined—Hodgson was the chief mate; he is here—I have seen him since yesterday; I have been with him—we have not being staying together—I cannot say that I talked anything directly about this matter—he called at my house last evening when I was at tea—it is impossible to say the whole of the conversation—he was with me about half an hour—I had not told him to call—I will not swear that I might or might not have said, "You may as well call in the evening"—he visits me and my wife—I cannot, on my oath, answer the question whether I told him to call.</p>

               <p>mate to call upon you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my oath I cannot tell whether I did or did not—I do not recollect telling him to call; I might or I might not; I will not swear—we did not talk about the questions you had put to me in relation to the omissions from the log and from the protest; I swear that—I do not know what you mean—I did not speak a word to the mate about the questions you put to me yesterday; I confess that I might have said, "Serjeant Ballantine is a very clever person, and you will have to mind what you are about"—I suppose he is something like me, not accustomed to be in a witness-box—I do not know whether I did or did not tell him the questions you put to me about the protest—I will not swear I did not—the latitude and longitude that I have given on 22d December is by account, by dead reckoning—I got it because that was the time when the wind hauled down to the S.W.—I had lost the log—that would be hardly so far south as Lisbon—I got the latitude and longitude by account carried on from day to day—I put it down in my protest from memory—the latitude on 4th January 36✗ 10' north and 13✗ west longitude I got from recollection also—that was after the sea struck the vessel—I have likewise given it when the ship went down, that is from recollection also—I forgot what latitude and longitude we were in when that fissure was made—I do not know whether this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the chart I had on 4th January—this other chart bears my own pencil marks exhibiting the course the ship took—we bore away for Cadiz—I found it marked likewise where we were at noon on Thursday, July 5—this is the place where we threw the bottle over, it is 36 1/2✗ and 10✗ 47', the nearest port or place from which would have been Cape St. Vincent—it is not very safe to get under the lee of Cape St. Vincent, and the wind was W.N.W.; it would have been highly imprudent to bear under there, there was a very heavy sea—I got at it by compass that the wind was W.N.W. at that time, but I get at it now from memory—we got within twenty miles of Cape St. Vincent, we sighted the light—that was at 4 o'clock on the morning of the 6th—I was bound to note in my protest that we saw the light of Cape St. Vincent, and I thought it would be noticed in the protest, but it was forgotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want to know if you forgot it in making the formal protest how you came to recollect it so as to put the very position down in the chart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did that to account for the loss of the vessel in the track I was making—I have also forgotten in the protest that we made for Cape St. Mary, and have made no minute of it—I have remembered it since—it was between Cape St. Vincent and Cape St. Mary that we left the vessel, and about ten o'clock at night—during the afternoon of that day, the 6th, I was trying to get hold of Cape St. Mary—I mean that I bore for Cape St. Mary, but I was never nearer to it than the track laid down—(<hi rend="italic">Pointing out the track on the chart and Capes St. Mary and St. Vincent</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at your own marking, you appear according to my plan to have diverged almost half-way between Capes St. Vincent and St. Mary; you appear to have taken a southerly course? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; at that time I could make for no place; I would have gone to St. Mary's if I could, but the wind headed us and I could get to no place—I was trying to get to St. Mary's, not to Cadiz—I was about 35 miles from St. Mary's at the time I began to diverge and go southerly—it was 35 miles, I think, at 1 o'clock; here is a scale—(<hi rend="italic">The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>, <hi rend="italic">after looking at the chart, considered that it was 35 miles exactly</hi>)—I bore away in the first instance with the intention of searching Cadiz, and was making for Cadiz up to 1 o'clock, and at 1 headed the ship to and made for St. Mary's, or about that time—the wind was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070173"/>
               <p>hauling round—if we were going to St. Mary's we should not have to sail north, but east and a little southerly; instead of which we were obliged by the wind to go S.E.—it was after dinner that we hauled up the chain, just after 1 o'clock, and we finished it about 5—that was done with the intention of anchoring under Cape St. Mary if I could reach there—the ship was heading in that direction when I gave that order, and she went about 3 miles on that course and then broke off; she was making water at that time—the only object of taking up the chains was with a view of anchoring if I could get there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to take the men away from the pumps and keep them away? why did not you stop that order when you found the veasel did not act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not tell that the wind would not back again—if I had not hauled the chains up ready to anchor I should have been censured by the Board of Trade—I did not take the men away from the chains at 3 o'clock and put them to the pumps, because it was impossible for me to tell, the wind might have hauled to the westward again, and if it had I should have still pushed on with the same intention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was a very important matter to take up the chains, and an equally important matter making for St. Mary's; I ask you to tell the Jury why you never mentioned either of those matters in your protest or in the report that you drew up three days afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because it was forgotten—the mate gave me the log on the 6th, just before leaving the ship; it was the ordinary sized log; I think I asked the mate for it just before leaving the vessel—I took it out of his possession to have charge of it—I thought it was an important document—he had kept it all the voyage—I thought it safer to put it into my desk, which was in the cabin—I do not know whether anybody was present and saw me put it in—I cannot tell why I did not put it into my pocket or about my person—when I threw the desk into the water I said, "There, I shall not want you any more"—I do not know whether I said "There"—I do not think I said "There go all my papers;"I will swear I did not, nothing of the kind—I do not recollect saying a word about papers—it was an ordinary shaped master's desk—I did not recollect at the time that the log was in it, and if I bad there would have been a great deal to prevent my taking it out; I did not think about logs, or books, or anything else—I do not know whether I mentioned, on board of, or to the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi>, that I had lost my log.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the weight of the desk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not very heavy—there were other papers and memorandum-books besides the log in it, which I had had ever since I had had the ship; it was about two feet and a half wide and a foot deep, and weighed about ten or twelve pounds.</p>

SOLICITOR GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You prepared the report that you wished the chief mate and the carpenter to sign on board the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood? A.</hi> Yes; we got to Land's-end on Saturday and Newport on Saturday fol<lb/>lowing—the weather was very bad when we were first picked up, and it continued bad for two or three days—six hours afterwards she lost part of her sails, and twelve hours afterwards she was dismasted—I assisted the Captain in the navigation of the ship; his arm was broken and hung in a sling—my crew would not render any assistance—I prepared the report three or four days after I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi>—it was two days before we got into Newport, that I asked the second mate and carpenter to sign it—the protest was prepared by a notary at Liverpool—we went from Newport to Liverpool—I did not then see the owner, Mr. Wilson—I went to Liverpool because I generally live there my owner's office is there, and I went there on purpose to see him, but he did not happen to be at home—I saw the notary himself; Mr. Smith, one of Mr. Wilson's clerks, made me known to him; I delivered the report into Mr. Woodland's hands before he proposed the protest; besides that I sat down and gave him such other things as were required; I then went away and called again a few days after, found the protest and put my signature to it—it was not exactly prepared and drawn out when I went; we had to wait a few hours for it; it was not quite finished and we waited in Mr. Woodland's office—Romanth was sick in the hospital, and the notaries took it there and read it over to him in my presence—I saw Hodgson sign it in Mr. Woodland's office, it was read over to us together, and he signed it just after me—the opening made in the bows on 1st January two feet and a half long, might be half an inch wide when the oakum was got out—we managed to keep the pumps sucking between the 1st and 4th—I had so arranged that with the ordinary way on the pumps we kept the water down—the pumps draw air at six inches, it required six inches of water to make them suck, and if there was six feet they would suck—when the pump sucks there is six inches in the bottom of the well—it was kept down to six inches between the 1st and 4th—on 1st January the wind was sometimes N.N.W. and S.W. flying about between the two, in fact forty times nearly I had to wear the ship round which way I could, to ease her—I have never been in Lisbon harbour, but as a matter of nautical knowledge I know that it is a very dangerous bar harbour, and on each side are two shoals which are covered at the tide, and to make the harbour it is necessary to go between the two shoals, and the space between is narrow—there is plenty of room if a ship is easily manageable—after we had got the serious damage on the 1st, she still answered her helm well—I could handle her and do anything I wanted with her—it was not the narrow channel at Lisbon that I speak of as dangerous</p>

               <p>because I might have made the land, but my ship was not in a condition to beat off a lee shore—the wind was blowing N.N.W. part of the day, and as it was blowing so fearfully I could never be certain of it for an hour—some<lb/>times it would fly into the northward, and not give the slightest warning, in two or three minutes—the danger in making for Lisbon harbour was on account of the weather, and not on account of the state of the ship—the 5th is mentioned in my report, but I have no date whatever of the day on which the ship sank—it was on a Friday—I never had the slightest doubt of the day on the week on which the very heavy sea broke upon the bows of the vessel and caused that damage; it was Wednesday, the day before the ship went down—there was a refusal on the part of the crew to work at the pumps—it was what we term a general growl—the men were all grumbling, and refused to go to the pumps, and physical force was used to make them go—they did work, but the chief mate had to rope's-end them—he thrashed them to the pumps—they worked rope's-ended on 5th, and up to noon on 6th—they worked for an hour or so after they had hauled up the chains—their last hour of working at the pumps was between 5 and 6 o'clock—they then separated from the pumps, and gave a flat refusal—it was then that I urged them to pump—it was on the 6th, the day on which the vessel sank, that I was at one time trying to make Cape St. Mary, and went about three miles—the wind was N.N.E. and the ship heading east—I was in hopes if I reached Cape St. Mary, as the wind was off the land, I might have anchored there, and perhaps stopped the leaks from the outside, and pushed on to Cadiz—it is not a place of shelter—it is a very wild open place, but I should have let down the anchor there; and if we had been under the lee of the shore I hoped to repair the vessel—this was the first time since we left home that we hauled up the chains for the purpose of being ready to let go the anchor—if the crew had worked properfy at the pumps they might have kept the vessel up for a short time longer—we had kept her np through the day, but I do not think we could have kept her up through the night, so as to leave her by daylight in the morning, because she was so settled down, and the water was coming in with great force—my desk rested on the seat that goes round the stern of the boat when it was first put in, and I was sitting on it, my wife filled up the whole space in the body of the gig—she was sitting there—I sat upon the box when I was steering, which raised me above the gunwale of the boat—my feet were on a level with the gunwale—in con<lb/>sequence of the way in which my wife and other persons were disposed, that was the only way in which I could sit—sometime after we left the ship the wind freshened—the sea was getting up all the time, and I found that I could not sit with safety to my own life on that raised surface—one clothes-bag was on a seat on the other side, and the sextant was a little nearer astern—they were in the way of any one sitting with safety.</p>

               <p>before she was ready for sea—she began to take in cargo on the day I joined—I saw the crew go on board—I noticed the ventilator holes—there were two side scuttles in the starboard—the glass of one was broken—we had them taken out, the captain and I together, and had the holes filled up, and all was made <hi rend="italic">taut</hi>—the hole was seven or eight inches inside, and eleven inches out<lb/>side—it was impossible to drive it out—there was also a bit of felt and a piece of deal nailed over outside—that was exactly in the same state when the ship sank, as it was when we left London—we left on 13th December, landed our pilot on the following day, and for some days had fine weather till we crossed the Bay of Biscay; but a part of the time the wind chopped round to the north-west, and about the 21st or 22d of September it changed and became bad—we had a succession of gales from that time till the ship foundered—before the bad weather had set in, the ship had been making no water at all to speak of—on New Year's Day, or somewhere thereabouts, a sea struck the bulwarks on the port side, and the bulwarks on the starboard side were washed away by the sea on 23d or 24th—on Christmas Day it blew away the topsails, and broke three panes in the sky-light in the stern—some watercame in, and the steward baled it out—on 1st January a heavy sea struck the ship—it started two planks, on the lower knee on the star<lb/>board side of the cutwater—the head rails were not disturbed anything to speak of that day, but there was a starting on the starboard side, and the ship made much more water—you could see daylight through from the inside, and every time the ship plunged, the water came rushing in with tremendous force—the captain, the carpenter, and myself were slung over the bows, and we tried to make a patchy affair of it—he tried to put a bit of flannel and boarding over it—we were hanging over by a rope—that was all that was done that day—we used to go down to look at it to see that all was light between the 1st and the 4th—it kept a little of the water out, and we were able by pumping to keep the water out with ease, as the leak was above the water-line; but the water came in when the ship pitched and plunged forward—nothing else was done between the 1st and 4th to stop the leak—on 4th, about 11 o'clock in the morning, a heavy sea struck the ship—I was on deck at the time, standing by the pumps—I felt the ship shake and tremble fore and aft, and the cook was washed out of the galley—the captain was below—he came up very shortly afterwards—the sea washed the cutwater and the figure was quite loose—it carried away the lower knee and head-rail on the starboard side—the sea struck the vessel on that side, the cutwater shook backwards and forwards—it was all adrift: all loose; the ship had completely opened forwards—all the plank timbers on the starboard side had started from the stern, as far as you could see from the inside—I could see that the leak was about three-quarters of an inch wide—this was not the same strain or opening that had happened on the 1st—planks were started on the 4th that had not started on the 1st, and it was as much as I could do to keep her above water after that—we got blankets over the bows, but they were washed away as fast as we got them there—the sea was too high, and the ship was knocking about too much: it was impossible—somebody was slung over the bows to fasten the blankets—I took my turn, and Captain Hewitt was over too; we found we could not really stop the leak from the outside, the sea was too high—from that time one pump was constantly kept going, and at the end of every watch both pumps—they continued to work the pumps between the 1st and the 4th—they were constantly going after this happened—we left the ship on Friday; it was two days before that, Wednesday, that the great blow</p>

               <p>struck the ship—the pumps were kept constantly going on the day before the ship sank—we had a difficulty all along to keep the men to the pumps; it was as much as I could do to get them out of the forecastle, out of their berths—they had very hard work some days, they were fatigued and ex<lb/>hausted; but previous to the 5th they only wanted pressing to the pumps; but the day before the ship went down I had to lug them out of the fore<lb/>castle and drive them to the pumps—I talked to them quietly in the first place, and found that did not take effect, so I was obliged to hammer them to the pumps—I mean that I rope's-ended them to the pumps—I recollect very well the day on which the ship was left—it was the 6th, Friday—it was my watch from 8 to 12 that morning, the forenoon watch; and the morning watch was the second mate's—I was not seeing what was going on from 4 to 8—my watch was from 8 to noon, and during that time the pumps were kept continually going, and we had two meals in one, breakfast and dinner—7 o'clock was the breakfast hour of the watch below, and 8 o'clock the other; but they did not breakfast at all that morning—the first meal that we had was between 11 and 12, breakfast and dinner in one, and after that they started to get the anchors over the bows and the chains on deck, for the purpose of being ready to let go an anchor if necessary—all hands were employed in hauling up the chains—it took two hours and a half or three hours, after which they pumped about an hour, and then turned round and said that they would pump no longer—they had sores on their hands and legs—they said that they were really exhausted, and could not keep the ship afloat, and that the land was in sight—the captain tried to get them to keep her afloat till we arrived at Cadis—a man named Gorth was spokesman for all the rest, and they began showing their hands and legs, and saying they would pump no longer, and there was no more pumping—we kept the carpenter continually employed inside for an hour before the ship went down, poking oakum into the hole—Stovell, the cook, is an old man—I think he has been forty or fifty years at sea—the captain spoke to him in the presence of the crew as the oldest man, and he replied, "You are the captain of the ship, you ought to know how to act better than I do"—at 5 o'clock on the 6th there was a tremendous sea, but yery little wind—it had gradually died away to a calm, but still there was a considerable sea—after they refused to pump, the captain gave orders to get the boats ready—they began to get them ready at half-past 4 or 5 o'clock—there were three boats, but one was stove—the long boat and the gig were got out—I went in the long<lb/>boat—it was about three-quarters of an hour before the ship went down that we got into the boats—we stopped by till we saw the ship go down, which was while we were getting a sail rigged in the long-boat—we had not got too far to see it—we were 200 yards from it—we were picked up next morning by the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi>, between 11 and 12 in the forenoon—the wind was then gradually increasing—there was a cross sea on, with a westerly gale—it was not a worse sea than when we got into the boat, but a different sea, a cross sea—there were two winds meeting—the water came into the boat I was in, and we had to keep two buckets continually baling it out—we were 30 or 35 miles from land in the morning—if we had not been picked up there would not have been a soul left three or four hours afterwards, with that sea, to tell the tale—we must have gone to the bottom, no doubt—on the 5th I threw a bottle into the sea, with the latitude and longitude, as far as I could tell by dead reckoning, and stated what our prospects were—I never expected, at that time, to see the land again, but did not give up all hopes—it was my business to keep the log—I gave it to the captain on the 6th,</p>

I shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>, in London, I can<lb/>not say exactly when it was—the weather set in bad about six or seven days after we left London—we had very bad weather on Christmas Day—a quantity of water broke the skylight at that time, and came into the cabin; the steward baled it out—we had very bad weather on New Year's Day, the spars and casks on deck were washed adrift, and the ship was making water—on the Wednesday I believe before we left the ship or about three days before we left a heavy sea struck us—I was on the main deck and saw the captain running forwards—I saw a blanket and a sail brought by the second mate and a man named Graff—I did not see where the sail was put, but I saw it go over the bows—I was in the second mate's watch—the pumps were going after that—the pumps were going up to dinner time on the day we left the ship—we had breakfast and dinner together, and after that we got the chains up and then went to the pumps again, and kept pumping for about an hour and a half, I cannot say exactly—we stopped because the crew said they would pump no longer—after that the captain called the men aft, and I heard him ask them a few questions—he asked them if they were going to pump any more; they aaid no, that their hands were some, and their arms and legs, and they could pump no more—he begged of them many times to pump, and they said they could not pump any more—he said something to the cook, but I did not hear what—they said there was not much wind, though there was a heavy sea, and that it was a good time to get the boats out, as there was a chance of saving their lives—the captain then ordered the boats—I went in the long boat—we had bad weather after we got in, the wind was freshening during the night—Cox and I were apprentices together—he was very ill some days before he left the ship—he did no duty up to the time we left—he crawled on deck at times, but he was not fit—I attended on him, and brought him a bucket for his natural purposes—we got on board the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi>, and after that I heard the second mate and another little <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>, who has gone to sea, talking about the money—they said they wanted two months' pay, and if they did not gat it, they would stick a knife through the master—it was the second mate who said that—he is a foreign sailor who has gone to sea—since I have come to England I met the prisoner Cox, in February, in Ratclifte Highway—he told me the second mate wanted to see me, and in the afternoon Cox oame down to me again and said that the second mate wanted to see me, and I was to go up to his boarding-house—I went there and saw the seoond mate—he asked me which side I was going, I told him I did not know, I had nothing to do with it—he asked me who paid my passage to come to London—I said, "I did,"—he was talking about the Court—he said he had no wish to do anything, he had plenty to eat, plenty of sleep, plenty to drink, and plenty to play at skittles; and afterwards it would come fine weather, and then he should go to sea, and he should get well paid for his trouble for</p>

I am what is called a wreck agent, employed by the underwriters to make inquiries—I was at the Gloucester Railway Station, on my way down to Newport, before this inquiry took place at Greenwich—I saw the carpenter Lehmann at the station—I think it was the 18th or 19th of January, but am not sure which day—he introduced himself to me as the carpenter—he had a macintosh on—I should take the second prisoner to be Lehmann—he said he was the carpenter of the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>—there were two foreigners with him—I asked them, after I had spoken to them, to describe to me the circumstances under which this vessel was lost—the conversation was generally or altogether with the carpenter—he ascribed the loss to bad weather, and said that the ship sprung a leak, and described to me how the crew were intensely fatigued at the pumps; that their hands were perfectly Bore, and that he had never had such bad weather since he was at sea; that he was over the bows of the ship, as the wood ends had started, and, as for as I recollect, he was, off and on, over the bows for two hours; that they put oakum and put some sails over where the wood had started—he seemed to have been in great risk while he was over the bows—I said "I think it very strange how the wood ends could start in that way"—he appealed to the two others who were with him; the two furthest prisoners, I think—I particularly noticed one of them, from the form of his eyes, at the station—one was German, and this one was English—the other could speak a little English, and he confirmed him that the wood ends had started—he said nothing about a hole in the ship—I suggested to him that such things did occur, and he said that nothing of that sort had happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Shaftsbury-street, Walworth, and am a black<lb/>smith—On Saturday, 7th April, I was at my own house about 8 o'clock in the evening—I had been at home some time, and had had my tea—the prisoner came; my wife was out—I don't know whether she was gone to the prisoner's mother's—his mother's house is less than a quarter of a mile from mine—I was at home when a knock came to the door, and I was in the act of stirring the fire with this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner's wife has worked at my house for my wife, who is a laundress, about twelve months—she was in the habit of working there about two or three times a week—she came to iron—on hearing this knock I got up to go to the door; when I got to the parlour-door I heard a noise in the passage—I did not open the street-door; the prisoner's wife opened that—I heard a noise as if a person fell down, or was knocked down—the poker was hanging down—it was not lifted up at all—the prisoner was there, and he said to me directly, "It is you, you b—r"—he struck me a blow with his fist, and said, "I mean to murder you to-night,"and snatched the poker out of my hand, and struck me with it five or six times—the blows were given me over the table—he seized me by the stock with one hand and struck me five or six times with the poker, and said, "I intend to murder you"—I lost a wonderful deal of blood—his wife came to my assistance, and said, "Don't murder the man"—between his wife and I we managed to put him out of the house, and he broke the panel of the door after the door was closed, and said, "I will go in and finish him"—I at last escaped by the back way into the next house—I afterwards went to a chemist and then to Dr. Howitt—I was under Dr. Howitt's care about nine days; I was not able to get out at all during that time—about two minutes after this happened I put a shawl over my head and went to the prisoner's mother's—I expected to find my wife there; I found the prisoner there; he knocked me down, and my arm was black and blue—he said he meant to finish me—his mother called out "Murder," and the prisoner was dragged away from me, and I was hurt a good deal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—on 5th April, I was living apart from him at Mrs. Clement's, 5, Park-lane, Clapham—I did live at 4, Mill-row, Clapham, and I went from there to Mrs. Clements—I went to try to get a lodging—no one would take me in on account of my husband—on 5th April, I saw my husband—I had been washing and I saw him against the door of the lodging—he asked me to give him a little hat brush, and I said yes, and he followed me into the passage and asked if I would have a little beer—I said, "No"—I went up stairs and got the hat brush and gave it him—I went out and left him there—I met Mrs. Clements, and I told her he was in the house—I returned with Mrs. Clements—I went in doors and sat down, and he sat down by the side of me—he went and got some beer and asked me to drink with him, and I did so—Mrs. Clements asked him to go, and I asked him myself to go—he said he had very comfortable lodgings—I said I was very glad of it, and I told him not to trouble me and I would not trouble him—he was going, and he came to the foot of the stairs and asked me to shake hands with him, and I did so—he then asked me to stop the night with him—I said,"No, you said you had a comfortable lodging, go to your lodging"—he then said he would stop—Mrs. Clements</p>

               <p>said she hoped he would not come there, it was a quiet place and we did not want to have a noise—he again asked me to stop—I said, "No," and he left—on the following morning about 6 o'clock, I was getting my break<lb/>fast, Mrs. Clements was gone to work, and Mr. Clements was out; there were two children in the house—while getting my breakfast a knock came at the door; I went to the door and it was my husband—he asked me for a bag which he had left the night before—I said he had not left a bag there, I supposed he had left it in his room at night and had forgotten it—I looked round for the bag and I said there was no one there—he then asked me for some water—I said, "Why do you not go to your lodging"—he then said with an oath that he would cut my throat, and before the words were out of his mouth I felt the cut at my throat—I struggled with him very much and defended the cut off with my hand, and he cut the leaders of my left hand—I fell and he fell on me—he rose, and he was endeavouring to cut my throat—I fell down and was on my knees—I struggled and got the razor from him, and he put his fingers in my throat to tear the wound open—the wound bled very much indeed; it bled much more after that—my husband got up and ran away—I was very much exhausted—I hallooed murder as long as I could, and some gentleman came and said I had cut my throat as I had the razor in my hand—I said no, my husband had done it—I saw Mrs. Clements and asked her to run for a doctor, and I was taken to the hospital—I don't know of any cause for this—my husband has not been happy with me for the last three years—I believe it was jealousy, but I believe the jealousy has been on the wrong side—I have had two warrants and a summons for him for his ill usage, and the last time he said if I had him brought up again, he would give me something for it—that is about a month ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bellamy, of 115, Union-street, Borough—about a quarter to 12 o'clock on the evening of 21st April I was with a Mrs. Mauler at the Red Lion public-house, very nearly opposite to where I live—I had not been in there more than while I got served with my supper beer, which I had gone for—I gave the barman a sovereign—the prisoners were there when I went in—there were a great many people there—I had known the prisoners before, by living in the neighbourhood—I received 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change from the barman—the prisoners saw me receive it—having received it I left the Red Lion with Mrs. Mauler—the prisoners followed us out instantly—I was crossing the road to go to my house, with my beer in my hand—the male prisoner came up to me, and asked me what I meant by calling his father <hi rend="italic">moucher</hi>—I had not called his father <hi rend="italic">moucher</hi>—he said if I had made use of such an expression my husband was to come out and show what he could do—my husband came up out of his shop—he is a boot and shoe maker—we have been residing in that house three years—when he came up the male prisoner instantly attacked him, struck him, and they both fell—the prisoner got up off the ground, turned round, and struck me—I was about two yards from where the scuffle took place between him and my husband—I tried to help my husband off the ground—I did not strike the prisoner in doing that—I had not struck him at all before he came and struck me in the face—I had a black eye, and my forehead was all scratched—I fell on the ground—at this time I had the change of the money in my right hand—having struck me, he made a grasp at my hand, and all the money was taken from me but 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he held my hand, wrenched it open, and took the money out, but some of the silver fell on the ground—he picked some of it up, ran away, and I pursued him—the female prisoner did not do anything to me, before she stole my shawl—nobody else did anything to me whilst I was on the ground—I ran after the male prisoner, and came up to him at Princes-street, which is in Union-street—he then struck me again a violent blow in the face—I fell, and he ran away—I got up and pursued him—I called out "Thief," and "Police"—when I was down the second time the female prisoner came up, and assisted</p>

               <p>in pulling me about till she pulled the shawl off my back—she is his mother—she then ran away to the end of the buildings where they live—I could see her—she threw the shawl to another son, who is not in custody—he was standing at the end of the buildings where they live—I cannot say whether that son is older or younger than the one at the bar—the son went with the shawl up the buildings, where they live—I had got up from the ground at this time—some man, I don't know who, was holding the male prisoner during this time, about thirty or forty yards, I should think, from where I had been knocked down the second time—he had run away after I was knocked down the second time—I saw him given into the custody of Ireland, the policeman—I never got back any of the money that was taken out of my hand.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Mauler, of 20, Pepper-street, Union-street, Borough, a bellhanger and gasfitter—he is employed by his father—on Saturday night, 21st April, I was with the last witness in the Red Lion; only while she was being served with a pot of half-and-half—I saw the sovereign changed, and the change handed to her—the prisoners were both in the public-house at the time—I knew them by sight—they</p>

I have got none"—I am positive I saw him take the money, and pick it up from the ground—no one interfered with Mrs. Bellamy while she was on the ground—she got up and ran after the male prisoner, whose brothers I know by sight—two of them were there while Mm Bellamy was on the ground—I think they are older than he—they interfered, and tried to get him away from Mrs. Bellamy while she was on the ground—she had not got hold of him—they only said, "Come away," they did not do anything—while Mrs. Bellamy was on the ground the first time the female prisoner struck her on the face—I can't say whether Mrs. Bellamy saw her do so—there was a crowd of people—it is a very bad neighbourhoodz—the male prisoner ran on, and then turned round and struck Mrs. Bellamy, who was pursuing him—she got up to him near Princes-street, which is five or six yards from the place where she was first knocked down—he struck her and knocked her down a second time—while she was on the ground, I saw the female prisoner tear her shawl off and give it to one of her sons who had been present at the first transaction—it was a silk shawl, with large flowers on—the female prisoner then ran up the court—the prisoners do not live very far from where Mrs. Bellamy was knocked down the second time—I saw the male prisoner stopped by a gentleman—after he knocked Mrs. Bellamy down the second time, he continued his flight till the gentleman stopped him—he had got about four or five yards from where he knocked her down the second time—Mrs. Bellamy cried out, "Stop thief!" and I saw him stopped and given in charge to a policeman.</p>

I remained some few minutes, and then went towards the arches, where my cab was standing for hire when the trains came in—I heard a noise like a fall, and went and saw Thomas Faye fall, just as I got to the spot—he laid on his back very quiet—I did not lift him up—he did not speak or make any movement—the prisoner was about three yards in front of his feet—he was lifted up—I did not see him taken away—I went to the Elephant and Castle, remained there perhaps two minutes, and then went away to my cab.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of James'-place, Fore-street, Lambeth—I was at the Elephant and Castle on Friday, 16th March, and heard the prisoner and deceased quarrelling about work—I could not under<lb/>stand exactly what was said, but after some time they agreed to go out and fight—I do not know which proposed it, one was as willing as the other—they were both under the influence of liquor—they left the Elephant and Castle together to fight—I remained behind some little time—I then went to see what was taking place—(<hi rend="italic">The witness was cautioned that he need not say any<lb/>thing tending to criminate himself</hi>,)—I do not want to say anything—I will speak the truth—I took no part whatever in encouraging them to fight—I saw them sparring together, and after that I saw the prisoner lay hold of Faye by the legs and <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> him on his head—he fell on the back of his head, as far as I could see—I said to the prisoner that it was a shame, and he struck me—I struck him back again—I did not see Faye afterwards till I saw him on Monday night—he was helped up and led away—I cannot say whether he walked—he seemed sensible—he was not bleeding that</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of Kingswood-place, South Lam<lb/>beth—on Friday, 16th March, about half-past 9 o'clock, I was returning from work, and saw the prisoner and the deceased come out of the Elephant and Castle—they crossed over the road and went into one of the railway arches—there were one or two others with them—I stood at the gate of the Vaux<lb/>hall station and looked in—it was within the enclosure—I stood there two or three minutes, and saw them pull off their smock frocks for the purpose of fighting—they stood sparring for a minute or two, and then the prisoner rushed at Faye with his head downwards, caught hold of his legs, and turned him over—he fell on the back of his head very heavily—he was the heavier man of the two, and about forty years of age—he laid there for a few seconds, groaning, and was picked up—he stood up as well as he could, and then Harper went at him a second time—there was more sparring, and he went in to him and turned him over in the same way, and the fall was much heavier than the first—he fell on the back of his head—they were both intoxicated—I remained two or three minutes, but he was not sensible—he never spoke; he groaned very much, and was dragged away to the Elephant and Castle—I then went for a policeman, but could not find one, and when I came back I saw the prisoner and Harrington fighting.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you ever seen either of them before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had seen the deceased—I cannot say that I have seen the prisoner, but am quite sure he is the man—they passed me on the opposite side going to the arches, but I could not hear what they said to each other—the deceased was much heavier and taller, and apparently a much more powerful man than the prisoner—they were both intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse dealer, of 1, Freeport-place, Wandsworth-road; on Friday, 16th March, I was at the Elephant and Castle when the deceased was brought there; he was like half tipsy; stupid—I looked at his head and saw just a little cut at the back of it, about as large as my nail, and clotted with blood—I can't exactly say the size, on account of the hair—after I had washed it he came to a little bit, and I tried to persuade him to go to the hospital, but he would not—there was a small quantity of blood, enough for me to see—it was such a blow as might be occasioned by his falling with the back of his head on a stone or hard substance—I stopped with him till 11 or 12, I left him then; I saw him again on Saturday morning; he told me that he had been into the gas works again to sleep—he seemed very bad and complained of his head—I was with him about an hour, and tried to persuade him again to go to the hospital in a cab, but he would not, and I did not see him again till Monday, the 19th, at 10 or 11 o'clock—I then got a cab and took him to the workhouse; he appeared very bad—he seemed fixed and stupid—I kept going every day in and out</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inmate and wardsman of Lambeth Poorhouse—on Monday, the 19th, about 5 o'clock, the deceased was brought there—he appeared rather lightheaded, and complained of his head—he was left in my charge—he could walk and stand, but he went to bed half an hour after he came, and complained of a violent pain in his head—I looked at the back of his head; there was a cut or wound about an inch long, with a piece of sticking plaister on it—I took the old plaister off and put new on about an hour after he was brought in—the medical officer was sent for, who ordered him to go to bed and have all nourishment, wine, bread and butter and tea, and whatever he could take, which I gave him; but he could not take much—he was put into a bath and cleaned, he came to me—he complained next morning of a violent pain across his head, in front, and seemed much worse—he had taken the medicine that I gave him—he had constant fits till Saturday the 4th, when he died about a quarter past 4 in the afternoon—the first fit he had was on Wednesday night—he was a little sensible when he came out of the fits, but he had no time before the next fit took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon and medical officer of Lambeth Workhouse—on Monday, 19th March, I was sent for to attend upon Thomas Faye, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I found him in the bath room washing himself—I accosted him—his replies were confused and incoherent—I asked him what was the matter with him; he said, "Nothing"—my attention was directed by the bath man to his head—I examined it, and found a slight wound about three-quarters of an inch long; it appeared to be incised, and such as might have been inflicted with a flint or a sharp stone, or any sharp instrument—I removed the plaister, and found it was in process of healing—in my opinion a violent fall on the back of the head on a stone would probably produce it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you tell whether the wound had bled much? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should presume not; there was a little clotted blood on the hair—it was a sort of wound more likely to be caused by a fell than a blow; the small quantity of blood would lead me to that conclusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SHARPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he a heavy person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A remarkably heavy man, a very fine man—his being heavy would be more likely to cause a wound of this kind—after I had examined him in the bath room he was received into a ward by my orders—I saw him again in about an hour; he was then leaning his head in his hand—I spoke to him, and he complained of his head—I ordered his head to be shaved in order that I might make a more complete examination—that was done—I ordered him a mustard plaister—I did not at that time detect any injury to the brain, though I sus<lb/>pected it—the wound had only penetrated the scalp—the pupils of his eyes were somewhat dilated; that, and other symptoms, led me to the conclusion that he was suffering from concussion of the brain—he said he had lost his appetite, and complained of great oppression in breathing—I had him put to bed, and saw him twice next day—I had received no information as to the particulars of this fight, but from the information I received, and from the symptoms, I judged he was suffering from compression of the brain, and treated him for that.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had been injured and tripped up twice bo that he fell on the back of his head, would that have accounted for what you saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might—I don't think the fact of his having been of intemperate habits would make any difference in this injury—by concussion I simply mean stunning, from which a person recovers shortly; compression is the result of the slow oozing of blood on the surface of the brain, which gradually causes that effect—a patient is less likely to recover from that than from concus<lb/>sion—it is a small oozing from the brain or one of its vessels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SHARPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe on the Tuesday evening he was half delirious? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; those symptoms kept on increasing—he had an epileptic fit on Wednesday evening; those continued to the time of his death—I was not with him at the exact moment of his death, but I was shortly before—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—I first opened the head—I found a quantity of extravasated blood on the surface of the brain, and towards the base—I collected it; there was about three ounces of fluid blood—I cannot exactly define how much there was at the base of the brain; the blood there was lying on the right side, at the back of the head, on a level with the ear—it commenced exactly at the cut which was just at the apex, and went to the back part; it had gravitated down to the base of the brain—the blood had all proceeded from an artery which was wounded; that would be likely in time to cause death—I saw the extent to which it had gravitated, and it must have destroyed life—it would be likely to cause epileptic fits with other symptoms—the ruptured artery on the brain was the immediate cause of death—I examined the skull, it was unusually thin—if he had been tripped up by his legs and fallen, it might have caused both the extravasated blood and the wound; it is a common cause—I attach no importance to the scalp wound, it was purely external; both the external and the internal rupture of the artery were, at the same part—the proba<lb/>bility of such a rupture would be increased by reason of the heavy weight of the man, and would be still further increased by the remarkable thinness of the skull; the thinner the skull is the more the external violence would be felt—I examined the brain, and found it in an unusually healthy condition; there was nothing in it to cause death, except the rupture of the vessel and the blood in the brain—I found a fracture of the skull extending from the apex, or about an inch below it, to about an inch from the cut, extending through the temporal bone right through the bones of the ear in a diagonal direction; it was a linear fracture without depression—I should attribute such a fracture more to a fall than a blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say there was a crack, but no depression of the bone on the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a sudden knock would cause it, which would be increased by the man being heavy and his skull not being thick—I attri<lb/>bute death to the effusion of blood—we have many cases where persons recover from simple fracture of the skull; if it had only been a linear fracture the patient might have recovered—seeing the blood that oozed from the rupture, I am of opinion that that was the cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When the case first came before you, did you think it was a serious case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not feel certain what had been the nature of the injury he had received, or whether he had received any—that there was some effusion of the brain I felt certain, but had no history before me—I did not consider the little cut at the back of the head of any conse<lb/>quence by itself—I felt certain that a fall had caused it—I was not aware, during life, that there had been any fracture of the skull—I think it more likely to have arisen from a blow or a series of blows—the body was gene<lb/>rally</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070210"/>
               <p>healthy—the cause of death was solely and entirely to be found in the brain—I should say that a man must fall at least four feet to cause that rupture of an artery of the brain—a man drunk and falling down might do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a man were standing, and his legs were tripped up, would he fall four feet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, this man would, for he was six feet high—his head would fall four or five feet, I should say.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, P.</hi>) On Wednesday night, 11th April, I was on duty in Pomeroy-street—the prisoner was given into my custody by a female who said in his presence that he had assaulted her—there were three marks of violence on her face—I told him he must go to the station with me—he said, "What! for two such b—y stinking wh—s as them; as for you, I will lay you dead in the road if you attempt to put a hand upon me"—I persuaded him to go to the station quietly, which he refused to do—I took hold of him by the arm—he was trying to get his arm away from me, and struck me a blow on the face—I took him by the cuff of his coat, and put my other hand inside his cravat and said, "Now then, for what you were going to do"—I took him to the station and he was dis<lb/>charged, the woman was obliged to take out a summons—I saw him again about five minutes after he left the station, near the Montpelier public-house, Queen's-road, Peckham—I was passing and he said, "Oh, you b—<hi rend="italic">smot</hi>; you have not got your wish to-night"—I told him it was not my wish to lock him up, and I had not said anything about it at the station; that I did not tell them he had assaulted me—he said, "No, you did not; will you come and have some beer?"—I said, "No, thank you"—I walked away—I saw him again about 12 o'clock at night, outside the Victoria beer-shop, in Pomeroy-street—I was still on my beat—he was halloing and making a great noise—I went down—several of his mates were there, and when he saw me he said, "This is the b—that took me to the station to-night, I should like to give him <hi rend="italic">a doing</hi>"—I persuaded him to go home, and think no more of it; two of his mates got hold of him—he said, "Let me go, I will give that b—<hi rend="italic">a doing</hi> to-night"—that was all he said that night—I saw him again the following night about 12 o'clock, in front of the Victoria public-house—Cox, a constable, was with me—I heard several people talking—the prisoner came out, I did not know he was there—he began halloing and said "I wonder where this b—<hi rend="italic">snot</hi> is who took me to the station last night, if I could see him I would soon do for him"—one of his mates pointed across the road and said, "There stand two"—the prisoner then ran across the road and said, "This is the b—that took me to the station last night," pointing to me—he came up quickly and said, "You are the one that took me to the station last night, are you not?"—I said, "Yes; have not you forgotten that yet?"—I persuaded him to think nothing more home—I said, "That is all settled as far as you and I are</p>

On 12th April, about twelve o'clock, I was in Clifton-fields—I met Luscombe in Pomeroy-street—I remember the people turning out from the Victoria public-house, and among others the prisoner—we were then standing on the other side of the street—the prisoner crossed over, pointed to Luscombe, and said, "That is the b—that took me to the station; it would take forty b—policemen to take me there to-night; if ever you put a hand upon me again it will be worse for you," or "I will do for you"—Luscombe told him that he had nothing to say to him, and said, u Why don't you go away home?"—a man then came out of the public-house with some beer; he asked for a drink—he said, "Why don't you drink and go home?"—the prisoner said, u The police<lb/>man did more than his duty last night;" and he said that he would keep in the street all night if he liked—I then went on my beat, and left Lus<lb/>combe to go on his—a few minutes afterwards Crutcher called me—I went up the street, and found the prisoner in Luscombe's custody—Luscombe was staggering back, and said to me, "Look out for the knife"—I made a catch at the prisoner to catch hold of him very quickly, and I received a blow from him on the side of my head with something very hard; I believe it was not his fist—I did not see anything in his hand, but I think there must have been something beyond that which nature gave him—a stone in a handkerchief would produce such an effect as I felt; I was knocked down Benseless—two or three minutes after I came to myself I found that Lus-combe had taken the prisoner—I followed them to the station, and found Luscombe bleeding from the back—I saw the prisoner at the station, and found on him this stone (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was done up in this handkerchief in the way it is now; there was a knot tied above the stone to keep it there—the prisoner was charged with stabbing Luscombe—he said, "You have not found the knife"—that was all he said—he had been drinking, but was not drunk; he knew what he was about.</p>

I am a widow, residing at 2, Frederick-terrace, Com<lb/>mercial-road, Peckham—on the evening of 5th April last, about half-past 5, I was coming out of my house—I had to go round the corner to Camden-grove, and as I turned, about twenty or thirty yards off, I saw the prisoner and another at the opposite side; they came up to me and asked me the way to the Kent road—I had to turn round to tell them—I pointed with my hand; they said a gentleman had directed them wrong the other day and asked me to show them right, and asked if they had to cross a field—I said, "Yes"—they then asked if they should be able to get an omnibus—I should say our conversation lasted about four minutest—during that time I had sufficient opportunity of seeing them, they were very near to me—the moment I turned round I missed my watch—they were then both in sight—I just looked down and saw that my chain was hanging—I turned round and said, "I have lost my watch, that woman has got it"—when I called out, the prisoner and her companion ran away; they were near enough to hear me—when I left my house I had my watch safe—I had not spoken to any one from the time I left my house till I saw these women—after I called out and saw the women running, a man came directly to me and said, "What have you lost?" and put his hands on each of my shoulders—I think it was to stop me, but I would not let him—I got away and followed after the prisoner and her companion as fast as I could—I never saw the man afterwards—I was at the corner that leads into the Commercial-road—I followed them and called out, "Stop the women, they have robbed me of my watch"—the prisoner was stopped almost directly afterwards, at the Rosemary Branch public-house—I got up at the time she was stopped—she had a muff in her hand; she was taken into the parlour and was kept there till Sergeant Castleman came—the other woman ran up a very quiet street, there was no one to stop her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am general manager to the prosecutors—the prisoner was in their employment about three months, and had care of the stables and hones—I never authorized him to sell or shoot any of the horses—I asked him, on 30th March, if he had sold or offered for sale any horse or horses belonging to the firm—his reply was that he had done nothing of the sort; that he was aware such rumours were about, but they were entirely without foundation—every six months we take a general stock; this happened to be at the time of the general stock taking—it was the prisoner's duty to hand in, on 31st March, an account of the stock with respect to the horses—we did not receive it from him, in consequence of which I received this note from him—it was put in evidence at the police court—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Sir, I am so unwell that I cannot attend to my duties this day, but I hope to be able to do so to-morrow, and trust my absence may not cause you any inconvenience.—<hi rend="largeCaps">G. D</hi>. Bond")—information was given me which led me to go and see a milkman named Mitchell, who I found had possession of one of my master's hones—I did not see the prisoner from that time till after he was apprehended—I went to his house previously, and was unable to find him there—he was taken into custody by my direc<lb/>tions either on the Tuesday night or the Wednesday morning—the two horses, which are the subject of this inquiry, had been, up to the 1st March, in my employer's stables, and had been daily used—I cannot possibly say when I saw them last—I saw two horses at the police court; they were my employer's property—I had seen them in my employer's possession within a week of the prisoner's apprehension—I saw them some time in March—one was a grey hone, and the other was a kind of a brown or bay.</p>

               <p>is that it would have been late in the evening when I left; on Monday—I have no positive recollection—I was in my office when I asked him about the horses—he came in to see me about some other matters, or was passing through the office—he would have been making preparation for taking his portion of stock in the factory—all the offices have windows looking into the yard, but mine is arranged so that I can see a little of both yards, but not so much of the second yard—Mitchell would generally drive into the one that I could not see so well—Mr. Peek's window looks directly into the second yard, and mine does partially—there were twelve horses on the establishment—the two that I saw at the police-court were lame—the work required of the horses in our employ is rather heavy; continuous work, and long journeys—it has been reported to me at times that the grey and brown horses were not in proper condition—then we had others, and they were relieved for the time—that might have meant that they were too lame to do their work without rest.</p>

I am a general warehouseman, living in Houndsditch—I keep au account at the Unity Bank—this order for a cheque book is not in my writing—I never signed this cheque, but it is very much like my signatnre—I know the prisoner Barrett; he was in my employment for about five or six weeks, about five or six months ago—he had frequent opportunities of seeing my writing—he has transacted business for me at the Unity Bank; taken cheques there, and received money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Goad, jeweller, in the Borough—on 16th April I saw Barrett about 8 o'clock in the evening—he looked at two rings which would come to about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and asked me if I could give him change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I told him I would see if he would put his name at the back—he put a name at the back of the note—I said I was afraid I should not be able to give him change for it—he said he was going as far as the Elephant and Castle, and would call again—this is the note—I read the name—it was "J. Williams, 18, City-road"—I know this note by the name—he went out of the shop, leaving the note—I kept it till he returned, and then told him that I was afraid I should not be able to change it for him—I asked him where he got it from—he said that he had a friend who came into 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I was afraid I should not be able to change it for him, and he said he would go and ask his friend if he could lend him the money—he returned, and said that he was not able to find him—I told him if he left the note I should be able to change it for him in the morning—he said that he should be going past the Bank of England himself in the morning, and could get it cashed—he left me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as deposit on the rings, and weut away, taking the note with him—Mr. Lyons afterwards came and brought the note—he took it away again with him—I went and gave information to the police—I went to Mr. Lyons' shop that evening and saw Barrett there—there was a policeman there, who asked him if he had any more notes, and he denied having any more—I said that I had seen him with some more notes in a bag when he took the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note out—I saw a woman in Mr. Lyons' shop with him—he had not given me a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that evening to change, nor had I given him a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I and my father keep a clothing establishment in the Borough—on the evening of 16th of April, Barrett came into our shop about a quarter to 9, accompanied by a young woman—he selected a stock of clothes, value 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and offered me this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he told me that he had just bought two rings of Mr. Goad, had paid him with a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and had received this note in part change, and wished me to change it—I did not like his appearance—I told him that if that was the case, I would go over to Mr. Goad, and perhaps he would givemegold for it—I went to Mr. Goad's and saw Mr. Payne—I afterwards returned to my shop, and detained Barrett in the shop while Mr. Payne went for the police—he was eventually taken</p>

On the 17th, from some information I received, I went to Stone's-end police-station, and saw Barrett there—I told him I was sorry to see him there, and asked him if his friends were aware that he was there—he said he believed they were, but he had not seen them—I said I understood he was there about Borne notes—he said, "Yes—I am; I should like to tell you the truth about it"—I have known him some years—he knows me to be an officer—I then said, "You know I am a police officer, and whatever you say I shall have to make use of in evidence against you before the Magistrate"—he then said, "I received <hi rend="italic">them</hi> notes from a person last night in front of the Mansion-house"—he told me that his grandmother had lately left him between 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that this was some of the money to go on with—he meaut the grandmother of the person from whom he had received them; he said, "He gave me these notes to get cashed for him"—I said, "Is that man a stranger to you?"—he said, "No; his name is Reuben William Streaker, and he lives some<lb/>where near Kenuington-park"—I had, previous to seeing the prisoner, seen the four notes which the officer had—I said, "I see on the back of some of the notes there is the name of Sole and Turner, and they are solicitors in Aldermanbury, close to where you live"—he said, "Yes, I wrote the name of Sole and Turner on one of the notes, but not on all of them"—I said, "I saw you with a man in Finsbury-circus two or three days ago, who was a stranger to me"—he said, "That is the man I had the notes of"—I had seen him with another man as I told him—I saw the two prisoners together about three days previous to Barrett's being taken in custody.</p>
