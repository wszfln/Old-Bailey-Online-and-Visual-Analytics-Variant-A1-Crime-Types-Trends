On the 10th of February I was at work in the shop, a little before four o'clock, and heard my wife scream for assistance—I went to her, and found her grappling with the prisoner—I took charge of him, and sent her back to see if she had lost any thing—she found she had lost this watch, guard-chain, and a tooth-pick—the policeman came over, add while he came the tooth-pick dropped from some part of the prisoner—I saw his left hand fall, I took hold of it, and took the watch and guard-chain from it—I do not know whether the outer door was shut or open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Godfrey, at Hanwell. On Tuesday, the 2nd of February, I was going towards Hanwell, between nine and ten o'clock at night—I had occasion to go by the church, path, and saw a man standing by the old house—it was the prisoner—he said nothing to me as I went—I returned about ten minutes before ten, and as I passed under the arch of the railway station, he said, "It is a snowy night"—I said, "Yes, sir," and walked on till I got to the wooden swing gate—he seized hold of the gate, to prevent my passing through—I got through, and he said, "Would you like a good rolling in the snow, my dear?"—I did not speak—I was very much frightened—he continued to follow me: and when I got to the trees, he said, "Have you not got any money to give a poor fellow for a night's lodging?"—I put my hand down and held my pocket—he took hold of my hand with one hand, and with the other felt all round me—I struggled violently with him, and hurt my arm in struggling—I have been obliged to wear it in a sling—he continued to hold and abuse me till I got to the iron swing gate, and said there, "I will not let you go through till you tell me whether you are going to Green-ford"—I was so frightened I could not speak, but 1 pointed to Mr. Carr's cottage, it being the nearest—he swore at me dreadfully, gave me a violent blow on my back, and pushed me through the gate—the blow, I after<lb/>wards found, cut my clothes through—I saw a small dark thing in his hand, what it was I don't know, but my dress on the right hand side was cut and torn—the cut was a small notch—and then it was torn, I think, in pulling; but my things were cut through the back as well—he then walked alongside the iron fence, and turned and watched me—I had never seen him before that night—I have not a doubt of his identity at all.</p>

I am ostler at the Duke of York public-house, at Han<lb/>well, which is very nearly a quarter of a mile from the iron gate, and the swing-gate of the churchyard—I remember Tuesday the 2nd of February—I did not hear of the attack on the prosecutrix that night—I heard of it the day after the prisoner was taken, not before—I saw the prisoner on that Tuesday evening, about half-past seven o'clock, coming out of the door-way—I was feeding a horse at the door of the Duke of York—he said, "You have got a cold job"—it was snowing very fast—I said it was rather a cold night for him to be out, as he said he had hurt himself at the Asylum, carrying stone—he said he should not have been out, had it not been to look after his father—he went into the Duke of York again—not with me—he passed me at the door, and went into the tap-room, and after the horse went away, I went into the tap-room and saw him there—that was I suppose about eight—I remained in the tap-room till I should think half-past ten—I was then called out to go to my supper—I am not called to supper at any particular time—I should not think it was earlier than half-past ten—the prisoner was there all the time I was—I know it was Tuesday night, because the ostler, whose work I was doing, came back on the Monday night, but the weather being so severe he could not stand the work—I had been engaged to take his place while he was away—I had done it for about ten weeks—I was not called on to go before the Magistrate—I cannot tell how that was—I was told of it the day after he was taken into custody—I do not know when he was com<lb/>mitted.</p>

                  </hi>. I was housemaid at No. 14, Bedford-place, when the Miss Sinclairs were there. 1 remember their leaving on the 4th of Fe<lb/>binary—I saw them in their bed-room between ten and eleven o'clock—I noticed that there was a bundle left in the room—neither Mrs. or Miss Sinclair gave me any instructions about its going to Mr. Learmont's—after they were gone I was going down stairs, and met the prisoner—I asked where she was going to—she said she was going up to Mrs. Sinclair's bed-room for a parcel which was left there by Mrs. Sinclair to be divided be<lb/>tween her and me—I followed her into the bed-room, and she was taking up some old slippers which were lying there, she said they were left for her, and I might have part of them if I wished—I asked her where was the parcel she said Mrs. Sinclair had left to be divided between us—she rose up from the slippers, looked round the room, and the parcel was on the bed—she said, "This must be it, there is no other in the room;" and said to me, "Bring it down stairs "I did so, and put it on a slab at the bottom of the stairs—I then went to a ring at the door-bell—a few minutes afterwards I went down to the kitchen floor, and the bundle was not on the slab then—there is a bed-room on the kitchen floor, which the prisoner and I occupied—I went in, and found her there with this tippet in her hand, looking at it—the pair of cuffs, the dressing-gown, and towel were on the bed—I said, "Mrs. Sinclair could never have given you this tippet"—she said, "Yes, she did"—she said Mrs. Sinclair had promised her the tippet; as she had got a bad cold, she was to wear it—I took the dressing-gown in my hand, and said, as Mrs. Sinclair had left the parcel to be divided between us, I would have the dressing-gown—she then said Mrs. Sinclair had left the parcel all for her, and I should have none—we bad some words about it that night, and on Friday morning also—Miss Wright then heard us, and tent down to us—she took the whole of the things, and wrote to Miss Sinclair.</p>

I heard a noise as if some one was breaking a lock about ten minutes to eight o'clock; I went out round to the meadow at the back—I stopped there till a quarter past eight, and heard some one in a garden—I got over into Mr. Vann's garden, and found this roll of paper hanging on the seat of an arbour where I had been before, and it was not there—I secreted myself, and in a few minutes I saw the prisoner put his head out of a green-house—I ran and collared him—he said it was all right—I secured him, and he begged me to let him go—he then begged me not to take him to Mr. Gee's, as he knew him—I took him to the watch-house, and found this cord and a knife on him—I went to the place with his shoes, which I took off, and found the marks in the snow, and then I found a door had been broken open—I went to Mrs. Vann's garden, and found some shells and a pair of gloves.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The charter-party was here read, dated</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th July</hi>, 1839, <hi rend="italic">by which it was agreed between M. S.

On the 7th of September, last year, the brig <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>, Captain Loose, sailed from Liverpool to Santa Cruz, in Cuba, with a cargo of plantation stores—on the 10th of November, same year, was totally lost fifteen miles to the eastward of Cape Cruz. The captain noted his protest in the town of Falmouth, Jamaica, on the 16th of November; and the letter to the owner of the same date stated that very little, if any, of the cargo would be saved. However, on the 5th ultimo, a report appeared in the "Shipping Gazette," published in this city, that part of the cargo was saved; consequently the insurance company have refused to settle a total loss until a specification of what goods saved is produced; or if none saved, a letter to that effect. Now having an interest in some part of the cargo, I should feel greatly obliged, as I said before, for such information as may enable me to come to a final settlement with the parties here; and, if possible, please let me I have your reply by return packet; but at any rate without delay.</p>

                  </hi>. I was clerk to Zulueta and Co.

In 1839, I was master of the <hi rend="italic">Bencoolen</hi>, bound for Cape Hayti; on the 23rd of October 1839, we were off the harbour at Cape Hayti—my vessel was 402 tons—a pilot-boat came on board with three pilots in it, and all came on board—there is a reef of rocks about two and a half or three miles from where the pilots boarded us—I observed a brig to the eastward of us which turned out to be the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>, Captain Loose—she was eastward of us, and going right stem on the reef—this reef laid down on the chart produced, is well known to mariners—here is what is called the "Silver Bank"—he was going on the reefs right off the harbour's mouth—they form the outside part of the harbour, and extend about fifteen miles down to the eastward—the direc<lb/>tion the brig was taking was the subject of remark—we waited some time to see if she would alter her course, but she did not—the pilot on board made a remark to me—seeing she did not alter her course, I fired a gun as a signal to her—she paid no attention to that, but still went on—as she did not alter her course, I ordered the pilot on board to go away in his boat directly on board the brig as quick as he could, as I thought she was in danger—the pilot pulled away and boarded her—she did not alter her course till he had boarded, but was still steering right in the direction of the reefs—the wind was blowing very little indeed from the west—it was a very little westerly wind, I believe, but am not very confident of that—she was being carried in that direction by the wind—she could have avoided it—when the pilot went on board she altered her course, and then came up into the harbour—I after<lb/>wards saw Loose on shore—he said something to me. about the Silver Bank—I observed that his rudder had unshipped, and a jury rudder was made—she carried away her jury rudder and iron—a day or two after, I was required to attend a survey on board the vessel—a gentleman there officiated as Lloyd's agent—the brig was surveyed and repairs ordered—I remained there seven or eight weeks—Loose remained thereabout a fortnight—I saw him during that time almost daily, and conversed with him about the brig, where she had been and what had happened to her—I saw him during the survey—I</p>

                  </hi>. I sailed as first mate of the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>, on a voyage from Liverpool, bound to Santa Cruz—Captain Loose engaged me in Liverpool, on the 4th of September, 1839, on board the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>, to go this voyage from Liverpool to Santa Cruz, from there to St. Jago de Cuba, and from there to Swansea, that was my understanding when I engaged—I have been brought up to the sea, and have commanded a ship in the South American trade—I have often crossed the Atlantic, and have been to the West Indies—I am acquainted with the navigation of those seas—I was in the hold of the ship on the 4th of September, the day I joined her—we took in a few cases of hardware, and a few kegs of paint—that was all the cargo that came after I joined her, and they came by Zulueta's bills—I signed bills for them as mate—it is customary for two notes to come down with goods to the ship, one the mate signs, and that goes back, and the other is kept—from the time I joined the ship, on the 4th, till she sailed, no goods were received, except those from Zulueta's—I am quite confident of that—I locked the ship up every night before I left her—I saw her again in the morning—when the lading was completed, one-third of the ship remained unfilled—I am sure eighty crates of earthen-ware were not loaded on board after the 4th—there were none, nor any cases of flannel, cloth, or prints, nor any tierces of beef, barrels of pork, or firkins of butter, only for the ship's use, and they were on board previous to the 4th—I saw the hold every day from the time I joined the ship till the ship sailed—I am quite sure no goods, except those I have mentioned,</p>

               <p>were brought on board after that time, only the kegs of paint and cases of hardware, that is all—she was ready for sea previous to that, but it was found out her foremast was bad, it was taken out that day, and we put a new foremast in that day, we had two tierces of beef, and four barrels of pork on board for the ship's use—that was a scanty quantity to carry us on the outward voyage—I have always seen, for the last fifteen years, that a ship on that voyage is provisioned out and home both—I am sure she had not provisions for the homeward voyage—we went out of the dock on the 6th, and entered the river, and sailed on the 7th—we had ten hands on board, all hands included—in going round Ireland, we went through the North Channel—we fetched Carlingford light on the Irish coast—I be<lb/>lieve it is not unusual to go by the North Channel, according to the wind—Captain Loose directed me to get tackles rove and coiled in the long-boat, so that if we wanted her, she would be the quicker put into the water—we had no logline when we sailed—I endeavoured to replace it by making one of spunyarn, but I found it quite insufficient for the purpose, it was too heavy—we had no proper logline during the voyage, while I remained on board—I found the larboard pump was choked the first time I endeavoured to sound it—a short time after we were at sea, I can<lb/>not say the exact time, I tried to clear it out, but was not able to do so—I told Captain Loose of it—he said nothing particular—the boy was in the cabin, and came on deck to me—the larboard pump was never made to sock—I believe there was a chronometer on board, but I never saw it, I was told of it—I made an application to the captain to be allowed to make use of the chronometer, which would have allowed me to know the longitude of the ship—he would not allow me to see it—we pursued our course to the West Indian seas—I had never been to santa Cruz before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know what was the proper course to be pursued in crossing the Atlantic, and going to Santa Cruz? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is generally one track laid down on charts as a guidance—Captain Loose followed the track part of the way—he deviated from that track about longitude 59 west, or thereabouts—he steered to the northward—we first made land in the West Indies at Virgin Gorda—I saw the land there—this is Virgin Gorda, (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out on the chart</hi>)—it is laid down here with a V. and Gorda only—I told the captain I had seen the land—he came on deck—he re<lb/>mained on deck about five minutes, and then went below again—he said nothing—shortly afterwards I observed breakers ahead, and low land—the breakers denoted a reef, and the low land was the main land of Anegada—we were probably about five miles from the breakers when I first discovered them ahead, or four or five miles, I cannot exactly say the distance—I went down and told the captain—I found him in bed—it was between six and seven o'clock in the morning (I had seen the land just at day-break) Benjamin Shultz was at the helm—I told the captain I could see breakers a-head, and low land—he jumped out of bed, and followed me on deck shortly after—I told Shultz to put the helm down, and let the ship come round to keep her off the breakers—the captain ran to the wheel, and hove the helm up again, that had the effect of keeping the ship direct on for the breaker a—he took the wheel himself, and remained at it a short time only—the crew complained—Thomas Hunter and Henry Simpson, two of the seamen, came into the waist, and said if the captain did not put her round, they would take charge, and put her round them<lb/>selves, they were not going to be lost through him—the captain on that</p>

               <p>left the wheel—Benjamin Shultz, the carpenter, again took the wheel—he put the helm down again, and the ship came round.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How near had you got to the breakers when Shultz put down the helm the second time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The ship just cleared the breakers, and nothing more—a few minutes, and she would have been on shore—after she was round, the captain mentioned to me, that he did not think she was so near—when he first came on deck, and took the wheel from Shultz, and told me to mind my own d—d business, and to take the studding-sails in—after the ship was brought round, he said he would have me tried for mutiny, for taking charge of the ship from him—this was on the 17th of October—we then proceeded on our voyage—on the 19th we were on the Silver Keys, (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out on the chart</hi>)—in some charts it is called "keys," and in others "bank"—it is to the north of the island of St. Domingo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Ought he to have gone to the south or north of St. Domingo to reach Santa Cruz? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider the south passage, between Antigua and Guadaloupe, is the way—I have crossed those seas—that would bring us to the south of St. Domingo, and make the island of Jamaica in passing—that is the usual way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a ship were to go to the north side of St. Domingo, ought she to have come on the Silver Keys? should she come so near the shore? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She ought to have been higher the shore to have avoided it—the Silver Keys is laid down on all the charts that I have ever seen of that part—the first thing that attracted my attention on the Silver Keys, on the 19th of October, was a rock on the larboard bow, about 300 fathoms off, more or less—I cannot swear to the exact distance—it was about half-past six o'clock in the morning, or between that and seven—I immediately men<lb/>tioned it to the captain—he was below—he came on deck—I pointed out the rock to him—it was easily to be discerned—the captain said he could not see it—I saw it with my naked eye—the captain had his telescope in his hand—the water ahead was discoloured, which indicates a shoal in those seas—soon after that one of the crew from the fore-yard called out "Rocks under her fore-foot"—the fore-foot is the bow of the vessel—I ran for<lb/>ward, and likewise the captain—I looked over the bow, and saw the rocks—the captain said, "Oh, we are lost! we are lost! we are all lost!"—im<lb/>mediately after the ship struck—she remained fast for the space of from fifteen to twenty minutes—we cleared away the boats—the captain ordered the jolly-boat to be hove overboard—we put her on deck, and got the tackle up ready to put the long-boat over to save ourselves—after about twenty minutes the vessel dragged off the rock, the sails being all set, and the breeze increasing—she had suffered no perceptible injury at that time—she was making no water—she went on a short distance, until she struck another rock—she remained fast on that only a few minutes—she dragged past that—the captain was in the cabin during this time—he was putting a life-preserver on part of the time—when she dragged off the second rock, our rudder was disabled—two pintles were injured, which caused the rudder to unship—we trimmed the sails, to keep her before the wind—I proposed to make a temporary rudder, and applied to the cap<lb/>tain, having no spare topmast on board, for the main boom, for some pieces of oar and the sprit-sail yard, to make a temporary rudder, which he refused, there being no spare spars on board—he said we were in a nice predicament; a ship at sea without a rudder; it would have been better if we had been all asleep a day or two previous, and let her go</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184103010063"/>
               <p>ashore at Anegada—Shultz made a temporary rudder from the stud<lb/>ding-sail booms, the long-boat's oars, and some spare pieces of plank—it was an assistance in steering her—on the 20th we made the harbour of Port-o-Plata, on the coast of St. Domingo—from the 20th to the 22nd, we proceeded close along the land—in my judgment it would have been better to have had a better offing—we were sometimes so near as to be almost among the breakers—it seemed to me there was danger of getting ashore there—the men had all their clothes ready packed up, if they should get ashore—on the afternoon of the 22nd of October we were close in with a reef that lies off the harbour of Cape Hayti—the jury-rudder unshipped, and we trimmed the sails, to keep her before the wind out to sea again—the captain gave those orders—he asked me what 1 thought was best to be done—I told him there was no danger to run into the harbour; the wind was fair for that—the captain told me to go forward and call David Davis, who was acting as second mate, and Benjamin Shultz the carpenter, to see what their opinion was—I did so—they came on the quarter-deck, and said the harbour was before us, and they thought we might get in—the captain said he would not, he had no pilot on board, and if any thing happened to the vessel, he should lose the insurance—I told him the only plan then was to keep her out to sea that night, we could replace the jury-rudder very soon, to get in in the morning, and get a pilot, by the time the sea-breeze set in—the captain went to bed about eight—about nine I saw a sail on our larboard quarter, I mentioned it to the captain—he came upon deck—I said she looked like a large ship, probably a man-of-war, and could give us assistance, if we were to run down to her—we could easily have done so, we could have gone down before the wind to her—we did not do so, the captain would not allow us—he said he wanted nothing with her—he went to bed again, and told me to call him at twelve—at day-break we were at the south-east of the entrance of Cape Hayti—when the day dawned, I saw a ship a little to the northward of the entrance of the port—we were steering towards the reef—I could see the breakers ahead, probably two miles off—the captain came on deck about seven—at that time we were steering towards the reef—she was steering the course that he ordered when he left the deck previous—I cannot say what time it was that he gave those orders, for I was in bed—he gave the orders to the second mate—when he was on deck, about seven, we were steering towards the reef—no signal was made from the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>—the ship we saw to the northward fired a gun and hoisted an ensign—I afterwards learnt she was the <hi rend="italic">Bencoolen</hi>, commanded by Captain Tate—I understood the meaning of the firing of that gun, it was to warn us we were running into danger—she had likewise the Union-jack flying at the fore, as a signal for a pilot—we were not allowed to hoist one—I pro<lb/>posed to hoist one—the captain said, if they were too lazy to come off without a signal, let them stop where they were—we kept on the same course till a pilot came on board—it was almost a calm—she was going very little through the water—I went below, and told the captain the ship to northward had fired a gun and hoisted a signal—he said that was nothing to him—he said nothing more, and I left the cabin—the pilot came on board about eleven in the forenoon—the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi> had not altered her course up to that time—the captain called the pilot aft, and showed him our jury-rudder, and asked if he would take charge of the vessel—he said he would; if the crew would work the ship in he would take her in—we</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From day-break until eleven o'clock she had only gone about a mile towards the reef? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She went a very little—we had very little wind—the pilot said he would take her into the port provided the crew would obey his orders—he said so on account of the unmanageable state of the vessel and the rudder—I think the vessel was cast away on purpose—I have said she was lost accidentally—I have sworn that she was lost ac<lb/>cidentally (<hi rend="italic">The protest was here read, by which Captain Loose declared the ship to have been lost through accidental circumstance; the truth of which statement was attested on oath by Shultz and others.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I am acquainted with the navigation of the Atlantic, and have been in the West Indian seas—if a ship sails from England to Santa Cruz, there is no occasion why she should not go on the north side of St. Domingo, bat it is customary to go on the south on that voyage; if a ship went on the north, the course marked in blue lines on the chart is not the proper course to pursue—it is wrong, being so far from the land—she should not have gone on the Silver-bank—that is well known to navigators, and is laid down on all the charts, to the best of my know<lb/>ledge—when she left the Silver-bank, and got in with St. Domingo, it was not proper to keep creeping along the shore—I should say it was danger<lb/>ous—in going to Hayti, I should keep further out to sea, to get the trade-winds—she ought to have gone by these red lines—I know of no fair pur<lb/>pose of bringing her so close to St. Domingo—if the ship came by the north side of St. Domingo to Cape Cruz, the red-line marks on the chart is the course I should take as the proper one—there would be no difficulty in getting there by that course—the blue-line marks, close in shore, would not be the proper course—there are a great many reefs off Cape Cruz, which are well known to navigators, and laid down in the charts—I know the reefs the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi> got on, on the 10th or 11th of November, from the chart—it is distinctly laid down in the charts—by keeping on this red line the reefs might be easily avoided—I think I never saw this reef, but there are generally breakers, which give notice of a reef—Maxwell was about nine months on board my ship.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JARVIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Michael carry on business in Cooper's-row? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge—his father and family lived there—I cannot say whether he did—I lived nearly seven years with Seldon and Johnson—they carry on a highly respectable business—I de<lb/>cline saying why I left them—I left in July or August, and did nothing for the remainder of that year—I lived with my father, in Bishopsgate-street—in the beginning of 1838 I was employed by the Metropolitan Gas Com<lb/>pany for three or four months—I then obtained another situation, thinking I should not obtain the security the Company required, and between the two stools I fell to the ground—the situation was with Mr. Harvey, of Hatton-garden—I was there a day or two—the clerk, who was leaving, remained, and I was not wanted—the Company had then another person, and I did nothing for three or four months—I then commenced business in Lower Thames-street, as a Custom-house agent—I remained there four or five months, and then dissolved with my partner, Mr. Stanley, because we could not make sufficient out of it—he continued the business there, and I went to Seething-lane, as a ship-broker and Custom-house agent—I re<lb/>mained there nine months—I gave up business there then, because I obtained a situation at John Nichol and Co.'s, George-yard, Lombard-street, and there I remained till I was taken into custody on this charge—I was kept in custody five weeks—I do not know whether it was at the last examination, or the last but one, that I was examined as a witness—I was not examined by the solicitors before I was examined at the Mansion-house—I had no communication with the solicitors, nor any body, but my own adviser, Mr. Hobler—I stated to Mr. Hobler what I knew or could prove—the balance of the account I paid Patrick was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the last insurance—that was deducting 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is not the usual rate—the usual rate did not amount to 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me the money for the premium be<lb/>sides, at the time the insurance was effected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it usual to have the trouble you had, as his agent, to effect the insurances and obtain the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very unusual—I had immense trouble—an immense number of difficulties occurred, to which I have not been examined—I received the 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in consideration of the additional trouble I had, but the greater part was due to me for other matters—the Magistrate expressed his regret that I should have been placed at the bar—I did not leave Seldon and Johnson for any dishonest act, or any thing affecting my moral character at all—it was a matter pe<lb/>culiarly my own—it was respecting a female.</p>

               <p>— <hi rend="smallCaps">FROST</hi>. I know the handwriting of Captain Loose—I be<lb/>lieve these four bills of lading to be his writing—I cannot swear to this one, but these I can swear to be his handwriting—I know Michael and Patrick Wallace, and also Captain Loose—Loose has been in the pri<lb/>soner's employ three years or three years and a half—I knew him when he was mate to the prisoner on board the <hi rend="italic">Delta</hi>—the prisoner commanded the <hi rend="italic">Delta</hi>, to my knowledge, about three or four years back, how long before I do not know—I was not at all ac<lb/>quainted with any of the transactions of the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>, as between Michael and Patrick—the prisoner acted as the agent of the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>—he was the agent in London, but occaisonally his brother Patrick paid the accounts, when he was not in the way—I transacted business with them, in refer<lb/>ence</p>

               <p>to the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>—as far as I was concerned, Patrick acted as agent to the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi> when Michael was at Liverpool.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When his brother was in town, Patrick paid ac<lb/>counts to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on two or three occasions for his brother, for goods supplied to ships—Michael was ship's husband, as far as I know—Loose is dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you heard of his death by any other means than what people have told you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, by receiving his effects, and the amount of money I have named—his 
death was testified by the whole ship's company of the <hi rend="italic">Premier</hi>—I saw the ship's company—I did not re<lb/>ceive any thing by way of effects, except as money for the salvage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who gave you the effects? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Captain Cuddy, of the <hi rend="italic">Premier</hi>—called on me in July last—she is an English vessel, belong<lb/>ing to Belfast—he gave me the whole of his clothing, a bill of exchange for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and cash amounting to 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of the fact of his 
death you know nothing of your own knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not there of course—when Captain Cuddy was in London, nothing respecting the loss of the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi> had been brought forward—I have not seen him since it has been discovered—it was on the 20th of July I received the papers from him, and on the 22nd of July I delivered the papers to Patrick Wallace, by my own dictation—I was not an acquaintance of the Wallaces—I called at the office to see the prisoner, but he was not there, and I left the papers in Patrick's hands, to give to Michael—that was at their office in Crosby-hall—to the best of my know<lb/>edge they were both carrying on business there—it was the first time I was ever there—I knew them in Cooper's-row—that is the office where Michael did his business, but it was Patrick's office—the agency of the ship was carried on there—Patrick acted as Michael's agent, during three or four voyages of the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Delta</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Lucy.</hi>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184103010077"/>
               <p>at sea—she was the first ship I was ever in that had them rove—when we got out of the channel, we unrove the tackles, as we wanted the rope for other purposes—the channel is not very crowded coming out of Liverpool—there are a great many ships going backwards and forwards—we had some heavy weather on the way from Liverpool to Carlingford—that is in the channel—it carried away our fore and topsail-sheet in one night—we had our tackles rove then—the log-line is merely to ascertain the rate at which we are sailing, the distance per hour—I never went a voyage before with a pump choked—we had three pumps on board, two which ought to have been to keep the ship free from water, and one to keep the deck clean—it was the larboard pump that was choked—I wanted to lift it—. we could have done that without removing the cargo—I was led to be<lb/>lieve there was a chronometer on board, but I never saw it—I kept the longitude by dead-reckoning—vessels of that sort do not frequently go by dead-reckoning, probably some do it, but not at the present day—there have been cases of it—the wind was not very fresh at Virgin<lb/>gorda—we were going about four or four knots and a half, at a rough guess, within half a mile—we had our studding-sails set—it is not at all difficult to bring round a vessel with the studding-sails set—I consider it helped the ship round—it is very seldom done—when time is allowed, and there is no danger, it is the practice to take down the studding-sails before you go about—the captain d—d me for not taking them down be<lb/>fore putting her about—I think we deviated from our proper course about longitude 59 west, latitude 17 1/2 or thereabouts—I made that out by dead-reckoning—I made it with sufficient accuracy to swear to it—we had not got the tackles rove when we struck on the Silver-keys—we rove them after we struck—it took us ten or fifteen minutes to do it—when the <hi rend="italic">Ben<lb/>coolen</hi> fired the gun off Cape Hayti, I went down into the cabin and told the captain the ship to northward bad fired a gun, and hoisted her ensign, and I thought we were getting too near the reef—he said, "That is nothing to me"—I am sure I told him we were getting too near the reefs or that we were standing too close in, or something to that purpose—I cannot exactly mention the very words—I did not mention that before, because I was not asked that particular, or else I should have given a correct answer I did not swear that what I told the Attorney-General was the whole that passed, but I was not asked any thing else that transpired—I was not asked about it yesterday—that is the only explanation I can give—I re<lb/>turned to Liverpool on the 22nd or 23rd of July, and have remained there ever since—I have not been to sea since—I have been shipping seamen for the merchant service on my own account—I first came to London on this business on the 1st of December—the Lord Mayor of London sent for me.</p>

I live in Brown's-lanc, in the parish of Christ Church—I occupy the shop and parlour only, which communicate with each other—I do not rent the whole house—there are several lodgers—my father is the landlord—he does not live in the house. On the 10th of February, at eight o'clock in the evening, I was at home, and heard a noise outside—I went out, and found the policeman, Trew, with the prisoner Duff in custody—I saw two or three other policeman with the other prisoners, but not sufficient to notice them—Trew had one boot in his hand—I had seen that in the afternoon in my shop window, in the second pane from the crack—my attention was drawn to the window, and I found a piece of glass out sufficient for a hand to be put through—it had been cracked for a month or six weeks before, but there was no hole in it before that evening—when I saw the boots in the window that afternoon there was no aperture in the glass—the piece of glass was puttied all round to keep it in—the boot was not above three or four inches from the broken pane—it was tied to the fellow one with a string, which was cut or broken—I did not see the fellow boot till I got to the station—when I came from the station I found both the boots were gone.</p>

I went to No. 8, Edwards'-place, on Sunday, the 21st of February, about half-past twelve o'clock at night—I found Mrs. Creed in bed, bleeding profusely from the wound in her forehead—I went up to the prisoner's room, and knocked at the door—she said, "Is that Mrs. Creed?"—I said, "No, it is a policeman"—she let me in, and I asked her why she cut Mrs. Creed in the head so—she said Mr. and Mrs. Creed had come up and broken her door open, and then she did it in self-defence—I examined the door—there was not the least appearance of violence having been used—I asked the prisoner what she struck her with—she said, with a chopper—I found the chopper on the landing, about two feet from the prisoner's door—I asked her, was that the chopper she struck her with—she said yes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Western General Dispensary. I went before daylight on, Sunday morning, the 21st of February, to Edwards'-place, to see Mrs. Creed—I got there about two, o'clock—she was in bed, with a wound on the right eyebrow and the right side of the nose—it was a clear cut wound—I found a contused wound on the upper part of the scalp—she was not in danger at any time—the incised wound was about two inches long, and penetrated to the bone on the brow, about a quarter of an inch deep—I think one part of the chopper now produced would have inflicted the cut—the bruise was about half an inch long—there was nothing particular about that—it was a blow from a blunt instrument, not given with particular violence—I should not think the bone was at all injured—there was blood about it, but not being serious, I dressed the wound, and she went on perfectly well—she did not appear in the least intoxicated—she answered quite rationally—I did not suspect that she had been intoxicated—she did not smell of liquor—I saw no danger at all likely to arise.</p>

I conduct the business of my brother, Elias Chartier, in High-street, Islington—it is carried on in the house of Philip William Hingston, who lives there with his family, and the shop is part of his dwelling-house. On the 9th of February, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for some thread lace—I got down a box containing a quantity of thread lace—she looked at various articles, and she kept putting the cards of lace up and down—she fixed on a remnant, and asked me to measure it—while I was doing that a wo-man came in, and asked the price of a bonnet in the window—that drew my attention from the lace a moment or two, while I answered the woman the price of the bonnet—I was waiting on Mrs. Whittingbam before the prisoner came in—I left off serving her to attend to the prisoner—Mrs. Whittingham gave me a particular look which I did not understand at first—about that time I turned round, as I thought there must be something wrong—I asked the person, did she wish to see the bonnet—before I could get an answer she was gone—I then looked at the box of lace, and in<lb/>stantly</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Paradise-terrace, Islington. About two o'clock on Tuesday, the 9th of February, I went to Mr. Char<lb/>tier's shop in Islington—soon after, the prisoner came in—I had seen her before that day—I observed her when she came in—she asked for some lace, and Miss Chartier put it down before her—she seemed to pull it about a good deal—after this another woman came in, and asked the price of a bonnet—she stood behind me at first, and then she stood near the pri<lb/>soner—I saw the prisoner give her the lace, and then she put it under her cloak—I intimated it to Miss Chartier as well as I could by a nod and a look—I turned to look for the woman, and she was gone—I immediately went to the door, and could not see any thing of her—I went both ways, and could not see any thing of her—I then returned to the shop, and Miss Chartier told me she had missed some lace—I said, "So I should think—I saw the prisoner give it to the other young woman"—I said to the pri<lb/>soner, "You know the young woman"—she said she did not, she never saw her before—the reason I said so was, because I had seen her with her before they went into the shop, and the other appeared then to be in<lb/>toxicated—I am quite sure the woman I saw then with the prisoner was the same person I saw in the shop—after this the prisoner said she had lost her purse, and she would have the house searched from top to bottom before she left.</p>

About the 8th of February the policeman called on me, with two bags and some horse-hair—one of the bags was mine, and the hair was, as far as I can judge; it resembled what I had, and which I had seen safe three or four days before—the weight of what was found corresponded with what I had, within a quarter of a pound.</p>

On Wednesday, the 10th, in consequence of information, I searched for the skin of a sheep—I found one in a ditch, in the adjoining field to Mr. Jordan's flock—I showed that skin to Mr. Jordan, and he identified it as one of his—I then went to the prisoner's house, and found in his bed this hatchet tinged with blood—it had been wiped, but not clean—it appeared to me to be fresh blood—I afterwards found the carcase and head of a sheep, in an empty cot<lb/>tage next to the prisoner's—the doors of the two houses are within five feet of each other—the back door of the house was open—the carcase was cut into four quarters, and the head separated—I saw the skin of the sheep</p>

               <p>compared with the head—it fitted altogether, bones and all—I after<lb/>wards took the prisoner into custody—I compared his shoes with some footmarks—they are very particular shoes—one has half a tip, and they are of different sizes—one is half an inch longer than the other—the shoes tallied with the impressions in all respects—I traced the marks from the cottage where the carcase was found, to the place where the sheep was slaughtered, and again from there down the side of a hedge, and through a gap where some of the bloody wool was lodged—it appeared to hate been thrown over another hedge, for some of the wool was on the hedge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a slop-seller in High-street, Shadwell. On Monday evening, the 15th of February, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner came and asked if I would cash her husband's advance note, which she produced—I asked where her husband was—she said, "He is at home"—I said, "Why did not you bring him with you?" she said, "He has been working very hard all night, and is going off very early in the morning; I want some clothing for him"—she said her name was Ellen Smith—when she produced the note, she said, "My husband has put his name on the back of it; I want two of the best blue twilled shirts, two pairs of drawers, a Scotch cap, and a pocket-handkerchief—I looked at the note, and from what I saw on it, I said, "Going in the <hi rend="italic">Bullfinch</hi> to St. Petersburgh?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "It is very early for St. Petersburgh this time of the year"—she said, "Yes, but the ship is going to discharge part of her cargo at Elsinore, and lay there till it is weather to go to St. Petersburgh"—I gave her the articles, which were worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money—when she had got the money, she said, "A friend of mine is going away on Friday or Saturday, will you cash his note?" and that is the way I detected this forgery, as she afterwards brought me another note—on the Thursday morning I went to Leaden-hall-street where this note is made payable—I did not present it for pay<lb/>ment, but went to ascertain whether it was a genuine note—I could find no No. 41, Leadenhall street—I found 38—it is made payable at Frazier's, 41, Leadenhall-street—I found 42—I found the firm Frazier and Co., at No. 30,—I presented the note to know whether it was correct—I did not ask for the money—there is nobody here from Frazier's—I went to Threadneedle-street, to Sclden and Johnson's office, and presented the note there—the <hi rend="italic">Bullfinch</hi> was lying in the dock at that time, under repair—there was no crew on board her—I saw Mr. Gunter, the owner there—I have known him some time—I do not know the prisoner's writing.</p>

I apprehended the pri<lb/>soner on Thursday—I told her I apprehended her on suspicion of passing a bad note to Mr. Jewell—she said, "If it is bad, it is more than I am aware of—I asked where she got it—she said it was given her by her husband—I asked where he was—she said she supposed he had sailed in the <hi rend="italic">Bullfinch</hi> from the London Docks a day or two ago—I said I was not aware she had a husband—she said, "No, not my husband, but the man I have lived with for the last seven years"—I have been to the Lon<lb/>don Docks, and made inquiry there of the foreman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Hutchinson, of Pitfield-street, Hoxton; the prisoner keeps a coffee-shop in the neighbourhood. Between ten and eleven o'clock on the 9th of February, he came and or<lb/>dered a pound of butter to be done into four pats—several customers came in, and he said, "You need not wait, but go on serving your customers"—having had notice what had taken place the morning before, I went to the desk at the end of the counter, and had my eye on the prisoner—I saw him take a piece of bacon out of the flat which was standing under the desk, and put it into his apron-pocket—he then went from the flat to the end of the shop—I immediately called my master—I walked up, took hold of his arm, and said, "Clark, you are a d—thief, pull that bacon out of your pocket"—he did so, and handed it over to my master—we let him go home—a policeman came—my master then told me to go and give him in charge—I did so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. John Warburg, a cigar-manufacturer in Mansell-street—the prisoner was in his employ as a stripper, and a porter. On the 10th of February I came out of the front shop to go into the manufactory—at the end of that there is a coach-house—I saw a figure there—I knew no one had any business there at that time, which was about twelve o'clock in the day—I went up to see who it was, and found the prisoner—I asked what he wanted—he said,</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop in Hoxton-square. The prisoner and three other persons came to my shop on the 26th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon—they called for a pot of sixpenny ale, and hesitated who should pay for it—one of them said, "Take hold and drink"—"No," says I, "I am not paid for it"—one of them then threw down a half-crown—I gave them two shillings, and put the half-crown behind the engine, in the bar—I then went into the parlour, and was there nearly a minute—I then heard a bit of a scuffle, and saw the prisoner on the counter, reaching after the half-crown—he got it, and got down, and ran off—I pursued him to the corner of Pitfield-street—he went into a cheese-monger's shop, and called for half a quartern of cheese, and tendered the half-crown—I went in, and said, "This is my half-crown," and I took it up—this is the half-crown—I noticed it because it was so smooth, and I was afraid it was a bad one.</p>

On the 9th of February I was called to the Red Lion—I got there about half-past eight o'clock, and found the place all in confusion, as if from a quarrel—Thomas Day came to me first, and said he was stabbed—I asked where, and saw a wound in the lower part of his belly, and something protruded from it—his trowsers were open, but not down—he pointed out the prisoner as the person who had stabbed him—she was standing in the parlour, or near the threshold, divid<lb/>ing the parlour from the bar, but more in the parlour—she had a shell in her band at the time—I went in, and asked her, had she stabbed the prosecutor—she said no, "I have struck at him with the shell"—I took it from her, and brought her away in about an hour—I found no knife—a surgeon was fetched—while the doctor was doing something to the wound, the prisoner was looking on—she sat down on a form, and said, Could it not be settled by money, she would rather give any sum than be taken into custody—I have the prosecutor's trowsers here—there is a cut in the right-hand side, by the belly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Sydney-place, Com<lb/>mercial. The prisoner was in my service as salesman, for about six or seven months—I had told him, two months before I charged him with this, that I did not require his services, and he might look out for another situation—he had several times been out for that purpose—in consequence of information on Tuesday evening, I sent one of my boys to Ray's coffee-shop, and he brought hack the coat and waistcoat now produced—this coat is mine, and had been in my shop for sale—the selling price would be about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it cost me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after I had got the coat back, the prisoner came to me, and said he had come to explain about a coat which I had sent up to his lodging for—I said nothing to him, but gave him into custody im<lb/>mediately, as the officer was there, and my shop was crowded with people, I was obliged to send him away—I had never sold him the coat, nor had he ever asked me to sell it him—to the best of my belief it has never been sold out of my shop—I have never received the money for it—if the pri<lb/>soner received money, it was his duty to give it to me or to my foreman—he had no authority to put it into the till—he said before the Magistrate, if I produced my sale-book and a satin waistcoat, he could show he had paid for the coat; and he pointed to an entry in the book—I have it here—here is entered, "Coat, cost 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., sold for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that does not refer to the coat produced—I do not myself know what coat it refers to.</p>

On the 26th of February, be<lb/>tween seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I missed the articles stated—I was about my work, and left the street door for about two minutes—the clock was taken from the mantel-piece in the back parlour, and the card-counters from the front parlour—I cannot say how many were gone, but there was a good many.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopwoman to Mary Ann Besant and another, in Oddey's-row, Islington. On the 27th of February, between twelve and one o'clock, Donovan came and asked to look at some buttons—I showed him the drawer—he looked and said they were not cheap enough for him, and asked to look at some needles, which he did—he said they would not do, they were too expensive for him—he then went out—I did not miss any needles till the policeman came, which was in about five minutes—we then saw that some were gone—these ten papers of needles I believe are my mistress's—I am sure they had been safe when Donovan was in the shop, and no one else came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Robert Udall, of Edmonton. On the 2nd of February, the prisoner came to his shop between one and two o'clock, and asked for some things, but did not buy any—he went away—I recollect showing him a drawer which had some silk handkerchiefs in it, and there was a box of lace on the counter—the next day he was brought past the shop handcuffed—I inquired what he had been doing—I then looked and missed five handkerchiefs and some lace—this now pro<lb/>duced is one of the handkerchiefs—I am sure it is my master's, and it had not been sold—I had sold one of them the day previous—this lace we can swear we had the same day, and the same pattern—the quantity I do not know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am steward to Mr. Charles Thomas Holcombe, he lives at Barking, the prisoner was his carter. On the 12th of February he was to go for a load of manure with an empty cart—I had frequently missed oats from the granary—on the night of the 11th of February, I smoothed the oats over, and in the morning I found the print of two holes in the oats, and about five bushels gone—Salmon, the other carter, came to me with two handfuls of oats—I compared them with those in the gra<lb/>nary, and they exactly corresponded—I believe them to have been part of the same—I afterwards saw the marks of some, feet without shoes, as if they had had worsted stockings on, walking up to a wall, and there was an im<lb/>pression, as if a sack had been dropped, with something heavy in it, over a nine-feet wall—the prisoner had no right to go into that granary—it had been locked, and the person who entered must have got in at a window, after getting over the wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carter in the employ of Mr. Holcombe. On the morning of the 12th of February I saw two sacks in the cart—one of them was three parts full, and the other about half full—it was Mr. Hol<lb/>combe's cart, and the prisoner was the driver—I examined the sacks, and found there were oats in them—I took some black oats out of one sack, and some white ones out of the other, and took them to Mr. Black—I saw the prisoner drive the cart away—I do not know whether the sacks were in it then—I did not look into the cart any more.</p>

Q.</hi> What time did you go to the stable that morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten minutes past five o'clock—the prisoner was then inside, just opening the great gates into the yard—he went away with the cart about a quarter past six, which was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I had seen the sacks in it—I was in the stable with him all the morn<lb/>ing—I did not say any thing to him about the sacks, as I did not know but that Mr. Black might have ordered them—the cart was about a dozen yards from the stable door—when I took the oats out of the sacks, the prisoner had gone with his horses to the pond to water—I took them to Mr. Black after the prisoner left—I could not take them before, as Mr. Black was not moving—I could have awoke him—his house stands in the garden; but I thought he would soon be out, and I did not like to disturb him—I did not examine the sacks in which the oats were—I never had any quarrel with the prisoner—we might have had a few words in contradic<lb/>tion—I swear I have not had words with him in anger half a dozen times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police inspector. I was on duty at Ilford station about half past seven o'clock in the morning on the 12th of February, and received information from Mr. Black—I went up the road, and saw a cart driven by the prisoner—I passed it at Stratford, and got a small distance in front of it—I desired the sergeant to keep in the rear of it—I proceeded to the Bell-and-Mackerel public-house—I saw the cart driven to the door—a man came to the prisoner, and he stopped about a quarter of an hour—the prisoner then drove on, accompanied by the other man, who had fed the horses, into Ducket's field, which is out of the main road—I then saw the man who had fed the horses get into the cart—I saw him take two empty sacks out, and place them on the hind ladder—the sacks were the wrong side outwards, and had oats hanging to them—I then desired the officer to take the prisoner, and to take care of the sacks—the sacks were the prosecutor's—the oats have never been found—the prisoner had got three miles and a half from his master's before I overtook him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am widow of General Sir Joseph McLean; I at present live in Wood-street, Woolwich. On the 24th of December I resided at Woolwich Common—my house was destroyed by fire that night, and the furniture that was saved was moved to a stable in the Royal Artillery barracks at Woolwich—about a fortnight after the fire I saw a star of the Hanoverian order of Knighthood at the Commandant's house—it was in a chest of my drawers—I had possession of the keys of the drawers—some of the furniture was afterwards removed from the stable to Wood-street—the military assisted in moving it—after it had been so removed I examined the drawer in which the star had previously been, and it was missing—there were marks of the lock being broken open, picked, as if the drawer had been forced—I also missed a gold ring which was cracked, and a purse with some gold and silver in it—I afterwards saw some pieces of silver at the Commandant's house at Woolwich, which decidedly belonged to the Hanoverian Order, but there was not the whole of it—it was mutilated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Salamanca-street, Vanx-hall-walk, in the parish of Lambeth. I rent the house—on Sunday even<lb/>ing, the 28th of February, I went to church, about half-past six o'clock, leaving the house quite safe—the windows were all fastened, I am confi<lb/>dent, and the doors all shut and fast—I left them all on the lock and bolted—the back-door was bolted, and the street-door on the spring lock—I was fetched from church about eight o'clock, and found every thing turned out; I found my son at home—I had left him in the house when I went out—the articles stated in the indictment were gone—my son's watch was hanging up when I went out—the coat and waistcoat belonged to ray hus<lb/>band—the table-cloth and stockings, to me—I found a drawer turned out, there were two coats and other clothes brought down stairs and laid in the passage—I found the parlour "window open—I had left it fastened, and put the shutters to, but did not fasten, them—I can swear to all the articles found, the waistcoat, stockings, and table-cloth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the certificate in your hand on the second occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I opened it, and produced it to her, and I said, "Who is Richard Bell and Frances Bell," and she said, "The man and woman belonging to the church"—this passed in the King's Head public-house, where she pro<lb/>mised to meet me—Mr. Clothier, the father, gave me instructions to appre<lb/>hend her—he did not tell me they could not prove the marriage—the prisoner told me that Clothier knew she was a married woman—I said, "Did Mr. Clothier know you was married?"—she said, "Yes; because I represented myself as a widow."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to mention what you did to the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After he entered into the case, he said there was not evidence, and then the solicitor for the prosecution asked me whether I had heard her say any thing—that was at one of the examinations—I think it might be the second, be did not enter into it the previous night—there was no solicitor the first evening—the first examination was the second time of going before the Magistrate—we went three tunes after that examination—I gave this evidence about the conversation more than once—after the first examination the Magistrate said there was not evidence enough—I had then given this evidence to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell me it was after the first examination that you said this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had been examined on the first examination—the soli<lb/>citor had spoken to me both before and after the examination—I had not given my evidence to the Magistrate at that time, I bad not said a word—I went forward, and gave my evidence about apprehending her—I cannot take my oath to all the words that passed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say a word about the conversation till after you were spoken to by the solicitor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The solicitor had had conversation with me before I had been with the Magistrate at all—that was on the first examin<lb/>ation, the second time of going before the Magistrate—when I went first, I gave an account of apprehending the prisoner—I do not know that I was asked about any conversation—I stated that I got the certificate from her, and she said that was what she got from Mr. Clothier—I did not state that till after the solicitor had the conversation with me.</p>
               <p>

I am constable of the parish of Wimbledon—I have a house and mill on Wimbledon-common—I was at home about five o'clock in the afternoon of Saturday, the 12th of September last—I saw a four-wheel gentleman's private carriage, drawn by two horses, just against Mr. Currie's, nearly a quarter of a mile from my place—it was on the road which turns off the high road, leading to the mill, about 100 yards from the high road which leads from Wandsworth to Wimbledon—I saw two gentlemen coming from it, making their way further on the com<lb/>mon—they divided, one went into Wandsworth parish, and one remained in Wimbledon—about the same time I saw another carriage on the high road—the two carriages were about a quarter of a mile apart—I saw two gentlemen come from that carriage, and divide, one meeting the other in Wandsworth parish, and one going into Putney parish—I then suspected it was a duel, and called my wife upon the stage of the mill to watch—I attended to the mill for a few minutes—as soon as my wife called to me, and said she thought it was a duel, I went into the house and got my staff, with intent to go to the ground—I went towards the ground where the gentlemen were then assembled, and in the act of firing—there were four gentlemen there, two were firing—there were two shots fired just as I got to my gate, which is 220 yards from the ground—I heard the noise—I then advanced towards the spot—I got within about fifteen yards of the spot when the second shots were fired—two of the gentlemen were standing side face to each other, about twelve yards apart, and two were to the right of them—I heard two reports—I thought the gentleman nearest me was wounded, because he put his hand to his head, and stood limping, for that reason I went to the furthermost—I afterwards under<lb/>stood the wounded man to be Captain Tuckett—the other one that was standing with his face sideways was Lord Cardigan—I do not see any of those who were on the right, to be positive.—(<hi rend="italic">At the request of Captain Douglas, three gentlemen were allowed to sit with him is the bar</hi>)—I went up to Lord Cardigan—I know nothing more of my own knowledge as to the gentleman being hit—I did not see any</p>

I was so in Sep<lb/>tember last—a little before six o'clock in the evening of the 12th of Septem<lb/>ber last two cases of duelling-pistols were given me by Dann the miller—I have still the custody of them—they are here—I know Lord Cardigan—he came into the station before the pistols were delivered—I know nothing of the duel—Captain Douglas was with Lord Cardigan—he gave his name, "John Douglas, Captain of the 11th Hussars," by word of mouth—that was on Saturday evening, before there was any inquiries before the Justices—they did not go before the Justices till Monday morning—I took down the charge from Dann, who gave charge of them—it was taken in writing—I have not got it here—I was not ordered to bring it—I had it at the House of Lords—I took down Captain Douglas's address, "At Lord Cardigan's, No. 26, Portman-square"—I took down what Captain Douglas said in writing, in the original sheet, which is always sent in to Whitehall—I took down the name of Captain Douglas in writing, as well as the charge pre<lb/>ferred by Dann against Lord Cardigan and Captain Douglas—I know the person of Captain Douglas—he is the second gentleman sitting, from here, in the bar—Lord Cardigan and he were together in the station till they were bailed, which was almost immediately after—when Lord Cardigan came in, he said he was a prisoner, he believed—I said, "What for?"—his lordship put his hand into his pocket to give me a card, and he dropped some—I took them up—he gave me one—he said he was a prisoner, he believed—I said, "What for?"—he said, he had been fighting a duel, he believed, and as Captain Douglas came up the steps, he pointed his fingers over his shoulder, and said, "So is this gentleman also, my second, Captain Douglas"—a' part of the conversation took place before Captain Dougras came up; and Lord Car<lb/>digan said he was a prisoner, he believed—Captain Douglas could hear that—he was close euough to have heard it—I do not remember that he</p>
