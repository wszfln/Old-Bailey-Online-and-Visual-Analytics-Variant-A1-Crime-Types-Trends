I asked him who it belonged to, as I did not think it was his own, he seemed staggered at the question; then he said it was the maid servant's in the house where he lived, and that she had sent it to pawn.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you where he lived? - Yes. I asked if I should send to the house; he said he did not choose it. I took him to his mistress's door; he then said his mistress came late from the masquerade, and lost it, and he found it in the kennel all over mud. I then suspected the maid was concerned, and took him back to my own house, and sent for a constable, and took him before the justice, and he then said he found it in the kennel. I applied to his mistress that evening, and she said she had lost it, but did not know by whom it was stolen.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found the slider; I thought it was my own property as I found it, and I went to a pawnbroker's with it.</p>

I heard my master cry, Stop thief! and ran down the buildings. I went out of the shop and round the buildings to meet him; I met the prisoner; he appeared much out of breath; I stopped him; he said, What do you stop me for? He had not got any thing. My master came up at this time with the pieces in his hand, and said, the prisoner had dropped them.</p>

               <p>On Thursday the 28th of last month the prisoner came in to a sale of goods which I had the care of; he asked for a catalogue; he went down into the kitchen; I watched him out; I went up into the shop and found him there, I was surprised at that as I thought I had seen him out; he asked me what time Mr. Phipps began the sale; he turned from me to go out, and I saw the impression of the plates under his coat; I followed him out and secured him. I said, you have robbed me; he produced the plates, and said, I acknowledge it, I stand convicted.</p>

On the 21st of January last I bought two dozen of stockings of Mr. Waller, in the Strand, they were carried by Mr. Waller's servant to my house in Wigmore-street. Having business in the city, I went forward, and these stockings were stolen before I got home.</p>
               <p>Did you make such remarks on them as to know them again? - I know them again very well, I took particular notice of the make and the size. When I came home my servant informed me she had received them into the shop; I saw no more of them till the next day, when I was sent for to Justice Welch's office; they found me out by means of the name of the person I bought them of being written on the wrapper in which they were. I went to the office and saw the stockings, and knew them again. They sent first to Mr. Waller, and one of his apprentices came up to the office and informed them that he had carried them to my house the night before. I bought 24 pair, there were but 22 pair at the office; there had been a pair taken out of each parcel; Justice Cox sealed them up with the office seal, and delivered them to the person who took the prisoners.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol in the parish of Bloomsbury. I have 22 pair of stockings; they were sealed up at the office. There had been a burglary committed in the house of Mr. Butcher, in Bloomsbury, I had a suspicion of the prisoner, Dempsey; I went to search his lodging, in the house of a Mr. James, in Dyot-street, between twelve and one in the night; I found all the prisoners in bed, and found the two parcels of stockings in a box under the bed they were in; they said they knew not how the stockings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170006"/> came there; that they were none of their's. When I took them to the magistrate, we found there was a direction on one of the wrappers to the person where the gentleman bought these stockings; the magistrate sent according to the direction, and a gentleman came and said they had been sold to the prosecutor the day before. I went to Mr. Sudlow's, and asked him if he had lost any stockings; he said he had lost two dozen. When he came to the office and saw the stockings, he said, they were the stockings he had bought the day before.</p>
               <p>When you came into this room on another business, on a burglary having been committed in Bloomsbury, and found the prisoners all in bed, did you tell them what you came about? - No; I told Mr. James I wanted to see Dempsey, and Dempsey opened the door.</p>
               <p>Did they appear to be under any apprehensions, or uneasy at your coming? - Yes, they did, I told them they must get up and go along with me.</p>
               <p>Dempsey. After he came in I went out to make water, and came in again; if I had known myself guilty I would not have come in again?</p>
               <p>Atwood. He only went into the shop to make water; the room is on the ground floor. I saw these things under the bed, and followed him and secured him. The shop door was shut, he could not get away; the others were in bed. I ordered them to get up and took them to the watch-house. On the bed I found this black mask (producing it.)</p>
               <p>(The stockings were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I live at Mr. Sudlow's, who is a hosier and hatter; I serve in the shop when he is out.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any stockings being brought to the shop while he was out? - Yes; on Thursday the 21st of January, between four and five in the afternoon, two dozen of stockings were brought; I put them at the end of the compter; about half an hour after that they were stolen.</p>
               <p>Was you in the shop? - No; I was in the parlour. I had just lit candles in the shop, and went into the parlour, and set a candle on the bureau; I saw the shop door open and a young man came in.</p>
               <p>Was there only one? - Only one.</p>
               <p>What size was the young man that came in? - He was quite a youth; he held up his head as he came in at the door. Woolley was the person; he took the stockings.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen either of the prisoners before this time? - Never.</p>
               <p>You did not know any thing of them? - No.</p>
               <p>How long might this matter be transacting between his opening the door and taking the stockings? - He was not a minute taking the stockings.</p>
               <p>You never saw him but that minute? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you positively swear from seeing him one minute that that person was the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What distance is it from the shop door to the parlour? - About four yards and a half; he had taken up the stockings before I came out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>When you came out of the door and cryed out stop thief! were there any other persons in his company! - Another young man stood at the corner of the shop window; he ran off; Woolley was running when I went to the door; the other seemed to laugh; when I got to the door I cried stop thief! and then they ran.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation upon that lad to know him again? - Yes; that is the young man in the blue clothes (Dempsey.)</p>
               <p>When did you see him afterwards? - At the office.</p>
               <p>DEMPSEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was employed in turning a wheel for twopence an hour at that time at Mr. Fox's. The room that I lodged in I was to pay twopence a night for, to Mr. James. I came in between eight and nine, and went to bed; this young man was asleep at the time; the key hung up a usual on the outside, in the passage. Between ten and eleven the woman waked me, and asked me to let a young man lie<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170007"/> with me, as he was destitute of a lodging; I said, three were too many in a bed, but however he came in. When Mr. Atwood came and knocked at the door; I let him in; he pulled these things out from under the bed; I told him I knew nothing of it; it is a common lodging house, the same as another twopenny lodging house. I never examined what was in the room. I used to go in and outin the morning; I never looked under the bed.</p>
               <p>WOOLLEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never looked under the bed; the door was almost constantly open. It is a common twopenny lodging house. I went to bed of a night directly as I went in; the door was almost always open. Other lads and disorderly women too lay in the house besides me.

               <p>Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - Yes; more than I desire to know. She came into our house on Friday last under a pretence of asking for her namesake; she said I was her namesake, that her name was Williams. I said my name was Williamson. She sat down; she said her husband was a Scotchman, and that she much loved the Scotch; and asked me to get a quartern of gin; I said I did not use that sort of liquor. I went and got a pennyworth of gin. I had a newspaper in my hand; she said she had found a purse with bank notes and money in it to the value of three hundred pounds, and asked me if it was advertised; she then asked me to come and dine with her on the Sabbath-day; which I did not agree to. When she was gone, I missed the cloak; there was nobody in the house besides her, my wife, and myself. On the Saturday following my wife went to the Brown Bear, in Rosemary-lane, and saw the prisoner. My wife sent for me.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of February; I went into the Three Tons to call for a pennyworth of purl, and saw him with a bag with two pigs in it in his hand; he was offering them to sale; he asked three shillings a piece for them. I asked him how he came by them; he said what was that to me; I said I believed he had stolen them, and would take him to a magistrate to see how he came by them. I took him to the magistrate; there he said first that he bought them; then he said he found them in the bag; they were warm. When I took him I found a knife upon him which I suppose he had stuck them with for there was blood upon it, and his hands were bloody; the pigs had not been long killed. I enquired about the neighbourhood, and was told they were Mr. Dunn's property; and he swore to them before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Jury. What colour were the pigs? - Both white about five weeks old.</p>

I took them; I went into a publick-house for a pennyworth of purl; I put the bag down and went out to make water; when I came in Isaacs had hold of the bag, he might have changed the pigs for any thing I know; they are not the prosecutor's property; he keeps pigs for other people he has none of his own.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes; I took him in my house, and gave him a fortnight's lodging out of compassion. I do not know that he took it. I took up his boy first; the boy said he had found it. The day I missed it, the boy came to bring an apron to a girl in the house; I asked him if he had heard of my misfortune, and told him I had lost the watch; he said no. His mother came afterwards and abused me, and said, she would trounce me for saying they had stolen my husband's watch; that because I had heard that their boy had found a watch, that therefore I pretended I had lost one.</p>

I waited an hour, he did not come; the prisoner was there; I bid the publican say nothing to the prisoner about it till we were certain of the the watch, as the prosecutrix only wanted her property again. Instead of bringing the prosecutrix the watch, they came and abused her; on which I advised her to go to Justice Sherwood. and get a warrant against the man, his son, and daughter. I advised that the watchmaker that repaired it should be summoned, but it was over-ruled.</p>

I went with him some of the way, when a man met him, and said Mr. Fasey wondered how he could stay so; and he said to me, boy, how came you to stay so long? I said my mother could not get them done sooner. The prisoner said to me he must have the things, and he gave them to the other man; then he told me to come back with him, that he had got an acquaintance at a publick-house where he must call as we went back. I began to think that they had robbed me of the linen; I said to the prisoner, that I did not think the things were safe. He said if I did not think they were save, I might run after the man; I did run after him, but could not see him; then I lost them both.</p>

               <p>I came out on Sunday evening, and went to Mr. Gabriel's house. He asked me if I wanted to buy a gown; I said I would have it, if it was not dear; he said it was a gown and coat, and they must go together; he said he gave 18 s. for it, and I should have it for 18 s. again. I took it on his word; I gave his wife a guinea, and she gave me three shillings change. I sent for the mantua-maker, and gave it directly to her. Mr. Fasey's apprentice went to the mantua-maker's, and saw the gown, and asked her how she came by it. The mantua-maker brought it to Mr. Fasey's house, and the washerwoman got it. I was there, and saw it brought; there was an apron.</p>

I found him about three weeks after, at a lodging in Chick-lane; when he saw Levi and I come in, he ran and hid himself in the coal-hole; after that, he said if 
we would admit him an evidence, he would confess the whole.</p>

He was not willing to go there. I took him to Mr. Whitehead's, and the iron was delivered to Mr. Sedgwick.</p>

               <p>To Ainsworth. Do you live in Greek-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Lucas pawn the tea chest with you? - One of them did.</p>
               <p>To Lucas. Did you pawn any thing-else? - Yes; the candlesticks and the sheet; she was in great distress when I carried them; she was to get them out as soon as possible. Mr. Best came into the apartment, and said she used him very ill, keeping the things out of his lodging, and paying no rent; that he did not care how long they were out if she paid him his rent.</p>
               <p>Where did she live when he said he knew they were out? - In Mr. Best's apartment.</p>
               <p>How long did she live there after they were out? - About a week.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. The prisoner gave me a spoon in Mr. Carter's yard. He lost it on Friday the 15th of January; she gave it me on Saturday; I went to the pawnbroker's and found the spoon, pawned in the name of Catherine Hill; then I went to the prisoner, and she said that was her name; then I told her she must go with me to Mr. Carter's When we were in Mr. Carter's yard, as I was lifting up the latch of the door I heard something rattle; she stooped and then gave me the spoon out of her hand; she said she kicked it before her. I took her from thence to the pawnbroker's, and he said that was the woman that pawned the spoon. The pawnbroker is not here.</p>

               <p>Court. Is there a person really existing of the name of Goodluck, or is it an assumed name? - No; there is such a person in partnership with me. The prisoner was employed by me and my partner in an office in <placeName id="t17790217-28-crimeloc161">Pall-Mall</placeName>

About the 13th of December last, I was looking over a bill of sundry expences that were incurred at that office in Pall-Mall, and seeing two dozen of candles every other day charged, when I knew they did not burn three pound a day, I imagined there must be some bad tricks played, either that they had not been laid in, or that they must have been carried off; they were both for candles and oil; I was determined that evening to find out how it was. I went to Mr. Jarvis, a tallow chandler in Pall-Mall, showed him my bill; these bills were delivered to me by a principal clerk of mine his name is

            , I questioned him with it; he denied it and proved that this lad always brought to him the bill and receipts as he always gave him the money for it. I went to Mr. Jarvis, and showed him the bill of parcels; they were his blank bills of parcel, but were not filled up-by him, nor any body belonging to him; the boy (the prisoner) I understood afterwards, had begged blank bills of him and then filled them up.</p>
               <p>Court. Had it been the practice to pay ready money for the goods you had of Jarvis? - Yes; there was no account subsisting between us.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner seems very young; in what capacity was he employed in your office? - As an <rs id="t17790217-28-deflabel162" type="occupation">errand boy</rs>

               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. House; I remember the prisoner coming for oil; he always paid for it, and never had a bill or receipt.</p>
               <p>Did you give him no receipt for these payments? - None at all.</p>
               <p>HENDLEY NIND sworn.</p>
               <p>Are you a clerk in the office of Jenkinson and Goodluck? - I was so in their office in Pall-Mall.</p>
               <p>The principal clerk? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Of what number of persons does that partnership consist? - Mr. Jenkinson and Goodluck.</p>
               <p>Only of those two? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, he was an errand boy there.</p>
               <p>You know he is now indicted for forgery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What do you know of that matter? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Jenkinson on the 15th or 16th of December last, it was on a Monday, I think it was the 15th, came to me in Pall-Mall and asked me if I knew any thing about any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170027"/> receipts of the tradesmen, which he produced to me afterwards. I told him for those receipts I had given the prisoner the money to pay; I always gave him gold to bring me change, because I would have silver. Mr. Jenkinson asked me whether those bills were paid. I told him they were by the boy. He afterwards said that for those bills no such money had been paid. He had enquired something of the tradesmen and had found the sum of money charged in the bills had not been paid. Mr. Jenkinson has got the receipts, I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you got these receipts?</p>
               <p>Jenkinson. No; I had them in court last sessions. The boy was then to have been tried. I think I remember taking them home safe, and putting them into the top of a writing desk. I looked for them this morning, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Court. Unless you produce them, and they are compared with the record, and found to be exact with that, the prisoner cannot be convicted.</p>
               <p>Jenkinson. I searched for them this morning, and could not find them.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose this was intended. You did not bring the receipts I suppose by design? - I had them in court last sessions, when he was to have been tried, but since that I have lost them.</p>
               <p>Court. But you must know these receipts were material to have been produced in evidence; and, therefore, you ought to have been as careful of them as of Bank notes. - I did take care of them, and put them in a drawer. I never looked for them since till this morning, when I could not find them.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury, you must acquit the prisoner.</p>

The two sashes on the ground-floor were open; the frame of one of the windows was broke. I had shut the windows, and fastened them in the inside with an iron pin. When I went into the room, one of the windows was down flush. The person must have got in at the top of it; the other sash was up. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). The window looks into a publick passage. I saw the things in the room ten minutes before, and the windows were both fast. No person had been in the room from the time I saw the things there to the time I missed them. When I went into the room I saw the prisoner go from the window. I pursued, and laid hold of him; he made a plunge to got away I secured him; he dropped a bag with the things. I am sure there was copper in the bag by the rattle of it. Deathridge came up, and I told him where the bag was.</p>

I went to the door; there was a man had brought a pot of beer to my sister; the prisoner was at the door. The prisoner asked if George was there, that is his master's son. I said he was, and he went down to him in the kitchen: as I was shutting the kitchen window I saw the watch hanging up in the kitchen. He said, whose watch is this? I said mine, not thinking any harm; he said again, whose watch is this? I said Mr. Lawrenceson's. He went out of the kitchen; when he was gone I missed the watch. I said he has got the watch; the apprentice said he would go after him; he came back, and said he could not find him. Presently the prisoner came in, and asked if we had found the watch.</p>

               <p>What were they? - I have an inventory of them. I cannot tell what they are without referring to the inventory.</p>
               <p>What is it an inventory of? - My goods that that gentleman and his wife took away from me.</p>
               <p>Of the things found in his possession, or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170031"/> the things found missing? - The things found in his possession, and which he sold to the Jews.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any aprons? - Yes. There may be two or three dozen; they had a room next to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you lost a dozen of linen aprons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Any linen shifts? - Yes; a dozen of them.</p>
               <p>Any handkerchiefs? - Yes; fifteen or sixteen in one parcel; half a dozen of linen frocks; there might be a dozen or two of linen shirts. I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Are you sure there were four? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there any linen sheets? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many? - Twelve.</p>
               <p>Cradle quilt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see them in the warehouse? - About three days before they came to take this room. They had been in a fortnight on the Monday; he was to have gone away on the Monday he was taken up; on the Saturday I missed the things, and got a warrant, and went with Redgrave the constable to his room; he was not at home; his wife was. While we were in the room, a man came with a knot, and two penny cords to carry away a box which was in the room; we broke it open, and found in it a cradle quilt, four sheets, and many more things my property. The bills were on some of them when they were found, and some were taken away. Mr. Richmond owned before the justice, on the 30th of January, that the property was mine.</p>
               <p>Was there any confession taken in writing? - I believe so. When we broke open the box; I said to Mrs. Richmond, how could you serve me so? She showed me where he had broke down the partition, between the warehouse and his room, and had got in; both she and Mr. Richmond said they were mine.</p>
               <p>What is the value of your goods found in the box? - At the least, they cannot be of less value than five pounds.</p>
               <p>Describe how the warehouse stands. Is it in your dwelling-house? - Yes; up two-pair-of-stairs.</p>


               <p>JONATAN REDGRAVE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I was sent on the 30th of January to execute a search warrant in the apartment of the two prisoners. I went up stairs; the wife was in the room; there was this box standing upright in the room. I said I had a search warrant, and must have the box opened; she said she had not the key. I told her then I must break it open, which I accordingly did, and the first thing I saw was a shift, with the pawnbroker's duplicate on it. The prosecutrix said, how could you rob me? She cried; the prosecutrix then asked her how they got into the warehouse, upon which she showed her the board he had occasionally pulled down to get in; I left the prosecutrix with her, and went down stairs to wait for his coming home; when he came in, I fastened the street door, and followed him up stairs, and told him he was my prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said to you by him, or by you to him? - No. I took him before the justice, and after a long examination, the justice got out of him where he had taken another room.</p>
               <p>Was there any confession taken in writing? - No; I believe not, nor any promise made that I know of. He said he had taken a room near the Horns, in St. John's-street; he did not say then that the things were the prosecutrix's property. We went to the lodging in St. John's-street and found another box, with some of the prosecutrix's goods in it. When we brought the goods from that lodging; he then said to the justice, I have sold some. The justice asked him to whom, and for what, and he said he had sold between five and six pounds worth to two Jews.</p>
               <p>You do not know what those things were? - No; he confessed before the magistrate, that he took them out of the warehouse and gave them to his wife.</p>
               <p>You are sure there was no confession taken in writing? - I do not remember that there was.</p>
               <p>(The goods found were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>

               <p>I had been out one day; when I returned I found these things in the room; my wife told me her mother sent them to her and asked me to sell them; she said they were her own property; I sold some and took some of them to my lodging in St. John's-street; I did not know who they belonged to.</p>

On Wednesday the third of February I went there and found that the house had been broke open. A very large nail which I had driven in a back window towards the garden, had been forced. Upon entering the house I missed a great many things. On Thursday the fourth, I saw the curtains, two bottles of wine, and two waistcoats, at the office in Litchfield-street, which I knew to be mine; I described the marks on the bottles before I saw them; the marks were found to tally exactly as I described them. I left them all in the house when I came to London. I had not myself seen them for near three weeks before the time when they were stolen. The gate before the front door of the house had been forced; the box of the lock was broke.</p>

               <p>I live in the next room to Mr. Huddey, in Church-lane, St. Martin's; I saw the prisoner in bed at ten o'clock on the second of February; I got up early to work the next morning; I went down to the vault; I met him as I was coming up with a candle in his hand; the clock struck four soon after I was in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was one of the neighbours before the bench of justices said he saw three or four men the night before the house was broke open.</p>
               <p>Dixon. I have asked Mr. White; I do not recollect any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. White. A person came from Kensington to look at the prisoner. She said she had seen people catching birds the day before about there, when she saw the prisoner she said she had not seen him before.</p>
               <p>Dixon. A bricklayer and some other people offered to sit up in Mr. White's house, expecting the thieves to come the next night. The bricklayer said he saw two men, and when he came out they ran away. That is what the prisoner means, I believe.</p>
               <p>NOT GUILTY of breaking and entering the dwelling-house, but GUILTY of stealing the goods in the dwelling-house.</p>

               <p>On the Wednesday after the robbery, I apprehended the two prisoners, but not for this fact. A person came to the office and laid an information against them, as two highwaymen, and directed us to their lodging in James-street; I went and found the two prisoners in one bed, with two girls; I did not find any thing there; I went to the washerwoman's and saw the linen; I found that inventory in Langham's pocket. As soon as the coachman came to the office, Macdonald and he went to the prison. The coachman afterwards went with me to the washerwoman's.</p>

               <p>I met this man on Sunday morning with the bundles which I had bought in Monmouth-street; he said I had better go and leave them at the washerwoman's for safety; I met him (Langham) in Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Dixon. He said before the justice that he bought them of a Jew; the justice asked him what Jew; he said it might be a Turk for what he knew.</p>
               <p>Eustace. I bought them of a Jew woman in Monmouth-street; I gave two guineas and a half for them; Langham is innocent of any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>LANGHAM's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I did not see this young man till I met him on Sunday morning in Compton-street; we went and had a pint of purl, and then went together to the washerwoman's.</p>

               <p>I am the prisoner Langham's brother; I am an upholsterer in James-street, Golden-square. I was very much surprised to hear of his being taken up, or being with a thief; it alarmed me very much; I never heard any thing of the kind of him before; he was bound apprentice to me; we did not agree; he left me about six months ago, and got a service in a family where a brother-in-law of mine lived as a footman; he had been out of that service about a fortnight, and lived at my brother-in-law's; my brother-in-law protected him; he had offended me very much; I did not suffer him to come to my house.</p>
               <p>I suppose when he lived with you he behaved very irregular? - He did; but he never was out of my house after ten o'clock. I could wish to save his life.</p>
               <p>Court. If you have heard the evidence you hear he was become so abandoned as to be found in bed with two girls and another man.</p>

I was a stranger before this time that the apartment had been let. When I came there the prisoner told me that she had suffered by the robbery as well as me, for she had lost several things, particulary some of her husband's shirts; a gold ring that had been her mother's; and a silver spoon. I returned home to my place and on the Monday following the prisoner came to my mistress's and desired I would go with her to the justice's and get a search warrant, and that she would be at half the expence, having lost some of her property. I went with her to justice Wilmot's, there I was examined and made oath to my loss; and the prisoner took oath to her pretended loss of shirts and spoons which she said were stolen. In consequence of this oath a search warrant was granted and executed, but nothing was found; afterwards I received information that the prisoner had offered some of my things to sale; thereupon I took her up; this was about three weeks ago; when she was taken up she confessed that she had pawned several things, and directed us to the pawnbroker's; and in consequence of that information I went with the prisoner to the pawnbroker, and there found part of my property; the silk and stuff gown, the blue petticoat, a dimity and a flannel petticoat.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mrs. Davis. The evening the robbery was committed the prisoner came down stairs from her apartment, and desired she might leave a candle upon the dresser till she returned again; she was permitted to do that, and she afterwards came in between nine and ten at night together with her husband. They went up stairs; she made a noise; at that time the staple of the door was drawn; when she went out she locked the door it is to be supposed; for at the time when she went out, and put down this candle, between nine and ten at night, the staple could not have been drawn; for I should have discovered it then if it had; but she must want it to be understood to be between the time she went out, which was about three quarters of an hour, to her return, that it must be done; they made an outcry and came down and informed me the robbery had been committed and the staple drawn. I went up, there were two blankets against the window, and the prisoner said the persons that had committed the robbery must have made their escape through the window.</p>

               <p>I let the lodging to the prisoner. She and her husband were well recommended to me. I let her this apartment; she removed some things of her own there. I was in a hurry, going to Smithfield, and did not observe whether the prosecutrix's box was there, at the time she came down and desired to put the candle on the dresser, and said she was going to the pay-table where her husband was paid. She put it down on the dresser, and returned again in about three-quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Was there any person with her when she came down with the candle? - No; there was no living soul with her, but a poor candle in her hand.</p>

               <p>There was a woman came into my house that was acquainted with my husband. I knew nothing of her, only I thought she was honest; she often got very drunk; she had come in that night I went out; and after the Monday morning I happened to see her. She came to this Mrs. Davis; she said I will make you acknowledge it. I said I have lost my good character that I have carried all my life. I have bore nine children. She was quite drunk; she said, if I would let her sleep, she would come on Monday night and tell me every things; and as she was coming up on Monday night, she was killed in Petticoat-lane by an accidence.</p>

               <p>On the sixteenth of January I lost nineteen pound weight of moist sugar; there is a warehouse where we deposit sugars, in which the several persons named in the indictment are warehouse-keepers, in care of, and answerable for these sugars. I saw the prisoner coming out of the warehouse, and, on searching him, I found nineteen pound weight of moist sugar in his pockets; I cannot say out of what particular hogshead it came, but there was a large quantity of the same quality in the warehouse as that; the prisoner, when he was apprehended, said, somebody had called out work, as is usual when they want, as porters come for the purpose of getting work; and that not finding employment he took the sugar, and said he should have made another trip if I had not stopped him.</p>

               <p>I am one of the partners in the warehouse; I assisted in taking the prisoner; we found the sugar in his pocket; the prisoner said he heard somebody call out work; that he came there, but found nobody to employ him, therefore he thought he ought not to go from thence for nothing, and admitted that he had taken the sugar. When he came before Alderman Sainsbury he did not then deny taking the sugar.</p>

               <p>I found the sugar in a paper bag, under one of the gateways; I found the bag was wet, I put it in my pocket; I was backwards and forwards upon the keys for some time.

I told them it was; they told me I must come to the justice the next morning. I did so, and there swore to the horse; it is a stout little horse, about thirteen hands and an half high.</p>
               <p>What age? - He may be ten or a dozen years old. I am certain it is my horse?</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable in Clerkenwell. Near where I live there are some people buy horseflesh. On the 29th of January last, about the hour of eight in the morning, the woman belonging to the horse-flesh-house came and told me a man had brought a horse to her, which she did not think it was fitting to be killed for horse-flesh. By the time I had got to the place, the prisoner had got farther from the house with the horse, for he had sent for a voucher, which the woman and I both knew to be a receiver of stolen goods, that made us suspect him the more. I laid hold of the prisoner, and asked him whose it was; he said it was his father's, who was a clerk to a printer near Bow, and his father having no further occasion for him had sent him to town to sell it. I said it was strange that a man should send a horse to town to sell on a Friday, Smithfield-market day, and should bring it to a place where they kill horses. He still insisted it was his father's, and gave me a direction to his father. After the other officer came back from Oldford, and found out the gentleman that had lost the horse, the prisoner declared before the magistrate, that it was through the persuasions of a man that boiled horses, that put him upon the practice of stealing horses.</p>
               <p>Who went with you to the justice's? - Redgrave and I that night.</p>
               <p>Was any confession of the prisoner's taken down in writing? - No.</p>
               <p>Was this confession before the justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170042"/>Were any promises made him? - No.</p>
               <p>Or any threats made use of? - No.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - When he found there was an owner to the house; he said, I have known the prosecutor, and the horse some time. He laughed, and said, I little thought that the horse and I should be so well acquainted together. He asked the magistrate what was the consequence of this; the magistrate told him it was horse-stealing; he said he knew the man that owned it, because he saw him ride it into a pond a stag hunting.</p>
               <p>What did he say relative to stealing the horse? - He said he met one Minchin, who told him, if he would come to the Punch-bowl in Hockley in the Hole, if he had any horses to sell, he could buy them of him, and that he was to have brought the horse on Monday morning; he said he brought it from Oldford, and he mentioned the turnpikes he came through. He had asked fifteen shillings for the horse; I told him I thought such a horse as that was not sit to be knocked on the head, as it was a good looking horse, and with good eyes too. He confessed before the justice, that he did take the horse, and bring it there to sell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never made any confession of a theft. - Yes; he did.</p>
               <p>What was the horse worth? - Three or four pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I give you a direction to go to Oldford? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My father lived there. I should not have given him a direction to have gone there if I had known the horse had been stolen.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Dinmore the constable sent for me on Saturday morning, and told me he had apprehended a man for stealing a horse. The consequence was, I went down to Oldford. He asked the prisoner how he came by the horse; he said it was his father's horse. I went to Mr. Hambleton's at Oldford; he was not at home; I waited till he came home; he said it was his horse. I was afterwards before the justice. The prisoner at first said it was his father's.</p>
               <p>Did he say before the justice how he got it? - No; not as I remember.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This is the man that went down upon the horse to enquire for my father; a man he met said he knew the horse, that it belonged to Mr. Hambleton, a baker; that Mr. Hambleton indemnified the horse to be his property. They fetched me out of New Prison, and took me to a publick-house in the neighbourhood. There they gave me beer, and gin and water, both of them, and promised me great things if I would confess.</p>
               <p>Court to Redgrave. Did you tell him he had better confess, or did you make any promise to him, that you would do any thing for him if he did confess? - No.</p>
               <p>Did any body in your hearing? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you give him liquor before you carried him before the justice? - I remember we had a pot of purl between us three, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Court to Dinmore. Did you give him any thing to drink? - So far from giving him drink; I gave him victuals. He said he had no money; there was part of a pot of purl, out of which us three, and another man drank.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said to induce him to make a confession? - No; upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Did you say it would be better for him? - No. I said, how could you send a man to Oldford, and say it was your father's horse, when another man has owned it? Then he voluntarily confessed the fact.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it ever his father's horse?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; his father never kept a horse in his life, I believe.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>A man said this horse had the staggers, and as I had nothing to do; he promised me if I would take him to London that I should have something for my trouble for selling him; I was to be back by twelve o'clock if I could. I came to London; the way I came acquainted with this horse flesh butcher was, I came to a publick house where this Minchin used; he is a printer by trade; he left off the printing, and then worked at horse flesh butchering; he told me if ever I went into the country to live again, if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170043"/> knew any body that had any horses that could not work to bring them to the Sun and Punch Bowl in Hockley in the Hole and he would buy them. I told this man I would take the horse there, but said I would not sell him unless they would give money enough for him. Smithfield market begins about three o'clock in the afternoon and I was in a hurry to go to Stratford upon business for my father; I was at this place a quarter after eight in the morning; this woman would give but half a guinea; and I was to get half a guinea for the man, and have the rest for myself; I would have sold the horse for 15 s. so I should have had a trifle for myself, as I was out of work and had nothing to do. They took me to New Prison upon suspicion. Mr. Dinmore was sent down to Oldford; before he could see my father he heard this horse belonged to Mr. Hambleton; the next morning when my father went after the person that entrusted me with the horse to sell, he was gone out of the way, and not to be heard of; after the common prisoners were locked up, they got me out of the prison, and took me into a little parlour at the sign of the Horse-shoe, and gave me two or three pennyworths of gin and water; and one went out of the room while the other staid to make me confess, and said they would do great things for me. All that I told the justice was, that the horse was intrusted to my care to come to London. I did not know the horse, not that it belonged to Mr. Hambleton, because I work at Hackney in the day time, so I have no opportunity of seeing the horse in the day time. Mr. Hambleton says he has had it but three months. I know he had a grey horse, but think it was rather taller than this horse, which they say I stole; the man I had the horse of lived at Hackney; he has absconded. He brought the horse to my father's at seven o'clock in the morning for me to bring to London to sell. I said I could not take it to the Market because that did not begin till three o'clock, therefore I could not stay so long; a man would have bought the horse for fifteen or sixteen shillings. If I had known it had been stolen that would have been a dangerous method as the horse would have been always about the street.</p>

            , who is charged by that indictment you have now heard read with an offence that goes under the general description of an highway robbery. But, gentlemen, the circumstances which attend this case are so uncommon and so singular in their nature, (and I trust will continue to be uncommon, for I hope never to hear of another of the same sort) that I conceive it to be my duty to state to you very particularly the circumstances of the case, that will be laid before you in evidence, and to submit some few observations to the court of what I conceive to be the law resulting from those facts.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The prosecutor of this indictment is a young gentleman of about eighteen years of age, the second son of the Earl of Denbigh. what the prisoner is, or in what manner he gets his living, I leave to him to state to you, because I am not informed upon that subject. The first time, however, that he was ever seen by the young gentleman who prosecutes this indictment, was on the 18th of January last, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, when that young gentleman was going from the house of a lady, where he had dined I believe, to one of the Play-houses; he was accosted in <placeName id="t17790217-40-crimeloc238">Soho-square</placeName>

                        targets="t17790217-40-off234 t17790217-40-crimeloc238"/> by the prisoner at the bar, who desired he would give him some money; this sort of request astonished Mr. Fielding, the young gentleman, and he said, Money! for what, sir? I do not know you. Upon which the prisoner said, You had better do it, sir, for if you do not I will take you before a magistrate and charge you with having committed Sodomy upon me. A charge of that sort must necessarily alarm the young gentleman to whom it was addressed; in truth, it did extremely; and there are very few men who have firmness of mind enough, and who are sufficiently collected, to take upon them to judge instantaneously what is proper to be done upon such an occasion; however, alarmed as he was, he conceived it would be better to submit to this man's demand and request, rather than to have this sort of attack made upon him, and to be carried before a magistrate; the consequences of which he did not then understand. It was, I think, two days after, when this young gentleman again met with the prisoner in <placeName id="t17790217-40-crimeloc239">Oxford-road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17790217-40-crimeloc239" type="placeName" value="Oxford-road"/>

                        targets="t17790217-40-off234 t17790217-40-crimeloc239"/>, in the afternoon; he made the same demand upon him that he had done the time before, and he accompanied it with this extraordinary expression, You had better give it to me, or I shall take you before a magistrate, and I shall contrive it so that you cannot prove an alibi; that is, that you was at another place at the time, and therefore you had better give me the money. At that second time Mr. Fielding went, I think, to a Mr. Waters in Bond-street, of whom he borrowed some money to give him; at both these times money was given him under the impression that was made upon the prosecutor from the menace and threat used to him by the prisoner, of carrying him before a magistrate, and charg-him with that offence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, It was by a very singular circumstance that this man was discovered, and is now brought to justice. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170045"/> the 12th, I think, of February, the prisoner at the bar met Lord Fielding, on Hay-hill who is the elder brother of the young gentleman who is the prosecutor, between whom, I believe, there may be three or four years difference in point of age, but they have, as I understand, an exceeding great resemblance to each other in person, and the prisoner mistaking Lord Fielding for the gentleman he had spoken to before, accosts Lord Fielding in the same manner that he had accosted his brother near a fortnight before. Lord Fielding said, What can you possibly mean by this? I never saw you before. Upon which the man put him in mind, which will, gentlemen, be a very strong confirmation, if it could be possible that the evidence of the young gentleman should want confirmation. He said, Do not you remember my seeing you in Soho-Square, and afterwards going to Mrs. Cotton's, (which is the lady's house where the young gentlemad had dined). That circumstance will be an exceeding strong confirmation, if any should be thought wanting, Lord Fielding attempted at that time to lay hands on him, and apprehend him, but the prisoner took to his heels, and for that time made his escape; but in a very short time afterwards he met Lord Fielding again, and fell into the same error respecting him, for he again addressed him as his brother, in the same manner as he had done before; and then Lord Fielding called to his assistance a gentleman who was near at hand, and between them both they secured him, and carried him before a magistrate, and he was committed to take his tryal.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, These are the facts that will, pretty exactly as I have stated them to you, be laid before you by the witnesses I shall call in support of the prosecution; and I trust that these facts, when proved, will satisfy you under the direction of the court, that in point of law, they amount to constitute that offence imputed to the prisoner, namely, that of an highway robbery.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, There have been cases of this nature, I think, two within my remembrance; and one that I have heard of before; where, under the solemn opinion of the judges, they have held that this kind of menace and threat being made use of for the purpose of extorting money from the person so charged, and compelling the delivery of that money, is equivalent to any terror a person may be supposed to be impressed with, by either a pistol put to his head, or a sword to his breast, or any thing of that sort that has been determined indeed upon the principles, as I conceive, of found sense; that the terror that every man's mind is impressed with upon a threat of this nature is more forcibly and more emphatically a violence done to him than holding a pistol to him, sword, or other instrument of offence, because every man knows what effect that menace is to produce, that it is to produce the effect of delivering the small sum he has about him; he complies with that readily, and is under no great apprehensions upon the subject; but the terror a man must be struck with, especially a young man at his time of life, of unblemished character and reputation, with a charge made upon him of this horrible nature in itself, you will easily judge whether that would not operate more forcibly upon his mind than any violence that could be attempted upon his person; it is upon that principle that the judges have held this violence to be equal to a threat with a pistol, or any other instrument of offence; and upon that ground they have determined that this sort of terror is what the law calls a putting in fear, so as to constitute that part of the definition of an highway robbery.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall not take up more of your time, but proceed to call the witnesses to prove the facts I have stated to you; if they do prove these facts, I trust that under the direction in point of law, which you will receive from the court, you will not be under any difficulty in finding the prisoner guilty of this charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170046"/>The Honourable Mr. FIELDING sworn.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Sir, you will be pleased to inform the court of the circumstances of your meeting with the prisoner on the 18th of January in Soho Square? - On Monday the 18th of January I dined with Mrs. Cotton, at No. 3 Harley Street, between the hours of six and seven; I went from thence in order to go to Covent-Garden theatre. In my way I passed through Soho Square; where I met the prisoner at the bar, who came up to me and accosted me, and desired me to make him a present. I asked him for what? He told me I had better comply, or he would take me before a magistrate and accuse me of an attempt to commit an unnatural crime; those were the words to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not comply with the request which he made?</p>
               <p>A. I did. I gave him half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him after this?</p>
               <p>A. He said that money was not sufficient. I returned to Mrs. Cotton's. He followed me. I borrowed half a guinea of the servant with intention to go to the play. I saw the prisoner no more that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you meet him again?</p>
               <p>A. That was on the Monday; I met him again on the Wednesday about four o'clock in Oxford road.</p>
               <p>Q. Please to mention what happened at that time?</p>
               <p>A. He came up to me and used the same threats of carrying me before a magistrate and to prison; upon which I took him to Mr. Waters's, a grocer, in Bond Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention as near as you possibly can the very words he made use of to you?</p>
               <p>A. He told me, I knew very well what had passed in Soho Square the other night; and unless I would give him some more money he would take me before a magistrate and accuse me of the same attempt which he had threatened on the other day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make use of any other expressions or any other threats?</p>
               <p>A. Yes. He said, That it would go hard against me unless I could prove an alibi. I went with him to Mr. Waters's, a grocer, in Old Bond Street; he went with me there and staid on the outside of the door. I gave Mr. Waters a guinea and desired him to give it to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no more of him, I believe, till he was apprehended?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Sir, Was you not much alarmed and agitated with this kind of address?</p>
               <p>A. I was extremely alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. And under that alarm you gave him the money?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; under that alarm I gave him the money.</p>
               <p>Q. The alarm it may easily be supposed begot a terror upon your mind; and it was under the impression of that terror that you delivered the money?</p>
               <p>A. Under the impression of that terror.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Sir, you say this was between six and seven when you first met the prisoner in Soho Square?</p>
               <p>A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person near you at that time?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. And none passed at the time?</p>
               <p>A. There might be, I did not take notice of that.</p>
               <p>Q. The second time you met him in Oxford-street?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the day-time?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there were a number of people passing at that time?</p>
               <p>A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had had any fears about you at that time; would it not have been natural to have expressed that, and taken him prisoner at that time?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you apprehend that at the time?</p>
               <p>A. I did.</p>

               <p>A. He did.</p>


               <p>Q. Was it not possible at that time to have secured the prisoner, if you had had these fears about you?</p>
               <p>A. I might have done it, but I was not acquainted with these kind of matters. I was apprehensive it might cost me my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you explain any thing of this sort to Mr. Waters?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before the 18th?</p>
               <p>A. No; never.</p>
               <p>Lord FIELDING sworn.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I was walking on Saturday last, between eleven and twelve at noon, up Hay-hill. When I had got towards the top of it, I was accosted by the prisoner at the bar with some salutation or other, I know not what, that he mumbled between his teeth; to which, I replied, I believed he had mistaken me for somebody else, for that I did not know his face. He answered, that he believed I must know him. I replied again, that I did not recollect ever having seen him, nor did I believe that he knew me; and, in order to try whether he did or not, I desired him to mention my name; which he declined, but added, that he knew my person well enough; asking me at the same time, if I did not remember giving him half a guinea, in Soho square, on the 18th of this month. I presume he must have meant last month, for the 18th of this month was not then come. Saying, That I went to No. 3, Harley-street, mentioning at the same time the name of the ladies who lived there, Cotton and Moysel; he mentioned also, his having met me after that, and my having given him money, by a grocer, at No. 6, in Bond-street; all which circumstances, I being totally unacquainted with, naturally denied. He said, it was very extraordinary that I should not recollect him, and persisted in the circumstances that he mentioned. I told him then, I did not recollect having given him any such money, but, if I did, what then? What is your present demand? What are you driving at now; I do not understand you? Be so good as either to explain yourself, or to leave me to walk by myself? He then began to say, that I had used him very ill, on the 18th, in Soho-square; and added, that I knew myself to be guilty of a very scandalous thing, and he would expose me. I desired him immediately to come before a magistrate; I believe I named Sir

            's office in Bow-street; with which he at first seemed very ready to comply, but perceiving me walking towards an hackney-coach, as if I was determined to go through with it, he stopped, and said he would not go. I then seised him by the collar, and declared he should go. He was a little alarmed at first; but recovered himself amazingly soon after, and, with surprising coolness and impudence, he asked me what I would do when I had him there? I believe I told him, that I would accuse him of having threatened me; to which he replied, that he supposed he had mistaken me, and seemed willing to get off, and to wave the accusation. I was a good deal surprised and shocked at so strange an accusation so suddenly, and had not my recollection so much about me as I should have had; and really I did not know at that time what I should have done with him, when I had got him there, and I was weak enough to loose his collar, and let him go. He turned about, and called me, My Lord, and said, I should hear from him again.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you part? did he run away, or did you walk one way, and he another?</p>
               <p>A. I walked one way, and he walked another.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again?</p>
               <p>A. The following Tuesday. I was walking about two o'clock, near the same place, and heard a voice over my shoulder saying, Sir, I have met you again, or some such expression. I recollected his voice perfectly well. I turned round, and seised him by the collar immediately. He complained then, that I had used him very ill the last time that he saw me.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170048"/> To which, I believe, I returned for answer, I had used him too well, for I had let him go, but should take care to do better this time, still keeping fast hold of his collar. Upon which he desired, that I would use him like a GENTLEMAN; he said, he would not be dragged, but he would go along quietly. I saw nobody then pass me that was likely to assist me, in case he should have any gang, or any body near him to rescue him, and as I wished to get him secured with as much quietness as possible, I told him, If he would walk along quietly to the next coffee-house I would not drag him. I could hardly keep my fingers from his throat. We then walked down Dover-street, and about the middle of it, rather before you come to the tavern, which is, I believe, kept by a man whose name is Ditilly, I met two gentlemen of my acquaintance. I then thought I would throw off my civility, and seise the prisoner again, that I should be pretty well assured of proper assistance and support. I accordingly seised him again by the collar, and called to those gentlemen to assist me, but whether they understood my meaning, or not, I cannot say, but I received no assistance from them. When I spoke to them, the prisoner walked on pretty fast, as fast as he could without making a run of it, down Dover-street. When I perceived that, I did not stay to expostulate with my friends. I followed him down immediately as fast as ever I could. I collared him again, and called to some chairmen, whom I observed there, to send for a constable. The prisoner struggled a good deal; saying, He would not be dragged, and bidding me hold off, and so forth. I told him I could assure him I would not let him go, and in the struggle, I believe, he fell down twice. I let him go as he fell, and then seised him again, the moment he rose. By this time, it being at the corner of a public-street, a great number of people were assembled together. I observed, a gentleman, with a cockade, standing by, who was Major Hartley. As a brother officer, I called upon him to assist a brother officer. I told the people who were gathered about the reason why I had seised this man; that he had charged me with a scandalous practice, and that I wished we might go before a magistrate. A coach was called, and Major Hartley and two others, the best dressed, and most gentlemen-like people I could see there, went with me in the coach, and we carried the prisoner safely to the office in Bow-street, and from thence he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time he addressed you, when he mentioned the circumstance of Soho-square, he mentioned also the house of that lady, by way of bringing the circumstance to your recollection, where your brother had dined on the 18th?</p>
               <p>A: He did; and that he was the man to whom I had given the half guinea, and to whom I sent a guinea by the grocer.</p>

               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I do not deny meeting Lord Fielding twice. I pulled my hat off to him; I addressed him in as decent a manner as I was capable of. I wanted to tell him something concerning his brother; upon which, my Lord, he would not hear me, and told me he knew the story before; as to any thing swore to here, it is entirely false, so help me God.

             on the 18th of January, and then taking from his person half a guinea. There is likewise a second charge against him for robbing Mr. Fielding on the highway on the 20th of January, and then taking from his person a guinea; the case was properly opened to you on the part of the prosecution; and the prisoner as well as the counsel for the prosecutor have much rested upon a point of law. The prisoner in the close of what he has said certainly meant to leave it to the court to consider whether under the circumstances of this case the taking the money is in point of law a robbery. What is or what is not a robbery is in general a question of law.</p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, the general definition of a robbery is, that money must be taken by violence and against the will. With respect to actual putting in fear, it has been frequently decided, that it is not necessary; if such circumstances are used as will put a reasonable man in fear, that is all the force or violence that is necessary to constitute a robbery. Now it has been suggested to me by the prisoner's counsel, that in this case the prisoner did not charge Mr.

             with having actually committed a capital offence, but with only having made an attempt, and the making an attempt alone would not have endangered his life. I do not think, in point of law, that that would at all avail the prisoner, because I hold it sufficient in point of law (and so I conceive it has been decided by all the judges) that accusing a man with an attempt to commit sodomy, which puts him in a state that he cannot act with his own will, is sufficient, and is violence enough to constitute the crime of robbery. But gentlemen, I shall leave it to you,</p>
               <p>First to consider, whether upon this evidence there does not appear to be an actual terror in the person accused, for if that be proved to your satisfaction, then the case clearly stands without any doubt whatever.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170050"/>In the next place, it seems to me, that if you are not satisfied of that, yet if the charge is such in its nature, and imposes such a restraint on the person accused that he must at all events be said to part with his money unwillingly, that in point of law is sufficient to constitute a robbery. Having now stated the law upon the case, I shall state to you what has been proved by the witnesses.</p>

             says, that on the 18th of January he dined with Mrs. Cotton, at No. 3, in Harley-street; that between six and seven o'clock he was going from thence to Covent-garden play-house; in his way he went through Soho-square; he met the prisoner there, who desired him to make him a present; upon which Mr. Fielding asked him for what? The prisoner answered, You had better comply, or I will take you before a magistrate, and accuse you of an attempt to commit an unnatural crime. Mr. Fielding said, he gave him half a guinea; upon which the prisoner said, That was not sufficient. Mr. Fielding had no more money then in his pocket; he returned to Mrs. Cotton's where he supposes the prisoner followed him and borrowed half a guinea of Mrs. Cotton's servant, and then went to the play. On the 20th, that was two days afterwards, about four o'clock, he met the prisoner again in Oxford-road; the prisoner came and made use of the same threats; he told Mr. Fielding, He knew what had passed in Soho-square, and unless he gave him more money he would take him before a magistrate and accuse him of the same attempt, the prisoner added, it will go hard with you unless you can prove an alibi. He went, he says, to Mr. Water's, a grocer, in Old Bond-street, the prisoner went with him and staid on the outside of the door; he gave a guinea to Mr. Waters, and bid him give it to the prisoner; he says he saw no more of the prisoner from that time to the time he was apprehended; he was exceedingly alarmed himself, and under that alarm he gave the prisoner the money; he says he gave it under an impression of terror.</p>
               <p>Upon his cross examination he told you that he observed no people in Soho-square; in Oxford-road he did; but did not know what it was proper for him to do, and that he apprehended it might cost him his life; that he swears was his idea at the time; and whether he was mistaken or not with respect to its affecting his life; if he really believed that at the time, it certainly did impose a terror upon his mind.</p>
               <p>Lord Fielding says, On Saturday last, as I was walking up Hay-Hill, between eleven and twelve at noon, I was accosted by the prisoner, who mumbled something, which, I believe, was, How do you do. I said he was mistaken, for I did not know his face. The prisoner said, I must know him. I told him no, nor did I believe he knew me. I then desired the prisoner that he would mention my name. He declined that, but added, he knew my person well enough, and asked, if I did not remember giving him a half guinea in Soho-square, on the eighteenth of this month; that was his expression, though he must have meant the eighteenth of last month, the eighteenth of February not being then come. Then he told Lord Fielding that he went to No. 3, Harley-street, and mentioned the ladies names, Cotton and Moysel, that he sent him money by a grocer in Bond-street; all this Lord Fielding said he dednied; the prisoner said it was very extraordinary that he denied it, and persisted in what he had said. Lord Fielding said He did not recollect giving him any money at all, but if he had what then, what did he want now? He desired he would either explain himself or walk another way, and leave him. The prisoner then said he (Lord Fielding) had used him very ill in Soho-square, on the 18th, and that he (Lord Fielding) knew himself to be guilty of a very scandalous thing, and he would expose him. Lord Fielding desired him to go before a magistrate, and mentioned Sir<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170051"/>

            . At first the prisoner appeared to be ready to go, but as they were walking towards a hackney-coach the prisoner stopped, and said, He would not go; then Lord Fielding seised him and declared he should go; at first the prisoner seemed to be alarmed, but soon recovered himself and with great coolness and impudence asked Lord Fielding, what he would do when he had him there? Lord Fielding said I shall accuse you of having threatened me; the prisoner said he believed he had mistaken him, and seemed willing to wave the accusation. Upon the prisoner asking him this question, he says he was surprised, and did not know what he should have done if he had got him before the justice; then the prisoner turned about, called Lord Fielding my Lord, and said he should bear from him again, upon this they parted, the prisoner went one way, and Lord Fielding another. On Tuesday last as Lord Fielding was walking, about two o'clock, near the same place, he heard the prisoner's voice over his shoulder; he recollected the voice immediately, turned about, and seised the prisoner by the collar; the prisoner complained my Lord had used him till the last time he saw him,; to which his lordship answered, I used you too well, for I then let you go, but I shall take care to do better now, still continuing to hold him by the collar; the prisoner desired he would use him like a gentleman, he said he would not be dragged, but would go along quietly. Lord Fielding says he saw nobody passing there likely to assist him; he told the prisoner if he would walk quietly to the next coffee-house, he would not drag him; that they walked down Dover-street; that about the middle of it Lord Fielding met two gentlemen of his acquaintance; that he then thought he would throw off his civility; he seised the prisoner again by the collar, and called to the gentlemen; they did not assist him, perhaps they might not hear him; the prisoner then walked on pretty fast, which Lord Fielding observing, followed and caught him at the corner of the street, and called to some chairmen to send for a constable; the prisoner struggled a good deal, saying he would not be dragged; Lord Fielding told him he would not let him go, and in the struggle he fell down twice; that he seised the prisoner again the moment he rose; during this he observed Major

             passing along the street, he called to him, and told the people what was the occasion of his seising the prisoner, and expressed a wish that they might both go before a magistrate; accordingly a coach was called, and Major Hartley, two other gentlemen and Lord Fielding went in the coach with the prisoner to Sir

               <p>This is all the evidence that has been given to you; you will consider it in the two lights I have mentioned. Whether you are satisfied there was an actual force and violence and a restraint upon the mind of Mr. Fielding, that rests upon his evidence, for nobody could be present but himself, he had given the prisoner a half guinea, this was all the money he had, and the prisoner was not contented with that, he tells him it was not sufficient, so it was a demand of more, if Mr. Fielding had more that he could have given him; and to be sure there is something very singular in the last<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170052"/> meeting when Mr. Fielding went to Mr. Waters's and not to be accounted for but from fear and terror in his mind: though he sees this prisoner in the street, and though he goes with him to the middle of Bond-street, he knows so little what he is about, that he goes into the grocer's shop. He gives a guinea to the grocer to give the prisoner. He did not go there to borrow it, for he had it in his pocket, for what purpose unless through fear, and not being master of himself, could he go into the shop? The circumstance is very strong to show he was not master of his own mind, but acted through violence and compulsion, besides he has swore to you, that he did apprehend, at that time, the charge would cost him his life. If you believe that evidence, then it seems very clear, that Mr. Fielding acted under the immediate fear and terror, not only of a criminal punishment, but his life being in danger; but, if you should not be satisfied of that, it is not necessary in many cases, that the persons robbed should apprehend themselves in immediate danger. The case has occurred in highway robberies, where a soldier, or a sailor, has been attacked. I remember one where the gentleman that had been robbed said he had no fear of his life; but the judges held, and that has been received as the law ever since, that if such circumstances are made use of as would impose a terror and violence upon a reasonable mind, though the individual who is robbed might be so confident as not to apprehend danger, yet it constitutes a robbery, because it is taking money by violence. In that case, if you are not satisfied with what I mentioned as the first question, you will find the prisoner guilty.</p>
