                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 7, Charlotte-street, Tooley-street, Borough, in the parish of St. Olave. I am the house-keeper—I let out the top garret, and middle room, and occupy the lower part myself—I and my wife went out on Saturday evening, the 9th of April, between eight and nine o'clock—it was then dark—I believe the people who occupy the upper part of the house were at home—I left nobody in our apartment—my wife locked the door as she came out and took the key with her—when I came out of the house I observed Rearden and Fry near the house—Fry was within six or seven yards of the house—he is my wife's brother—I had employed him to work for me for five or six months, and he then lodged in my house—I discharged him about three months age—he knew my house very well—I am quite certain I saw him near my house that night when I went out, and I saw Rearden with him, and a third per<lb/>son, but I am not certain who that was—Rearden was about thirty-six feet from Fry—he was two arches off the Greenwich rail-road from him—the third person was further away—Rearden stood westward of Fry, and the other man was still more westward—he was double the distance—I returned home about ten o'clock with my wife—I found the padlock of the door had the staple drawn, the lock and staple were taken away, and the door left half open—I missed a box containing a suit of clothes, a blue cloth coat, a pair of new cloth trowsers, a waistcoat, a cloth cloak belonging to my wife, two merino gowns belonging to my wife, a silk shawl, two silk</p>

I know all the male prisoners—Fry and Rearden live near me at Earl's-court—I don't know where Castle lives—on Satur<lb/>day afternoon, about four o'clock, before I heard of the robbery, Fry, Rearden, and Castle, came up to me against the star and Garter, in Ken<lb/>sington—they asked me if I would take a walk with them as far as London-bridge—I told them I would if they would not be too late home at night—I went with them to London-bridge—when I got there they told me to stop there till they came back—I don't know where they went—we got to London-bridge about six o'clock, or a little after—I stopped there two hours, or better—they did not come back—I would not wait longer, and was returning home—when I got to St. Paul's, which was between eight and nine o'clock—I saw Rearden and Castle—they overtook me, and asked me where <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> was (meaning Fry)—I said I did not know—one of them went on one side of the street and the other on the other—I walked with Rearden, who had a small bundle under his arm—he had not got that bundle when he went from Kensington to the bridge—Castle had also a bundle—neither of them had those bundles when I walked with them to London-bridge—they were tied in coloured handkerchiefs—Rearden said to Castle, "You keep what you have, <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>, and I will keep what I have got"—Castle, crossed over to us—I went with them to the top of Sloane-street—I was then with Rearden—castle was on the other side—Rearden asked me if I was going that way, towards Brompton—I said, "No"—Castle went towards Brompton with him—Castle had asked me if I would take the bundle and carry it—I asked him what it was—he said he did not know, and I said I would not carry it—I went up Kensington-road, and turned up Church-street, into Uxbridge-road—I slept in a shed in a brick-field that night, and next morning I came down towards Hammersmith, about nine o'clock, and saw Fry and Rearden standing against the lamp-post, by Hammersmith-gate—they had each a bundle under their arms—Rearden's bundle was in a coloured handkerchief—Fry's was in a red silk handkerchief with a coloured border to it—Fry asked me where I went to last night—I told him—he told me he took an omnibus to come home first to let the others in—he told me that Castle went and broke M'Lin's house open, and Castle brought the box out under the archway, and broke it open, and he said there was a paper in the box, with red reading on it, which they burnt—he did not say what he had done with the other things—I afterwards saw Castle and his wife just down against the turning leading to their own house—the same morning—castle asked me where I went to last night—I said as they did not went me, I went and slept down in Langston's sand-house—Castle had on a blue cloth coat at that time, with brass buttons—he had a velveteen coat on the night before—the blue coat seemed too big for him—Fry had said on the Friday, that he should like to see somebody rob M'Lin—I am sure I did not go beyond the bridge with them that day.</p>

On Monday, the 18th of April, I left home about half-past ten o'clock in the evening—I left nobody in the lower part of the house—the doors were locked, the windows down, and the shutters closed, but not fastened—I went to a neighbour's, two or three doors from my house; and about half-past eleven o'clock, Michael Phillips called me from my neighbour's, and brought my bonnet in his hand—I went back with him, and found my shutters open, and the window up—I put my hand in at the window, and missed the property from the table; it had laid there exposed for sale—the table was close to the window—I missed prints and thirty-four yards of merino a shawl, two handkerchiefs, two pairs of drawers, and different articles—I went to Aldgate watch-house—Three-tun-alley, is not far from my house—I went and listened at the door of a house there—I have known Hyams by the name of Mitchell from his youth—I heard nobody's voice that I knew when I listened—I heard a person say, "There are gown pieces;" and I immedi<lb/>ately left, and went to Mr. Phillip's for assistance, and he ran to the police—the door of the house I listened at was open—I do not know how many voices there were—I afterwards saw Hyams come out of the house and go on—I do not know whether he saw me—he walked a-pace—I called to Phillips for assistance, and said, "There goes Mitchell!" which is the name I knew him by.</p>

On the 19th of April I was returning home about half-past one o'clock in the morning—when I came to porter-street, I met the two prisoners at the corner—they were standing at the corner of the street—I passed up on the left to my lodging, and they followed me up on the right—they did not speak to me when I passed them—when I got as far as Princes-court, the prisoner Ray crossed over, and left Wade on the other side—Ray followed me up to my own door—I was in the</p>

                  </hi>. I was acting as chairman at Clerkenwell Sessions, when Mr. Goodale made an appeal from the police-office. I took the greater part of Sheering's evidence in writing—there was no alteration that I did not take, if there had been, I should have put it down—I can un<lb/>dertake to say, that he said every thing I have down—they are the exact words (<hi rend="italic">referring to notes</hi>)—he first stated that he knew of the White Horse, public house, in Hare-street, Bethnal-green—that he was there on Sunday, the 22nd of November, then last past—that it was about three minutes before twelve o'clock when he arrived at the house—the door was shut—that he saw there two women and one man, who appeared to be drunk, desirous to get in, and that Mr. Goodale came and let them all in—that they drank at the bar, other persons being in the tap-room at that time—that he stopped there till half-past twelve o'clcok, having had something to drink during the time—whilst he was there twenty-seven other persons entered,</p>

               <p>and upon leaving the house he went to the parish church, where service was still going on—he was then cross-examined, and on a question put by the learned Counsel, he said the defendant did not ask for time to bring wit<lb/>nesses—he was asked how often he had been in that court—he stated more than I recollect—he said something about being brought up to the bar—he said he could not recollect whether he had ever been tried in that court—upon being further asked, he said, "I was charged with stealing a dead body"—he gave an answer which excited some surprise and laughter, but I did not take it down.</p>

I remember appearing at Worship-street, on a charge brought against me by Aaron Rawlings—I remember the state of my house on the morning of the 22nd of November, during church-time—I think I can distinctly recollect what Sheering swore against me at the office—when he got into the box, the Magistrate told him he was drunk—he said he was not, he had got a bad cold—the Magistrate said he was very drunk, and he would not hear his evidence—but Raw<lb/>ling stepped up and said, he had but one case, which would not last five minutes—and then he was put to his oath.</p>

On the 14th of April I was sent for to the prosecutor's house, and found the duplicate of a shawl and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the prisoner—I afterwards went to Blackmore's, a tailor, who lives a few doors off Petticoat-lane—I found him at work on his board—I asked if he knew any thing of Welsh—he hesitated at first—I told him I wanted some pawnbroker's tickets belonging to Welsh—he hesitated—I said, "What is that little box on the mantel-piece? Hand it down"—his wife then gave it to me—I looked at it—it contained seven or eight duplicates—I said, "Here are some of the duplicates in the name of Welch"—he then acknowledged knowing Welch—he said, "Part of the tickets belong to me and part to Welch"—I said, "I will read them over," and to state what were his and what were Welch's and to be cautious—he claimed a pair of trowsers and a shawl, which the prosecutor also claims—I went to the different pawnbrokers and found the property.</p>

On the 26th of April, I went to No. 3, Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, with Duck, Hall, and Ashton—the street-door being open, I pro<lb/>ceeded up-stairs to the second floor front room—that door being fast, I broke it open, and saw Mary Evans near the fire-place, and Amelis near the window—they seemed sadly confused at the moment, and one of them (I do not know which) said, "Oh, what do you want here?"—I took them into custody, and put them in one corner of the room—Ashton look charge of them—the window was open, and on the coping stone I found two pieces of metal, which were hot at the time—I produce them—on searching the fire-place with Hall I found a piece of metal under the grate—Hall poked the fire with a small poker, and I saw some metal run out of the fire—there was one piece of metal, and a piece of cinder with metal on it—I found some part of the metal before he raked the fire—this piece was lying down, and when he pocked the fire I saw more run out, which he picked up—I did not pick up any after he poked the fire.</p>

I accompanied Reynolds—I entered the room almost immediately after him, and saw him with the two prisoners at the further side of the room—Amelia was near the fire-place, and Mary bear the window—Amelia was the furthest from me—I went towards her, and she held out a shilling, and said, "This is what you want," I took it, and saw Reynolds pick up a piece of metal off the coping stone, outside the window—I found near the window a piece of an old handkerchief, which was quite hot at the time—on a shelf at the left hand side of the room I found a paper bag containing plaster of Paris—I said, "Here is the plaster"—Amelia said, "That is what we clean the place with"—I produce the good shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the police-office of Hatton-garden. I was with Reynolds and Ashton—I was in the street about a minute after they went in—there was just time for them to get up to the second floor—I observed the prisoner Mary at the window—she threw something out—it fell into the middle of the street, in the dirt and mud—I immediately picked it up—it felt quite hot—I found it to be a mould for shillings—it was broken, when it fell, into several pieces—I have it here in a box, and a shilling, which was lying close to it quite hot—I did not see the shilling thrown out—the mould came out of the window in pieces—I saw it in pieces before it struck the ground—I went up-stairs, and found on the table a small file, with white metal in the teeth of it—and near the table I found two pieces</p>

               <p>of a metal spoon—it was a very brisk coke fire—under the fire-place I found an old iron spoon with white metal in it, which is in it now—I searched Mary—she hesitated and requested I would get a woman to search her—but I ultimately put my hand through the pocket-hole of her gown and drew her pocket out—I found in it a counterfeit shilling in an unfinished state—I searched the other prisoner but found nothing on her—I examined her hands and found them dirty—I said in the hearing of both the prisoners that it was all right, for they had thrown the mould out of window, for I had picked it up—Amelia said she was sure they had thrown nothing out of the window—Amelia's hand smelt strong of metal—Mary's bands were black and dirty, and smelt strong of pewter-metal—there was something white in the palm of her left-hand which seemed to correspond with the plaster-of-pairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of Coin to His Majesty's Mint, and have been so nearly twenty years—the mould produced by the officer is made of plaster-of-Paris, and is intended for casting counterfeit shillings, and calculated for it—it has the impressions of both sides of a shilling on it, and appears to have been used for such a purpose—I believe it has been used; the obverse side is the deepest impression—the reverse is merely the surface—the two shillings produced by Duke are counterfeit—they are Britannia metal cast—I have applied one to the mould and it corresponds with it, and I believe it was made by it—I have fitted both of them to the mould—they correspond in all respects—the piece of white metal produced by the officer and some which is adhering to the cinders is of a similar description of metal to the counterfeit shilling—this spoon is also of the same kind of metal—here is an iron spoon which has the same kind of white metal adhering to it—it appears to have been in the fire—I cannot tell whether it was actually fused in this identical spoon—I have no doubt white metal has been fused in this spoon—here is a file which would be necessary to remove the surplus metal adhering to the coin after it is cast—there is the appearance of white metal in the teeth of this file now—here is a bag of plaster-of-Paris in powder of the same kind of material as the mould is composed of—the shilling produced by Ashton is a good one.</p>

                  </hi>. I know a boy of the name of Duncan, he was tried for this robbery at the White Horse, Fetter-lane. I had got a Key of the office—I could go in when I pleased—I had it about two days before the robbery—I knew Hagger, by working up the yard—I worked there, but Hagger had been turned out—he had been to help his father to clean the horses about eight days before the robbery—I went to Hagger's house, his father sent me there—I did not say any thing to Hagger—he asked me to take a walk, and I asked him how much money he had, and he told me had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, that was taken from the office—we were not talking about it—I asked him how much he got of the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody, at No.41, Wych-street, Strand, about a fortnight after the robbery, (last Sunday fortnight, the 24th of April)—I had a key, which I found behind the water<lb/>butt in the cellar, at No.41, Wych-street—that was the Key of the office at the White Horse—I told the prisoner I wanted him—he said, so he had heard—before I said any thing to him about the money he said, "I had none of the money"—I told him that I supposed he had heard all about it—he said "Yes"—I told him if he had anything to say, to say it before a Magistrate, not to say it to me, as perhaps it would be evidence against him—his father was sitting in the room at the time—he said no more till I was coming down Fleet-street—I asked him if he had seen Fallon, he said, "No"—I then said, "Fallon said that you had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money"—he said, "No, I had but 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so"—he said Duncan had brought the parcels and the Key to No. 41, Wych-street, to his house—that he was in bed—that Duncan opened the parcels and burnt the paper over the candle—he then went down into the cellar with Duncan, and Duncan put the money in a pot in the brick wall, and he himself had put the Key behind the water-butt—the next day, after being at the office, on taking him to the Compter, he said, "I did not tell Fallon that I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money, I had one sove<lb/>reign and two new shillings, which I took off the table myself," that was all he said, except that he had been into the country to look for employment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why did you begin to question him, was it that you might draw something out of him, after you told him not to say any thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I merely asked him if he saw Fallon, because Fallon said that he had not seen him at all—I was not alone, my brother officer was with me—he said he had not seen him—I asked him that question in the house as well as out—I said, Fallon says you had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money"—my fellow-officer's name is Nunns—I can give no reason why he is not here—he heard it—Fallon had told the Magistrate that the prisoner had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I took Fallon from the court here after the trial last sessions—he had been tried and acquitted—he was in custody after he gave his evidence—I saw Nunns this morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I know nothing about it—Fallon told me to go away—I told him I would not have any thing to do with it—he said he would, we should only get three months a-piece, and that would do us good.</p>
               <p>(John Smith, a boot-marker of Wych-street, and Mr. Greenwood, a whip<lb/>marker, of Wych-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman M</hi> 16.) I apprehended the prisoner on the 23rd of April, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, in a court in Woolpack-yard, Kent-street, Borough—I found her secreted in a cellar, after searching for her some time—there was no way of getting to the cellar without getting over a fence six feet high, or being lowered down out of a back-parlour window—I found a scaffold-rope there, by which she might have been let down—I asked her what brought her there—she said she had run away from her father, being afraid he would beat her, or something of that sort—this was not the house she lodged in, but an adjoining house—I searched her, but found nothing on her—she said her father's name was Collins, and he lived in the court; but I found no such person there—I was obliged to force down the fence to get her out—I told her the charge—she denied knowing any thing about the robbery, but acknowledged having lived at Mr. Riley's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. There were five or six open cellars for any body to go in. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. There is a little row of houses there, and the Kitchens are never occupied—the back part of the house is on a level with the bottom of the Kitchens, and fenced up—the top part of the house I found her in was occupied.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. Her husband used to give her six or seven shillings at the most, at a time; and she suspected her lodgers of robbing her—when I heard she and the policeman were looking out for somebody, I thought (having left her) she might suspect me for something her husband had robbed her of, and I was afraid, if I was put into the station-house, I should never come out of it in my life—there was a passage to get to the cellar—the policeman asked me if there was a passage, but I would not please him by giving him any information, and refused to tell him—I told him the house in the court I lived at, and he went to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothes salesman, and live in Monmouth-street. A person, in livery, brought the watch to me, on Friday, the 15th of April—I stopped it—I don't know the person—he was dressed in a green livery frock coat, with gold lace—was about twenty-five years of age to the best of my recollection—he ran out of the shop when I stopped the watch, and left it in my possession—I thought the man was five or six years older than the prisoner—I found he did not come back, and went to Marlborough-street and saw the Magistrate about it—the watch was given into Key's possession, and returned to me at the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Green Man, on Finchley-common. On Saturday, the 9th of April. I was standing outside my door, between six and seven o'clock, and observed a wagon coming down the hill from Lon<lb/>don, with four horses in it, and laden with sacks of soot—I did not see the driver at the time—I saw a lad lying down on the sacks in the wagen—the horses, in coming down the hill, got one of the traces unbooked—the lad at the top looked over the side, and attempted to get off, am I sup<lb/>posed, to hook the trace on—in doing so, he fell from the shaft to the ground—he did not attempt to jump off, but came along the sacks very carefully, and got down on the shaft of the wagon, and sat down there—he then gave a spring off, and missed his footing, I belive, and fell back<lb/>wards to the ground—the fore wheel ran over his leg—he gave a sudden twist, and put his head under the hind wheel, which went over his head and leg too—it killed him instantly—he never moved after—I had not seen the wagoner at that time—I saw him an hour or an hour and a half afterwards—I got George Collins to help me to take the deccassed into my house, and I went for Mr. White, the surgeon, who came in ten minutes—the deceased's head was squeezed quite flat—Mr. White put his had toge<lb/>ther and put his hat on to keep it in from—the leg was nearly served from his body—it hung by a small sinew—the wagon belonged to a Mr. Titmus—the driver passed about this time; but I was engaged with the deceased, and did not see him—the driver was not sober—he was certainly the worse for liquor—I saw him again that evening, and hour or two after<lb/>wards—I had not noticed him before; but the prisoner is the man who came back as the driver—he had been to put his team up.</p>

                  </hi> I am silk-mercer, and live in Pall-mall, in the parish of St. James's Westiminster. I live and sleep there—it is my dwelling-house—between four and five o'clock on Monday, the 18th of April, the two female prisoners came to my shop—I am confident they are the persons—I did not know them before—Lemaire produced a yard and a quarter of silk, and requested me to match it—they both spoke broken English, such as I could understand—I do not speak French my<lb/>self—I set Jerritt, my shopman, to match the silk, which he did—he cut them off a yard and a quarter, and it was delivered to them—I am not certain which of them produced the silk, they both spoke about it—it came to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Lemaire gave me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I went to my desk, in the frost shop, which was some distance from them, to get change—I gave them the change at the front shop counter, and they went away—the piece of silk produced by Hobbs, is my property—it was on the counter when they were there—about three quarters of an hour after they were gone, I saw my young man had forgotten to put up the yard and quarter of silk, which they had brought with that they had bought—I did not miss this piece of silk till twelve o'clock the following morning—there are fifty-nine yards—it is worth, at least, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—this is the piece they behind (looking at it.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. King. I saw the two female prisoners there on the 18th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon—they produced this piece of brown silk, and re<lb/>quested to have it matched—I found a match to it—I can swear positively to Lemaire being one of the persons, and to the best of my belief Nelston is the other—I gave them a yard and a quarter of silk to match theirs—I saw them give Mr. King some silver—he went into the front shop to get change—I was then at the front of the shop doing up the silk—that evening I found the piece of brown silk which they had brought to match—Mr. King missed the levender silk next morning while I was out—I am sure this silk is his property—Lemaire had on a black cloak, and Nelaton a mixture of flowers and green—I imagine the cloaks were large enough to conceal the silk.</p>

In consequence of information on this Sunday, I, in company with Fowler and others, went to the prosecutor's and got information from him, and went to apprehend the parties—I took the prisoner into custody about eight o'clock at night, in a lane going from the Orange-tree to Colney-hatch—he was in company with James Smith, whom I was looking for as well as him—I took them both into custody, and handcuffed them—I went into a beer-shop on the road to the watch-house, to apprehend some more—I got out of the cart-when I returned I found Page and Smith both gone—I re-appre<lb/>hended Page on the 17th of April, at Muswell-hill—I asked him what he had gone with the handcuffs, he said, they dropped off his hand—I told him I wanted him for the charge I had had him before, for shooting at Mr. Bacon's bailiff—I had told him what it was for, when I first apprehended him.</p>

On the morning of the 21st of April I went into my kitchen, and missed a boiler, and then a saucepan—I spent up to the prisoner who lodged in the house, as I thought she might have taken the boiler for her use—I went up with the policeman—the prisoner opened the door—she said, "I know what you are come for"—I stood a long time, and wished her to tell me where the property was—she would not, and I gave her in charge—she said she would fetch the boiler at night if I would let her go.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, residing at Chigwell in Essex. On Friday the 29th of April I had a number of sheep and lambs—on the Monday I missed six lambs—when I send lambs to market I mark them—I sent eight lambs to market—they were returned, and two of them were of the six that were lost—I came to Newgage-market on Monday—I afterwards went to Curnell's and found the skins of six lambs—there were two of the returned eight—I believe the other four were mine, being the same colour and fleece, and in every respect corresponding with the others—(Curnnell was tried and acquitted)—I afterwards saw Day—he was tried and convicted of receiving these six lambs, knowing them to have been stolen—after I and Kentish had seen Day, we went to the King Harry the Eighth public-house, in the Mile-end Road—the prisoner was ostler there—he was not there—I was walking up and down—Kentish found him, and I went in, and they were in conversation—I went to the prisoner and asked him if he had any knowledge of any lambs that had been stolen—he said, no, he had not—I said it was useless his denying it, I could tell him the name of the person that had them from him—I then said it was a man of the name of Day, who lived somewhere in Hoxton—he still persisted that he knew nothing of the lambs, nor of Day—the officer, Kentish, then said, "You must go along with us"—the landlord afterwards came out, and said to the prisoner, "You had better tell Mr. Walton the whole of it, but don't prejudice yourself at all, but tell the whole of it"—Kentish said, "What ever you say, I shall be obliged to give in evidence, therefore don't prejudice yourself"—the prisoner then said that he had them from Mr. Mason's wagoner or carman from Chigwell—Kentish brought him to the Compter.</p>

I told him that—I acquainted him, through courtesy, that his business should suffer no neglect—he then said to the prisoner, "John, if you have had any dealings with any lambs, confess the truth"—I told the prisoner that, whatever he might say, I should give in evidence against him—he then said, that the had them left by Mr. Mason's wagoner early on Saturday morning, who told him that he was to do the best he could with them—Mr. Walton had put some questions to the pri<lb/>soner—the public-house is in the direct road from Chigwell to Town.</p>

I received information when I was in Shoreditch, on Saturday, the 30th of April, and ran through Magpie-alley, towards Wheeler-street—I there saw the three prisoners in company together, walking very fast—I pursued them-when they got near the bottom of the street they began running—I pursued them through Spitalfields-market, and lost sight of them—I caught sight of them again by the Church, and ran towards them—I took Pearson and Smith, and my brother-officer took Moore—I observed Moore had some<lb/>thing under her shawl-we took them into the watch-house, and I said I wished them searched—Moore dropped this piece of print, and this shawl from under a shawl she had on—I said, "That is what I expected"—I took it up—after they were looked up, I inquired in Shoreditch, and found the property belonged to Mr. Webb.</p>

               <p>distress, owing to his wife's death—I gave him a shirt, a cravat, and stock<lb/>ings, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had no lodging, and I allowed him to asleep in my room that night—my bed is up stairs—he went away early in the morn<lb/>ing—I was to inquire for a place for him—he came again next night, about half past nine o'clock, and proposed to sleep there again—he had seen the plate the night before, in a drawer in a pantry—when he came the second night, I said I was afraid, if I should take him up-stairs, and master or any of the ladies came out of the drawing room, he would be seen—he said, if I had a bed down in the pantry, like old Keet, where we used to live, it would be very well—I said I would make him a temporary bed in the pan<lb/>try; which I did, and locked him in the pantry—I hung a pair of breeches on a chair, to keep a draught away from him—I took the principal part of the plate up stairs to bed with me—I got up about half past six o'clock, and found the pantry door broken open, and the cupboard door also, and he was gone—the chain of the hall door was down—I missed all the articles named in the indictment—they were all in the house the night before—I was the first person up in the morning—the prisoner never returned to me—I had information exactly a week afterwards, and went for an officer—we went to the place, and took him into custody—I told him he had acted in a most shameful manner towards me—he pleaded drunkenness until he got to the station-house—he affected to be drunk, and not to understand me at all—in consequence of information, I afterwards went to the Horse-Shoe, Titchborn-street, and there found Williams—I never saw him before—I asked him if he knew Atkinson—he said, "yes"—I said, "Will you come out?"—he said, "Are you the servant?"—I said, "No"—I had a reason for denying that—he asked me to come into the tap room, which I did and sat down with him—I began to question him how he thought Atkin<lb/>son would get on—he said, oh, he thought he would get on very well, if he had a counsel—he said, if his friends would come forwards together, he would draw up the brief himself, as he was good scholar, and that would be no expense; and he tole me that the property was deposited with Lord King's coachman, in a box in a stable, in St. James's-square—that At<lb/>kinson had told him so three or four times; and after talking, he wanted me to go there—he called Atkinson a b—y fool, because he had directed him to go to an old clothes shop, and buy a pair of old trowsers, and get the breeches off, as they were the only things they could convict him on; but instead off that, he went and got drunk with a woman named Kennedy, and spent all his money, and went and slept with her—I asked Williams if he thought I should get into trouble about it—he said, "No, you will not; if any body gets into a trouble about it, it shall myself, as I disposed of part of the property for him"—I asked him what he disposed of—he said, a toast rack, umbrella, pair of gaiters, shoes, decanters, and several other little things, and also a pair of boots, that (Atkinson's) had in his pocket, and one of the boots was stolen out of his (Atkinson) pocket while he went to sleep at a public-house in Air-street—I agreed to meet Williams next day at a public-house in Titchbourn-street, but he did not come—I went to his lodging in Cas<lb/>tle-street, and went with him to a coffee-shop—he said if I would come in there while he had his breakfast, he would tell me all about it—I went in, but he told me nothing particular more than before—talking about counsel, and how the money was to be raised, which was by subscriptions among their friends—he said about £2 would do it—we went from there to the public-house in Titchbourn-street, and I asked him there where the things</p>

I am foreman to Mr. William Emerson, a silk manu<lb/>facturer, living in Spital-square, On the 10th of March I delivered to Eliza Allen a cane of Adelaide warp, it weighed 31lbs. 60z.—I gave four lengthening bobbins—the shute silk was worth 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and ounce at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Emerson. I went to the house where Allen lived—I found about 9 1/4 yds. made, and 2lbs. odd of silk gone—Allen made a communication to me, and I took Sturin into custody—he told me what he had done with the silk, and in consequence of that I went to the prisoner's house with the officer, on the 9th of April—we found him at home—it is what we term a loombroker's shop, down below—I saw no articles of furniture for sale—a loombroker must necessarily be acquainted with the weaving trade—his house is in the neighbourhood where the weavers live—we told him what we came for—he said he had no objection at all to out searching—we went up-stairs and saw a quantity of rolls ticketed, which had no warp upon them—we searched about the place, and sixty-six empty bobbins were found, belonging to out factory, with the name of"Worland"on them, which was a stock that Mr. Emerson had purchased—I found a lengthen<lb/>ing bobbin—it had Adelaide silk on it—I found some white silk on a bobbin with "Worland" on it—the shop bobbins had been died black in July, and were rather remarkable—he said he bought the lengthening bobbins that had the Adelaid silk on them, with some other brokering things—I think he said a plush-box—I think he said he might have had it two years—I am sure he represented that he had had it some time—he was then taken.</p>

I was in Brick-lane, between four and five o'clock—I saw a cart with the name of Dale on it—there ap<lb/>peared to he two hogsheads of sugar in it; and at the tail was a bag about three parts full of what turned out to be sugar—the prisoner Reeves went to the tail of the cart, accompanied by Waterman—took the mouth of this bag over his left shoulder, and Waterman lifted it on his back; waterman then drove the cart on towards Spitalfields-church—Reeves went down Thrawl-street, and I followed him, with this bag of sugar on his back—he went into the private door of a coal-shed in Thrawl-street—I watched at the corner, and never lost sight of the house till a policeman, No. 118, came up—I told him what had happened, and he went after the cart—I watched the house for upwards of half an hour—dur<lb/>ing that time the female prisoner, Mary Ring, came and looked over the hatch of the door, three or four times at me; and likewise a girl that was in the shop came and looked at me—the policeman. No. 118, brought No. 40—I walked across the street to speak to him—the prisoner Reeves then came out of the shop, and ran down Thrawl-street—I called out, "That is the man, stop thief"—he followed him to the bottom—Evans and I returned to the house—the female prisoner refused to let the policeman enter, and wanted to know where his authority was—I said, "The man's coat is autho<lb/>rity enough, go in"—she was like a termagant—we took her to the Spital<lb/>fields station, and left Birch in possession of the house—we then returned, got a truck, and took the sugar away—I went the next morning over to Mr. Dale's yard, and there I saw Waterman—I said, "This is the carman who was with your cart yesterday"—Dale desired me to go for a policeman—I said there was no occasion, I would take care of him—I took him, and in going along I said to waterman, "Was not you in Brick-lane, Spitalfields yesterday, with two hogsheads of sugar?"—he said he was—I said, "where did you bring that bag from, that that man had in the cart"—he said he was in Ratcliff Highway, and a man asked him to give him a lift—I told him it was very wring to take any thing from strangers, and said, "Where were you going with those two hogsheads of sugar?"—he said, to take them to Dock—I said, "Who to?"—he said, "Mr. Tokely, I will show you"—we walked down to Dock-head, and went to Mr. Tokely's shop—I saw Mr. Tokely's young man behind the counter—I asked if the young man brought two hogsheads of sugar there yesterday—he said yes, was any thing the matter?—I said, "Nothing particular, but weigh them;—think you will find them 1cwt. short."</p>

                  </hi>, I am one of the mangers of the firm of John Healey Booth and two others, wholesale grocers, in Upper Thames-street—our stables are in Princes-street, close by Harrod's premises—our people, going to put up the horses at night have to go near his shop—Moran was in the employ of the firm in April as porter, and had been so seven or eight months—we have a cellar where goods are kept—in April we had a stock of currants in bags, weighing 1cwt. each—they were kept close to the loop hole door in the cellar, close to where the cart loads—Moran had to it busi<lb/>ness in the cellar when the last load was taken out—he had access to it as porter—it was part of his duty to assist in loading the cart—we had a man named George in our employ who was taken ill, and left, shortly after Moran came—he was a porter also—I heard nothing of this till I received a communication from the officers of the Thomas police—Warner and Moran were then both taken into custody, and sent to Giltspur-street pri<lb/>son on the 16th; and at six o'clock on Monday morning, the 18th, I re<lb/>ceived this letter from Giltspur-street, in consequence of which I went there and saw Moran—I showed him the letter, and stated its contents—he said he did not write it, nor was he the means of sending it—I asked him if it was his confession, and he said, "No"—in the course of conver<lb/>sation, I told him we had been robbed for a length of time—he said, he partly knew that George, who had lived there, had carried on a robbery for some time; and that he was coming from his work one evening, and a strange man, in the street tapped him on the shoulder, and took him into a public-house—they had some beer together, and he said that they could do some business together; and that George had often done business with the man; and he had thrown goods out of the loop-hole, and the man had taken them away—I afterwards saw Warner, and showed him the letter—we missed 1cwt. of currants, as soon as were apprised of the loss, on Tuesday, the 5th of April—we had taken stock on the 2nd.</p>

Fogg"—the parlour joins the shop—he said, "What is it for?" I suppose you heard that we searched your house the other day?"—he said, "Yes—I said, "Messrs. Booth and Ingledew have been robbed to a great extent, by their carman and warehouseman, of pepper, currants, and many things, and you have been receiving them"—he said, "Oh, consider my wife and family, what am I to do"?come up-stairs and see my wife, she is in bed"—I said, "You may go up and see your wife, but I cannot assist you, you must to with me"—when he got up-stairs he said, "Oh, what am I to do? can't you settle this thing?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Such</p>

I generally work for a person in Norton-street—on the 6th of May I was in Oxford-street—I crossed by the side of the Pantheon, nearest the Blenheim-steps—I was not sober—when I was in the road I looking at my watch to see the time, and it was seventeen minutes past ten o'clock—I re<lb/>turned it to my fob, and finding I had taken a little more than I ought, I went between Marker-street and John-street, and called a cab—it came, and in getting into in I missed my footing, and fell down and hurt my thigh and my arm—the male prisoner was called by the boy who had the cab to come and help me in—the boy is not here, he was taken to the office and discharged (as he never had the property) to attend on the second examination—the prisoner then assisted me to get in, and the policeman likewise, but the prisoner was there precious to the policeman coming up—they got me into cab—before sitting down I put my hand to my fob, and said, "I am robbed, policeman came up and took the prisoner—the property was traces, and I identified it at the pawnbroker's</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. Cuberson of Oxford-road, I was coming along Oxford-road, and saw the cab standing against the curb-stone, and Mr. Lee attempting to get in—he slipped once, and could not get in—he tried second time, he then could not get in—he tried a third time, he then fell down, and laid under the horse's head—gentleman came, and tried to take him up by the arm—he found he was too heavy, and then he called. "Tom" (meaning the male prisoner) to help him—the prisoner was standing against the coach rank—he assisted the other man to get him up—he put his right hand on the prosecutor's watch and seals, and his left hand under his arm-pit, and assisted in getting him up—when they had got him up, the policeman Sumpter came, and asked what was the matter—the prisoner said, "The gentleman has slipped in attempting to get into the cab; "and then the man who first took hold of his arm left go, and went round to the other side where he had been before; and the police<lb/>man took hold of the prosecutor's left arm—they succeeded in getting his foot on the step, and kept behind him as much as they could to get him up—the prisoner still kept his hand on his seals, and when he got his left foot on the step of the cap, he said, "Now I will lift you in, and as he lifted him in with his left hand, he took the watch with the right—I saw it distinctly—I saw the chain and seals—the male prisoner then went round to a man who was standing with a whip—(he was not the driver, we have found out since) and he offered the watch to him, but he would not take it—he told him to give it to Jack,—I think I should know Jack if I saw him again—he was short man, standing with a frock coat on—the prisoner then went to Jack, and shoved it into his hand, and told him to cut away, and see whether his horse had done his feed, of something to that effect—Jack then went away, but he did not go to any cab or coach—he ran between two coaches, and then came back again, as though he was coming back and then ran through two more coaches to a public-house, and darted through that public-house—I then came back, and the police<lb/>man was there, talking to the male prisoner—the prisoner said to me, "What did you want when you followed the man round the cab?"—he then said to me, "Cut off"—I said, "Very Well, I will"—I then went into my master's shop—there was a <hi rend="italic">parleying</hi> then, and I told my master's son of it—he told me to go and tell of it—I went out, and the sergeant had taken the prisoner on suspicion—I ran after them, and told the sergeant that the prisoner was the man that had taken it—I then said that I saw where the man went with the watch—we went to the publican, and he said so many went through, that he could not tell who it was, but he thought he recollected a man who went through at that time.</p>

I am managing clerk to Mr. Thomas key, He keeps the Island Mills, by the New Cut—it is a manufactory for shop and pipe-lead—on the 12th of April we had three hundred pigs of lead, with the name Wm. Blackett sunk in on the bottom of them—that denoted the mine—there was a small peculiar mark on them, which I had never observed on any before—it was on the end of each pig—on the 13th I missed two—we buy about four tons of lead a week of Phillips who car<lb/>ries on business in the Whitechapel-Road; which is about a mile and a half from Limehouse, where our place is—we received a large quantity of lead, from Mr. Phillips on the 22nd of April—I was present when it was turned out and weighed—I observed among it some pieces of pig-lead, which attracted my attention—I put the pieces together—they formed two entire pigs within 10lbs. or 12lbs.—one pig weighs about 1 1/4 cwt.—there was no name on the pigs—it was all beaten out—there was the appearance of something having been beaten out—there was a small mark at the end of every pig that we put on—on two of the end pigs, there was one small mark—it was the particular mark that on the three hundred pigs—Bromley is in Phillips's employ—I sent for the prisoner on the 24th, and he came on the Monday following—I threatened to send an officer if he did not come—I met him at Phillips's on Monday morning—he came to the mills at the time appointed, and I showed him these pieces of lead—I told him I had received these pieces among a quantity of old lead, from Phillips's shop, and asked him if he knew any thing of them—he said, "No" I asked him to meet me at Mr. Phillips's, which he did; I asked Phillips, in the presence of Bromley and Levy, whether he had bought these piece of lead that he had sent to me of Mr. Levy,—he told me, "Yes"—Levy said he did not sell them to him—this is the lead—I have no doubt it is my master's—it is worth between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are the marks upon it—the name of Blackett is beaten out—when these pieces are made up they almost make up a whole pig within 10lbs. or 12lbs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of Dr. Abraham Lamert, who carried on business at No. 10, Church-street, Spitalfields. He was a patent medicine vender—the prisoner came into his employ about four years since—he was clerk and assistant—he was authorized to receive money for medicines that were sold, and to make proper entries of them in the book—there was a day-book kept to enter money received from customers for goods sent out, or medicines sold—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">looking</hi> at one)in which I have always seen the accounts entered—my husband died on the 4th of March, 18936—on the 19th of May. 1835, I left London, and joined him in Dublin, and continued with him until his death—I am his administratrix—the prisoner has not accounted to me, independently of the day book, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., received from Zaccheus Hunter, on the 9th of July, 1835; nor for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Alfred Willoughby, on the 22nd of August, 1835—he has never accounted for or paid me the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received on the 19th of October, from Mr. James Knight—two days before my husband's death I authorized my son, Joseph Lamert to obtain the prisoner's account from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This is the book in which the accounts were kept, and in which you have always seen the accounts entered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the book that was given to me by my son since I returned home—it it the book that was taken from the prisoner when I authorized my son to take the books from him—it is the book I was to have had the accounts kept in, after my departure from London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is your first answer a true one, that this is the book in which you have always seen the accounts entered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the book that was given to the prisoner to keep his accounts in after my departure—I might certainly have said that I saw it—that book was given to keep accounts in after my departure from London—I could not swear that I saw accounts entered in it, because it was given to keep the accounts in after I left London—I could have no motive in swearing it—there has been and examination before the Court of Bankruptcy with respect to my husband's effects, and the prisoner was examined as a witnesses—My husband became a bankrupt in November 1834—I remember after Gore's giving his evi<lb/>dence his being sent with a messenger to take possession of some secreted goods, of which he had made a discovery—they were my son's—this might have been a fortnight or three weeks before he was apprehended—I think it was as long as that—after Gore's evidence there was a write for 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. issued against my son Samual, at the instance of the assignees—I saw Samuel a fortnight ago—he is travelling—I do not know where he is—he set out after Gore's evidence—I do not know any thing about the writ—I have heard of it—he set out after the information I had about the writ—I got this book from my son, Joseph Lamert—I put the greatest confidence in my sons, both before and after mu husband's death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, with respect to those sons, did you not invoke your vengeance, and God Almighty's vengeance upon their heads? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect that I have—I cannot swear that I have not—no recollec<lb/>tion.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183605090214"/>
               <p>I received a letter from the prisoner at the bar, (indeed, more than one or two). saving that my sons were the greatest enemies I had, and he so set the mind of the father and against them, that I believe I repbied with irritated feeling, being incensed at such disobidient conduct—all the letters I had at my husbands's death, I delivered over to my sons—I had destroyed several—the prisoner wrote me a letter, saying that one son would take the bed from under me, and the other acted very badly; and the letter I wrote denouncing my children, was in consequence of a letter of Gore's—I am the mother of these sons—the letter I received was in great cause the reason of my writing as I did; and it was in consequence of my eldest son getting married and his father being too ill to come to his marriage, which was one cause of setting me against him—Mr. Gore's letter and my son's marriage, and little family affairs, was the cause of my being alienated from my sons—the two brothers were not friends for some time—it was not to prejudice the Jury that I said it was Goer's letter that alienated me from my sons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not the cause still kept back purposely by you from the Jury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoners's letter and my son's marriage without the consent of his father, and little family matters were the cause of it—there might be other causes with the father—to the best of my belief these are the causes with myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not in consequence of a letter from your son, Sarswel Lamet, written with his own hand to you to Dublin, that you did it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Indeed it was not—I do not recollect ever receiving such a letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if you wrote to Gore that you had received a latter from your son Samuel, and that while breath remained in your frame the character of its contents would never be erased from your memory—is that true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I did—I do not know whether the sight of my own letter has brought it to my remembrance—I did write that letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I heard at the Magistrate's of letters being burnt belonging to Gore—I heard Joseph swear before the Magistrate that be burnt some—I was not paying any attention to what he said—I cannot tell what letters my son said he burnt—I did not think this letter was burnt, when I said I was paying no attention—I cannot tell what letters were burnt—I did not hear from Joseph that he had burnt some letters I had written to Gore—I heard Joseph say he had burnt some letters in Gore's possession, but I do not know what they were—that was before Gore was taken into custody—he did not tell me he had burnt papers as well as letters—he said they were letters from patients to his father, and different things, and as there was going to be a sale on the premises, be thought they had better be burnt—I cannot tell when I wrote the letter to Gore, denouncing my children—it was in August, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not what you considered the base conduct of Samuel, in a letter from himself, that caused you to write that letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect any letter from him—I know the letter from the prisoner was the great means—Samuel's letter and the prisoner's together might have caused my denouncing him—I do not recollect the contents of my son's letter now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say, that while breath animated your frame the cha<lb/>racter of Samuel's letter would never be erased—that to all the world you would show the infamous manner in which he threatened to reduce to the street his unfortunate parents—but that you never would acknowledge yourself a parent to such an unnatural tiend—did not forget that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say to Gore "He says, if I do not remit 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by</p>

               <p>return of post, that without any further notice, he will sell off all our furni<lb/>ture to pay himself"—did you forget that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I acknow<lb/>ledge having received a letter from my son—my sons were continually threatening to sell me up, if I did not repay the money we owed—Samuel threatened to come to the house and take the property by force, and sell it—both might have done so—I say Samuel, I did not mean to exclude Joseph—they might have both done it—I do not know—I did give Gore directions, if he dared to enter his father's house, or to touch any article, to eject him by law immediately. Dr. lamer's affairs were in a very bad state—I do not know that Miss Blits, the housekeeper, was obliged to pawn her clother, to support the current expenses of the household—she showed me the duplicates, but she did not say it was to pay the household expenses—I do not know whether it was for the household expenses or herself—I never told the prisoner to keep money which he had received to pay up the arrears of his salary, which the embarrassed state of the firm would not enable me to do—it might be so, but I do not remember it—all monies that he was authorized to receive in the shop business, he was desired by my late husband to enter in the book—he always wrote that he did not get money enough to pay up the arrears of his salary—I have sent him money, not to pay other per<lb/>same but I have to pay Miss Bilts—I have not written to the prisoner to shot up the house, and to sell the things, that I recollect—the furniture was to be left in the house—the furniture was not mine—I do not know of his removing any property—I do not know whether it was the custom of my husband and the prisoner to pot down on bits of paper, the sums they received in town and country, and at certain chronological times to enter them in the book—I travelled with my husband, he kept a book, but he past down person's names and residences on papers—he might have put down suns he received also—I cannot swear that he did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there nothing removed before the bankruptcy from your hus<lb/>band's house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ten or eleven months age, Dr. Lamert gave to his son ten or twelve very old chairs, a table, and a few little things; these things were seined at my son's house; and the gentleman of the Court came down, and went through all our house—a great many things were pointed out by Mr. Gore that did not belong to us—on looking over the inventory, they were all there—they came back and searched my trunk—the prisoner said I had a box of jewels; and all they found in my trunk, was a little locket and some seals—Gore has been three or four years in the employment of my husband—these letters are all in my own hand-writing (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

               <p>eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came with a Greenwich pri<lb/>soner to buy a waistcoat—there was a woman in the shop when they came in—there were four handkerchiefs pinned up, and just as the woman left the shop I saw them drop from the gown to which they were pinned—asked the prisoner to pick them up, and when he did so there were only two instead of four—"Bless me. "said I, "there were four—I pinned them up just this minute"—he said the woman that woman that went out of the shop took them—I called my mother from the other side of the way, and went out to fetch the woman—I came back presently, and my mother said she did not believe it was the woman who had the handkerchiefs, but it was this boy, and he had got something else as well—he was just then gone out—the college-man had been trying on waistcoats, and the prisoner had been hold<lb/>ing his clothes the while—I looked on the counter and missed a pair of half-boots, marked No. 3—I then went after the prisoner and the college man—I saw the college-man and spoke to him, and he brought the prisoner to my shop the next day—I gave him in charge—he had one of my hand<lb/>kerchiefs round his neck, the other in his trowsers, and he had to him the duplicate of my boots.</p>

I had heard of Spiers's robbey—I was on duty in Clapham-road on the 16th of April, and saw the prisoners on Clapham-rise together, and having the description of the two men from Plummer, the moment I saw them I walked by them and watched their manceuvres for a considerable time—I then went home and put on my plain clothes and called Plummer, who lived close by me, and came to the spot near where I had seen them before—they had been there for an hour and a half—I sent Plummer on first, and then I went up and took them into custody on suspicion of being the two men, on the Rise, and took them to Clapham station-house—I searched them, and on West found pocket-book, a silk handkerchief, three half-pence, and a penknife—on Loscombe I found a silk handkerchief, a skeleton-key, two latch<lb/>keys, a snuff-box, a tabacco-box, and a chisel—he said the skeleton-key was the key belonging to his residence, and the latch-keys belonged to his door at No.36, New-street, Lambeth—I went to the house, but could not open the door with the skeleton key—the latch-key I could open it with, with difficulty, but it was not made for that latch, for the latch was a square one, and this is not a square—one of them does not fit at all—I took Loscombe's hat off and felt round it, thinking there might be something in the lining, but there was nothing in it—I put it down close by the side of him, and am sure there was nothing in it then—I took a black silk handkerchief off his neck and searched that, and put that in his hat, or close to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was at the station-house when Stephenson brought the prisoner in—I recollect his searching them perfectly well—I saw Loscombe'ss hat taken off—it was placed on a box close by his side—a person in the room took up the hat—I immediately took charge to it, and there were six skeleton keys in it—that might he minutes after it was first put down—they were tied up in a small piece of calico—I went to the prosecutor's house, and tried the whole of the key and the smallest of the six undid his door very easily indeed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. One Sunday morning some weeks previous to this, (I forget the date,) I saw West in the New Cut, Lambeth—I saw him go into a house at the corner of Isabella-street, and Gibson-street—it was before the 12th of April—I went to that house on the 16th after coming from Union-hall, and having a list of the property lost with me, I searched, and in a small box I found this small seed on the first-floor front room—I shewed it to Mr. Spiers—he described the seal he had lost to me before I showed it to him.</p>

               <p>Loscombe's Defence. I went on this day to see my brother, who lives in a gentleman's service in Clapham-road—there was a trotting match, and we stopped to see it, but it did not come on—we went to the Larkhall public-house and had some dinner—I did not go that way again till Wed<lb/>nesday or Thursday, I am not sure which—I did not see my brother then, and went again on Saturday—I have two lodgers, and each have a key.</p>

Oh, Claridge, why did you not stop me? I am done it—I am done it—I am done it"—(Mrs. Haggerstone had washed for Claridge)—when he said he had done it, he said, "The devil was with me while I done it—my husband did not hear all this, he was gone to work—he works on the rail-read, and is obliged to go to work on Sunday morning—this was about twelve o'clock in the day—it was at one o'clock in the day on Sunday that he said, "The devil was with me when I done it, &amp;c." and he said it when in bed that night, before he got up—I swoke my husband, and told him of it—my husband always went to work on Sunday morning to repair the new rail-road, because it is out of order—there are six of them at work there on Sunday—it was before the people came to arouse the prisoner that he used the expressions—before Green or any body came, and told him what was done—that is true.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon living at Merton. I was called on to examine the body of Mrs. Haggerstone on Sunday morning, the 17th of April, about half-past two o'clock at the White Hart—at that time I only made an external examination—it appeared that she had been dead above an hour—there was the appearance of a blow on the right side of her face, and a great deal of swelling—I did not consider it possible at that time to ascertain how those appearance had been produced—when the swelling had subsided there appeared indentations of knuckles—it was by candle-lights that I first saw the body, which is the reason I could not decide then—I thought all the external appearance of the body were those I should have expected to have found in a person who had been drowned—I observed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183605090250"/>
               <p>scratches about the legs and thighs, both interior and posterior—they appeared to have been made by brambles and thorn s—they were scratches of that description—I afterwards made a more minute examination and opened the body by the Coroner's directions on Wednesday—the immediate cause of death was in my opinion from suffocation by drowning—there was no appearance whatever of external violence on the head—on each outer side of the wrist there was the appearance of blows, I think those blows were produced before death, I think they could not be caused by falling down the well—it was a very deep well—I should think twelve feet deep and three feet wide—there was some bar in the well against which she must have rested at first—I think it very likely she might he bruised by going against the sides of the well—there were many appearances of blows on the back—I think they might be cause by falling down the well against the bar—I am informed the well was formerly a pump and some bars remain across the well against which she must have rested—there were a few scratches on her arms—I think the scratches in the interior of the thighs were produced by bram<lb/>bles, and I should say prior to death—I examined the organs of generation at the post mortem examination on Wednesday—there appeared to have been recent excitement of those parts but nothing conclusive—I think there was no appearance of force on those parts, nor any laceration, nothing of the kind—I should think it most difficult to ascertain that point, and it was the opinion of three surgeons with me—the excitement I allude to might have been produced in other ways also—there was the appearance of a blow below the groin near the parts of generation—it appeared to me to have been produced in the same way as the below on the face, with the knuckles, although there was not indentation, there was the same lividness parts of it—we divided the integument of the brain—there appeared nine or ten portions of extravagated blood as if that had been produced by blows—the immediate cause of death was suffocation from drowning—I have not the least hesitation about it—the blow on the head might have produced very serious symptoms had she not been put into the well.</p>

I am the natural son of the late Mr. William Surman Chambers—I was in the habit of visiting him—I lived in one of his house—he had ten houses in Whitehorse-street, Lambeth—he lived at No. 20—I was acquainted with his articles of furniture—I was at the house two or three times every day, for about twelve or eighteen months, till he went into the country, which was in July, 1834, and he died on the 17th of September following—this carpet was down in his frosst room tip-stairs, which was the room he occupied—about a month before he left, he directed me to take this carpet up, beat it, and fold it up, and put it is the black-room, on the same floor, and I did so before he left—the prisoner lodged in the lower part of the house, and paid the rent to my father—my father generally slept in the front room, and made use of the back-room as a sitting-room—he had no servant—the prisoner occupied two rooms on the ground-floor, and the kitchen—I saw him on the 6th of October following—I went into the back-room, and saw this curpet is the same place as I had placed it in before my father went into the country—I picked the key up in the front room, and the prisoner went in and unlocked the door, and I then saw the carpet there—on the 2nd of May, last, I went with Mr. Bedford to the prisoner's house, in Mason-street, and saw the carpet in an empty top room, wrapped up—we asked the prisoner to allow us permission to see what furniture he had, as we believed he had some belonging to the late Mr. Chambers—he said he had not any belonging to him—I afterwards found the carpet, which I am positive was my father's property.</p>

On the morning of the 11th of April, I was in Guildford-street, Southwark, and saw a boy assisting the prisoner with a bag on his back—I went towards them—the prisoner threw the bag down and ran away—I pursued and brought him back—I looked into the bag, and saw it contained this iron which I now produce—also some iron rollers and other iron—I asked where he brought it from—he said he had taken it or picked it up (I am not certain which) from Bankside—this was at eight o'clock in the morning as near as could be—he told me he was going to sell it either in the Mint or in the Borough—Mr. Sutton came up while I was standing along-side the prosecutor's barge, and said, "This fencing was torn from the front of my house"—I walked up to Mr. Sutton's, and found the rails had been torn out, and the iron fencing corresponded in colour and size, with the pieces of bars in the bag—this iron roller was in the bag, and I found some similar to this on board the barge, which is Mr. Chantler's, and was about 100 yards from Mr. Sutton's railings.</p>
