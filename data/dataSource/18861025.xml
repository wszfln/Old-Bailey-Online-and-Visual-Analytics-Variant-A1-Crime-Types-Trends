On 17th September, about 2.30, I was with Dockrell in Shaftesbury Avenue, Seven Dials, and saw Crepin speaking to a man whom I had been keeping observation on for several months—I then saw both prisoners go through Endell Street into Long Acre—Dockrell and I followed them—they went across Lincoln's Inn Fields, and through Chancery Lane to Fleet Street, where Crepin went into No. 98, the office of the <hi rend="italic">Cyclist</hi> newspaper, while Longman stood at the corner of Fleet Street and Farringdon Street, where Crepin joined him—they went across the Meat Market to Chiswell Street and Finsbury Square, where Crepin went to a turning to a place of convenience—as he came back he threw a look over the railings of Finsbury Square—he then went to an eating-house in Chiswell Street, where Longman had gone, for they came out together in about 20 minutes, and we followed them to Broad Street Railway-station, where they stood in conversation about a minute, and Longman crossed over to the door step of 4, Broad Street Buildings, while Crepin went into the railway-station and upstairs to the platform—we followed him; he remained there five minutes, first looking at the bookstall and then at the refreshment-bar—he took some<lb/>thing from his right waistcoat pocket, looked at it, and went into the refreshment-bar by one door, and Dockrell went in at the other door and spoke to a barmaid—Crepin called for a glass of stout and drank it—I stopped him at the door and said, "I am a police officer" (I was in plain clothes), "and shall search you; I believe you have counterfeit coin in your possession"—he made no reply—I searched him, and found in his right-hand trousers pocket this counterfeit shilling, four pence, and three half railway tickets—I said, "This is a bad one"—he said, "I did not know that"—I left him in charge of some railway officials, and went down to the doorway where Longman was and said, "I am a police officer, I am going to take you to the station and search you, your friend is there"—he made no reply, and Dockrell came up and took held of his right arm—his right hand was in his trousers pocket—we pulled him out of the doorway—he then drew his hand out of his pocket and appeared to throw something behind him—Dockrell said, "There it is, he has thrown it away"—I picked up this package containing two bad shillings wrapped up separately, and a bad half-crown</p>

               <p>in another piece of paper, a portion of the <hi rend="italic">Cyclist</hi> newspaper—he said, "Who saw me throw it away?"—I said, "I did"—he said, "This is <hi rend="italic">Brummagem</hi>, or did you bring it with you?"—that means telling a falsehood—he said, "Good God, this will kill my wife, I <hi rend="italic">did not ought</hi> to mix in such company"—I took him to the station—Crepin said, "I can easily account for mine, I changed a two-shilling piece at a shop, I can take you there"—I bought this copy of the <hi rend="italic">Cyclist</hi> at the office (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk of the Tavistock Hotel, Covent Garden—the prisoner arrived there on Friday, 1st October—I was not present when he arrived, but I was when he left on the Saturday, about 7 p.m.—he came downstairs with a bag in his hand and a coat over his arm, and as is customary the hall porter asked him for his key—it is the practice at our hotel, as soon as the visitor is allotted his bedroom, to be supplied with a key of that room—it is also the practice for visitors to write their names in the book—it is the hall porter's duty to ask for the key—when the prisoner was asked for his he said he had not got one—he then asked him if he had left it upstairs in his room—the prisoner said, "You never gave me one"—the porter said, "How did you get into your room? you must have left it upstairs"—the prisoner said, "I presume I must, "and went out to a cab which was waiting for him, and drove off—I then sent Draper, the chamberlain, upstairs to see if the key was there—he came down and made a communication to me, in consequence of which I told him to follow the cab as quick as he could on foot, and shortly afterwards he returned with this key in his hand and made a communication to me—this is the key of room No. 51, which the prisoner occupied—a few days afterwards Sergeant, Wright brought a bundle of keys to me, and I picked out this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as the property of the hotel—all our locks are supplied by Hobbs and Co., and a different key fits each door—the top and bottom wards of this key have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188610250018"/>
               <p>been filed away, and the number also—I was not able to see to which door it belonged, Messrs. Hobbs's manager did that—we have lost one key within the last three months.</p>
               <p>

I live at 9, Fitzroy Street—the prisoner came to lodge with me it may have been at the end of May, and left on Sep<lb/>tember 11th—Dr. Balkwill attended him there—he met with the accident before he came to my house, and he was continuously resident there—he treated himself at first before the doctor came—he was at home and confined to the house almost all the time he was there till within a week or two before he left, and then he walked with a stick—he lived in the name of Croon.</p>

I live at 64, Upper Berkeley Street, and let lodgings there—on Friday, 20th August, between 12 and 1 o'clock, the two prisoners came together, and Vachell said he came from Boston, America—I asked if Judge Moulton recommended them to me—he said "I don't know him personally, but I know his nephew"—they left, and returned I think together, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, bringing a small portmanteau and a leather hat-box—Vachell had taken my dining-room and bedroom in the morning, and said he was going to the station to get his luggage—when they came about 5 o'clock Captain Culhane, which was the name Vachell gave, said they would require dinner at 6 o'clock, and they remained and dined at 6 o'clock—while they were at dinner Mr. Fryer came with the clock and candelabra—after he had gone Vachell said to me in Levine's presence that he had bought some presents, pointing to the cupids, and the clock, and the candelabra, and that he was going to send them to America, as some one was going to be married; and I think he said he thought he would go and pack them that night and send them by the ship they came over to England in—I think he said "we" came over in—Levine did not contradict it—they left about 7 o'clock, telling my servant they were going to the theatre—Levine went first in a cab, which came to the house, and then Vachell went away on foot—the things were taken away from the house; I did not see them taken—I saw no more of the prisoners till I saw them at the police-court—on the 28th a constable opened the portmanteau and hat-box in my presence—there was no clothing in them, but a lot of old newspapers, boots, and wood, and waste paper.</p>

"Do you think these will do for Judge Moulton? as I want them for him; if you think he will be pleased I will "have them, but you will have to make them pounds instead of guineas"—Levine said, "Well, I thought you did not intend giving more than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Culhane said, "Well, if you think they will do we will have them"—he said, "Yes, I think so"—I said, "Well, the things are not perfect, you had better let us have them back to put right"—one of the pins was missing in the pendulum of the clock—he said, "Subject to my friend's approval of them this evening, if you like to send for them to-morrow morning at 9 you can have them"—on that he went to a side table and wrote out this cheque—I said, "We don't know you, who are your New York bankers? what bankers have you there?"—he said, "I will satisfy you on that point," and he handed me this note of credit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am salesman to Mr. Frederick Lawrence, who trades as Lawrence and Co., at 111, New Bond Street, as dealer in works of fine art—on 13th September, between 6.30 and 7 o'clock, Vachell called, and gave the name of Howard, and said he wanted something for a wedding present—he selected a clock, value 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he wanted packed and delivered at 8, Welbeck Street to show his cousin—I went that evening with the clock to 8, Welbeck Street, where I saw Vachell and another man—I showed the clock; Vachell asked the other man if it would suit—he said yes—they were sitting at the same dining-table together; they asked me to wait a few minutes, and I saw Vachell write this cheque—after I had received it I left the clock and came away—I parted with the clock believing the cheque was genuine—the cheque was afterwards paid into my master's account, and returned marked "No account"—I do not identify Levine.</p>

My husband, Robert Hughes, is the landlord of 84, Buckingham Palace Road—he is a servant, and was in Scotland on this evening—I was in the back kitchen, and heard my niece scream "Oh, aunt, that boy is setting the curtains on fire"—I went into the front kitchen, and saw the curtain in a blaze—I tore it down, and sent for a constable—the curtain was worth about five shillings; it was not all consumed.</p>

I live at 15, Chapel Place, Belgrave Square; I am a charwoman—on Thursday night, 26th August, at half-past 10 o'clock, I was in Park Lane—I there got into conversation with the witness Brown, a butler; he came and spoke to me in the street—I had seen him before, I knew who he was—I chatted with him, and we went into the park and sat down on a seat—we were not there five minutes, no impropriety whatever took place between us, when the prisoner came up, he was in plain clothes—he said he was a detective from Scotland Yard, he said we were acting indecently, that Brown was disarranging my clothes—I said there was nothing of the kind—he said, "Well, I don't wish to give you in charge"—Brown said he could do as he pleased—the prisoner said, "If you go about till it is 4 o'clock in the morning I shall follow you"—Brown said, "Very well, then I will give you a walk"—the prisoner demanded our names and addresses—Brown gave his correct name and address, "Ellis Brown, 31, Grosvenor Square," that was his master's house—I gave my correct name, "Julia Cormack,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188610250035"/>
               <p>and my address as "15, Chapel Place, Belgrave Square," but I do not think he put that down—he had a book, and he appeared to write some<lb/>thing in a book; I think it was a larger one than that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we went through the park up to the Marble Arch, the prisoner following us about a yard behind; he said he would continue following us—Brown turned round on him and said he could do what he pleased, he did not care whether he was a detective or not, he had done nothing to be ashamed of—Brown then took me into 31, Grosvenor Square to avoid him—the housemaids were there, but I think not the family—the prisoner was outside; he rang the bell eight or nine times, and he put his foot in the door as we went in to prevent the door being shut—he rang about eight times—Brown answered it, he did not answer all the rings—we were in the house altogether about an hour and a half, looking out of the window; we could not see him, it was a dark spot—after that time we came out—we saw nothing of the prisoner—we walked along together as far as Stanhope Street, we then parted—about two minutes after Brown had left me the prisoner came across to me—he said, "You have kept me waiting a long time, what are you going to give me for my trouble?"—I said, "I will give you nothing"—he said, "Then you come with me to Vine Street"—I told him I would do so—as we went along we met a policeman in uniform—the prisoner said to him, "I demand this woman's name and address"—I told the policeman I would not give it him any more because he had already got it, but I would give it to him (the policeman), and I did give him my correct name and address—the policeman then said to the prisoner, "Show me your authority for being a detective from Scotland Yard"—the prisoner called him a b—fool to ask for such a thing—the policeman called another policeman from the opposite direction and said, "We had better take him to Vine Street, and take the woman as well"—we went to Vine Street—the inspector asked me if I would charge him with accosting me; I said "No"—he was detained—I heard no more of it till I was summoned to appear at Maryborough Street to give evidence against him some time afterwards.</p>

               <p>been in the park before that night; I know it—the Marble Arch is about a quarter of an hour's walk from Stanhope Gate to walk moderate—we were sitting on the seats in the park when the prisoner asked for our names and addresses—I gave my correct name then, but at 31, Grosvenor Square I gave the name of Brown on the doorstep, because I was so annoyed—I have not had any conversation with Brown since I was before the Magistrate, for he went away to the Isle of Wight the next day, and he was subpoenaed here yesterday, and I was not allowed to speak to him—I have not had any conversation with Constable Howick with regard to the case—when the prisoner came up to me after Brown left me, the words he used were "You have kept me waiting a long time, what are you going to give me for my trouble?"—I told the Magistrate what he said—I was alarmed when he kept continually following me—we went into the house to avoid him—it was in Mayfair that the prisoner asked the constable to take my name and address—there was a little short man there at the time; he followed us to the station—I should know him again; he looked like a waiter—I did not make any charge against the prisoner at the station, because I did not wish to be bothered about it—I have been in trouble for drunkenness once, since this occur<lb/>rence—I was in prison for drunkenness when the prisoner was remanded—the prisoner never mentioned the word "money" to me, only when he asked what was he to get for his trouble—Brown did not appear at the police-court.</p>

I have given you my full name and address"—I said "I do not believe you are a detective; I believe it is only an imposition, to extort money"—he continued to follow us to the very door of 31, Grosvenor Square—as we were going in he put his foot between the door and doorpost to prevent my closing it, and I could not for some little time—I don't remember his producing a book—I took the woman into the house with me; I let myself in with a latchkey—after we got in the prisoner rang the bell two or three times; at last he ceased ringing, and walked up and down in front of the house—I watched him from the hall window for about three-quarters of an hour or an hour; after that I lost sight of him—I then let the woman out—I should think that was between 12 and 1 o'clock—there was somebody else in the house—I accompanied Cormack to Stanhope Gate—I looked about to see if the prisoner was there, but I could not see him, and I let her go on by herself thinking she was then safe from being molested—I went to Wales the next day—I next heard of the matter last Wednesday morning by being served with a subpoena at Buckland,</p>

I carry on business as a mantle manufacturer under the style of Holloway and Sharpe in St. Paul's Churchyard—there is one house intervening from Pawson's—Lawton has been in my employ, I think, 20 years—I was not aware that he had a shop—I have known Wicks 10 or 15 years, and during the last eight or 10 years I have had transactions with him—he used to come once a week and clear away the cuttings, what we call rags—I do not deal in lengths or pieces of silk, or silk handkerchiefs or gloves—Lawton had no authority to sell or dispose of any capes or mantles in my possession—I have sold him capes and silks—I went to Wicks's house with the detective, and found capes, Ulsters, and other things, and some at the warehouse—I have looked them through, they belong to me, I never sold them to Lawton or to any person; most of them are this season's goods—the value of the things found at Wicks's is about 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have also seen the dolmans and capes and other articles found at Lawton's; they are my property—I cannot say positively whether I sold the capes to him, but the other Things were never sold to him by me or any one in my employ; I have no entry in any of my books of the sale of these particular things to Lawton or to Wicks.

Pawson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had to send for the parcel after Mrs. Wicks had communicated to me that it had come—that was after her husband was charged with this offence—some of these goods had still the tickets on, them when we found them—there was no distinguishing mark on the material of which the goods were made—Wicks said in my presence, "Lawton told me he could buy goods from Holloway and Sharpe at a cheap rate"—Wicks has borne a good character in the trade for all I know—the entire value of my goods found at Lawton's is, I think, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the silk department at Messrs.

               <p>found two pieces in the parcel making exactly those yards; also a piece numbered 2317, of which we missed 671/4 yards, and we found that quantity, less a quarter, at Duncan Street—we also missed 61 1/4 yards of a piece numbered <hi rend="smallCaps">F</hi> 9896, and we found all that but half a yard—the value of the whole of the property we found was as nearly as possible 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the average price of the pieces is about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., some of it is as high as 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi> 1313 is 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I have measured most of these lengths, they average from 20 to 30 yards; there are a few small lengths—there is 711/4 yards in three lengths, costing 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 987/8 yards in three lengths at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 64 1/2 yards in two lengths at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 41/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 173/8 yards at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 101/4 yards at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 71/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a good deal of the silk I have identified has been missed from stock since the last stock-taking in June—I have not sold any silks personally to either Lawton or Wicks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the silk handkerchief department at Pawson's—I was present on 6th September, when Davidson seized the goods at Lawton's shop—I saw the handkerchiefs there, and identified some of them as having been taken from Messrs. Pawson's—there are 14 dozen—I have a doubt about the others, but we have the same pattern, and the same handkerchief in stock; the others I am quite certain about—the average selling price of them is 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—I have also seen the handkerchiefs found at Wicks's; we have the same in stock now.</p>

I live at 29, Wesley Street, Seymour Street, and am a prostitute—on 9th September I was at the corner of Neal Street with Waller; five or six men came by, and Carman took Waller by the hand and called him by his name—they stood talking to him, and then walked away from him; I did not see them do anything to him—after they went away Waller said to me "Nelly, they have taken my watch and chain from me and a half-sovereign"—we were half an hour before we could see a policeman; they asked me to go to the station, which I did—I told the inspector that all Waller changed in my company was a two-shilling piece—I had been drinking with him at the Cranbourne, and from there we went to Sheen's and had another glass—I say nothing about the other two prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in service as cook at 47, Wimpole Street—on 20th July I went to the Exhibition in the evening with Charlotte Barnes, a fellow-servant—we spent the evening there, and we left the Exhibition together—after that I was spoken to by a young man; I entered into conversation with him, and he walked with me—we went to 205, Brompton Road, my sister's—Barnes was with us then; I left her there, and walked on in the direction of home with the young man—my way home took me across the park; we went in at the Albert Gate—it was about 10 o'clock when we left the Exhibition, and it was about half-past 10, or not quite so much, when we entered the park—we sat down on one of the seats there for five or ten minutes, and as we got up to go the prisoner came up from behind the tree where we were sitting—he said to the young man, "I accuse you of disarranging that young lady's clothes"—he denied it—the prisoner said, "Do you know what I am?"—I do not know whether the young man said yes or no—the prisoner said, "I am a detective in private clothes, and I shall take you to the police-station"—he then blew a whistle which was fastened to his coat into the buttonhole by a chain which hung down—no assistance came—after a time he said, "If I don't take the two I shall take one"—he asked me if I knew my way home; I said "Yes"—he told me to get away quick, and asked me if I had anything to say to the young man before I left—the young man shook hands with me and said "Good night"—he returned with the prisoner, and I walked away to go home—I had never seen the young man before that night, and have never seen him since—I walked towards the Marble Arch—after I had gone on for about five minutes the prisoner came up and walked by my side—he said, "I have put your young man into the police's hands, and now I am going to take you"—I turned to go back with him—he then said, "What money have you got about you?"—I said, "Not much"—we walked on a little distance, and he asked me again how much money I had—I then took out my purse and gave him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was all I had—he afterwards said, "I shall not take you to the station now, I shall detain you in the park for 20 minutes"—I gave him the money because I was so frightened of him; he demanded the money twice, and I did not know what to do—we walked on a little without any conversation, and then he took me farther into the park, under a clump of trees, and threw himself down and asked me to sit down; I refused, and I was crying—he said if I did not sit down he should put me down, and the more fuss I made the more serious it would be for me—he then put me down and insulted me, he had connection with me—I was still crying, and I screamed—he got up and asked me to go that way with him, and I walked a little way with him—he then said, "I shall not go any farther with you, but will you go over to the Bayswater Road, to the main gate? I have got the keys, and will let you out"—I went to the gate, but he did not come; I then went to the Marble Arch—there were two policemen there; I told them all that had happened, and I went with them to the police-station in Hyde Park—I made a statement there, and a policeman then took me home—as I went from the Marble Arch with the policeman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188610250049"/>
               <p>I pointed out to him the clump of trees where this happened—when I got home I saw Charlotte Barnes, she was sitting up for me—I believe it was from half-past 1 to 2 when I got home—I told her all about it—I did not tell my mistress—on 3rd September a detective came, and next morning I went to the Marlborough Street Station—I was taken into a room there to wait till they were ready, and then I was asked to go into a back yard to identify the prisoner—I saw 11 or 12 men there, and I identified the prisoner as soon as I saw him—he said that I had made a mistake, but I had not—I did not hear what else he said.</p>

I am a clerk in employment at 72, St. Paul's Churchyard—on a Saturday evening about the middle of July last, about half-past eight, I was in Hyde Park with a young lady—whilst we were sitting on a seat I heard a whistle blown; I half turned round to see what it was and saw the prisoner get over the railings—he came up and spoke to me; he said he was a detective—he was dressed in a light coat and vest, a darker pair of trousers, and a hard felt hat—he put something into his pocket; I think it must have been the whistle—he remained with me ten minutes I should say—we walked away together 20 or 30 yards on the grass; the young lady was with me—he told us to separate, and he walked along with me for about 50 yards in the direc<lb/>tion of the Marble Arch—I saw him again that evening on the path by the Bayswater Road, inside the park; I was about five minutes with him there—I have no doubt whatever that he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The young lady was with me all the time except the last five minutes—she had the same opportunity of seeing him—I know that she was called on to identify him and that she picked out another man; he was very similar to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was on 1st October that I next saw the prisoner—he was then with about eight or nine others in the police-court yard—he was slightly altered, but I immediately identified him—he was not quite so stout as when I first saw him; that was the only difference, except that the clothes were not the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at 7, Great James Street, Bedford Row—I was acting on behalf of Mr. Michael Pope, the holder of this promissory note against Harriet Layte, Charles Hopkins, and Charles Hunt. (<hi rend="italic">The note was dated</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>, 1885, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">at six month, signed by Harriet Layte in favour of Charles Hopkins, accepted, payable at</hi> 70, <hi rend="italic">Gray's Inn Road by Harriet Layte, and endorsed by Charles Hopkins and Charles Hunt.</hi>) Mr. Pope said he was the holder of this bill, which had not been met at maturity—I only got summary judgment under order 14 against Hopkins—Layte defended the actions on several grounds, and I determined to abandon the action against her—the defendant swore this affidavit at my office on 10th August. (<hi rend="italic">In this the prisoner swore that he did not endorse the promissory note.</hi>) I objected to that as not sufficient, and on 14th August he swore this second affidavit at my office. (<hi rend="italic">In this he swore that he did not endorse the note, nor did he authorise any one to endorse it in his name.</hi>) These are the prisoner's signatures to the affidavits—he was allowed by the Judge to defend the action—on the 28th and 29th June last the action came on to be heard before Mr. Justice Hawkins—I called Mr. Netherclift, the expert, to prove by comparison the similarity of the handwriting of the various documents, and Mr. Hopkins and his wife and daughter were called to prove they saw the prisoner sign that note—afterwards the prisoner was sworn, examined, and cross-examined as a witness on his own behalf; I was in Court the whole time—I heard the prisoner swear he did not sign the "Charles Hunt, 8, Roderick Road, N.W."—the Judge asked him to write his name and address, and he did so on this piece of paper—he referred to his pocket-book for something, and it was noticed that his name and address were written in that—the Jury compared the hand-writing; they returned a verdict for the full amount for the plaintiff, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188610250053"/>
               <p>the Judge impounded the documents—I signed judgment—his goods were sold privately for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I received 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the action lasted two days, and was very expensive—I was directed by the Judge to communi<lb/>cate with the Public Prosecutor—the defendant was represented by a Queen's Counsel and a junior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The action was in the list for a day or two before it was reached—Mr. Lawrence, Q.C., was retained for Hunt, and, I believe, at the last moment he handed his brief to Mr. Bosanquet—I had retained Mr. Kemp, and he returned the brief at the last moment, and I had to hand it over to Mr. Channel—the bill is rather a strange docu<lb/>ment—I believe one of the grounds given to Mrs. Layte for leave to defend the bill was on account of its informality—I knew she could set up a defence which was not available for Hunt, so I did not proceed against her—it is not usual for an endorser to put his address on a bill unless his address is not known—I have seen it done before, the address is generally known—it would be usual for a person endorsing the bill after Hunt to put his name below, but there was plenty of room here, so that I am not surprised Hopkins has put it above—I should not have allowed a document of this informal description to be drawn if I had been present—a ninepenny stamp is necessary for a bill under 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it would not bear any higher amount—it is usual when people are jointly and severally interested in a bill for both to sign—there is only one signature to this—I am usually anxious to have a husband's rather than a wife's signature—I do not know whether Robert Layte can write or not—I heard Mr. Justice Hawkins order all witnesses out of Court on application of Counsel—Mr. Justice Hawkins asked Miss Hopkins if she bad been out of Court when her father was giving evidence, and she said no; she and Mrs. Hopkins had remained in Court; she said they did not hear the Judge's order—a short-hand writer was instructed in the middle of the case; no note was taken of Hopkins's evidence—it is the rule for Counsel to cross-examine on the evidence they are going to adduce themselves, so that till Mr. Justice Hawkins had heard Hunt's case it was impossible for him to cross-examine Hopkins upon that case, I presume; but he could cross-examine Hunt upon the evidence of Hopkins—Mr. Justice Hawkins put Hunt through a very searching cross-examination—Hunt was cool and collected in the box, and gave his evidence firmly and decisively—the prisoner was asked whether Hopkins was aware of his private address, and he said no, and then the Judge repeated the question in a rather forcible manner, and he said he had once given Hopkins his private address, 8, Roderick Road, in order that he might send him a theatre ticket, and that it should not be sent to the British Museum—I believe Mrs. Layte said that Hunt had acted purely as a friend for her, and had not had a penny for his trouble, and had no interest in this establishment which she was buying. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>, <hi rend="italic">at Mr. Statham's request, put in the lease of the premises</hi>, 97, <hi rend="italic">Gray's Inn Road, an assignment of the premises, and an agreement of</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th February.</hi>) Mrs. Layte found the money for the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamp on this assignment; the date is 21st April, 1885, and the document is dated 31st March—I heard that Hunt was waiting for that 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from her for the three weeks—Mr. Pope is a solicitor, and I am his solicitor for all these cases—Mrs. Layte said she was in the room when the figures were filled in, but not when the bill was prepared on 9th February—I understood it was brought</p>

               <p>subject to the filling in of dates and amounts—she was liable for the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think she said in examination-in-chief that the prisoner did not sign it, but in cross-examination she said he might have signed it, and if he did she did not see him do it—she said she did not remem<lb/>ber his signing it; she also said I believe that there was no discussion as to whether he should sign it or not; she never suggested he should sign it—I don't remember her saying that she had paid 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in respect of the transaction before Hunt was called on to sign; I dare say she did say so—she said that Hopkins asked Hunt to write out the bill—when the prisoner called on me to swear the affidavits I think he told me it was the first bill he had ever had to deal with, and did not understand them—I warned him to be careful what he was saying, as he might be charged with perjury—he then made the affidavit—that was shortly after the writ was issued under Order 14 in July, six months after the bill was drawn—I did not subsequently offer to pay Mrs. Layte's expenses in respect of the trial, if she could come forward and her evidence concurred with mine, nor that if she swore she saw the pri<lb/>soner sign it I would drop the action and pay her costs—I called on her to ascertain what evidence she could give—I dropped proceedings against her after the second hearing of the summons for judgment—she paid at first she did not sign it; she had not the bill then—she said her evidence would be to the effect that the prisoner did not sign it—I believe the prisoner was asked by my Counsel whether he filled in the "Rober"—I never attempted to prove that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I went to ask Mrs. Layte whether she signed it, and whether the prisoner signed it—if Hopkins had deceived Mr. Pope I should have proceeded against Hopkins—Hopkins keeps an eating-house in Gray's Inn Road—Mr. Bosanquet, Q.C., represented the pri<lb/>soner all through the case, which lasted two days.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On or about 24th January I entered into an agreement with Mrs. Layte to lease these premises to her—I let her the property at 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I was paying 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself, I told her so—I told her the lease ran for seven or eight years; I did not tell her it could be renewed—dilapidations were not mentioned—she paid me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to lease the property—afterwards she introduced me to the prisoner, and then it was suggested that she should purchase it for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was made up of the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. she had already paid—she gave me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I did not know that was raised on a bill of sale on her furniture—then 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was allowed for outstanding debts, and a bill was to be given me for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving a margin of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in case of any little account being presented for payment—I said the prisoner could have that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he succeeded in getting 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the School Board for Mrs. Layte—this was all subsequent to his endorsing the note—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for any other bills and little things coming in, and then going into things I found nothing was coming in, and I said to the prisoner, "That is for you if you meet your bill"—there was nothing of that sort in the agreement—the prisoner did not tell me to knock it off the amount if I wanted to give him anything—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not knocked off Mrs. Layte's account, nothing has been paid—nothing was said as to my being paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards—I did not complain of his having put the interest at 5 per cent, on the bill, I thought it was a funny thing to do, I remarked about it; I had no hand in its getting on the bill—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was knocked off the purchase-money to cover the out-standing claims; I did that—nothing was suggested about knocking it off for Mrs. Layte—afterwards, when the prisoner was in communication with the School Board, he told me if he got this money he should come and take up the promissory note—I said the only obstacle in the way of my taking a promissory note was that Mrs. Layte could not write—the Prisoner said, "To obviate that I will be answerable, I will sign"—</p>

               <p>I took his in lieu of Mr. Layte's—Mrs. Layte signed, and the prisoner signed the assignment as witness—I borrowed the deed a few days after its execution—there is a resemblance, but not a great deal, between the signature on the deed and that on the assignment; I am certain they are both the prisoner's writing, I saw him write both—I borrowed it because he brought me another document to sign, and I wanted to show them both to and ask my solicitor if I was justified in signing it—I don't know where that document is, I believe Mr. Maskell has it—I refused to sign it; it was empowering me to come in at the end of the lease. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Maskell stated that he had no recollection of this document, but that if he had it with him he would hand it to the Court.</hi>) I believe that the other docu<lb/>ment was at the High Court; it was handed to Counsel on both sides, I kept it about two hours—the bill had been cashed six or eight weeks before I saw this deed; I discounted the bill in March—I could not get the matter settled, and the prisoner's excuse was that Mrs. Layte had not money enough to pay him, and he would not have anything to do with it till then—I saw three young fellows at the Museum whom the prisoner led me to believe were his clerks—I did not see Mr. Edans—the prisoner asked me whether there was a lease, and I said I supposed Mr. Crossfield held the original lease—I produced the only lease we had, it was on parchment; I cannot say if it was the original one—on February 9th the prisoner said he had been to Messrs. Crossfield—I said "I thought you simply wanted to peruse this lease"—the prisoner had that lease in his possession; I handed it to him before February 9th—he went to Messrs. Crossfield's to get what information he could—he gave me an acknowledgment for this lease—I kept it in my desk, not locked up—he had the lease for two or three months; I never saw it from the time I entrusted it to him till he brought it to me complete—he had the lease at the latter end of January—this receipt was not dated January 9th in mistake for February 9th—the receipt was signed in January; I could not say when—I did not tell Mrs. Layte for certain how my business had declined—I gave Mr. Pope 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my lease and sold it to her after the business had declined for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. some months after—we laid out 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the premises after we paid the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was spent to make it in a proper state of repair, and I had to spend more afterwards—I told Mrs. Layte they would do very well, and that she would be able to pay me out of the profits—I have been in several other establishments—I have had a permanent address—if any money is owing to Mrs. Saunders for her rent it is from my wife—no execution has been put in or threatened by Turner, the furniture people of Tabernacle Walk—we have paid them pretty nearly 100—my wife pays what is required of her—I don't know if anything is owing to Denman a dairyman; they supplied us this morning; my wife knows—I have earned my living for the last five years as collector, canvasser, clerk, not as commission agent—I have had no commission on betting transactions—the potman at the Bacon Arms serves us; if he says I am living as a betting tout it is not true—I canvass for general house agents and public-house brokers—I call at Marks's, of Great Russell Street, every day—I never represented myself to be their public-house broker—I do not owe money all round the neighbourhood, nor does my wife—we pay Turner by monthly instal<lb/>ments—I did not order my wife and daughter out of the room when the bill was signed; they were there the whole time.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">This witness was tried and convicted in the name of Touissant at this Court in June last, see page</hi> 147.) I am a convict, under<lb/>going a sentence of 15 years' penal servitude—I was convicted and sentenced on 1st June last for robbery with violence on Mr. Tabak—I have been four times in penal servitude—the last time was on 16th December, 1884—I know the prisoner Palmer, he was in Dartmoor with me—I knew him for two or three months before I was discharged—I have known Scanland since June, 1885—Jacoby I have known since last December twelve months—as soon as I came out of prison I was introduced to him by my daughter Eleanor—at that time I was living in Bath Street, Farringdon Street—Jacoby was then living with his father as a barber in Long Lane—after that I went to Italy with my daughter, and was away about six months—before I left England nothing was said to me about an engagement between Jacoby and my daughter to be married; she only said Jacoby was her sweetheart; she said nothing about marriage—I had to come back to London in June because she had typhus fever in Italy—I then went to live in Amwell Street—I was introduced to Scan<lb/>land by his brother-in-law Palmer, at Palmer's house, in Arthur Street, Oxford Street; that was in June, 1885—after leaving Amwell Street I went to Brighton for two weeks to see if I could get employment, I could not, and when I came back I went to live at 115, St. George's Road, Southwark; that would be in July, 1885—while I was there I went to see Jacoby, who then had a barber's shop in the Walworth Road, and had got married—I went to sell him something—I think that was about eight or nine days before Christmas, 1885—before that, on 21st October, 1885, I went to Paris with Palmer and Scanland—Palmer had been to my house previous to that, and Scanland had been once before, and once with his wife the day we went away, and my daughter stopped at Scanland's—we went to Paris on a Tuesday and came back on the Saturday—I paid the expenses of that journey—when I went to Jacoby I gave him two pairs of earrings, two brooches, a gold bracelet, a diamond earring, another gold bracelet with three diamonds, and a diamond ring—I asked him to buy them—he said "All right"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188610250059"/>
               <p>gave me a sovereign that night, and told me to come next morning—went, and went with him to the Walworth Road, and he went into a shop, and came back and gave me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he lent me, and from that time I used to go every day and visit him—I told him I felt very uneasy, that I wished to have some employment—he said his business had gone very bad—he then said "I have got a friend who has got something to do; I think you can do it if you like; I will let you see him"—I said "What is it?"—he said "He has got an old Jew worth 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of diamonds; I will get the chloroform"—I said "That will be a very good thing if you can get it"—he said "All right, we will see him"—that was all he said on that occasion—that same evening we took a cab and went to a cafe restaurant, opposite Dyer's Buildings, Holborn—the Weiners carried on business at No. 6—by and by Adolphe Weiner came in to the cafe—we went upstairs into a room by ourselves, and Adolphe said to me "I suppose Mr. Jacoby told you about the busi<lb/>ness?"—I said "Partly he did"—then Adolphe said "Well, I have an old Jew, a miser; he is worth 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of diamonds, and he has only a wife and servant, and they are always downstairs; Mr. Tabak is very anxious to do business; he will receive you upstairs in the back room; you tell him that you are recommended by Messrs. Asher, a firm at Paris; he knows those gentlemen, and he will receive you and show you all the goods; when he opens the safe and shows you the things, give him a blow and then take everything, not to forget the bottom drawers of the safe, they contain a lot of foreign coins, and take all the papers, they are bonds—he told me to shut the safe and bring the key away with me—I told him I did not like to give the blow, I could not do that; that Jacoby said he would get the chloroform—he said "Yes; but he must not get the chloroform"—Jacoby said "Yes, yes; I will get it"—Adolphe began to lay down a life of Mr. Tabak; that he was a miser, and he would not spend a penny—he mentioned Mr. Tabak's name, and gave his direction on a piece of paper to Jacoby: "5, Belgrave Street, Euston Road"—Jacoby kept the paper, and he showed it to me some time after—Adolphe and Jacoby wanted me to go with the chloroform, and said Wednesday would be the best day to go—I said to Adolphe once or twice "Why not go yourself?"—he said "I would, but he knows me"—it was arranged that I was to wait till Jacoby brought me the chloroform, and that when I went Jacoby was to stop at the Great Northern Station, opposite Belgrave Street, with a cab—my first interview with Adolphe Weiner was two or three days before Christmas—after that I met him scores of times, many times, in January, February, and March—I used to go to Jacoby's every day—he told his shopmen and servant that I was a music-mast—after I left Walworth Road and went to Edgware Road I was introduced to Leon Weiner, that was the morning after the great <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in Trafalgar Square—in January I sold two pairs of earrings to Adolphe—when we met we always used to speak about Mr. Tabak—Adolphe also mentioned four other names; one was Mr. Ayres, of 16, Northampton Square, a foreigner—he wanted me to get hold of him in the night time and knock him down, and get his bag that he used to carry diamonds about in; he described him to me, and both the brothers came to show me the place, but Adolphe spoke to me in the first instance—I went twice to Northampton Square, but did not see the man—about Christmas-time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188610250060"/>
               <p>or early in January I sent my daughter to Mr. Tabak's; she came back and told me she had spoken to him—the chloroform was brought to me by Jacoby towards the end of January—it was about a quarter of a pint in a round bottle; there was a label on it, I did not read it, it was red; he wetted it and took it off, and I put on another label from a scent-bottle—my daughter was present when he brought it, and saw the bottle—I put it behind the glass on the mantelpiece—this was at my place in St. George's Road—he made a sign to me that my daughter should not see the bottle, but she did—that evening, about 7 or 8 o'clock, Jacoby took me to the Strand and called Adolphe out of Gatti's Restaurant, and we went to a cafe near the Pavilion in Windmill Street—Adolphe said he was very glad we had got the chloroform, and he said, "I will begin to look from Wednesday in the newspaper, and see if the thing has come off"—he then went home, and I and Jacoby went to our place—on 9th February I was introduced to Leon by Adolphe outside the cafe in Holborn where we had been before—we shook hands, and Adolphe said, "You can speak to him, he is my brother"—we went upstairs in the same room as before and had lunch—after lunch Leon asked Adolphe what my name was; he said he did not know—he said, "Do you transact such business as this without knowing the man's name?"—he aid, "Jacoby introduced him"—they then asked me how I was getting on—I said, "I am afraid to go away, I don't know what to do"—Adolphe said, "Don't throw yourself away, I will give you some money," and he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—his brother then said, "Give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and Adolphe gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the three of us then went out, and stopped at the corner of Gray's Inn Road, and Leon then asked Adolphe if he would show me the place of Mr. Harris in Hatton Garden—we went to the station at the bottom of Gray's Inn Road and took two return tickets to Westbourne Bridge, or something of that; it was five stations from there—after that he showed me the house where Mr. Harris lived—Adolphe Weiner was not with us then, we had left him at the corner of Gray's Inn Road—this was not the first time I had had money from Adolphe, I had had a lot of money from him before—I sold him things, and after that I could Dot do anything, and he gave me 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Jacoby—he gave me money for four or five weeks, sometimes a sovereign or two sovereigns or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in February there was a kitten at my landlady's house, and I tried the chloroform on it alone—that was before I went to Paris and before the introduction to Leon—I tried it on the kitten on the second morning after I had the chloroform—it sneezed a bit, but it was not successful, and I told Jacoby and Adolphe the chloroform was no good, I tried it on the kitten and it was not successful—Adolphe said, "Oh, a cat has nine lives"—two or three days afterwards Adolphe came, and we tried it on the kitten again—I did not know his brother then—it was the very same, but he said, "The stuff is good, but it doesn't affect cats"—two or three days after that I saw Adolphe and Leon in the Edgware Road—Jacoby had then removed from Walworth Road to No. 16, Edgware Road, where he carried on the business of a barber on the first floor, but it was not open then—in a restaurant there Adolphe said, "I want money, you want money, and he wants money, and that is the only place you can get it," meaning Tabak's—after these experiments on the kitten I thought no more about the chloroform, as I thought it was no good, and I said to them all, "I don't believe it is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188610250061"/>
               <p>any good, it has no effect"—on 15th February I paid another visit to Paris with Adolphe Weiner—before I got the chloroform I said the only tiling I could do with the chloroform was to go into a shop and <hi rend="italic">mace</hi> anything; that is, go into a shop as a gentleman, and under pretence of buying, and take something—he said, "If you won't do this, get some money, and we will go together over the Continent as far as Brussels"—I Raid, "Where can I get the money? I am afraid to go away"—I had <hi rend="italic">maced</hi> these earrings—we then went together to Richmond for the purpose of robbing a shop; he pointed it out to me but I didn't effect a robbery—he then said, "We will go together to Paris; I will pay the expenses," and together we went—the appointment was that Adolphe was to meet me on Sunday at Charing Cross; my daughter went to see me off, but he never came there, and on the next morning he came to my place and said, "Where have you been?"—I said, "Charing Cross"—he said, "I was waiting for you at Victoria"—we then went on Monday, the 15th, from Charing Cross and arrived in Paris on the morning of Tuesday, the 16th, and we stayed at the same hotel as before, an English hotel outside the station—we remained in Paris just a week, and were in London on Sunday morning—I went round to shops while I was in Paris to see if I could get anything, and Adolphe was waiting outside for me—amongst other things I stole this pair of diamond earrings and brought them to London, but I said nothing to Adolphe about them—in every shop I went I used to ask for a card or bill, because Adolphe wanted them to show to Mr. Tabak, and out of those he chose this bill of Linsella's and a small card—I filled in the amount, in the first instance it was for 2,000 francs—that bill was made out in this way, I went and selected those things that are there and asked him to make out a bill for them, which amounted to 2,000 odd francs, and said I would send for them; I then left the things behind and brought the bill away and gave it to Adolphe as I did with others, and when we returned on the 21st he brought that bill back with him, and I brought back the diamond ear<lb/>rings which I think was the best—Adolphe paid the expenses of that visit and I gave him an umbrella costing 60 francs and a silver snuff box—when there I bought a bracelet costing 50 francs and the lady signed it And put that stamp on, which I gave to Adolphe, and when we got back he took the stamp off that bill and put it on the Linsella bill—I afterwards gave the earrings to my daughter to pledge—I had been con<lb/>victed on the last occasion in the name of Defour, and I sent her to pledge them in that name—the stamp was put upon that bill four or five days after we came back from Paris, after the clothes were ordered from Newman's—when I gave the bill to Adolphe there was no stamp on it, but when he brought it to me it was like that—I was not present when it was done in his place—I have had it in my possession ever since—I altered the amount of the bill after I got the clothes made—when he brought me the bill he said, "Here is the bill and here is the card, if you don't go quick to Mr. Tabak's, in a week or two he will go to Holland"—once as we were at the Palais Royal in Paris Adolphe said, "You are very well to put that coat on, but the cloth is not the real gentleman cloth," and he lent me his diamond ring and his diamond stud, which he fixed on my neckcloth that I might look better, so when he said that about going to Mr. Tabak's in a week or two I said, "You passed the remark in Paris that my clothes were not the real gentleman's; you don't think he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188610250062"/>
               <p>will think I am a diamond merchant"—he then told me to get a suit of clothes made, and gave me Newman's address, No. 69 in the Strand and said he would be reference for me, and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give to Mr. Newman, which I gave him on the second occasion when he measured me—I went there and Newman asked me what I wanted—I said, "A full suit with overcoat"—he then asked me my name and address, and I gave him a name—after that I went and saw Adolphe Weiner and went a second time on a Tuesday to Newman's and was measured, and I then gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as deposit—the total cost of suit and overcoat was to be 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were finished and sent to my place at St. George's Road on a Saturday—I did not pay any more for them except the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the boy, and a glass to Mr. Newman—I have been twice to him since then—about two or three weeks after this I was in company with Palmer and Scanland, and saw Mr. Newman at the corner of Dyer's Buildings waiting for Adolphe Weiner, and I spoke to him—I saw Palmer two or three days after the Trafalgar Square row, about 12th February: I had not seen him since the journey to Paris—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with reference to that journey, and I had had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before—he then spoke very nicely, and I told him about this; I said there was a gentleman giving directions about Mr. Tabak, but I didn't say the name—I told him I had got the chloroform to go and get these diamonds, and the man always asked me to go and I said I could not—he said, "Perhaps I will see this man, but don't tell him where I live"—I had said to Weiner I knew two brothers that were very crafty, and he always wanted me to introduce him—I saw Palmer two or three days after the suit of clothes were delivered, and we went up in Hyde Park—from there we went to my place and he took a little dinner with me, and the two Weiners came in and they said, "How does the suit fit?"—I was wearing the suit from Newman's at that time—I said, "You are suspicious of my daughter"—this was the first time Palmer had met the two Weiners, and after my daughter had gone out to fetch something to drink, I said "This is the man I was speaking about, one of the two brothers"—they shook hands and were very pleased to meet, and after dinner we Went out and went down the Westminster Road to the back of Charing Cross—I had the three diamonds, and I gave them to Palmer and told him to pretend they were his own, as I owed several pounds to Weiner—he said "How much shall I ask?"—I said "7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—they were worth I dare say 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard Weiner offer 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was talking with him over the road and I was talking with his brother—the offer was not enough, and he brought them back—next morning I brought the jewels to Adolphe Weiner, and he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw Palmer every day after that—I remember a rabbit being brought to my house in St. George's Road; I don't know who brought it—I was in the Havelock public-house, in the Gray's Inn Road, with the two Weiners, about half-past 11—we had lunch there together—after I had sold these diamonds Adolphe was very anxious to be introduced to Palmer, and always asked "Why don't you see this man, where does he live?"—I said "I don't know, I will see," and it was arranged that Leon Weiner was to be at my place at 5 o'clock, and bring the rabbit—on the same day Adolphe said he had heard from a doctor that they had experiments of chloroform on a rabbit, and he intended to do that—he wanted to see Palmer again, and I said "Well, I am going towards there, I will see if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188610250063"/>
               <p>he is at home"—he said "I will come with you"—I took him to a public-house in College Street—that is not where he lived, but Palmer had told me not to tell him where he lived; he used to live in the Euston Road—I left Adolphe and, said I was going to see if he was at home—I came back and then we went to my place, and pre<lb/>sently his brother Leon came in with a rabbit; it was a big one, with brown and white patches, and was in a basket with two handles—my daughter and Margaret Ross were there at the time—we talked for an hour or two till his brother came in, and then the two girls went out—I and Leon then tried the chloroform to the rabbit, and it was prostrated on the table for six or seven minutes, like as if it was dead—Adolphe then said "Open the window, the smell is fearful," and he opened the door and I the window, and they were not closed until my daughter and the other girl came in—before he went out he told me the stuff was all right, the thing was dead, but when I got hold of the thing it shook, and I saw it was not dead'—he said the stuff was all right, I could make up my mind to go; they told me this stuff must be put on the handkerchief in a good dose and put on Mr. Tabak's nose—I said I could not do it, suppose he were to shout, I should be caught in a trap—he said there was no fear of that, "You are always making excuses"—after this Adolphe went away rather cross because I would not go—Leon told Adolphe two or three different times "Don't force the man," and he said to me "Don't you go if you think you will get into trouble," and before I went away he gave me half a sovereign—Adolphe said "You can have a good dinner to-morrow;" but I wouldn't take the rabbit, I gave it to Margaret Boss with the bag; I had given it to Mrs. Reid at first—Adolphe went away by himself, and I and the two girls went out with Leon to the obelisk, and he there took a bus, and I and my daughter went indoors—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the same sort of rabbit's skin, and basket—on Saturday I saw both the Weiners, but I don't remember anybody else—on Sunday I saw Palmer—he came to my place with his wife and sister-in-law; they were the only persons I saw on that day—I remember Mrs. Reid re<lb/>ceiving a message for me—on that day I made an appointment to meet Palmer on the Monday at his place, 121, Whitfield Street—I had seen him previously to that day; he wanted me to read something in French and I could not; I was ill in bed—Palmer said he had a win in a lottery, and showed me six bonds for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I don't know where he got them—he was with another man, who was outside—when I looked at these prizes Adolphe Weiner wanted to buy them; they were both there—we then went out into Wardour Street to change the bonds, not the Weiners, only Palmer and I, but we had some drink together, and, spoke about this affair of Tabak's—the Weiners said it was to be done, and Palmer said he did not think he would be able to do it with the chloroform—he thought the same as me, that it was not merely to pass it over the nose and send him to sleep, but it was to be held there—on Monday morning I went by appointment to 121, Whit<lb/>field Street and met Palmer and Scanland—Palmer gave me a ticket to take to Adolphe, for a ring pledged for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by my daughter—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the ticket—Palmer said he wanted the money, and I gave him the ticket back—on the morning of 22nd March I, Palmer, and Scanland went to a public-house in Holborn; I don't know the name</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188610250064"/>
               <p>of it—that was the day I saw Mr. Newman—I saw Adolphe that day at the Havelock, and we went to the public-house where Palmer was waiting for me, and he gave the ticket to Adolphe—Scanland came in—Adolphe said to me "We don't want to stop here, because there are a lot of merchants who may know us"—it was arranged that Scan<lb/>land, Palmer, and I were to go to Mr. Tabak on Wednesday—Adolphe spoke about Mr. Eider, and if I had a chance to get a few diamonds there I should not have gone to Mr. Tabak's—Mr. Eider is a diamond merchant, at 29, Viaduct—Adolphe said if I went to Mr. Eider's at 12 or 1 o'clock I should see the uncle or the nephew by himself, and I could do the same as at Mr. Harris's and Mr. Ayre's and Mr. Tabak's—they were all to be done the same, but I went there with the idea to get a few diamonds—I saw the nephew, and gave him a card, and I went again next day and found my card on the floor, and put it in my pocket—I met Adolphe again at the corner of Hatton Garden, and told him I had been to Mr. Eider's—he said, "What makes you go to Mr. Eider's if you have to go to Mr. Tabak's on Wednesday; did he show you the book with diamonds?"—I said "Yes"—he said, "Well, when you go to Mr. Tabak he will show you ten times more than that"—before that they had all of them spoken many times about the share each of us was to have, partly on the Monday and partly on the Thursday or Friday—Leon was present on the Thursday; he said he did not want nothing, but Adolphe said, "He does not do any<lb/>thing for nothing"—this affair had been talked of from the beginning; they said there would be 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Palmer said, "Well, we will give you 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy the things"—Adolphe was not content with 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said, "What about my brother?"—I said, "There is the other man, too; divide it into four equal shares, one for Adolphe, one for me, one for Palmer, and one for Jacoby"—that was when we were to go with the chloroform—when that was altered, instead of Jacoby Scanland was to take his part instead, and what was over was to be divided between Jacoby and Leon—at first it was to be divided into thirds, and when Palmer came in it was to be into fourths—Adolphe afterwards said there might not be 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there might be less than that—Scanland was not present when we talked about the shares; Palmer spoke for him—on Tuesday, the 23rd, I went to Palmer's and went with him to the neighbourhood of the Elephant and Castle, and he went into a small shop and bought a stick with a big top—we then went to another shop and bought some gutta-percha—we then went to my place in St. George's Road—this (<hi rend="italic">produced, a life preserver</hi>) looks like the stick, but it was longer then; he cut it twice—when we got home he warmed the gutta-percha by the fire and put it on the stick, and then washed his hands because they were sticky and took the stick away with him—he cut it the next day, because it was too long for his pocket—on the Tuesday, as he was warming the gutta-percha at the fire, my daughter came in and her uncle, Mr. Ross, and a man called for a sewing machine that my daughter had hired, and he got half a sovereign, signed a book, and went away—I afterwards described to the inspector where the life preserver and the gutta-percha were bought—on the morning of Wednesday, the 24th, we went to Mr. Tabak's with Scanland and Palmer; we met in Gray's Inn Road, just outside the station of the Underground Railway, and all three went towards Bel<lb/>grave</p>

               <p>Street together—it was a little past 9, I think—I had on the new coat with the top coat, and a new hut; Adolphe had given me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday before to buy it; I always wear a high hat—I had with me this bill head; I had altered that on the Wednesday—I and Palmer went upstairs; Scanland remained outside; he said he would act like a detective; if anybody came out after us he would stop them, and ask what was the matter, to detain them; or if anybody came in he would come into the house and give us notice to come out—Mr. Tabak answered the door to us—he first asked what we wanted, then he said "What have you got to sell? let me see?"—Palmer said "We have got nothing to sell; we want to buy some diamonds"—then he shut the door and led the way upstairs into the back room first floor—there was a table, and a safe just at the end of the table—I sat at the table next to him, and he showed a pocket-book with all the diamonds—he took it out of the safe—I was supposed to choose the diamonds and look at them—I got several of them, two or three packets, I think—I chose a quantity of them, and I got a few in my left hand—then he said "Who sent you here?"—I said "Mr. Asher, from Paris"—Palmer said "I am staying at the Bath Hotel"—he was supposed to speak; I was supposed to be a Frenchman—he did not speak to me—Palmer saw I had a few of the diamonds which I intended to pull away—I should have been satisfied if I had got them—Palmer said "Don't do that; we will have all the lot presently"—that made me tremble a little, and I turned round with an excuse and got hold of his hat, which had a hole in the top, and I put a diamond in that hole, because it looked well on the hat, and I said "For God's sake don't do it"—he said. "It's all right"—I said "No, no; I hear somebody in the other room"—this is the hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it had on a mourning band, and it has a ventilator at the top—I then put down the diamonds I had in my hand, and stood there—Mr. Tabak said those I had selected were 53 carats; and he put them in an envelope, and told me to put my name on it, and I put the initials "D. T." after he had sealed it—Palmer then said we were going to the bank to get the money—I think we were to pay 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or some<lb/>thing like that; I forget now—we said we would come back with the money—we then went out—we saw Scanland outside—Palmer said, "He would not let me do it"—I said, "It can't be, the servant was on the stairs"—we went back again in a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes—the servant and Mrs. Tabak answered the door and spoke to me in French—Mr. Tabak was out—we asked if we could come back about half-past 5—she said, "I don't know, he has gone out on business, but you can see him at half-past 3"—we then came out again—we just spoke to Scanland, and then the three of us went to the Public-house in Holborn—there was nobody there—Palmer went to the Havelock, came back and said Weiner was there, and we went there, and the two Weiners were there—we had something to drink—Adolphe said, "Let us go out of this; where can we go?"—Scanland and Palmer said, "Down here," and we all five went to a public-house in Theobald's Road—Palmer said there was a very nice chance, and I would not let him do it, and Weiner snapped his fingers and treated me as a coward for not letting him do it—they all said we must go again at half-past 3—me and Palmer then left—we had to stop a long time in the street, and then it was that he cut the string and shortened the life-preserver—</p>

               <p>about 3 o'clock we went back to Mr. Tabak's, but we did not go in—Scanland said there was a pianoforte going in, and a publishing man going in and out, and it was no use to wait, so we took the train and went to Scanland's place, and he said he would see us in the morning—Palmer and I went back to Theobald's Road, where we saw Adolphe—we told him what had passed—he said we must go again to-morrow at 9 o'clock, and he would write a letter—he went out and fetched a sheet of paper and an envelope, and asked Palmer to write—Palmer said, "I am not much of a letter-writer"—Adolphe said, "I must not write, Mr. Tabak knows my writing"—then he asked me to write—I said, "I am supposed to be a Frenchman, how can I write?"—he said "Write," and I wrote, pretending it was my partner—he tore it up and said it was no use, and he fetched another sheet of paper, and I wrote another letter, partly at his dictation—this is the letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed "D.

I can explain: Father and I were going up the Euston Road one day, my father said "Would you go to No. 6, to Mr. Tabak's, and ask him if he could tell me the address of a certain diamond merchant," and I went there and he asked me what sort of a man he was, and I said a little old man, and he said "That is the man Weiner wants me to rob"—"he, said "It is true, then, he is a little old man"—I did not know he was the man he was going to rob—on 19th March Adolphe came in first—Leon brought the rabbit with him—father took it from his hand, and took the bag in my bedroom—I said so at the police-court—I and my cousin afterwards walked with Leon a few yards to the corner of the street—Adolphe had gone—I did not go upstairs and have refreshments with Adolphe at the <hi rend="italic">cafes</hi>—I did not have refreshment at the <hi rend="italic">cafe</hi> in the Seven Sisters Road till Leon had gone, and that I paid for—Langrish and Bordman asked me to assist the police—they did not say anything about it being better for my father—I asked Mr. Langrish if it would benefit my father, and he said no, so I didn't tell him—I didn't say before the Magistrate "Mr. Degallow didn't say if I told the police it would benefit my father, Mr. Bordman told me that"—I said I never told Degallow anything—I didn't say Mr. Bordman told me if I assisted the police it would benefit my father—I said I thought myself if I told it would do him some good, but I never said they said so.</p>

I am a diamond merchant, at 5, Belgrave Street, Euston Road—I have lived there 22 years with my wife; a servant named Utting lived with us—I know the Weiners; they both came to my house to buy about November last—my safe is in my office on the first floor—I took a lot of diamonds out of my safe and showed them; they understood diamonds—some bonds were in the safe in the bottom drawer with some diamonds—the best diamonds are kept in the safe—I had seen the Weiners before, in Hatton Garden—I knew they were diamond merchants; I did not know their address—I had no correspondence with them—the daughter of Toussaint came and spoke to me about Christmas last—on Wednesday, 24th March, Toussaint came upstairs to see me with Palmer—I opened the door—they asked to see some diamonds—I showed them the diamonds—they selected about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, and went away saying they would call in the afternoon, they had come from Paris—they showed me a large piece of paper, a bill like that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not see them in the afternoon; I expected them about 5 o'clock—a piano was being moved in—I had bought it for my wife at a sale—I received this letter saying they could not come till the next morning, when they came I showed them also 80 carat diamonds for a bracelet—Toussaint picked some out; Palmer was behind me—I was struck twice on the back of my head and face with something hard—I put up both my hands, which were seriously injured, and one of my fingers very seriously damaged—I went to take the diamonds, and Palmer gave me a blow with both hands, and they took the packets of diamonds and loose diamonds away, leaving their hats on the table—I fell insensible—a doctor came—Toussaint was brought back in custody—my head was bandaged—I was seriously ill, and attended by the doctor for a long time—the total value of things carried away was about 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth have been restored; also the pliers.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Looking for papers</hi>) I have not got that first letter; you say the September letter—I think it was September I received the first—Langrish was out of court when I first gave my evidence—Mr. Bridge asked me if I received a letter from Langrish—I said I gave it to Langrish and he tore it up—I was seen to speak to Langrish as I went out of the Court and he came in—when I returned I admitted to Mr. Bridge that I had said to Langrish as he was passing, "You tore up the letter. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi>—I ask you whether that admission to Mr. Bridge was not after you had over and over again sworn you never uttered a syllable to Langrish? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>—I might have said so.

                  </hi>. I am a coach painter, of 22, Wharfedale Road, King's Cross—on the night of 30th August, about 9.30, I was walking over Battle Bridge, St. Pancras; I saw Munroe in the middle of a crowd, and he wanted a cab to take him to Barnsbury—he was drunk—a four-wheeled cab drew up to the pavement; the cabman said he would not take him without he had some money first—Munroe took a quantity of money out of his right-hand trousers pocket, and gave the cabman some—the cabman said he had only given him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and it was not enough, and he would not take him unless he had more—Taylor, who was stand<lb/>ing next to Munroe, said "I will lend you a hand to get into the cab"—he started to do so, and put his hand into his right-hand trousers pocket and turned it inside out, and about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver fell to the ground; he then got hold of Munroe by the throat and threw him violently against the wall of the bridge; then he threw him on his face on the pavement—Taylor picked up a black bag which Munroe dropped as he fell, and gave it to a shorter man—Munroe cried out "Murder!" when on the ground—Taylor then kicked him twice in his side, and then he and Austin helped him up, and put him in the cab—he had no hat on; I had not seen one—the cabman, who was holding his horses head, got on his box and drove away—Henry Sylvester was with me; we followed the cab to outside All Saints' Church, Caledonian Road, about 300 yards from Battle Bridge—the driver there stopped and pulled Munroe out—I after<lb/>wards saw Shrimpton take the prisoner in custody; we spoke to the con<lb/>stable, and went with him to the station, where I gave a description of Taylor—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man—all I saw Austin do was to help Munroe in the cab—then Munroe asked for his hat; Austin said it was inside, and threw a piece of paper into the bottom of the cab.</p>

I have known Taylor for 18 months by sight—I never knew him work at the gas works—I never had a squabble with him outside a public-house—I left Mr. Collyer's employ because of slack business—I am a bit near sighted, but that was not the cause of my leaving—I have to put a book close to my eyes to read—there is a lamp close on Battle Bridge—there are a good many men like Taylor about; his is a common kind of dress there—there were a good many people on the bridge—Taylor put his hand into Munroe's pocket, and then threw him against the bridge—I was standing about two yards from the prisoner among the crowd—if I had been more than two yards</p>

               <p>I should not attempt to say positively who it was; my vision is not good beyond that distance—Munroe had no hat that I saw; he was drunk—I only recognized the two prisoners of the men who were there—there were about 40 altogether, I think—I am 19—I and Sylvester are friends—I des<lb/>cribed to the policemen the man I have known for 18 months—I did not know his name.</p>

I had never seen Austin before to my knowledge—I went to the police-court first and gave evidence against Taylor, and then when Austin was arrested I went to give evidence against both of them—I went with Sylvester and Williams to the police-station to identify Austin; Sylvester did not do so—I walked up and down the line three times, and then said "This is the man, and touched him"—there was a tremendous scene of confusion and excitement at the place where Munroe was assaulted—Austin was about three yards from him; near enough to take part in the assault if he had chosen, but I did not see him do anything in connection with the assault.</p>

I live at 172, Pentonville Road—on 30th August, at 9.30, I was with Wagner on Battle Bridge—I saw a crowd, and Munroe, who was drunk, looking for a cab—a four-wheeler came along and drew up against the kerb—the cabman said he had only had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and would not take him without he paid his right fare—Munroe gave the cabman his right fare out of his right-hand trousers pocket—then Taylor turned that pocket inside out—the money fell on the ground, and there was a scramble among the people standing round to pick it up—Taylor picked no money up, but helped Munroe into the cab, and as he got his foot on the step he seized him by the throat and <hi rend="italic">shied</hi> him against the railway wall on the other side of the pavement—Munroe was on the ground a little while; Taylor kicked him twice in the side as he was falling; he fell down; his head touched the wall—Munroe had a stick and a bag in his hand, and I saw nothing done with those—when he got up from the ground Taylor took his hat, and passed it to a shorter man—Taylor helped him in the cab, which then drove of—I and Wagner followed it to All Saints' Street to the General Picton public-house—it then stopped, and Munroe was put out—I afterwards saw him leaning against a wall in All Saints' Street—Shrimpton was with him—I made a statement to Shrimpton, and went to the station with him, and described the two men—I cannot recognise Austin by his face—I never picked him out, but the man was very like him—I am sure about Taylor—I was standing not above two yards from him at the time—I am not short-sighted—I have no doubt about him.</p>

Taylor—a short man who is not here, put his hand into Munroe's right-hand trousers pocket—he said "Take your hand out of my pocket; I have two knives in that pocket"—the tall man, who I believe to be Taylor, then threw Munroe badly against the wall of the bridge—a four-wheeled cab was passing—the two prisoners and others called to the cabman, who drew up—seeing Munro was in a stupefied condition he asked for his fare first—Munroe handed him some coppers, but the cabman objected that it was only threepennyworth of coppers—while Munroe was bargaining, the tall man put his hand in Munroe's right-hand trousers pocket, and turned it inside out—his money fell to the ground, and was scrambled for—Munroe got a shove on his face, and was thrown on his face on the ground by the tall man, and was kicked twice in the side—the cabman said "Put him inside and I will take him"—the tall man and two others put him in the cab—Munroe's bag had been snatched out of his hand by a man who is not here, and his hat was taken off his head by the tall man, and put on to another man's head—I did not see Austin do anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been for some time shop assistant at 3, Spring Street—the prisoner came on 1st December, 1885—I had previously been there—he kept the clean cash-book—I had nothing to do with that or with the ledger, they were kept under lock and key by the prisoner—there are three sorts of business, ready money small accounts collected by men who deliver goods, money paid over the counter, and money paid by customers who had books—money paid for a book account would be put into a bowl kept for the purpose, and the men's cash was kept in the same bowl—money taken over the counter was put into an ordinary till under the counter—at the end of the day the money in the till was added up, a memorandum of the amount was written on a slip of paper, and the paper and money were put into the bowl—whoever was there would add up the counter-book and check it with the bowl—then the bowl with all the money and the slip of paper in it, and the counter-book, was handed to the prisoner if he was there to receive it; if he was not there I should lock it in my desk with the counter-book, and hand the key to his wife—that was done regularly at the end of each day—I have never had any complaint from the prisoner that the money in the bowl did not tally with the counter-book or with the slip of paper; I have never heard him complain to any one that he could not make the cash tally—I have no recollection of the two sums being paid by Madame Gallion, nor the one by Mr. Chick—it was the habit of the person who took the money, to enter it in the counter-book and to give the receipt—the receipts to Chick, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and those to Madame Gallion on 16th July and 10th April, are in the prisoner's writing.

I live at 18, Queen Street, Greenwich-my business is to call people in the morning—at 2.30 am. on the 21st I was in my passage, three doors from the prosecutor's house—I heard a noise there—I got up and looked round, and saw Fisher and Shay in the road—I lived alongside Shay for years, and know him well-Shay went home, and Fisher slammed Mr. Tilley's street door and stood in the alley till Shay came back, and then right opposite my door they counted out money and shared it between them-Fisher took some tobacco out of his pocket and gave it to Shay, who put it in his pocket—then they shook hands and bid one another good morning and parted—I was in my passage smoking my pipe; my door was wide open—when I went down the street at 3 o'clock I gave information to the police.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector V</hi>). On Saturday evening, 21st August, I was at the Battersea Police-station—the prisoner came there and said she wanted to tell me something about the poisoning case—she said "I did it," adding "I put the poison into the teapot"—I pointed out to her the serious statement she was about to make, and how it affected herself, and I asked if it was true that she still desired to make the statement—she then made this statement—I took it down in writing as she made it—I read it over to her, and she signed it, and I witnessed it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "21st August, 1886. I, Emily Parry, formerly Vass, under<lb/>standing the probable serious consequences of what I am about to do, desire to make the following statement:—On 26th February last I was in service at Dr. Bayfield's, Soames Villa, Lavender Hill. My fellow-servant, Alice Tharby, and I quarrelled on that day. The same after<lb/>noon Alice made some tea for Mrs. Darling, Mrs. Bayfield's mother, who was staying in the house, which she placed on the dining-room table. She then went upstairs. I was in the scullery at that time, and wishing to spite Alice I determined to put some poison into the teapot, thinking that blame would fall on her. I did not think of what might happen to other persons. I ran from the scullery and took the teapot off the dining-room table out to the surgery. I poured something from several bottles into it, one of which was labelled 'laudanum, poison,' and then put the teapot back on the table in the dining-room. I went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188610250129"/>
               <p>to the pantry, took the jug of milk into the surgery and put some chloroform into it, and replaced it in the pantry. It only took me about five minutes to do all this. I had no thought or intention of poisoning any one; my only idea was to get Alice into a <hi rend="italic">row.</hi> When Alice was locked up I was afraid to tell the truth. I have often since half made up my mind to make this statement, but could not find courage to do it until to-day. I make this statement to clear all blame from Alice Tharby and to ease my own mind.") She was half crying at this time, rather agitated, but she knew what she was telling me, I think—I subsequently received two bottles from Sergeant Drew; that was in Tharby's case—I handed them to Dr. Dupre.</p>

What are you doing?"—I had a severe blow on the head, which knocked me insensible—after a time I got up and walked as far as the Verney Road, and there they again knocked me about in the same cruel manner and broke my head—I was slightly inebriated—I was taken up and carried to a doorstep, and sat</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 33, Albert Road, Peckham, and am employed by Webster and Co., timber merchants, of 85, Grace-church Street—on 29th May, 1878, our firm opened an account with Harnott and Co.—before doing so; I called at their business premises, Commercial Road, and had a conversation with Wadsworth with reference to the firm of Harnott and Co. starting business, and as to their means and position—he said he was starting his nephew, Harnott, in business, at least superintending him—he was a young man; that Harnott had some few hundred pounds, a couple of houses, and security for money; that he (Wadsworth) had made money in business and retired—he gave me his private address—from the house he occupied I knew he must have means to keep it up—then an account was opened—we continued to supply them with goods, and I saw Wadsworth from time to time—Wadsworth transacted the business when I went there—Harnott signed the contracts—I did not deal upon matters of business with Harnott—in March, 1884, in consequence of the account owing to our firm being close on 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I was directed to see Wadsworth at his business place—I went and spoke to him about the overdue account, and suggested that he should see my principals—he said if the business went on all right he should put in about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was then endeavouring to borrow money from his friends—bills were running—I frequently took them up to pre<lb/>vent their being dishonoured—I took a verbal guarantee from Wadsworth for Harnott and Co. when we commenced to do business with them—then there was a written contract, endorsed 5th October, 1883, for 1,067<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was for a specific transaction—there was one to guarantee the whole of the bills running at a later date—these are two contracts pro<lb/>duced entered into between us, dated March 18th and October 24th, 1884, to guarantee all bills running—this is Wadsworth's signature, and this is Harnott's—in January, 1885, Webster and Co. pressed for payment—I have no doubt I saw Wadsworth in February, 1885—I must have seen Harnott and Wadsworth after January, 1885—I cannot remember any particular occasion; the last time I saw Wadsworth on business was towards the end of 1884, or the beginning of 1885—the last contract was made on 30th March, 1884—the delivery would be some time after; probably up to October or November—I never gave as a reason for not dealing with him that no early cargoes had come in.</p>

Ingledew, Ince, and Co., as to the bills falling due—that was some time in April, 1885—I cannot tell you the exact date, as my partner had the management of the affair, and he is abroad—I declined to supply them with further goods—I called at his place of business continually to try and get money—I remember one date, 29th April, 1885—I had called more than once previously—on 29th April, 1885, my partner and I went and asked Wadsworth for money, as he said he had not any money to give us; we told him he must tell us exactly the position of his affairs—I took down on one of his memorandum papers his position, showing that he was insolvent—this is the paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said he had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in stock, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. outstanding debts, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of long stuff, that is to say deals and battens and flooring boards, and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. spent in machinery, and other amounts, making a total of 2,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had no other liabilities but ours and a few bills amounting to 316<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—our account at that time was 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the 2,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. assets he put down 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for outlay on works and machinery—when I told him his statement showed that he was insolvent he said he would get some more money to put into the business by borrowing money on some houses of his, and if we would not press him he should gradually pay us off—bills were already drawn and had fallen due that he had not met and we were pressing him for—nothing was said about supplying more goods—I never told him that we could not sell him any more goods as we had no early cargoes coming in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior clerk to Messrs. Duns, Brown, and Co., timber merchants, of 5, East India Avenue—at the request of our firm I called on Harnott and Co. on 10th April, 1885—I saw Mr. Harnott, who said he did not understand the purchase of fire<lb/>wood, but his uncle, Mr. Wadsworth, took the entire management of the business—by appointment I saw Wadsworth the next day—I asked him why he was desirous of purchasing firewood of us while he was purchasing of With, Webster, and Co.—Wadsworth said Mr. Webster told him they had no early cargoes coming, and were not able to supply him so early as he wished, and that if he purchased of us he should not by consequence leave Webster and Co.—I then asked him if he had an account with them, and if he owed them money; he said "Yes"—I said "Have you sufficient in the yard and premises to pay them?" he said "Ample"—such a reply led me to believe he was solvent—I inquired, and found their bankers were the London and South-Western Bank, Bermondsey branch, and the account was in Wadsworth's name and not Harnott's, and nobody had authority to draw money from the bank but Wadsworth—we opened an account—on 17th April, 1885, a contract was made—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is my writing—it is for timber <hi rend="italic">ex Bondfide</hi>—the account is 496<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—payment was to be half in cash on invoiced amount on ship's arrival, and remainder by acceptances of three months?—the cargo arrived on 12th May—the invoice, delivery order, and documents required are signed "Harnott and Co."—we got two days afterwards 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a bill of acceptance for 248<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we got no more—the bill was renewed—the next contract was dated 16th July, 1855, <hi rend="italic">ex Norwegia</hi>, firewood value 686<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the vessel arrived on 28th July—the terms of the contract were the same as before—we got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 1st August, and acceptances for half the amount, nothing more—the next contract was dated 14th August, 1885, on same terms, <hi rend="italic">ex Myra</hi>, value 543<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the ship arrived 31st August—we did not get a penny, only the acceptances as usual—the last contract was ex <hi rend="italic">Garibaldi</hi>, dated 23rd April, 1885—the ship arrived 28th September—the amount was 868<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the delivery order was duly signed in the ordinary way—we got 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only—there was a subsequent contract, which had not arrived when I returned from the country, and I resold it elsewhere—the date of that was 17th August. 1885, <hi rend="italic">ex Harmonie</hi>, for 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sold at a loss of 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is all I have received for the timber supplied to Harnott and Co.—the liability was 2,098<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th October, when the petition was filed—the amount proved for in the bank<lb/>ruptcy is 2,419<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we saw Wadsworth when we found it necessary to take the bills up ourselves and renew them—I said "Can you give us further security by endorsement?"—Wadsworth said "I have no objec<lb/>tion to do that," and on one or two occasions he put his name on the back of the bill as security—I was induced to supply the goods because of my general view and the impression I formed; I considered Wadsworth a highly</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Finley Road, Peckham—I entered Harnott and Co.'s service in January, 1885, and continued there till about a fortnight previous to their filing their petition—we had considerable timber and match business—I looked upon Wadsworth as one of the firm—I worked under his orders, and very little under Mr. Harnott—Harnott did very little; in fact, I do not know what he did; he came about the place; he was nothing in the clerkship part—I never took instructions from him—I might tell him if I had orders what I was going to do—Wadsworth was over me; he engaged me—he said if I had a business I should get some one to go with me in partnership—he inquired what business it was, and I told him—he said he was going with me into the packing-case business of Harnott and Co. in the Bird and Bush Road, and if I found the business he would find the capital—the firewood business was in the Commercial Road—we started on the business, but I never got the agreement—it was first suggested that I was to have half profits, but when coming into the business I was to have a third—I recollect Harnott and Co. commencing to deal with Duus, Brown, and Co.—before that Wadsworth gave me instructions, and I waited upon them—I cannot recollect what he said; it was to try and see if we could do better—he said he knew Webster and Co.—I did not then know the state of account with Webster and Co.—it might have been to get a better cargo that I was to go to Duus, Brown, and Co.—I called there—I believe he said something about paying too much; we paid every Saturday; that was part of my business—I received the cash from Wadsworth—I paid in both businesses in cash—when I received money I handed it to Wadsworth—I had two cheques drawn in my favour, one on 16th January, 1885, the other in August, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had cheques on 22nd June and onwards, representing a total of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not receive on the 22nd June a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on the same date another cheque for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; nor on the 23rd June four cheques, one for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., two for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sometimes had cheques to cash in the neighbour<lb/>hood by tradespeople for wages—I paid the men in the Bird and Bush Road up to the end of May—the money I got from the tradesmen for the cheques was applied in payment of wages—I have kept no list of such cheques—if a cheque was made payable to me I should endorse it—I did not get very heavy sums in that way, from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not as much as 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in both places I should.</p>

               <p>books from January to July, 1885—I asked Harnott whether there were any return cheques; he said that he had none, he thought they had been burnt or destroyed—I know what I presume to be Wadsworth's writing; I have not looked through these counterfoils, but they appear to be his writing—we saw few exceptions; a number of them are written in favour of H. Smith, and some are "H. Smith, change," and others "H. Smith, wages"—in June, 1885, the counterfoils in favour of H. Smith amount to about 123<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have examined the cash takings book; it all appears to be in Wadsworth's writing, and it seems all to have been written at the same time—December 25th, 1883, is entered here in the ordinary course, as if they were cash takings on that day, and with it is 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 26th is also entered as if there had been cash takings on that day—I also find entries as if cash had been received on one or two Sundays—I have looked in the almanack, and I believe June 8th, 1884, was a Sunday—October 12th was also entered, and that is Sunday—the takings on June 8th are entered 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the other day it is brought down on the Monday 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not find the regular books of the business—the cash takings book commences on September 4th, 1883, and another on June 4th, 1885—I have gone through the other books which should supply these figures, but there does not appear to be anything from which the figures are taken—I found no book from which the cash takings book is made up—there is a book, No. 12, which commences at folio 16, and contains purchases only—since June, 1885, on folio 17, there is an account with Webster—nothing is complete; it is all odds and ends, beginning in one book or another; but June, 1885, is when they tried to do something—there is a cash book then, and you will find balance-sheets each day, out they are not brought forward till the next day—there is nothing to be found about them—it begins on the following day without any balance, that is so all through.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think this was greatly my own fault—my husband was in the Army 21 years and four months, and left with a very high character and five good conduct stripes—he had served the whole of the time that he could possibly serve—I married him while he was in the Army 16 years ago, and have been in Africa with him—he has always behaved well to me, he is a good husband—he had a pension—I have not been a very good wife to him, I have aggravated him very much indeed—drink takes an effect upon me sometimes, and I had been drinking that night—I have created a good many disturbances at Mr. Strangway's, and I once threw a knife at my husband—Mr. Strangway told me he would not keep me if it were not for my husband, and threatened to bring a policeman to the house—I have drunk: with Pain at different public-houses against my husband's wish—I knew that my husband kept a revolver to guard the house, with Mr. Strangway's knowledge, and he has practised with it—I have dared him to fire it—I do not say that he fired the first shot at me, he fired through the window—he was a little nearer than I am to you, but he shot on one side—there was a light in the room, so that he could see me perfectly well—I did not hear a shot when I was on the stairs—if a person fired through the door it would go into the coal-cellar—my husband was at the Savage Club some time after he left the Army.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have dared my husband to fire at me, but he has never presented a pistol at me before—I said at the police-court that I never threw a knife at him in my life, I told an untruth.</p>

I am an Army tutor, of Clarence House, Barnes—the prisoner and his wife were my cook and butler—on Sunday, 6th September, I heard a noise downstairs and then the report of a pistol—I ran to the top of the stairs and saw Mrs. Abrey coming up with a towel round her head with blood on it, and in her night dress—I took her into the sitting room, left her with my wife, went down to the prisoner and said, "I want that revolver, Abrey"—he said, "There it is, Sir; I am just dressing to give myself up"—I said, "That is right, you will have to do so"—he said he was not going to run, and I said I was quite sure he was not—I sent for the police and for Dr. Marqueson, and handed the revolver to the constable.</p>

I am a watchmaker, carrying on business at 95, Lower Addiscombe Road, Croydon—I went to bed on May 10th at 9.30 at night, having properly secured my premises, and at 5.30 next morning I heard a noise downstairs, went down, and saw the staircase window open, and the shop parlour door open, which was shut when I went to bed, and the window curtains of the parlour were disturbed—I went upstairs to get some keys in order to open the shop door, and then heard footsteps in the passage—I went outside—I was crossing the road; I went out to arouse a neighbour next door but one, and after doing so I returned and went to another neighbour; I had to cross the road, and as I did so I looked towards a narrow lane which runs at the bottom of my premises where there are stables, and saw the prisoner Williams running out of the lane—that was after I had got about half way across the road, consequently I returned, and took hold of him at the corner,</p>

               <p>p.m., I was on duty at West Hill, Wandsworth, and heard a crash—I looked in that direction and saw a lot of people shuffling about, and im<lb/>mediately I saw a horse and light spring cart coming in my direction at the rate of from 10 to 12 miles an hour—I held up both hands and shouted "Stop"—when he got within a short distance of me I saw the driver held the reins, but he lowered them—I jumped for them; they were slack, I missed them—the shaft caught me in the right side and knocked me completely round, and the wheel went over my hip—I got up and walked towards the station, just outside of which it had happened; some one helped me—I saw the doctor that night and have been under his care ever since—I am still unfit to resume duty, and I am afraid I shall remain so for some considerable time—I was in uniform—I saw no vehicle other than the prisoner's—when he lowered the reins he was sitting on the driving seat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was about 130 yards from where I was run over when I heard the crash; I ran in the direction from which it came—the collision occurred close to the Rose and Crown, I believe, at the beginning of the High Street—I did not see the trap with which the prisoner came into collision—several vehicles had passed me just before, going towards London; the prisoner was going towards Kingston from London—the prisoner's horse and cart were brought back by a sergeant and constable to the station afterwards—I saw the horse outside when I was taken home by two constables—I did not examine it, and did not see it had a piece cut out of its shoulder—it was a tradesman's cart with one seat across it I should think—I could not say if there was a back to the seat—there were three persons in the cart, they all appeared to be the same size; they were all sitting on the same seat—the cart was on me not a minute after the collision, I should think—I could not say if the prisoner was moving on the seat when the reins dropped; I only saw his hands go down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, of West Hill, Wandsworth—on 24th August, between 9 and 10, I was at my door—I saw a waggonette pass in the direction of London, and immediately after I saw a horse and cart driven by the prisoner approaching and going towards Kingston—the waggonette was going down a slight incline—there was a row of traps in front of the Rose and Crown, which is separated from the Swan by an eating house—I heard a shout, and looking in that direction I saw the prisoner's cart coming up on the right hand side of the road—he ap<lb/>peared to me to pull to the left, to try and avoid the waggonette, but they collided—the waggonette had kept to his side, by the side of the vehicles—the prisoner did not pull up, although called on to do so; he appeared to take no notice—he did not seem to have lost control of his horse—I saw him strike it, I think once, immediately after the collision—the horse then went on at about 10 miles an hour, I should think—it was not a fast horse, I should think, by any means—it went in the direction of Kings<lb/>ton and down the road to where a constable was standing; he went out into the road and put his hands up—the prisoner did not stop in any way—I ran after the cart and I think I called out "Stop him;" I was rather excited—the constable was knocked down and the cart went over him—I caught hold of the cart at the time it was stopped; it was then not more than 30 yards from where the constable had fallen, and 130 or 150 from where the collision occurred.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 68, Lansdowne Road, Clapham, and drive a horse and trap for my father—on this night I was driving a waggonette down High Street towards London—as I got about to the bottom of the hill I saw the prisoner driving a light spring cart and horse in the opposite direction—I was going down on my near side, and he was coming up on the same side, his right-hand side—I called out to him; he seemed to take no notice, and he came into collision with my waggonette by driving on—his shaft cut my horse; I said it scratched it, but it was a cut—the prisoner drove on; he did not stop; he used his whip after he got out of my way, trying to escape—he whipped his horse, and went on till he was stopped—he was coming towards me at the rate of 12 or 14 miles an hour, I should say, and when he left me and drove on he went at a considerable pace.</p>

I am a butcher, of 7, Adam's Terrace, Putney Bridge Road—on this night I was on West Hill, and saw the collision, and the prisoner driving away after it—he had a whip, and whipped the horse after the collision to make it spurt on—he went towards Wimbledon—I saw the constable get out into the road, and put up his hands for him to stop, and the cart knocked him down, and went over him—I saw the horse then run on the pavement, and it was eventually stopped, perhaps, 20 yards from where the constable was knocked down—I ran after it, after I saw the collision, and called to the prisoner to stop—he did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's son, and live at King Charles's Dairy, Brown Road, Surbiton Hill, where my father has carried on business as a dairyman for 26 years—on 24th August I was out with him and my brother driving back in the cart from London to Kingston—going down Wandsworth High Street we saw three other vehicles in the road; a waggon was standing still on the right hand side, and Esling was coming down West Hill with his waggonette in the middle of the road, and then there was a spring cart going towards Kingston in front of us on the left hand side; we were keeping on the right hand side, and Esling turned his horse right towards us, and cut right across to us; the result of that was a collision between us, and the point of his shaft ran into our horse's shoulder—our horse immediately jumped forward and shied and backed, and there were people screaming in the waggonette, and he took fright; the seat dropped down in the cart, and my father lost power over the reins, and away the horse went; my father did not use the whip at all after the collision; I am sure of that—he was doing what he could to stop the horse; he was trying to pull up the reins with all his might, and trying to prevent himself from falling down, by putting his hand on the side of the cart—the horse went away before he could get his reins up—directly he got up and got the reins he stopped the horse as soon as he could—when we stopped, the whip was in the socket—we turned and came back to the police station—I there ex<lb/>amined the horse and found this cut in the shoulder; it was about three inches long and down to the bone—Aspin saw the horse shortly after<lb/>wards—we were all perfectly sober; we had had nothing to drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We had come to the commencement of the hill when the waggonette was coming down—we were on the left-hand side of the road I am sure, not in the middle; we were not as far as we could get on the near side, but there was room for two to pass us—my father, who was driving, did not pull in any way to the near side to avoid a collision, he drove straight on on our proper side—he had not the whip in his hand then, he did not take it in his hand after the col<lb/>lision; it remained in the socket till the constable stopped us—I am positive my father never had it in his hand—he did not hit the horse after the collision—the whip is a hard thing to get out of the socket, it can be taken out—the swing of the cart might give one the impression that the whip was being used—the seat fell at the time of the collision; it was fixed by two little irons on each side, which go into holes; there is a back to it, and it goes right across the cart—the sudden jerk of the stopping would raise the seat up and chuck it down again in the cart—my father fell on the top of me and my brother; we were all at the bottom of the cart—we were not all three sitting on the seat, which was in its proper place, at that time; before the collision we were all sitting on the seat—we did not flounder at the bottom of the cart half a minute, then my father stood up in the cart with the reins in his hand, he col<lb/>lected them directly he could; they were entangled in our legs as we lay at the bottom of the cart—when he got the reins we drove on—I heard a good many shouts of "Stop"—a policeman ran at the side and called on us to stop; my father had got the reins at that time and was</p>

               <p>trying to stop—we went about 150 yards after the collision, and about 30 after the constable had been knocked down—I did not see the constable in the middle of the road holding up his hands, nor did I hear him call out, because so many called out—the police did not stop the horse, I am sure; it was my father alone who stopped it, he had the reins at that time.</p>

About a quarter-past 11 on Friday morning, 17th September, I was with Cox in Fleet Street, where we saw Ryan, whom we knew before—we followed him into the Strand—he passed the <hi rend="italic">Graphic</hi> office, 190, and went to the corner of Wellington Street, where he was joined by Stevens—neither of them were carrying anything—I then followed them across Waterloo Bridge into the Belve<lb/>dere Road, Lambeth, where Stevens turned into College Street, and I lost sight of him—Ryan meantime had turned into a public-house, the Rising Sun, at the far end of Vine Street—about five minutes afterwards we saw Stevens coming along Vine Street from the direction of College Street, carrying this parcel under his arm and a jug in his hand—he entered the Rising Sun, and went into the compartment Ryan was in—after about two minutes both prisoners came out together, Ryan carrying the parcel, and Stevens the jug; after a short conversation they parted—Cox went after Stevens, and I followed Ryan—I overtook him in the York Road and said "You know me, I am a police officer;" he said "Yes"—I said "What have you got there?" pointing to the parcel; Ryan said "Paper"—I said "What have you got inside of it?" he said "A few <hi rend="italic">Graphics</hi>"—I said "Where did you get them from?" he said "I have just bought them from the publishing office in the Strand"—I said "I shall take you into custody, you will be charged with being concerned with another man in the unlawful possession of them"—he said nothing—I said "Where are you going to take them to?" he said "That is my business"—I took him to the station—the parcel contained 36 copies of the <hi rend="italic">Graphic</hi> of the 17th September issue.</p>

I know nothing about a parcel"—I told him I should charge him with being concerned with another man with the unlawful possession of this parcel—he said "I know nothing of a parcel or man either"—I took him to the station, where he was charged; he gave the address, 16, College Street—it was in that direction he went when he left Ryan, and he came back to Ryan at the Rising Sun from the direc<lb/>tion of College Street—No. 16 is about 100 yards from the public-house—when Stevens was charged at the police-station he made no reply.</p>

I am manager of the printing department of the <hi rend="italic">Graphic</hi>—Stevens has been employed by the proprietors for 13 or 14 years as a printer's labourer—he is employed generally on Wednesday afternoon, Thursday, Thursday night, and Friday afternoon, sometimes longer, and he is put on one of the folding machines—different portions of the <hi rend="italic">Graphic</hi> are completed on different days of the week; each portion as printed is taken to the folding-room, and Stevens's duty was to take the completed portion and put it on the folding machine—on Thursday night we run the machine from 8 o'clock continuously, so that we have three men to do the work of two, and each man works two hours and rests one—Stevens would do so, and at the end of two hours he would be entitled to go off the premises and then come on for another two hours—he would several times go off the premises during his spell of work—at the premises in Milford Lane about 200 hands are employed altogether—in that particular department there were 47 that week—the same rule applies to the men on the printing machine, two hours on and one off, so that at a certain time a number of men would be going off the premises—no doubt they get a little opportunity if they think proper of taking out a portion of the paper with them—copies of the <hi rend="italic">Graphic</hi> have been missing to the extent of 300 or 400 some weeks—it is the property of H. R. Baines and Co., Limited—these copies were published that week—the earliest time at which copies are sold to the general trade is 10 o'clock on Friday morning—at 4 a.m. they are delivered to wholesale agents for the country—a person in the folding department could abstract the last part of a com<lb/>pleted number at 6 or 7 o'clock on Thursday evening.</p>

I am a fly driver, and live in Strathmore Road, St. James's Road, Croydon—on 3rd September last I went into the Oakfield Tavern about 7 o'clock; I was by myself—the prisoner was there when I went in, and several other people, including a Mr. Shoebridge—I was talking to Miss Dowden, the barmaid, when the prisoner said to her, "You are a nasty, dirty little faggot, and you have no business to be behind the bar; you are almost as bad as the girls who are on the town"—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself for using such language; he then turned upon me and called me everything he could lay his tongue to—I cannot remember what it was, it was very filthy language—he said he had killed men and women wholesale in America—he appeared to be quite sober—I saw him take a pair of scissors from his pocket and rub them up and down as if he was sharpening them—that was after he had called me these names—I left him and went into a private compartment—I heard him going out—I came out of the private compartment and saw him coming out—I asked him if he would apologise—he said, "I have done nothing to apoligise for, and he would see me b—first"—he then went out—some three or four minutes afterwards I and Shoebridge went out together to go home; I saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the road, six or seven yards from the public-house; I could not say to a yard—I had to pass him to go home—when I got up to him I did not speak to him, nor he to me, but he made a blow at me—I guarded it off as well as I possibly could with my arm; immediately afterwards I received another blow over my eye, which I found was a blow with some sharp instrument—I did not see how he gave me the blow: it struck me just under the eye, and again just by the eyebrow; the first time he only struck me with his fist; he made the one blow and then the two stabs with the scissors—I called out that I was stabbed, and fell back into some one's arms; I don't know who it was</p>

I am house surgeon of the Croydon General Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there on 3rd September last—he was under my care in the hospital until 25th September, when I was at the police-court—when he was admitted he had two punctured wounds, one entering the orbit and one just above the eyebrow, and there was considerable effusion of blood behind the globe of the eye, which rendered it difficult to see what amount of injury was sustained by the eye at that time—it was a wound that must have been caused by some sharp instru<lb/>ment—I should say that the wound in the orbit was probably inflicted by the points of the scissors—the two wounds could have been caused by one blow of the scissors if they had been open—one wound was on the eye<lb/>brow and one just below it—he was discharged from the hospital but was ordered to come and see me periodically—one morning a fortnight ago I saw him and he then had symptoms of sympathetic ophthalmia in the other eye—I immediately ordered him in, in order to have the injured eye removed—the other eye will not be affected now, but probably if the first had remained it would have been—I should say it would not be affected now—a very slight blow would be sufficient to drive the points of the scissors into the orbit.</p>

I live at 4, Bronte Place, Trafalgar Road, Old Kent Road—on 20th October, Mr. Booth gave me some instructions to go with a barrow of morocco skins with the prisoner at a quarter to 11—I did not know where I was going with them—I had not taken skins to Mr. Nicholls before—I started with the prisoner and with the barrow; when I got a few yards away from the warehouse, the prisoner asked me if I knew Fenchurch Street—I said, "Yes;" he then followed me till I got to the New Kent Road—I looked round and could see nothing of him—I was there at least ten minutes, when a strange man came up to me, and asked if I worked for Mr. Booth—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I have got to go with you"—I said, "Where is the other man"—he said, "He has got to go somewhere else"—going by the Bull public-house, opposite Weston Street, I saw the prisoner with his face turned towards the public-house doors—he saw me and the strange man go past him, because his face was turned towards me as I went past; he turned round; he was one and a-half or two yards from me—as we were going down the Dover Road, the strange man asked me if I knew Mr. Booth—I said, "Yes"—he said, "He is my father, and young Tom is my brother"—the prisoner's name is Tom Baldwin—when we got to St. George's Church I stopped with the barrow, and the strange man went into the public-house at the corner of Swan Street; then the prisoner came up to me and waved his hand for me to go—I did not know at first what he meant; he then came up and told me to walk on slowly round by St. George's Church—I don't know where the strange man was at this time, but he came back again and followed me—I went round by St. George's Church, and then the strange man took me to Mr. Nicholls', Fenchurch Street; a porter there took the skins into the warehouse—the strange</p>

Blanc and see what we can do between us'—he never came near me again—I went and saw him again; I got nothing from him—I gave information to the police, and he was arrested—I parted with my money for the cheque, solely on his representation that Mr. Blanc had money at the bank.</p>
