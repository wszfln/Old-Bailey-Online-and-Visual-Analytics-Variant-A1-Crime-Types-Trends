            . On the 14th of February, I was servant to the prosecutrixs. I was not the last person up that night, and did not fasten up the house - I got up about five o'clock next morning, and found it all quite safe. I missed two bottles of wine from the shop, and 2 lbs. of candles from the cellar; they were safe the night before. I do not know how the persons got in. There is an iron grating before the cellar, if that was lifted up persons could get in.</p>

            . I lived with Mr. Bone at Tottenham; but am now out of place. I know the prisoners. On the night of the 14th of February, I saw them coming from Mrs. Haggars's, about midnight - it was either on a Thursday or a Friday night, I cannot say which: I saw them come out of the cellar grating; they had something with them. I said nothing to them - I saw them again a few days after, and told them I saw them coming from Mrs. Haggars - they bid me hold my tongue, and say nothing about it; this is all that passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How do you get your living at this time. - A. I am supported by my mother. I told nobody what I had seen. I was coming from London at the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say nothing more to them - A. Nothing more. I am certain I said nothing more to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you afterwards at Mrs. Haggars yourself - A. Yes; I went there with two others, and went again on the 2d of March, between three and four o'clock in the morning - we got in at the grating - we were disturbed, and did not stay. I first told of this when I was apprehended, which was about a fortnight after the 2d of March. I have known the prisoners seven or eight years.</p>

On the 28th of April, about twenty minutes before eight o'clock in the morning, I put some plate out to clean, on the dresser in the pantry, which fronts the area steps - a person could not see it passing along the street, unless he stood on the area steps of Mr. Goldsmith's, next door. I went into the kitchen for three or four minutes; as I returned from the kitchen to the pantry, I saw a man go through the area gate dressed in a darkish frock coat. In consequence of what the kitchen maid said, I looked and missed the plate, this was within a minute of when I returned - I immediately put on my jacket, ran up the area steps, and into the New-road, with Mr. Adams. I saw two men in custody half an hour after; they ran through the house, No. 14, in York-court - we found one in the privy, and the other by the dust-hole. We lost twenty-seven silver forks, twelve spoons, a silver mug, three sauce ladles, a fish slice, a butter knife, and a sallad fork, all silver; also four plated dishes. I found them all at the Apollo, public-house, the same morning, about eight o'clock, in possession of Morris, the officer. I cannot say whether it was one of the prisoners, who I saw go up the steps; but one of them had a dark frock coat on when taken.</p>

On the morning of the 28th of April, about a quarter before eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner Connor dressed in a blue frock coat, and blue trowsers - he came up the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140004"/>prosecutor's area steps, with a bundle which rattled, and appeared to me like plate; I alarmed the servant maid - Coleman came up immediately; I watched Connor to the New-road end of Harley-street, and gave an alarm to some persons on horseback, who pursued. I ran into Paddington-street, and East-street, and in a back yard in York-court, we found the two prisoners - Cooley was just coming out of the privy; Connor was shuffling about close by the dust-hole - they were both out of breath, and had been running. I knew Connor again, and am sure he is the man who came up the area steps. We kept them until the constable came. Cooley wanted to speak to Coleman. I saw the plate in Morris's possession. I did not see Cooley till I got to York-court, which is half or three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>

As she stood at the counter I saw the second print I had showed her under her shawl; I said nothing until I could be certain it was ours. I missed it from the counter - she was going out, and I went after her; she had got to the door. I saw a woman go from her. I brought the prisoner back, but she had not got the print - I am sure she had it when she went to the door - I have not found it. She said she lived round the corner, at the first butter shop.

On Saturday morning, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was coming ashore, and thought I saw something bulky in his breast - I looked and saw he had a new jacket on under his own. I told the chief mate, and we followed him to the bottom of Fox-lane - he turned into a stable yard; we went together, and met him coming out at the gate. I said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man who had the jacket on" - he said,</p>
               <p>"I had no jacket on but this," and opened his breast to shew us. I said,</p>
               <p>"You must have left it in this stable," and went to look for it; but there was a passage leading from the stable where I did not search. Wood found it there.</p>

I am not certain whether I left anybody there or not, or whether I locked the outer door. I returned about ten o'clock, and found a note on my table, which I now produce. Next morning, I missed from my book shelf Bacon's Abridgment, seven volumes, octavo, which were safe the preceeding day, and a tortoise-shell snuff box, with a painted lid, which was on the table in the course of Saturday. I found the books on the Saturday following, at Cooper's shop, in Fisher's-alley. They have marginal notes, in my own hand writing - I found the snuff box in pawn afterwards.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Addison. I was gone to dinner when he left the chambers. After I returned, the prisoner came to the chambers, a little past eight o'clock, and asked how long Mr. Addison had been out - I said I had not seen him since four o'clock. He said he would write a note to him, and went into Mr. Addison's room; I followed him in - he asked if Mr. Addison had Bacon's Abridgment; I said Yes; he told me to get them down for him - I did so, and asked if he wanted them for Mr. Whiting, whose name he had mentioned. He said. Yes, and took them away. I had not noticed the snuff box. I saw Mr. Addison on Monday; he said Bacon's Abridgment was gone - I said a man had been for them. (Looks at the note,) this is the note he left. On the Thursday following, I went with Limbrick, to the prisoner's house, in Clarence-street, Rotherhithe - I saw him, and told him a gentleman was waiting for him at the bottom of the street; he said he would come to him immediately. I returned to Limbrick; we waited half an hour for him; he did not come; we went to the house, but could not find him - we went again on the Sunday following, and took him. I have seen the books since, and know them to be my master's, (Note read.)</p>

I went to him, and asked what he was going to do with it - he said he was going to lend it to a man, to whitewash a room, as he had no ladder. He had been in our service for eighteen months. I asked the man's name and residence; he could not tell me, but said he became acquainted with him at the White Horse, public-house, Baldwin's-gardens, and was to meet him at the corner of Baldwin's-gardens. All the property in the gateway was ours.</p>

            . I am in the service of the prosecutors. I was coming down West-street, about eight o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner coming from the premises with the board on his shoulder - he was bringing it out; part of it was in the yard when I first saw him. I stopped him - he said he was going to lend it to a person to whitewash.</p>

On the 29th of April, about a quarter before seven o'clock in the evening, I fastened all the windows and double locked the door; I slept there every night; but was going up to another house of mine at Edgware. Between five and six o'clock that evening the prisoner had rang at the bell, and asked if one Mr. Gurney did not lodge there; I referred him a few doors further on. While I was at Edgware, between half-past eight and nine o'clock, I was sent for - I got back to the house before it struck nine; it had been dark about an hour. I found the door shut, but a crowd of people round it - I applied the key, and found it on the single lock. I am positive that I double locked it; I went in, and found the back door, which I had double bolted and barred, wide open, and a pair of steps moved from where I had put them, and set against the party wall. I found somebody had scratched the wall leading to the mews with his feet, in endeavouring to get over. I went down stairs to get a light, and found the matches disturbed, which I had left on the tinder box. Upon going up stairs, I found a glass moved from the table by the window, and the trap door leading to the loft open, but not the trap door above the loft, so that a person could not get on the roof. I found about an inch of wax candle, which had been lighted, in the back area. There was a fire in the back kitchen, by which the matches must have been lighted. I am certain the prisoner is the person who rang at the bell - I did not know him before.</p>

            . I live in Horse Shoe-yard, Lower Brook-street. About a quarter past eight o'clock on the evening in question, I was in Upper Berkley-street; it was duskish; all the lamps were lighted - I could not distinguish a man's features to know him a short distance off. I was passing down on the opposite side of the street with my wife, (the prosecutor is my brother-in-law) - my wife said,</p>
               <p>"There is somebody gone into Mr. Well's house;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Well, I thought so" - we crossed over and went up to the door, and found it closed. I had been there about an hour and a half before with Wells. We hesitated for some time, and presently I saw a light come up as if from the kitchen - I gave a very loud double knock at the door, and the light disappeared. I crossed to the other side of the way. There was a tall man walking up and down; he gave two or three very loud Halloes! and while I crossed over, he crossed to the same side as the house, and walked up and down. My wife stood at the door, and rang the bell; I told her she had better go to Portland-place, and fetch Mr. Wells; she went, and I guarded the door. The man passed me two or three times, and so did the watchman. I stood with my back against the iron railing, about two feet from the door. About forty minutes past eight o'clock, the prisoner opened the door, and came out - I stepped up, and collared him, and asked what business he had there; he said he found the door open - I called the watchman. A mob collected, and wanted me to let him go. His coat and trowsers were all covered with lime white, as if he had attempted to get over the wall - I gave him in charge. I went to the back of the premises, and found the whitewash all scratched off the wall leading to the mews, and three or four of the bricks pushed into the gutter. I think it must have been about twenty minutes past eight o'clock when we saw him go in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140011"/>- it was a quarter to nine when we took him to the watch-house; it was too dark to discern a person's countenance.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Upper Berkley-street. I saw Hart by Wells's house twice; when I called eight o'clock and half-past eight - when I was calling half-past, I was fetched, and took the prisoner from Hart to the watch-house; he kept knocking the white off his clothes all the way as he went along. I found upon him a latch key, a small bag with two halfpence, and a small piece of wax candle, and a large bundle handkerchief.</p>

We left nobody in the house; the window shutters and the back door were bolted; I stood at the front door when she locked it; she left every thing secure, and took the key with her; we returned about twelve o'clock at night, and found the door shut to; it is a spring lock; we opened it with the key, and found a bundle tied up in a blanket in the front parlour, ready to be removed. I sat up all night in the room where the bundle was, and am certain the same bundle was taken to the office; it appeared to contain a bed. I had left some green baize up stairs when I went out; I left one piece on a hamper, and the other on the bed. I went up stairs at night, and found the bed and baize, and quilt and blanket gone. I live with Mrs. Gillings; she has left her husband. A piece of cheese was also gone, weighing 4 lbs. The bed was on the mattrass in the morning when I saw it. They were all tied up in the blanket in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Mrs. Gillings lives with you - A. Yes; Mr. Gillings does not live in the house; he gave his wife the house; it is his property; we pay no rent for it. The bed is his wife's. He does not visit her, nor ever comes to the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long is it since he lived with his wife - A. Not since September; he never lived in this house himself at any time; he pays the taxes; I have lived there six months with his wife.</p>

            . I am a master carman. On the 24th of April, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was going home - it was moon-light. I went into Elizabeth-place, and met the two prisoners and another man. knew Wilford before. I was forty or fifty yards from the house.

I knocked at the door of the next house to Gillings's, and asked if they had been robbed; they said No. I looked at Gillings's door, and saw it three parts open; I knocked at next door again, and alarmed them, and went after the prisoners. I met Mullins, who directed us which way they had ran; I ran, and caught the prisoners in a place called the Five Chimnies, and pulled the bundles off each of their backs; I said,</p>
               <p>"You bl - thieves, you have stolen these." Wilford immediately knocked me down with a stick; I jumped up at him; he knocked me down again; I got up again, and he knocked me down a third time. I hallowed out, and they ran off; I pursued; they were both stopped in Regent-street, without my losing sight of them, and taken to the Ship, public-house, Vauxhall-road. The third man escaped. The bundles remained where I had pulled them off their backs. I went back, and carried one bundle back to the house, and Smith carried the other; we put them down in the front parlour. I left the next door neighbour in possession of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had they both a bundle - Yes; I kept them in sight all the way; I was not above twenty yards behind them; it was not above half-past nine o'clock.</p>

I ran down stairs, and assisted in taking Wilford, who was running. As we were taking him along he dropped a dark lanthorn, which I caught as it fell. We took him to the Ship. The other prisoner was brought in about the same time; I proposed to search them; somebody said I had no authority; I said I was an officer. Nibbs immediately dropped three skeleton keys: one of them fell on the floor, and I caught two as they fell; they are different sizes; Wilford also dropped the key of a clock.</p>

            . I live in Regent-street, Vauxhall-road. On the 24th of April, at twenty minutes past nine o'clock at night, I was at supper, and heard a shuffling noise coming along the street; there was a cry of Thief! I ran out, and saw Wilford running on the opposite side of the way, and Nibbs running on my side, in the gutter. He halloed out,</p>
               <p>"There he goes! Stop thief!" It struck me that he was one of them. I ran down the steps, overtook, and collared him. He said,</p>
               <p>"I am not the man; why do you detain me?" Bowen, who was behind, came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is one that I stopped with a bundle on their heads in Five Chimnies-passage; and there goes the other who knocked me down three times." I said,</p>
               <p>"Go after him." He did so, and I detained Nibbs till Wilford was brought back. Both were taken to the Ship Nibbs wanted to get his hand into his left trowsers pocket but I held his arm; he said he wanted to pull out his handkerchief. Nibbs said he was not the man. When I was proposed to search him he pulled four skeleton key<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140012"/>out of his pocket, and dropped them; I took up one of them, and Bowen took the other three.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the Ship about ten o'clock, and found the prisoners in custody. After we had taken them to the watch-house, I pulled a handkerchief off Nibbs' neck, which has the marks taken out of it. I went to Wilford's lodging with the key which he said belonged to his door or box; it opened the padlock on the door. I searched the room, and found two regular skeleton keys and some other keys, which have been filed; I found five fine files there. I have known him many years, and know he has lived there for the last two years. Some of the keys were on his work bench. I stripped and went up the chimney, and found a surgeon's instrument case, containing two lancets and a probe. I was at the office next morning when the bundles were produced, and have had them ever since; Bowen brought them to the office; I found a piece of cheese in one of them.</p>

             re-examined. I sat all night in the room with the bundles - I found them tied up in the front parlour on coming home. They were put into the cart in the same state they were then in.

               <p>GEORGE GILLINGS. The house No. 8, Elizabeth-place, is my leasehold property. I pay the ground rent and taxes - I built it last spring, but never lived in it. I let it for a quarter to another person. My wife wished to leave me - I told her she should have that house to live in, and the goods also - the furniture in it is mine; it was moved from Garden-street, where I live; she left me in September - I allowed her to take what furniture she liked - I knew she was going to live there with this man, because she had encouraged him in the house where I lived. I never had any conversation with him about the house. I told my wife if she chose to leave me, she might have the house to live in, and the things for her use; that is all. I have paid no taxes, but I have got a bill for them, which I must pay. I have two more houses adjoining this. I did not take a list of what furniture she took, but I know what I gave her - I had no concern with Websdale. I gave the house to my wife to live in. I know the bed, bolster, and two pillows to be mine, by the pattern; I had had them about three years, and gave them to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You gave them for her use - A. Yes; I did not know at that time that Websdale was to live with her, but suspected it; we had no intention of coming together again.</p>
               <p>Q. You never intended to claim her or the furniture again - A. I can't tell what may happen sometime or other. I never put any servants in the house. I have not attempted to separate her from this man; I ask him how he is when I meet him. I never intended to occupy the house myself; I never drank tea with Websdale there.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not intend to claim the furniture again - A. I do not know what I might do if it pleased God to take her. Taxes have been demanded, but I was not at home, so I did not pay them.</p>

            . On the 26th of April, I was at Mr. Smith's lodging. I went to bed about eleven o'clock. Smith has an outer door leading into the street, which I locked and bolted. I did not examine the shutters - there is a wooden partition between Mr. Smith's shop, and another shop, forming I believe part of the premises, kept by Mr. Wilson; but there is no direct communication from one to the other. About one o'clock in the morning I was disturbed by a noise at the street door, as if some person was attempting to get in; I listened for five minutes, when it ceased - in a few minutes it began again; I listened, and thought I heard some persons whisper; I slept on the same floor as the shop. I got quietly out of bed, and softly opened the door, saw something dark by the door, and found it was a chair - I saw the prisoner crushed up by the door, in a corner; I collared him, and demanded who he was; he did not speak - I struck him with the chair; a struggle ensued. I gave an alarm; the watchman came, and demanded admittance; I told him to force the door open, which he did. I gave the prisoner in charge of Foley. I got a light, but could not see how he got in. I enquired of him how he got in; I threatened him, and in consequence of what he said, I went and examined Wollat's shop, and found a pannel had been removed between Wollat's and Smith's shop - it was a very small hole, but a small person might get through - I should have thought the prisoner could not get through there; he could have got in no other way that I know of. I did not examine the shop when I went to bed, and cannot say whether any one was behind the counter or not. The shopman had left about half-past eight o'clock. I found Smith's door unlocked, and the key in my door.</p>

             re-examined. I returned about eleven o'clock on the Sunday morning, and saw the opening in the pannel; it had been removed by boring holes round it, and then forcing it out. The holes were not bored all the way through; I should think the prisoner could not get through there. If the holes had been bored the night before, I think I must have seen them. I do not believe it was possible that the prisoner could be in the shop when I left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You think he could not pass through the hole - A. No; it was ten inches and a half square - he might; he is thin made about the shoulders.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the house at ten o'clock on Sunday morning, and looked through the hole in Smith's shop. I saw the pannel lying in Wollat's shop, and a chisel under the hole, on Wollat's side, some pieces of wood, and a gimblet. The pannel came against a counter on Smith's side; the aperture was about ten inches and three quarters square. Smith's shopman got through the hole into Wollat's shop, and opened the door - I went in, and found it was quite easy to get through when the counter was moved, as it was then open the full size of the pannel.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. A person in Wollat's shop could not have removed the counter - A. No.</p>

The prisoner lived at my house about six weeks prior to the 26th of April, on which day I missed this property, and got a constable - I told him I suspected him, and he had better confess; he afterwards took us to Mr. Field's, an old iron shop in Long-court - he went in, and asked for a bundle, which a woman there gave him; it contained a quantity of duplicates of my property. I returned to the shop with him, and saw two of my decanters and a glass, and brought them away. He then took us to a shop in Market-street, and there picked out himself a number of my glass coolers, wine and finger glasses. This was a rag shop kept by Martin. I found my window curtains in pawn. The property was missed at different times.</p>

             applied to me early in March, on account of ill-health - I gave him medicine, and attended him up to the time of his decease. On the 22d of April, I saw a mark under his left eye; it was a considerable bruise, apparently from a blow - leeches had been applied to it before I saw it. He complained of no other mark; there was no other external mark. Previous to this, he was under great debility, and indigestion. I continued to apply remedies until his death - I thought nothing serious whatever from the mark on his eye. On the 1st of May, about one o'clock, I was called in; he was then very ill and sick, and complained of pain in the region of the stomach; he made no complaint respecting his head - he died in a spasmodic fit while I was with him. I opened the body with Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Lake. The membrane of the brain, on the upper surface, had suffered inflammation - there were sufficient diseases in the head, to lead me to suppose it might occasion death. There was an adhesion of the outer membrane, and the outer surface of the scull. External violence would produce those appearances. I opened the body; the heart was in a very diseased state with a quantity of bloody serem; this might have produced all the appearances in the head. The heart had doubtless been diseased for a length of time, and might have produced the inflammatory appearance on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person was suffering from the disease in the heart, and received external violence, might it accelerate his death - A. Very probably. I think the wound under the eye had very little to do with it, for he made no complaint of it; it appeared no more than a common black eye - a blow on the head might have accelerated his death. I examined the back part of the scull - there did not appear any bruise there. I think the serem on the heart was not produced by violence. A person in this state would suffer more from a blow than another.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If he had received a blow, so as to produce inflammation, would it not have produced pain, which he would have complained of - A. I should certainly think so. The appearance in the head might arise entirely from the state of the heart.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Fore-street. I was present when the body was opened, and fully agree with Mr. Wadd's statement. A person in that state of body receiving a violent blow was likely to accelerate his death, and if he was intoxicated at the time, it would be more likely to be in a state of inflammation. Intoxication alone might have caused it.</p>

On the 20th or 21st of April, I was sitting at my table with Tate, who was a good deal in liquor - he had an altercation with one Barnstaple - in consequence of which the prisoner interfered. After some words had passed between them, Tate was removed by Smith to his own seat, and we prevailed on him to be quiet. Some conversation passed between the prisoner and somebody, and Tate said,</p>
               <p>"It's a d - d lie," or</p>
               <p>"It's a lie," I do not know which. The prisoner at that time was sitting on the opposite side - he immediately came across the ward, and struck Tate, who was sitting at the table with his arms folded; he struck him on the left cheek, and another blow on his head; immediately after Tate received the blow, his head fell on the table, as if he was stunned. The prisoner collared him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you come out, and face me like a man?" No more blows passed - Tate said nothing. I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't strike a man who is sitting down, it is so unmanly;" I prevailed upon him to let him alone. I believe his nose bled but he was subject to that. The prisoner went to his own side of the ward. Tate sat as if in a stupor for four or five minutes - his face was swollen immediately after the blow. When he came down stairs next morning he complained of his head, and afterwards, and particularly on the day he died. We prevailed on him to go to the sick ward on the day he died; he had not complained of his head before the blow; but he had complained of being bilions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He complained of his head every day did he - A. Yes. I saw him drunk frequently after that.</p>

            . I was a prisoner at the time, and saw this quarrel. Tate was sitting down at the time the blow was given - he called Latham a liar, twice; he said if he called him a liar again, he would strike him; he did so, and Latham hit him on the side of his face - Tate said</p>

            . I was a prisoner at the time. I heard a quarrel between the deceased and Barnstaple - hasty words arose, and Latham said something to Tate, that he had no business to interfere; in consequence of which Tate went, and sat down in his own seat, with his arms crossed, leaning his head back. Something more passed. Tate called the prisoner a d - d liar; he instantly moved, and struck him, saying he would suffer no man to call him a liar; he struck him on the left eye - I did not see that it had any particular effect, except bruising his cheek. He sat up, and said it was unfair; he was intoxicated at the time - they were violent blows. I saw him next day with his face tied up. I was in the room for half an hour after; during that time Tate got up, and walked about as usual. I saw him intoxicated several times after that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he complain,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140015"/>of his head during all that time - A. I never heard him. I believe the wardsman fined them both 1 s. for their behaviour. He had his hat on when the blows were struck.</p>

            . I was in the prison, but was not present at the quarrel. After the death of the deceased, I went over to Latham's ward to see a friend; I told the prisoner it was a pity he had not conducted himself differently, in consequence of the death of the man; he said he did not see any reason why he should not play as usual; and that he had not caused the man's death; and if I had said the same to him, he should have served me the same.</p>
               <p>MR. E. LLOYD. I am a surgeon, and live in Falcon-square. I was present at the opening of the body; there were appearances of inflammation in the head, and of bruises under the left eye, but no appearance of any other external injury; the dura mater appeared of a darker colour than usual, and a greater adhesion than natural; this was produced by inflammation.</p>
               <p>Q. Might the inflammation he produced by external injury - A. Certainly; the appearance might be occasioned by the state of the heart, but in my judgment no to that extent; there was a greater appearance of blood on the back of the head than usual. It was stated that the blow he received drove his head against the wall, which might have produced those appearances. When the brain is affected in consequence of the heart, the vessels easily become full, but in this case they were fuller than they would usually be from that. I think the inflammation was not wholly occasioned by the state of the heart; intoxication would produce the same effect as the influx of blood from the heart; the blow would have been a sufficient cause to produce it. Though I have no doubt but the blow accelerated his death, still I think it would not have happened had not disease previously existed; he might have lived some months under the disease.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are supposing a blow given which caused a counter-blow on the back of the head - A. Yes; the blow under the eye might have caused it; intoxication would not occasion such appearances. I never saw him before death, but can say he had not apoplexy, for appearances of that may be traced years afterwards. Intoxication in his state might occasion death.</p>

I saw him every day; he never complained of any effects from the blow; I was particularly friendly with him. I think he was drunk on the day after it happened.

I saw a pearl brooch in her possession a Sunday or two before she asked me to pawn it; this was in March - she said it had been pawned before, but did not say where. I pawned it for her at Muncaster's, and gave her the duplicate, and money - she waited outside the door the while.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 15th of March, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening. I went out; it was quite dark then - I left the house quite safe, and locked the door. I left nobody at home. I returned about five minutes before eight o'clock, and found the street door wide open - I am quite certain I had locked it, for I tried it afterwards. I found somebody had entered the house - I got a light, and found the cupboard doors open. I went up stairs, and missed my bed, and a patchwork quilt. The drawers too were open, and the articles stated in the indictment gone, and a great many other things taken out. I have since seen a silk handkerchief, and a few pair of stockings. The value of the whole is from 25 l. to 30 l. (Looking at a handkerchief and some stockings, produced by Pace) here are three stockings I know by any own mark on them, and another pair by the old fashioned silk clocks, and another pair I know by the darning. The handkerchief was marked with white thread; it is picked out now; the appearance of it having been picked out is quite plain. The persons must have got into the house by a false key, for the lock was not injured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The handkerchief is not an uncommon pattern - A. No; I have often washed it. I know my own darning.</p>

            . I am an officer, I look the handkerchief off Wilford's neck, and found the stockings at his lodgings, about twelve o'clock on the 24th of April. I had apprehended them both at ten o'clock that night, at the Ship, public-house, in the Vauxhall-road. I had known where Wilford lived for two years - I have seen him and Nibbs together at a public-house in Duck-lane at times, for two or three months back - they were acquainted before the 15th of March. The door of Wilford's room was padlocked. Woodley who went with me, opened it with a key, which he took from Wilford; he is not here - he is a constable, and had them in custody when I went there. I had been at Wilford's lodgings before, and saw him there several times - a woman lived there with him, and nobody else. I found the room empty; I had seen a padlock on the door when I have been in the house before. On searching the room and bed, I found these stockings, and some of them were hanging over a chair in the room. I noticed the letter C on some of them, and brought them away. I found a large quantity of keys there; here are two skeleton keys and four filed keys. I found five files, two large, and three small - one of the files was on his work bench, with a screw driver. I have not tried any of the keys at Coultas's house. I found nothing particular on their persons except the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found them five or six weeks after Coultas was robbed - A. He was robbed on the 15th of March. A number of persons lodge in the same house as Wilford; there are girls of the town there; it is a common lodging house - he is a shoemaker, and had the lower rooms. The woman who lived with him has left him - the last time I saw her was at the bar of this Court, from which she was transported - I think it was the Sessions before last. I found the prisoners in custody together - I was not present when they were taken. I had not been to Wilford's rooms for twelve months before, but I have passed by, and seen him in the room, a week, or perhaps a fortnight before he was apprehended. I have seen another woman in the room with him since the one I spoke of was gone. I understand he lived with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Shoemakers use files in their business - A. They use very coarse ones. I do not think the three small ones are such as they use.</p>
               <p>MRS. COULTAS. The house was very dirty; but I cannot say whether there were footmarks of one or more persons.</p>
               <p>NIBB'S Defence. I have had the handkerchief for twelve months. She said at the office, that she did not mark it herself.</p>

               <p>MR. WHITE. I am a surgeon. I was called in on the 9th of May, to attend on the deceased, at a public-house in Theobald's-road, and found him in the arms of three or four persons, in the back yard; he was very black in the face. I ordered him to be put to bed, when I opened his arm, but could only extract two ounces of blood - I then opened the jugular vein, from whence came about fourteen ounces; he died soon afterwards, as I was informed. I left him because I knew nothing could be done for him. I opened the head next evening, as the Coroner's Inquest sat on the body - I found about four ounces of extravasated blood pressing on the brain. His death was caused by some violence; I should think external - there have been instances where a vessel has been ruptured by violent exertion, but I have never witnessed one myself. I consider the agitation of the mind of the deceased might contribute to form the rupture.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. A rupture might be caused by the mind being violently affected with passion, and a great effusion of blood, pour on the brain - A. Yes.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Bridges, in Hatton-wall, and am a baker. I knew the deceased - I saw him last Thursday week, in Copenhagen-fields, about six o'clock in the evening; I saw the prisoners there. I had seen Lake on the preceding Tuesday, and went to see him and the deceased fight - when I saw Lake on the Tuesday, he said he would rather not fight. I saw them fight; it lasted eighteen minutes, when the deceased was carried off the ground - I went the same evening to the Cross Keys, public-house to see him. I observed he was discoloured about the head and neck; he was dead, The prisoner Butler was second to the deceased; they fought for four sovereigns. I held the stakes, because I was requested to do so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I heard Butler persuade them not to fight, and tried to prevent it. There was another second to attend the deceased, who rendered every possible assistance. I never knew M'Cloed by name before. He was considered a taller man then Lake. I was not near enough when they were fighting to learn what Butler said to the combatants. I believe Butler and the deceased lived together as fellow servants.</p>

On the Saturday before the fight, they were there at a singing club; this was on the 3d of May - Lake was the chairman - words arose, and a quarrel ensued, which induced me to clear the room; then M'Cloed made some allusion to the unfitness of Lake, for being the chairman; having my business to attend to, I did not pay attention to the precise words uttered - I remember a person coming afterwards from the deceased, with a challenge for Lake, and two sovereigns; Lake said he had no money to fight for, nor did he wish to fight - one of the persons put down his watch as a stake for him; I recommended them to go away and make it up - I heard no more about it till the accident, except that Lake called on me the next day, and said he felt very uncomfortable, and did not wish to fight.</p>

On the 25th of April, about eight o'clock, she came up to Mrs. Warner for money to buy tea and sugar; Mrs. Warner gave her 6 s. - she asked if she should not buy some meat, as we should want some next day, and asked for more money to buy if. Mrs, Warner refused; she went out, and never returned. I went to bed about twelve o'clock, and missed four half-crowns and a shilling from my pocket book, which was inside my bonnet - the bonnet was pinned in a paper bag, and laid on a press bedstead - I had seen it safe in the morning, after breakfast. Other persons had access to the room. In the morning I found a dirty bonnet was placed in the bag, as a substitute for my own; I had never seen the dirty one before; I had only unpinned the bag overnight, and taken the pocket book out, without looking at the bonnet. I saw the prisoner in custody the following morning, in Duke-street, Manchester-square, and afterwards at the office.</p>

Next morning, about eight o'clock, I missed two sovereigns, and four half-crowns, which I had locked up in a writing desk, in my bed room, where Clues slept; it was safe on the preceding evening at six o'clock - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140019"/>found the lock forced open.

            . I am an officer. On the 26th of April, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I found the prisoner at No. 10, Calmell-buildings - I met her running down stairs, and stopped her, and said she must go with me to the watch-house; she said she must have her bonnet and shawl, and asked me what for - I said for robbing, but did not say whom. On our way to the watch-house, the two prosecutrixs were walking behind; I asked her if she knew them - she said she did; I then asked if she had not been taking some of their property. I neither promised or threatened her - she said she had taken some money from them; I asked what she had taken; she said a sovereign, and ten shillings of Miss Harrison's, and eleven shillings, and a bonnet of Miss Cluse's. I searched her at the watch-house, and found a sovereign, seven half-crowns, five shillings, and a sixpence upon her. I went back to the house by her desire, and asked for her bonnet, and one was given to me, with a cap and frills in it. I asked her if that was the bonnet she had taken of Miss Clues; she said it was.</p>

I have the care of the burying ground. I found another padlock placed in its stead which was about as good as the other; I sat up to watch the burying ground on Saturday night, and about half past one o'clock, I heard some tiles slip off a house adjoining the burying ground; about ten minutes after I saw four men come down the wall, they came to the grave, unlocked the padlock and went in; I run off to the watch-house, and sent assistance to different places, then got over the wall, and found Wallis and Cronie in the vault; I shut them in; the watchmen came; we got over the tilings and went to a house in Plumtree-court, from which house they must have come, as we found two ropes hanging to the window, and found Lee there in the room; he has a wooden leg; we took them to the watch-house - I returned to the house and searched the room; between the bed and the sacking, we found our padlock, and also the one which had been substituted for it; we also found pickaxes, and shovels, hats, and shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you buy the padlock - A. I bought it for the parish - I had the key of the one I put on.</p>
               <p>Q. Persons putting on another, would give them access to the vault - A. Yes; they certainly came to rob the graves; they stole the padlock; I do not know what became of the fourth man. I had no information of what they intended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You saw four men in the ground - A. Yes; there was plenty of time to run away, while I was sending men to different places - they must have escaped the same way as they came.</p>

The prisoner made an excuse to go out, to light the candle - she took the bundle off the table, and went out. I had not then been in the room above five minutes - I went after her but could not overtake her, and returned to the room and stopped there, thinking she would return. I have found none of the property; I saw her next morning between nine and ten o'clock, opposite White Lion-street, Norton-falgate, and charged her with it - she said she had never seen me before. I am certain of her. It was a moon-light night, but there was no candle in the room.</p>

The prisoner was received into the institution on the 28th of September, and left on the 4th of May, without our knowledge. We missed a gown, a bonnet, and a shawl. She was apprehended on the 7th, and brought back to the house, and I found those articles on her back - they are the property of the institution. They were not for her wear, but for two other inmates; she had other clothes, which she also took with her; she said she would not be confined to see the committee, but would take the event of justice. She had her own clothes on, as well as these when she was brought back.</p>

            . I live in Silver-street, opposite to Butcher. I saw the prisoner lurking about the house for five or ten minutes, about half past seven o'clock that morning; I watched him; another person was with him, who looked very hard at me. The prisoner stooped down towards the key-hole of the prosecutor's door, and went away very hastily as if something interrupted him; the door was shut then. I went into the parlour, so that they could not see me, and directly I was gone in he returned to the door, and opened it, and went in; I could not see what he opened it with; when he was in, he beckoned with his finger to a man who was on the opposite side of the street; he went across to him, placed his back against the door, and kept it open. I saw the prisoner put a roll of carpet in front of the window by the side of the door, and during the time of his going from the window, a little boy went into the passage to go to his work; I then saw the man who stood at the door leave it and come across the road, and go down the street; the prisoner then came out with the roll of carpet on his shoulder, and went in a direction for Golden-square. I went over, and asked if they had sent anything away, but the servants were so long answering me, that I could not overtake them. I saw no more of him till the Saturday morning, when he and another man, (not the same as before) came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140022"/>to the same spot - he had been in my sight on the Thursday for quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. I secured him with the assistance of the square-keeper. I am certain of his person. He opened the door as easy as if he had a proper key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You could not tell how it was opened - A. No; I am sure it was shut. I saw the milkman go away three minutes before. I often joke with the servant, and had been at the door with her that morning. I am positive the prisoner opened the door; he stooped, and put his hand to the key hole. I observed his face before he went in; he was dressed in a black coat, and blue pantaloons - I could swear to him among a thousand.</p>

Bank notes, fifteen sovereigns, and a half-sovereign; there was a great deal more money there before, a quantity of silver, and my cash box. I locked the chest, and took the key up to my bed room. The prisoner slept in the shop to protect the property. I was unwell on the morning of the 10th, and Mr. Lewis, my junior clerk came up and fetched the key - I delivered it to him about nine o'clock; it was not out of my possession till then. About three quarters of an hour after, I went into the shop; the prisoner was not there - I asked for him; he had no business to leave the shop. I did not see him again till his appreheasion, on the 29th of April. I went to the chest about as hour after I went into the shop, and then missed this money, which consisted of the cash taken on the previous day. I found the chest open; it is usual to leave it open in the day time. The bowl in which this money had been put was gone - I did not know the numbers of the notes, but should know the 40 l. note, from a mark which was on it.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Davies's service, as cashier. It is my business to take the money, and hand it over to him at night. On the morning of the 10th of April, about nine o'clock, I went up to Mr. Davies for the key of the chest. Before that the prisoner had asked me for the key, as he said he wished to make out some bills; he asked me twice to get it - the first time was about eight o'clock, and again about half an hour after. When I had the key I unlocked the chest, and took out the silver and copper - I left the safe open, and did not go to it afterwards. I left the prisoner in the counting-house, and saw him take a book out of the chest - I was out about half an hour, leaving him there. Mr. Davies went to the safe afterwards - I do not know in what state he found it.</p>

I returned to the room, and found them open, and marks of footsteps on a chair, of a person getting in and out. I have not found them.</p>

            . I live in Adam-street, Adelphi. On the evening of the 16th of April, about twenty to eight o'clock, I was passing Mrs. May's, and saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140023"/>and another was taller than him, by Osborne's hotel - I passed on, and went to a public-house about twenty yards off, and changed a newspaper. As I returned I saw Herd stooping down rubbing his legs, close to the parlour window. The taller man was opposite the door with a bundle of things under his coat, about two yards from May's door; they had not got the bundle when I first saw them. I could not see what it contained - I found the blinds and the window thrown wide open - the tall one went away directly, and Herd stopped about two minutes rubbing his legs, and then went towards the Strand. I rung the bell immediately he was gone, which was in about five minutes from the time I first saw them. I did not notice the tall man sufficiently to know him again. I knew Herd before by sight - I had seen him and another frequently walking backwards and forwards in Adam-street, between seven and eight o'clock of a morning.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND. I am an officer. In consequence of the description I received, I took the prisoners into custody - I have seen them together before. I found 7 s. on Herd, and 9 s. on the other. I took Herd on the night of the robbery.</p>

On Wednesday the 13th of May, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop alone, to match a piece of Norwich crape; another person attended to her; she went out and came in again five minutes afterwards, and I cut her off half a yard of Norwich crape. I shewed her other things; she bargained for a yard of French cambric; I began to cut it off, and I saw her put a whole piece of cambric in her pocket; she stood right opposite to me; I charged her with it - she denied it; I reached over the counter and took it from her pocket, and asked her how she came to do such a thing; she still denied it - we sent for a constable; it was one of the pieces I had been shewing her - it measures five yards and a half, and is worth five guineas - it cost my master that.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Wyllie. On the 6th of March we went to bed about twelve o'clock. I looked at every door, to see that they were secure, and I am certain the back kitchen window was fastened, and the front area door bolted - I came down next morning, a few minutes before seven o'clock, and found the warehouse door at the foot of the stairs open, and things laying about, and the hall door also open; I had fastened it with two bolts and a chain; the cook got up before me, but did not notice this; I had left a large damask table cloth on the kitchen table, which was gone - I alarmed Mr. Wyllie, and then came down and examined the house; I observed a small square of glass cut out of the window, of the back kitchen, where the fastening was; a person could then push his finger in and push the fastening back; I also found a large piece of wood, cut out of the front area door, there were drops of blood about the area, and on the wall as if a finger had been wiped on it.</p>

            . I am a Hackney coachman, and live in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140024"/>Gibraltar-court, Gibraltar-row, Lambeth-road. On the 6th of March, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was at the Elephant and Castle stand; I went to the Rulers' room at the corner of Marshall-street, and saw the two prisoners there; I knew neither of them before, but Gloyd was there, whom I had known from a boy; he spoke to me, in the hearing of the prisoners. they were all in company; he said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got a coach in the rank," I said Yes, he said, well then, he should have a good job for me up in Conduit-street, Bond-street, about one o'clock, if I would be there, I said</p>
               <p>"Very well, I will come, if I get a job any where near there." Fuller was dressed in a cut off blue coat. with blue buttons, kerseymere breeches and top boots. I was at Hatton-garden, coach-stand, and was ordered by a lady to drive to Argyle-street; I got there about one o'clock, in a few minutes after, I drove on to the stand at Conduit-street, and stopped in the rank; about half past one o'clock Gloyd walked by and went towards Mr. Wyllie, he had been gone about five minutes, then returned to my coach door with three or four rolls of something under his arm; my horses heads stood on a level with George-street, looking towards Bond-street - Gloyd opened my coach door and threw the rolls in, and then got in himself to place them; he remained in the coach - the two prisoners came with their arms loaded, in the same manner. I did not observe what the rolls were, but when they were taken out, I saw one was a large roll of dark cloth; Fuller then had no boots on, but shoes, that was the only difference in his dress. The prisoners returned backward and forwards four or five times, and brought something every time. The last time they came was a quarter past three o'clock. Mr. Wyllie's shop is on the left hand side going out of Regent-street - my coach was in the middle of the road, where the first coach always stands. They got into the coach, and shut the door, and told me to drive to Cornhill. I was going to stop in Cornhill - one of them let down the front glass, and said,</p>
               <p>"Dont stop here, drive on to the first turning to the right after you pass the church," I did so, and they then ordered me to take the first turning to the left, which led into a little square. They pulled the string for me to stop, under a lamp on the left hand side; it was then about quarter past five o'clock, and then Fuller jumped out from the off side door, and knocked at the door on one side of the lamp, which was immediately opened by a man in his shirt sleeves; Fuller returned to the coach. They all three took an arm full of the rolls into the house. Fuller remained in the house with them, while the prisoners fetched the rest out; they all went into the house; the door was shut - they had been in the house about the space of five minutes, when Gloyd returned to me, and put five sovereigns, and a one pound note in my hand; he said</p>
               <p>"Here, we shan't want you any more, you may go about your business," I had been on the stand a quarter of an hour or better. My horses each have a white star on the forehead; I talked with the watchman in Conduit-street about the badness of the weather.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. On what night of the week was it - A. Thursday. I saw them at the Rulers' room at nine o'clock; nine or ten people were drinking there. Gloyd sat with the prisoners; the conversation was in a low tone; I did not suspect any thing wrong; I did not ask where he brought the parcels from; they were nearly three quarters of an hour bringing the goods to the coach; it was above half past two o'clock when he came up, and a quarter past three when we started. I only saw the watchmen once.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you come here from gaol - A. I have come from Tothill-fields; I was taken there because several threatened to kill me. I did not suspect any thing wrong till he put the money into my hand; I did not refuse it; and in the morning I told my mother I thought I had been carrying people who were after no good; I told nobody else; I was apprehended about three weeks afterwards, and related it to the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not give information before - A. I did not know what to do; I was as likely to be wrong as right; I do not expect to escape punishment by being a witness; I believe the magistrate did say if I told nothing but truth it would save me. The coach I drive is No. 77; it is my master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you not think it odd that a coach should be wanted in Conduit-street from the Elephant and Castle - A. Not at all; my being hired to Argyle-street was quite accidental; unless I had been there I should not have gone. I had a fare to Fleet-market first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think it suspicious for one man to wait in the coach while the others fetched the bundles - A. No; they brought the rolls in a direction from Mr. Wyllie's; I saw them come out of his door; the back of my coach was that way; I did not offer to pull up to the door; I was within twenty yards of the house; they told me not to drive up to the door; I could not tell whether they lived there or not; I believed it was their property. and only expected my fare. I did not speak to Gloyd while he was in the coach. I have not talked with him since.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He was busy in the coach putting up the rolls - A. Yes; Gloyd has been in Tothill-fields. but we have been kept separate. Mine was the only coach on the stand; a chariot had driven off.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker, and live in Wellington-street, Newington-causeway. On Wednesday night, 3d of March, I went to a house in Conduit-street, with Fuller and Rodham, and I had known them nine or ten months - he, Rodham, and I had agreed to go two or three days before, and Bishop, the coachman was to ply there. On the evening of the robbery, I saw Bishop at the Elephant and castle, about four or five o'clock and asked him to ply at the West end of the town, in a street where there were some fine large new building at the end of it; I do not know the name of the street. I told him to meet me there at one o'clock. Nobody was with us when I said this - the prisoners were twenty or thirty yards off - they stopped in the street, not in a house - I afterwards went with the prisoners to Oram's in the Strand, where we stopped till a quarter past eleven o'clock - we then went to Tinkler's (Rodham's) lodging, in Shoe-lane, Holborn, and stopped there till a quarter before twelve; all three of us together; we then look a centre bit and some keys, we had with us before; they belonged to Tinkler - we then went to that end of the town, where the new buildings are, and where the robbery was to be committed; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140025"/>went to Bishop; he was in the rank before we got there, which was about one o'clock; I said nothing to him; Price and Tinkler went down the area to the kitchen door, with the centre bit; they unlocked the area gate. I saw no more of them till they came out at the private door; they then went back and fetched some cloth. I had been waiting about an hour and a half for them. It was two hours before we left the house for good. They brought rolls of cloth with them, I and Bishop put them into the coach, which was twelve or fourteen yards from the door, in the ranks. Bishop helped in with the cloths. I stopped with the coach while they went back for more. Tinkler and Price went backwards and forwards, and brought cloth to me, which I put into the coach. We told Bishop to drive to the first turning past Whitechapel church, and then the first turning to the right. The centre bit was Tinkler's; he had some keys also, and a stock. When the coach stopped, we knocked at a door, and the things were taken in. I returned to Bishop, and gave him three sovereigns first, and 1 l. in silver, and gave him two more sovereigns in the afternoon. I was apprehended about ten days ago. The robbery was advertized about a week after it happened. Tinkler and I went beyond Stoke Newington, and lived together there - he went by the name of Rodham, and I as Matthews. We were apprehended, and put in the watch-house, and on the Monday morning, when the watch-house man brought us some water, we pulled the door open and ran out. I was taken the next day in Rhodes-fields, Islington. We got 109 l. for the cloth, and it was shared between the prisoners and me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you known Bishop - A. A good while. I saw him at the Elephant and Castle, about four o'clock, his coach was there then, he knew what we were going about. I did not see him before on that day. I gave him 4 l. at first, and told him, I did not know what there would be more for him, but it would be settled, and if he came to my lodging in the afternoon he should have it, which he did, and I gave him 2 l. more, as his share of the booty. It was part of the plan that his coach should be on the stand, and not at the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the Ruler's room - A. Yes; I was there about a week before the transaction. Tinkler was there then, but not Price. I have seen Bishop there frequently, but not on the night in question.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he was aware of what you were going about - A. Because we applied to him one night - it was not done then, as we had not got the centre bit, and we applied to him on the next night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the Ruler's room, on the night you meant to have done it - A. Yes, in the day time Bishop and I were there, but neither of the prisoners; I told him we knew where to get some cloth; he knew all about it.</p>

            . In March last I was watchman of Conduit-street. I heard of this robbery on the 7th of March. I was on my beat the night before, and saw a coach on the stand. I had some talk with the coachman. I never saw his face, and should not know him again. I particularly looked at his horses; they stood at the head of the stand, at the corner of George-street; they were very dark brown or black horses. I saw the coach there until I called three o'clock but not afterwards. I think one horse had a white streak on the face. The coachman appeared to me to have a large blue top coat on, which he wrapped all round him, and said he would have a sleep and threw himself back on his box; he appeared to be asleep every time I passed him.</p>

I was awake and heard a coach pass my door, and draw up about two doors further, towards the Commercial-road, at a house kept by Solomon's. I heard the coach door, and also the house door open; a person came out - there was passing and repassing several times, the coach was there about ten minutes or quarter of an hour, but it being dark and the coach just under the window, I could not see it; I heard of the robbery afterwards, and went to Mr. Wyllie.</p>

            . I assisted in apprehending the prisoners. The breeches found in Fuller's lodging were stained with blood - he had a cut in his right hand, which looked rather fresh; it was not healed up - I think it had not been done above a week. We apprehended Rodham with Gloyd and another man, on Sunday, the 4th of May, and on Monday they had escaped. Rodham denied all knowledge of Gloyd or the other, and gave his address Northampton-row, Clerkenwell. Salter delivered me a key and centre bit.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I produce two pannels - one of which I took from Mr. Wyllie's door, and another from Wheeler's. There are marks of an inch and three eights, and a four inch centre bit on them; there are marks of the inch and three eighths centre bit on both. The centre bit found is a four inch one - it fits the mark on the pannel at Wheeler's, but not at the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The centre bit does not fit the marks in Mr. Wyllie's pannel - A. No; but there are marks on both pannels of an inch and three eights centre bit having been used. Centre bits are made of regular sizes, on a progressive scale. Every carpenter has a regular set of them.</p>
               <p>MR. WYLLIE. I got the centre bit and a picklock key from Wheeler's on the 25th.</p>

On the 20th of February last, about two minutes before six o'clock, I was coming down Crown-street, Soho, and a gentleman accosted me, and asked if I had any commands to Liverpool, he would take them - I told him No. I do not know his name - he was going to Ireland that way. I had seen him once or twice only.

I had no other shilling. I kept it in my hand some time, and when she was gone I examined it and found it very bad. I put it in paper, and kept it separate, and gave it to the officer - next night I saw her at the same place; she wanted two pennyworth of raddishes, but said she had only three half-pence, and would I trust her. I did not recollect her, till we got to the light, and would not trust her - she asked me to give her change for a shilling, which she gave me. I found it was a bad one.

On Wednesday, the 23d of April, I went to a house in Somers-town, where I found the prisoner; I told her I wished to see a bonnet which she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140029"/>had been making up at our house on the Saturday before; she said she had not, she had made one up on Saturday week; I asked to see that; she went up stairs, and brought down a Leghorn straw black bonnet; I said that was not what I wanted, and I was determined to see the right, and told her to go up and fetch the other; after some hesitation she went and brought this bonnet; after saying she had acted very wrong in taking a breadth, and making it into a bonnet, I said I should send for an officer, and take her away; she fell on her knees, and asked forgiveness, and said she had taken it out of the silk box where they are kept; I said I could say nothing to it as, it was not my property - she got up and ran away with a young man, who was with her. I took the bonnet to Mr. Duggan. I have been a dyer, and I am certain that the silk bonnet is made of part of the dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you never see two pieces of silk of exactly the same colour - A. Yes; when they were dyed together. I did not knock her down. I believe she fell down as she ran out of the room. I was rather irritated but did not catch hold of her to my knowledge. She had been discharged.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no Defence.</p>

            . I lived in the same house as the prisoner. I never saw this bonnet till Warner called. I was present; he told her if she came forward and acknowledged to taking the silk, he did not wish to hurt a hair of her head. I afterwards went with her to Duggans to deliver herself up.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Do you lodge in the same room - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the first thing he said,</p>
               <p>"Bring down that bonnet, which you was making up on Saturday" - A. Yes, and after she produced it, he said what I stated. I was not present at the beginning of the conversation.</p>

I had been at home all the evening from four o'clock. I had been with him till three o'clock that afternoon, and left him at Horrigans.</p>

I was quite sober. I went to a public-house just by where I lived, to get a pot of beer - the prisoner sat by my side; we were in company together nearly an hour - I went away first; I paid for my beer when I first had it; my money was then safe - he slept in the same bed with me.

I went to search and while I was searching his right hand pocket, I saw his hand in his left hand pocket; I put my hand in, and found a dollar, a half-crown, and a farthing; he said he received it from his Captain, and after he was locked up, he said Wilson gave it him.</p>

In consequence of what he said, Price was apprehended, and while the three were under examination at the office, the articles stated in the indictment were produced. I cannot swear to the powder and shots, but to the best of my belief the ten flasks are ours; they have no mark on them - they are made purposely for us.

On Saturday morning, the 26th of April, about half-past two o'clock, I heard a cry of Stop thief! from a female voice, and saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutrix pursuing him - I stopped him. Nobody else was running. She charged him with robbing her of a handkerchief, and 14 s. or 15 s.; he denied it. On the way to the watch-house, he produced a handkerchief, and asked Pryor if it was her's; she said, Yes - he said it was not, and he would make her take her oath of it, for it was his. I attempted to take it from him, but he kept it in his hand. In Titchbourne-street he threw it down, saying, if it was hers to take it - I took it up, and found two half-crowns, and 8 s. 6 d. in it - there was the letter B on the handkerchief. He did not claim it after throwing it down.</p>

She walked up the shop; Mr. Cross met us at the door; she begged forgiveness, and at the office said it stuck to her shawl. It is worth 30 s.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Clare-court. On the 9th of April, the prisoner came to my shop with thirteen law books to sell - I asked him how he came by them; he said his brother was a student, and wished him to sell them, to buy new ones; I said if he would leave them, I would perhaps buy them; he did so, and came again about five o'clock in the evening; I gave him a guinea for them. Next day, about twelve o'clock, he brought thirteen more, and left them with me. I gave him 25 s. for them. I sold the first lot to Mr. Rolph. He called again next day with more, and I had him secured.</p>

The prisoner came to my shop, and bought a catalogue, about three months ago, and in April, he brought some books, which he said his brother had to sell. I bought them; he brought two or three parcels since that, consisting principally of law books. The last time he brought me twelve volumes of Reports - he said his brother had a great many more to sell. I said I had better see his brother - he said he would go and ask at what time it would be convenient; I did not see him afterwards.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the morning of the 8th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoners following a van, which was loaded with furniture; I followed them for twenty minutes. Jones took the trunk out of the tail of the van, and came on the footpath to Freeman, and delivered it to him; he received it from him and was walking away. I seized Jones, and told a person to stop Freeman, which he did, and I took the trunk from him.</p>

On the 9th of May, about nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in a cart, in Honeypot-lane, about a mile and a half from Stanmore church - it is a common thoroughfare, but a shocking road to travel on. I looked into the cart and saw that they had nothing, and was determined to watch them - they saw me and went up the lane as hard as they could, and I after them; the sound of the cart ceased. I came up and saw them start from a dung hill in three minutes. I saw a very heavy impression on the dung hill, as if they had taken something from it, and followed them into Edgeware, and gave information. I pursued them towards town, and stopped them on Silk-hill, and found the lead in the cart. There were marks of the wheels having backed to the dung-hill. I saw the lead compared with the roof of the church; it matched exactly.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you not observe several people leave, who could not get standing room - A. Yes; he ran out of the theatre as soon as an alarm was given; he ran through the coach ranks, but I never lost sight of his logs.</p>

I lost sight of him when he ran round a carriage - I saw him thrown down, and saw a watch thrown from towards his hand; I think he threw it down. I picked it up, and gave it to Mr. Dunch. I live in Bedford-place, Catherine-street. I cannot say he is the man, as he is dressed differently now. I followed him to Bow-street.</p>

            . I am a cabinet maker, and live in Northampton-square. I saw Davis crying - she said a boy in a brown coat had taken the child's handkerchief; she was looking towards Percival-street. I saw a boy running - she said he was one, but not the one who took it. I pursued, and saw the prisoner running, in a brown coat, and caught him down a court, which was no thoroughfare; he had got into a cart. I saw him throw the handkerchief out of the cart before I pulled him out. Davis saw him in about ten minutes, and said directly that he was the boy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were there not two boys in the cart - A. No.</p>

On the 10th of April I slept in the attic; the prisoner came to lodge in the house for that night, he went to bed at ten o'clock, on the second floor, and after eleven, as I was going to my room, I heard a noise in the boy's room, which is also in the garret; I went in and found the prisoner; I asked what brought him there - he said he had made a mistake. I saw my gown drop, which I had seen that day in the drawers in my own room. I went and found my door open, and a shawl on the drawers, which I had left in my box - the drawers were pulled out. I came down, told my mistress - master came up and told him to dress and be off - he would not unless master returned what he had paid, and he was given in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You found things misplaced - A. Yes; the gown was in the boy's room. I shewed the prisoner his room in the afternoon, but did not light him to bed; the boy's room is above the floor he slept on.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in the park, and saw Mr. Plane go into the crowd where the guns were firing, and immediately after I saw the prisoners and two shore occasionally in their company; they spoke to each other at times, and then went away. I observed all four get behind Mr. Plane. Thomas was close behind him, and Moir on the right side, and the other two behind them. I saw Thomas put his hand into Mr. Plane's pocket, but could not see him draw any thing out, for the first gun fired which occasioned a move - he shifted to the right, and then Moir put his hand into Mr. Plane's other pocket, and drew it out without any thing, if either of them took the handkerchief it must have been Thomas. I followed them about the crowd for ten minutes or quarter of an hour, and saw them attempt several people's pockets. I saw Thomas lay hold of the pocket of a man named Harley. I then ran to Mr. Plane and asked if he had lost his handkerchief, he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes." I went and seized the prisoners; the other two heard him say he had lost it, and ran away. I found nothing on them, but 3 s., on Thomas and a knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why not give him back his money - A. The Magistrate ordered me to detain it. I said at Marlborough-street, that I knew them to be bad characters. I knew them to be in bad company.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you are not the person who was tried at Clerkenwell - A. Very likely. I gave evidence against Jay. I am a special constable now. I was suspended from office for not attending the House of Lords, when I was obliged to be here. I was suspended for twelve months, because constables are only returned once a year. I have seen the prisoners in company of those who I know to be thieves, because they loiter in the park every day, and must get their livelihood some how.</p>
               <p>THOMAS'S Defence. I never saw Moir before. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>MOIR'S Defence. I never had my hands in any body's pocket.</p>

            . I live opposite Butler. I was working at the window between five and six o'clock, and saw three lads come round the corner, one went into the shop and the prisoners stood at the stall, and they took up several things and looked at them. I saw Whitmarsh take something up and give it to Collins, who put it into his pocket. Whitmarsh took something else, and they went away laughing - the one who went into the shop ran out. I went and told Butler.</p>

            . My uncle told me to watch Redman the carman, to see if he put more iron into his cart, then he was ordered.
