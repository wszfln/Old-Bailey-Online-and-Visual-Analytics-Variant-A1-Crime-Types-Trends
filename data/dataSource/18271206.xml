On the 29th of October, at near eight o'clock at night, I was coming from Hyde Park-corner to Grosvenor-gate, in a direction to my own home: I was in the Park - it was a moon-light evening; I met a man at the crossing where the road comes out, near the bason in <placeName id="t18271206-1-crimeloc4">Hyde Park</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18271206-1-crimeloc4" type="placeName" value="Hyde Park"/>

                        targets="t18271206-1-off1 t18271206-1-crimeloc4"/> - he was a stranger to me: I was picking my way over the cart road, which was then in a very bad state, and the man said."You had better come this way - it is a better crossing; I said, "Thank you, that is not my road"- he said, "You had better come;" I said, "No, that is not my road, and I shall not go that way;" he was close by me; he replied, "D - n you, you shall," caught hold of my arm, and seized my umbrella, which I had in my hand, and wrenched it from me, by force.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance at the time? A. I did not at the moment, for I was struck with astonishment; he ran across the Park, in a direction for the Serpentine-river, with my umbrella - he had nothing else at that time: I followed him - he ran up by the side of the Serpentine-river, a little beyond the Humane Society's house, and then across the road, and across the grass, among the trees. I followed him to the spot, and as soon as he arrived there he made a sudden stop; I seized my umbrella, and wanted to wrench it from him - he wrenched it also, and broke the handle of it off; he then said he should not let me off in this way, and knocked me down with his fist, and for the moment I was senseless. As soon as I got up I found my clothes literally stripped open, and both my trousers pockets turned inside out - both my waistcoat and trousers were opened. I had had a brown silk purse, with four sovereigns and four shillings in silver in one of my trousers pockets; as soon as I found my pockets turned out I found every thing I had possessed was gone; I had a key of my trunk in my pocket - that was gone; and my pocket handkerchief - I had one glove on my hand at the time, and the other in my hand - that was gone, but the one on my hand remained; I saw the prisoner standing at a little distance from me, and made towards him - he held the umbrella up against me, saying if I attempted to come another step that way he would beat my brains out with the umbrella, and if I did not return the same way as I had come, he would certainly murder me; I was rather frightened at the time, and did not proceed further after him, but saw him go in the direction of Cumberland-gate, round the ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he walk or run? A. He walked away - and as soon as I saw him going away I made the best of my way between the barracks and the green, and succeeded in arriving at Cumberland-gate before he got up; I told the gate-keeper what had happened, and begged him to come out and shut the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the gate-keeper assist you? A. No - I ran to the gate, and shut it myself; I turned my head round, hearing footsteps behind me, and saw it was the man who had robbed me, coming up; I then charged him with the theft, and told him he was the man - he denied it; I said,"You are the man, you know it - you have robbed me of four sovereigns - you have robbed me of my all;" with that he shoved me from him, and ran off back again into the park, towards Kensington-gardens, among the trees; two soldiers came up, and hearing the cry of Stop thief! they ran off, and followed him, and succeeded in taking him - another person came up, and, seeing the exhausted state I was in, came to my assistance - I had fallen down.</p>
               <p>Q. You say two soldiers took him? A. They did - I was then in a very exhausted state, and had fallen down near the gate, and the witness who came up had seen the umbrella drop between me and the prisoner at the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. What, had you a struggle at the gate? A. Yes - I seized him, and charged him with the theft, and he shoved me from him; the umbrella fell from him; he had it in his possession at the time I seized him - it was taken to the watch-house by one of the officers, I believe, but I cannot be certain who carried it, I was so confused; the prisoner was brought back by the soldiers, and taken to the watch-house; one of the witnesses brought my glove to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the person who robbed you before that night, to your knowledge? A. No - I am certain he is the man; I had a clear view of his countenance, for it was moon-light: there are no lamps near that place. I accompunied the soldiers and the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. You are a servant out of place? A. Yes - I had been out of place about three days when this happened; it was rather before eight o'clock when I got into Hyde Park; I went from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060004"/>Hyde Park-corner gate, in a direction for Grosvenor-gate; I had not been at home that evening - I had left home about twelve o'clock in the day - I had been with a neice of mine to school, and then to deliver a message to a friend of mine, who lives near Finsbury-square - I remained with him the remaining part of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure, when you went to see the friend, that you had the money in your pocket? A. I had, and I had my hand in my pocket before I entered the Park gate- I am quite certain I had the money when I entered the Park; I first met the prisoner near the bason, in the road which leads from the gravel-pits: I swear I did not speak to him before he spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live when you were in place, before this happened? A. With Mr.

            , who lives at No. 79, Cadogan-place, Sloane-street, with the sister of the gentleman I had lived with; I had borrowed some money of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not as high up the Park as the magazine? A. I was afterwards - I had followed the prisoner there, after he took my umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him about the bridge at the end of the Serpentine-river? did you say you were going there on business, and ask if he was going? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He snatched the umbrella from you then, turned upon you, and stunned you? A. He did stun me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so insensible as not to know who took the sovereigns? A. He is the man who took my umbrella; I was insensible, but there was nobody else near me; and, as he took the umbrella, I have no doubt he is the man who took the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had you to go up so high in the Park? A. I came through Piccadilly, and, having walked so far, felt myself rather tired, and having promised my wife to return home early, I thought I would defer what I intended to do; the prisoner arrived at the gate two minutes after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he followed you there instead of running away? A. He arrived there after me, but he did not go the same way as me; I was not astonished to see him arrive there, as I saw the way he was going - he could have run another way; he came to the gate in a different direction to that I did; I have reason to think he thought I was gone in another direction.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the gate were several people assembled? A. No, but when I gave an alarm there was - it was not said, in my hearing, that I was making a sham of being robbed, and that I was not robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the umbrella in your hand as you went out of Cumberland gate? A. I cannot say, as I was in a very exhausted state; I do not believe that I had it in my hand then - I will not swear it, but I do not think it possible; I will swear it did not drop from my hand - I swear I had not got it in my hand when I arrived at the gate, for when the prisoner came up he had it in his hand; it certainly did not fall from my hand, because I had not got it. I went with the prisoner to the watch-house; we were pretty near together - I was not at his side; the watchman and soldiers took him along; I did not see him throw any thing away; I have no knowledge of his throwing any gold or silver away.</p>
               <p>Q. You met some friend, I believe, as you were going to the watch-house? A. No - a total stranger to me acted as a friend, and went with me to the watch-house, and afterwards to the office - he did not represent himself as a night officer.</p>
               <p>Q. At the watch-house did you say to the prisoner,"Why did you hurt me? I did not wish to hurt you?" A. No; I said, "You wanted to take the umbrella from me - why did you wish to injure me? I have never done you an injury;" I might have said that also at the watch-house; I had some dirt on my clothes when I arrived at Cumberland-gate; I do not know that any body made an observation about that - they might - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say at the watch-house, that he had forced you against a clump of trees when he robbed you? A. I said he shoved me against a tree when he took my umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear you did not make proposals to him, which caused him to be very angry? A. No, I made no proposals to him; he charged me at the watch-house with making proposals which are quite against my nature, and which hurt my feelings; I had not got the umbrella when I arrived at the gate, but whether it was afterwards given to me I cannot swear.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. After you had lost your money, you say the prisoner walked off towards Cumberland-gate: what direction did you take to get there before him? A. I ran down between the trees, and crossed a little wooden bridge- we went in different directions; I ran as fast as I possibly could; he came up to the gate about two minutes after me, as near as I can recollect, and the umbrella was then in his hand; as soon as I saw it was him I seized him by the collar, and he dropped it on the ground; that was while I was scuffling with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to believe you had the money in your pocket before you entered the Park? A. I was going to pay the money, and I then put my hand into my pocket; I felt the money in my purse, and buttoned up my pocket; I am quite sure I had the purse, with some money in it, in my pocket then, and I had not met a single person from that time till I met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You were knocked down, and made insensible - your pockets turned out, and money gone, and you saw the prisoner standing a little distance from you? A. Yes - he might not be above a yard from me. I concluded he was waiting to see which way I was going.</p>

            . I belong to the Coldstream Guards. - About eight o'clock on the night of the 29th of October, I was at Cumberland-gate, and heard the cry of Murder! Robbery! and Stop thief! which came from the gate, close to where I was standing; I turned into the gate, and ran into the Park; I looked to my right, and saw a man running along by the side of the wall, among the trees - I pursued him - Charles Bruce, a fellow-soldier, was with me; several other people followed him - I gained ground on him- he looked back, and turned to the left; when he saw me gaining ground on him he turned, and said, "Who are you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060005"/>following?" I collared him, and said, "If you attempt to stir I will knock you down;" he said, "Let me sit down a minute:" he had his waistcoat and trousers unbuttoned - he sat down for about a quarter of a minute - he got up, and Charles Bristow* came up to me.*This name is printed Bruce, by mistake, in the preceding page,</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did he give for wishing to sit down? - A. He gave no reason. The prosecutor came up, and said he was the villain who had taken his property - he said,"That was the man."</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say? A. He looked very indifferent indeed, but said nothing; several people wanted to lay hold of him; I said, "If you want to take him I will have nothing to do with him; they let go of him, and I took him- he is the man. I went into the Park on the following morning, and found the prosecutor about twenty yards inside the gate, at a place where the prisoner ran down - Bristow was there, and he picked up a silk handkerchief; I picked up a leather glove and a penny piece - I gave the prosecutor the glove; I found that glove about two yards to the right of where the prisoner had ran the night before; when I found the glove the prosecutor might be about three yards from it. When I first saw him in the Park he was about fifty yards from that place; it was about half-past six o'clock in the morning; I had left the barracks about a quarter-past six.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prosecutor go into the Park the next morning, but found him there? A. No, I found him there; whether he had been to the spot where I found the glove I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where had you been that evening? A. I was taking a walk - I belong to Portman-street barracks. I was standing outside Cumberland-gate, with Bristow, talking to two girls; I heard the cry, it proceeded from a very little way inside the gate; I did not particularly notice what sort of a night it was; I could very well see the prisoner running down by the trees.</p>
               <p>Q. Which trees are you speaking of? A. Towards Kensington-gardens; when I first noticed the prisoner he was about thirty yards in front of me - several people were pursuing him; I did not see the prosecutor, not to discern him; I got up to the prisoner in not more than five minutes- he appeared quite out of breath; he had no umbrella then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to see any thing fall from him, or thrown from him, if it had? A. I did not see it; I was not near enough to him to see it: I was not above thirty yards from him when I pursued him, but I do not say I was no further from him all the time - I had him in sight all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you seized him did you see the prosecutor? A. I might say, in about three minutes - he came up to me; Bristow was the first who came up, and the prosecutor next. The prisoner was not out of my hands till I delivered him to a constable; I did not see him throw any thing away, nor did I search him - he might have dropped a thing carelessly without my seeing him; he was in a most exhausted state, as if he had run three or four miles; the prosecutor was very much flurried, as if the prisoner had knocked him about - he was in a flurried and agitated state- I parted with him in Oxford-street, when I gave the prisoner to a watchman. I did not appoint to meet him in the Park the next morning; I went there to see if the prisoner had thrown any thing away, as the watchman had told us nothing was found on him; we told the watchman we would come up in the morning, and see if he had thrown any thing away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor describe to you what property he had lost at the time? A. Yes, and told us the road the prisoner had taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it as light when you left the prosecutor as when you were in pursuit of the prisoner? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then could he not have found any thing if it was dropped as well that night as in the morning? A. No; there are a parcel of leaves strewed about; they would not cover a handkerchief, but it was brown, the same color as the leaves.</p>
               <p>Q. For what you know, the prosecutor might have been in the Park all night? A. He might; Bristow found the handkerchief: the prosecutor was six or seven yards from him.</p>

            . I am in the same regiment as Welch. I was at Cumberland-gate about eight o'clock on the night in question - I heard a man screaming out Murder! in the Park; I and Welch ran into the Park as hard as we could- the prosecutor said, "Stop the robber!" I at that time saw a man running near Cumberland-gate, among the trees, near the wall, towards Kensington-gardens; we pursued, and Welch seized him; I might be ten or twelve paces behind Welch; when I got up the prisoner was sitting down, as if he were going to ease himself; we brought him up to the watch-house; on the following morning, between six and seven o'clock, I accompained Welch to the Park, and saw the prosecutor there, looking about for the money; we went in the direction we had followed the prisoner, and I picked up a silk handkerchief, which the prosecutor owned- I gave it to him; I picked it up on the place where the prisoner sat down; I saw Welch pick up one glove and a penny piece, thirty or forty yards from the handkerchief, in the direction the prisoner had run; he gave the glove to the prosecutor; I had left the prisoner in the custody of the watchman the night before - I saw him next morning at the office - he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. What sort of a night was this? A. A very moon-light night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other persons running? A. Only Welch and me; we passed by the prosecutor, and overtook the prisoner; we did not go to the watch-house, but gave him into the hands of the watchman at Cumberland-gate; I did not observe his clothes being dirty; the prosecutor's clothes were dirty, as if he had been thrown down; I saw the umbrella in the prosecutor's hand when we brought the prisoner back.</p>

            . I live at No. 9, King-street, Golden-square, and am a tailor and draper. On the night of the 29th of October I and my wife were coming across the Park; I think the clock might have struck eight about five minutes before; we had spent the evening at Pimlico; I walked across the Park, for the benefit of the air, having been confined all day - when we got to Cumberland-gate I heard the prosecutor exclaim, "For God's sake, shut the gate - I have been robbed, and in danger of my life;" he did not wait for the gate being shut, but lifted up the bolt to do it himself, and seeing the prisoner coming up to him, he exclaimed, "This is the villain,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060006"/>or rascal, who has robbed me," and immediately seized him - a scuffle then took place, and the prisoner released himself from the attempted grasp of the prosecutor, and, having on a long great coat, the prosecutor laid hold of the tail of his coat, with a sudden jerk, and I saw an umbrella and hat fall on the ground, from which the umbrella fell I cannot tell, not to be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the result of the jerk? A. The prosecutor fell, and the prisoner ran off towards the barracks, alongside the wall; I was anxious to follow him, and did so, about forty yards, but my wife wished me not - the prosecutor exclaimed, after he got up, "For God's sake, stop him;" several persons ran after him: I did not observe any soldiers then; I remained by the gate, and the prisoner was brought back by two soldiers and the prosecutor - I am sure he is the same man I saw scuffling with the prosecutor; I saw him handed over to the patrol; I did not hear him say any thing then; I said to the prosecutor, in the prisoner's presence, as we were going to the watch-house, "You seem much exhausted, you had better take my arm," which he did - when we got to the watch-house the prisoner said, "You villain, will you take my life?" Luscomb at that time was so much exhausted he was scarcely able to give the charge; the prisoner continued to worry him, and I desired he should have some water, which having been given him he then gave the charge. The prisoner said he would give him all the money he had lost to let him go; the prosecutor said he did not want money, but justice; after that, he said, "I will give you 10l. or 20l. or 30l. if you will let me go - I can easily raise it - I have nothing to do but to send for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that said publicly or privately? A. Publicly, before the constable of the night; the prosecutor said he did not want any of his money, and when he observed,"Would you take my life," he replied, "You would take my life - I want nothing but justice;" the prisoner came before the Magistrate next morning in a different coat - he had observed, when they were about to strip him, that he had nothing about him but a penny and a halfpenny, but they were not found; I saw him searched, but he was not thoroughly searched - his shoes were not taken off; he had a loose great coat on that night, and I believe I have seen that great coat on a companion of his just now, who wanted to draw the soldiers on one side; he appeared next morning in a blue straight coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you happen to know whether the prisoner was allowed to go at large that night? A. I saw him locked up, and I believe he was kept in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, in a scuffle between the prosecutor and the prisoner, an umbrella and hat fell to the ground? A. Yes- that was the first time I had observed the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether the prosecutor had that umbrella in his hand before he fell? A. I cannot - I did not see it in the prisoner's possession.</p>

            . I am an officer of High-street, Mary-le-bone. I was at the office at the time this charge was given - what passed was taken down in writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you overhear any conversation between the prosecutor and prisoner at the time they were waiting? A. No. Brown was at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you overhear any conversation between them in the office? A. Not as I can safely swear - I was on duty there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You happened to be the officer on duty there - did you remain in the Magistrate's room while he was examined? A. Yes, but it not being a case of my own, I did not take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. If any thing had been said, loud enough for every body to have heard it, you would have heard it? A. Yes; Webster was the officer at the second examination, and the glove and umbrella were handed to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say, but that I am innocent of robbery, or any thing of the kind; he knew I had not robbed him - he had been using very bad expressions towards me, and he means, by accusing me, to save himself, by taking me up, and charging me with a highway-robbery: he ran to the gate when I ran after him, and he was stopped by two soldiers, and whatever he said to them they let him go; I came up, and he knocked me down, and he collared me when I came up to the gate.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

No; he afterwards turned back, and came right towards me; I said at the watch-house, that I did not know what to make of it, as he did not seem to run as if to escape, and he offered no resistance; when I took hold of him he was going to strike me, but he did not - he seemed against going to the watch-house, because he said it was not him who robbed me - he said it was the other gentlemen behind him, whom he did not know, but they he passed before it was taken; my Christian names are William Julius.</p>

Bank-note in a silk purse; I put it at the back of a drawer in the secretaire, so that the drawer would not shut close; I left the secretaire locked; the note was not in the drawer, but behind it; I had the number and date of the note, and had placed my initials on the top of it in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060008"/>front; I had often seen the note, as I had received it on the 22d of June, and whenever I arranged my money I saw it. I returned to town on Monday, the 1st of October; I was leaving town again on Wednesday, the 3d of October, and had no occasion to go to my money till that morning; I then went to where I had deposited my note, and the purse and note were gone. I inquired of the prisoner, in an indifferent sort of way, if he had seen my purse about; he said he had not, and would inquire of the cook; he certainly left the room in a hurried manner; I heard no more of it - he did not tell me whether he had or had not inquired of the cook; I left town in an hour, and sent notice to the Bank to stop payment; I came back on the 10th, but left again, and came back on the 14th; the prisoner still remained in my service; I had collected from him that he was extremely anxious to leave my service, and on Monday, the 15th of October, I told him I understood so, and said I was not obliged to give him any notice or money, and that he had better leave that afternoon; I paid him 5l. odd as wages in the evening, and he left.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him you understood he was anxious to leave, what he did he say? A. He said nothing - he did not at all express a wish to remain; I advertised the note, and have seen it since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not advertise it as a note supposed to be lost, and not as having been stolen? A. I headed my advertisement with the word, "Lost" - I have a stable at the back of my house- I was about purchasing a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been in the habit of riding it up and down the mews? A. Not in the mews certainly; I have here a memorandum of all the Bank-notes I have had in my possession, and accounting for how I have disposed of them - it was given to me by the person who gave me the note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You had better put that away; you have said your initials were on the note, shall you know it by them? A. No; they are now torn off - there is a tear in the place where my initials were, but I know the number and date myself.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you advertised it, did you suppose it had been stolen? A. I do not wish to answer that question, because I am afraid to do so.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Oh! answer me? A. I tell you honestly, I suspected the prisoner from the first, but if I had put "Lost or stolen" at the head of my advertisement, the note would not have been circulated, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes had you had for the three weeks, or month preceding? A. I think about seven, but only one 40l. - I have a wife, but no children; the secretaire is in my private room; the prisoner came to my service from the Rev. Mr. Young, one of the masters of Eton school - I had a written character; it was not an excellent character, but I took him; he said he had a sister, and on Mrs. Vines going to that sister; she appeared respectable, and we took him before the written character came, as the sister said she would be accountable for any thing; he told me he had lived with Lord Mansfield; he came to me on the 18th of August, and left on the 15th of October - I missed the note on the 3d - I had not been in town more than three or four days altogether - I advertised the note on the 16th, the day after he left - I have a partner, but this note was paid to me by a gentleman at the bar, who is my tenant; it is my private property.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you know the number of the note, did you put it down yourself? A. I did, and I have it in my pocket - I did that on the 26th of August - I received it on the 22d of June, took it home, and had no occasion to look over my money, till the 26th of August, when I put down the numbers, dates and amounts of all my notes - I have the paper here now (looking at it); it was the only 40l. note I had - I have taken no other since; it was dated the 5th of May, 1827, No. 15261 - I received it from Mr. Crupton's clerk.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you leave any other note behind you? A. None, of any description, sort, or kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, look at this paper - here is under, the words,"Left in town" this 40l. note, and several other notes? A. I was possessed of these several notes on the 26th of August - when I came to town from time to time - I took out certain notes, I have crossed off all but this 40l. note, which was the only one I left in town, on the 16th of September - I had spent the rest at Brighton, and wanted the 40l. when I came to town.</p>

            . I am a servant. I am at present out of place - I have been acquainted with the prisoner from a boy - I met him in Bond-street, on the 10th of November; we walked together along Piccadilly, as far as the Park; we came back again, and he asked me to change him a 40l. note, which he said he had picked up in Chenies-mews, which is near Bedford-square; he told me he came honestly by it, that he picked it up in Cheniesmews - I changed it at Mr. Howis, an oilman in Piccadilly, whom I have known for some years - I got thirty sovereigns, and two 5l. notes for it - I did not notice the number of the note, but I noticed a piece torn off the top of it - I do not recollect noticing any thing else - I gave him the money, and he lent me 20l. of it; he partly offered to lend it to me, and I said I should be obliged to him - I gave him the money at a public-house in Vine-street; he said he would lend me 20l. of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to offer that? A. I told him I was in want of a little money, but not before he offered it me; he offered it me, and I accepted it - I have always given the same account of this - I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you always told the same account of it; is that perfectly true? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say you got it from a gentleman at the Clarendon Hotel? A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in the first instance tell the Magistrate you got the note from the prisoner? A. I did not - I did not tell him I got it from any body else - I said I got it from a gentleman; the prisoner's family are all respectable - I said the gentleman lived at No. 109, Great Titchfield-street - I did not give any other address.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not for the purpose of concealing the person you had it from, that you said it was a gentleman? A. No it was not - I meant to give the prisoner's name, and I did - I meant the prisoner when I said the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known him in service; when you described him as a gentleman, had he not been many years in service? A. Yes - I knew him as a footman, and in other capacities - I considered him as a gentleman - I had always found him correct and upright - I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060009"/>been in the House of Correction, for want of bail, since this transaction - I have come from there to day - I was sent there to give forty-eight hours' notice of bail to appear here, but I did not care for bail, as the Sessions were so near; it was eight or ten days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate, or any body that you took the note from a gentleman, who was waiting at the Clarendon Hotel? A. I did not - I mentioned the Clarendon Hotel, as I am in the habit of calling there every morning, and I mentioned the hotel to Howis, but did not say I took it from a gentleman there - I do not recollect the Magistrate saying he did not believe my account - I do not think he said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You changed the note at Howis'? A. Yes - I asked him to cash me the note, and had a long conversation with him, and he has since said, that I mentioned Lord Henley's name, but I did not mention any such name; he did not ask where I got the note - I told him I was expecting a situation to go out of town with a gentleman at the Clarendon Hotel.</p>

            . I am an oilman, and live in Piccadilly. I have no knowledge of Morris, except from his living in different services - I knew his person, and what places he had lived in; he came to me with a 40l. note, about the 8th or 10th of November - I do not know the day; he came from ten to eleven o'clock in the day; he came and asked for change for my Lord Henley; he said we served my Lord Henley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he introduce himself in that way? A. No; he asked for change for a 40l. note - I hesitated, and said, "I do not know you;" he then said, "I serve Lord Henley;" that was in order to remove my scruples - Lord Henley's father had been a customer at our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him where Lord Henley was, or did he tell you? A. He said he was at the Clarendon Hotel; that he had come from Ireland, on account of the death of the Hon. Sir William Wynn, his brother; I hesitated again, and looked at his appearance, which was that of a nobleman's upper servant, and then asked him for the note; I inspected it, and saw it was without any writing, or any thing on the back - I thought it had very probably been received from a banker, and from those circumstances gave him change; he stated other families which he had lived in before, and whom we were connected with in business, which strengthened my idea that he lived with Lord Henley; he mentioned Mrs. Trail, the widow of Henry Trail; he observed, that he was brought up on Mr. Trail's estate - I asked his name, and wrote it on the note; he gave me the name of Morris; he observed his lordship was going to trave which induced me to change the note - I paid it into Messrs. Drummonds, with our general account, and should know it again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he mentioned Lord Henley's name so frequently, that you had no doubt he was telling you the truth? A. Yes - I understood him clearly to say, that he was going to travel with Lord Henley, as his servant - I am certain he mentioned his lordship's name, and Mr. Wynn's.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I apprehended the prisoner on Friday, the 23d of November, in Great Titchfield-street - I took him to the office, and asked if he knew a person of the name of Morris - I asked him the question several times; he repeatedly said, he did not; this was not before the Magistrate - I asked if he knew any thing respecting a 40l. note, and if he had not given a person named Morris a note, of that description; he said No - I had not said it would be better or worse for him to say any thing; the chief constable then said, "Young man, do you mean to say you don't know a person named Morris?" he said he did not, but there was a Welshman named John, who was bred up in the same village with him - I asked if he had not given that John a 40l. note to change; he said he had not; he was examined by the Magistrate, and sent to the watch-house till the following day, and on our way to the watch-house, he himself began the conversation, and said,"The reason I would not know Morris was, because I had heard that day that he had been taken into custody" - Morris was at the office, but he had not seen him; on the following day I was present at his examination - the clerk wrote down what he said, and I attested it; no inducement whatever was held out to him; the Magistrate said,"Now, prisoner, you need not say any thing without you like, you are not bound to say any thing;" he said the truth was the truth, and began to make a statement - the clerk was called in, and took it down, and on the Tuesday following I saw him sign it; here it is (looking at it); this is his signature.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why were you not content with one denial from him, without asking him the same question over and over? A. Because I knew he had not told me true; I thought it right, to further the ends of justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you examine every man in this way? A. If I found any thing intricate, I probably should. I would not try to get a confession by any unfair means.</p>

               <p>GEORGE DYER. I know the note was paid in by Messrs. Grotes, by referring to our books; the bankers leave their parcels of notes, and write on the outside who they are from; I have written "Grote" on this note; I copied that from the book; we punch out the sum, and tear off the corner, to cancel it. Any writing at the back would be taken off if it covered the sum.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is done with the bits cut out? A. I believe they are kept till there is a large quantity, and then burnt; the book from which I copied this is still at the Bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060010"/>MR. VINES. I put my initials on the note exactly at the place where it is torn; this is the note which was taken out of my secretaire - I know it because I so often saw it, and have the date and number.</p>
               <p>The confession made by the prisoner was here read.</p>
               <p>MIDDLESEX. - The voluntary statement of ROBERT WILLIAMS. - Who says, "That in the first week of October last, opposite No. 50, in the mews, at the back of Upper Gower-street, I picked up a 40l. Bank of England note, and at the same time my master was riding on horseback up and down the mews; it was about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon - I told no person that day what I had found, nor did I mention it to any body, until I met John Morris, in Bond-street, last Saturday fortnight, when I told him that I had picked up a 40l. note in the mews, and asked him if he could get it changed; he said that he could, at Mr. Howis' in Piccadilly; we then walked together into Hyde Park, where I put the note into his hand, and told him to take it, and if he got it changed, he should have half; we then went into Piccadilly, and I waited outside, while he went into the shop of Mr. Howis, and he soon afterwards came out, with the change in his hand, and said, "Come along with me Bob, I have got twenty-five sovereigns or thirty (I cannot recollect which), and two 5l. notes", and we went together to a public-house near there, and he gave me two 5l. Bank of England notes, and ten sovereigns, and the same day I changed one of notes, at a public-house in Great Titchfield-street, and the other I changed two or three days afterwards, at a linen-draper's in Oxford-street - I wrote Morris's name on them, after I received them.</p>
               <p>(Signed) ROBERT WILLIAMS."</p>

The prisoner was occasionally employed by us, and on the 6th of November he was employed to pass down one hundred sacks of flour into a barge; I had suspicion, and discovered that a crate of glass and other things were broken open in our warehouse; I had not seen the crate before the discovery - I saw it opened about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and, on examining it, missed some articles; the prisoner was then gone. I sent for an officer, with whom I went to his brother's lodging; we found him and his brother together, and five cut-glass tumblers on the drawers before them - they were very handsome tumblers; I asked whose property they were - neither of them could tell me; they said they knew nothing about them; nobody else was in the room. The prisoner's brother said, if I waited a few minutes his wife would be in, and might be able to tell me about them - the wife came in, and said, in the prisoner's hearing, that she had been out all the morning, and the tumblers were not there when she went out - that she had been in at five o'clock, and they were not there then, and she knew nothing of them. I then gave charge of the prisoner, and the officer took the tumblers - they matched exactly with those in the crate, and we found them in a piece of red cloth, of the same sort as those in the crate were wrapped in; they are worth about 2s. each; we have employed him repeatedly; he did job work at times - he might earn 7s. or 8s. a day.</p>

            . I have belonged to the Police many years, but am now suspended, having met with an accident. On the 9th of November I was standing about thirty yards from the end of Fleet-market, when the Lord Mayour's procession was going by; the prisoner rushed by me, to two of his companions, and I heard him say to them, "I have done it;" they directly, in a whispering manner, said,"Get out of the crowd;" I followed him out of the crowd, laid hold of him at the end of the market, and said, "What have you done, young chap?" I put my hand into his side pocket, and took out this snuff-box, and then took out a pair of scissars - he said, "You have no right to take the scissars, they really do belong to me;" I did not see Mr. Greenfield till the Tuesday - a friend of his, who knew the box, happened to be in the office, and Mr. Greenfield came and claimed it. The prisoner told me, as I was going to the Compter, that he had picked it up in the kennel on the bridge; it was quite clean; his companious disappeared the moment I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>MR. GREENFIELD. I am quite certain this is my box; it was in my outside coat pocket, and could not have fallen out; I was not on the bridge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming over Blackfriars'-bridge, and saw the box in the kennel - I picked it up, wiped it with my handkerchief, and put it into my breast pocket.</p>

            . I am a clerk to John and Robert Warner, and have been so nearly sixteen years. On the 1st of November I placed Parker in a coil of pipe, so as to see who entered the shop; he afterwards made a communication to me, and I stopped the prisoner, who was down the yard, at the back of the premises - he merely went down the yard and returned; I said he had something about him which did not belong to him; he said, "I have;" I requested to see it, and he himself pulled it from his bosom - it was five pieces of metal of the same descripiton as that in our warehouse - it was given to the officer by Messrs. Warners; I believe it to be their's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been in your master's employ? A. Eight or nine months - they would not have employed him if his character had been bad; we have one hundred and forty men.</p>

               <p>Q. What led you first to suspect the prisoner? A. She slept in the same bed with me, and on the morning of the 15th I found my pocket, which contained the keys of my trunk, was moved from my pillow, where I had put it the night before; the keys were still in the pocket; I went down stairs to my trunk, counted my money, and missed nine sovereigns; I have found none of them. Ballard, the housemaid, came, and I told her; I then told Mrs. Harrison; when I spoke to the prisoner about it, she said she had not moved my pocket; I know she had no money on the 1st of November, for she borrowed 3s. 6d. of me, and on the 7th she told me she did not know when she could pay me, for she had no money.</p>

            . I am a butcher. On the 18th of July I was in Charles-street, St. George's, (which is a little way from the Jolly Sailors), about one, or it might be two o'clock - I passed the Jolly Sailors, and saw Watson, whom I knew, holding a bay, or a brown horse there - I went to buy some wood for a pig-stye - I came up Charles-street, back again, and saw a horse, and a person on it, about twenty yards off - I was told his name was Dean - I think it was the prisoner; he looks to me to be the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Dean before? A. Yes; the prisoner is the person; when first I saw the horse, it was about twenty yards from me, coming past me - I spoke to the person who was on it, and I took him to be this Dean - I said, "There you are, Thomas," or something of that; he looked back, and said, "There you are, Charley," or something of that; he rode away towards Chapman-street, and I came on; he was trotting; this was a few minutes after I had seen Watson holding the horse - I had seen Dean two or three times before, or it might be more, I cannot exactly say - I may have seen him several times - I have seen him in company with Watson - I cannot saw how many times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect whether you have seen him more than once with Watson? A. I have - I cannot tell when - I cannot say how long I have known Dean; it is a good while ago.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you remember being examined here on a former trial? A. Yes; the prisoner is the person I saw on the horse in Charles-street - I know he was acquainted with Watson - I have seen them together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What are you? A. A journeyman butcher. I know it was the 18th of July, for I was at the dock on the 16th and 17th - I believe it was about one or two o'clock. I know I had dined. I will not swear it was not three or four o'clock. Charles-street is not far from the Jolly Sailors public-house - it is the second coach turning on the right - it is not half a quarter of a mile. I was going to a shop in the back road, which is about thirty yards from Charles-street. I was a-head of the person on the horse at first, and he passed me. I turned down Martha-street, and he turned another way; he was in Charles-street, coming in a direction from the Jolly Sailors. I was returning with the wood. I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060014"/>come by the Jolly Sailors in my way back, but did as I went - I was shifting my wood on my shoulder - the horse was trotting - it was walking at first; when I first saw it, it was about twenty yards from me - it went very slow, between a walk and a trot; while I was shifting the wood I saw the horse coming up, my back was towards him till he passed me, and he was then trotting fast - he passed me as I was going to turn the corner - it did not vanish in a minute. I said "There you are Thomas" - he said "There you are Charley." I cannot swear to what he said, but I understood it was that. I have not seen the prisoner since that till to-day - I am sure he is the person now I come to look at him - it was a long while ago, and I could not swear to him till I looked at him. I have since been living with my brother-in-law, as a butcher - I work as a butcher when I can get it to do.</p>
               <p>RICHARD PECK re-examined. Q. Where was it that you saw part of the horse in the dust? A. Close to the Jolly Sailors - he was cantering - that was immediately after I lost it, before he got into Charles-street. I do not know Charles-street, but I think I turned down two or three street before I saw it - the streets run in a crooked direction, and there was a great mob after the horse - the Jolly Sailors is in Back-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say, that as soon as you came out of the house you saw a dust, and part of the horse galloping off? A. I did not see it till I went down two or three streets. I went down several turnings, but being in a hurry, I could not tell whether it was two or three streets - the streets are very short there. I do not know the name of any of them. I saw a dust, and caught a glimpse of the horse.</p>

            . I live in Back-lane, Shadwell, and am an egg-merchant - I am in business with my mother. On the 18th of July I was standing at my door, which is three or four doors from the Jolly Sailors, on the same side of the way. I saw Mr. Peck ride down to the Jolly Sailors, and stop with a bay horse - he went into the house, leaving his horse at the door with a young man whom I saw here last Sessions - he was called Watson - he brought the horse opposite my mother's door; another young man came up - the one who was holding it said, "Get up;" he got up and rode up the street, opposite my mother's door, towards the Commercial-road; he afterwards made a tarning round, and went towards Charles-street. I cannot say whether the prisoner is the person. I did not notice him to know him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You stood at your mother's door? A. Yes - he turned round one street, and then I saw him no more. I do not mean that he turned back, but he passed two or three streets before he came to this turning - there is a street directly opposite my mother's door, and up that street are five or six streets crossways - I saw him pass two or three streets before he turned down one; that would lead towards the Commercial-road, and towards Charles-street.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Brockhurst, within two miles of Gosport. I know Cutt's stables at Brockhurst. I went there in the month of August, about seven or eight o'clock in the morning - I do not recollect what I went there for; a man named Hitchcock came there about half an hour after I got there - he is not here to-day - I saw the prisoner there - I think he was there when I first went, but I am not curtain of that. I saw some horses there. Mr. Barber took a horse away with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in August, see the horse there, which Barber afterwards took away? A. Yes - I think it was the same, it was a bay horse - it was shown out for sale that morning, I do not recollect by whom. Cutts had two or three men there - the prisoner was there; the man called Cutts goes by the name of Brown; the prisoner was there looking after the horses the same as other men about the premises. I do not think Cutts was up when I first went there. Hitchcock asked some people in the yard about a horse, but I do not recollect which or whether the prisoner was by; one of the men said Hitchcock could not see the horse till Brown was up. I cannot say whether that was the prisoner. I have said I thought it was the prisoner who said so, but I cannot recollect which man said so. Cutts was called up - I cannot say who it was that called him up.</p>

               <p>RICHARD PECK. I live at Old Ford. On the 18th of July I went into the Jolly Sailors public-house, Back-street, Shadwell, leaving my gelding in charge of Watson; I came out in about five minutes, in consequence of an alarm; the horse and Watson were gone; I went in search, but could not find it; on the 19th of October I found it in possession of Mr. Barber, the Governor of Gosport gaol - it was a bay gelding, worth thirty-five guineas; I lost the saddle and harness with it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You have been Governor of the Bridewell a considerable time? A. Yes; I had known the prisoner two or three months - he knew I was Governor of the Bridewell - he had shown me the horse about three weeks before - it was not then in so good a condition; when I saw it afterwards it had been well attended to.</p>
               <p>Q. It had not been cut in the mane or tail? A. Yes, I am sure it had - the hair of the tail had been cut and combed - it was a switch tail when I first saw it; being cut made a very great alteration in its appearance; I do not mean to say that the fleshy part of the tail was cut - it was a cob tail; I saw several persons at the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not a stable in which any body might put a horse? A. No; he made no secret of showing me the horse; I was frequently there, and had seen it two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see different persons about the stable? A. Yes, Mr. Brown's attendants; the horse had been brought to my house with another or two, to be shown to a friend of mine - my son rode it about, and was so delighted with it, that Brown, in conversation, called it my son's horse. My house is nearly two miles from his stable - it joins Gosport gaol.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, "Oh, Mr. Brown, I am in trouble" - did he not add, "It is a pity such a thing should have been left with me?" A. I do not recollect it - I wish to mention all he said; I will not say he did not, for he said a great deal to me.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far is his stable from Old Ford? A. About eighty miles; I had no information about it when my son rode it.</p>

            . I am constable of Gosport. I accompanied Mr. Barber to the prisoner's premises; I was in the road close by the yard - Mr. Barber came out to me in about five minutes, and showed me a bay a horse; I had seen the prisoner go into the house with Mr. Barber, and as I stood at the stable door I saw him make his escape across the yard into the field; I told Mr. Barber, and followed him across three fields; he was running without a hat; I called a man named Fryer to assist me, and about three fields off we came up to him; I stood, and saw Fryer bring him from a hedge; he had slippers on, and no hat - he took me by the arm, and said, "I am beat - I will go with you like a man, Stroud."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see him show the horse to Barber? A. I saw him go to the stable with him; I went into the stable afterwards; I had seen young Mr. Barber trying the horse at Bridewell, about eleven o'clock one day; a great many people were there; I never saw it before.</p>
               <p>RICHARD PECK. I received the horse from Barber - it is the one I lost at the time in question; I got it from Barber's stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you a doubt of its being yours the moment you saw it? A. No; I knew it directly - it was not fatter than when I lost it; the tail had been trimmed; it was cut - it had been cut previous to my losing it, but it had grown long again; when I found it it had been cut shorter than I had ever seen it before; no joints were taken off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Dean is the man who brought the horse to my place, which I believe Mr. Blunden knows - he came to my house on the 29th of July, with a horse, and I gave information of it to his father, and he sent to tell me to take care of the horse and his son, for he had a friend arranging the matter with Mr. Peck, which was the cause I kept the horse; I never offered to sell it. I took a cob down to show a friend of Mr. Barber's, and I rode this gelding myself; I never intended to sell the gelding. I never showed it for sale to any individual - it was seen publicly in plenty of places.</p>

On the 29th of November, about twelve o'clock in the day, I was at the second floor front window, and saw the prisoner in the front garden - he asked if I wanted to buy any black-lead pencils; I answered No, and he left the garden; I immediately came down stairs into the front parlour, and observed the window a little way open; the bottom sash was about two inches up - there was not then room for any one to get in; I had seen it about eight or nine o'clock that morning; it was then quite shut. I went from the parlour into the kitchen; the silver wine-strainer was then safe on the parlour side-board; I returned from the kitchen in about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060017"/>five minutes, and found the sash thrown quite up; a chair was moved from the window, and I saw the prisoner walking from the side-board as I entered the room; I laid hold of him, till Mrs. Jones came to my assistance; she took hold of him, and before I had time to look at the side-board, she took the wine-strainer from his waistcoat pocket; I sent for a constable, and he was secured. I had not observed the window after nine o'clock; it was shut then, for I opened the shutters.</p>
               <p>MRS. JONES. I was not in the front parlour, to my knowledge, till Hudson called me up, and I saw her struggling with the prisoner, to hold him; I took hold of him by the collar, and secured him; he struggled a little, to get away, and I observed the wine-strainer under his coat, in his waistcoat pocket, and took it out - it is my husband's, and worth at least 10s. I had not opened the parlour window at all that day.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Mary, Islington. On the 29th of November I was fetched to Mr. Jones', and found the prisoner in the parlour; I searched him, and found two bundles of pencils in his coat pocket, and outside the window, on the cill, two more bundles; I asked if they belonged to him - he said they did. I found a bag in his hat; Mrs. Jones delivered me the wine-strainer, and said, in his presence, that she took it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>MRS. JONES. This is ours, and what I found on the prisoner; nobody was in the house besides me, Hudson, and a char-woman, who was in the bed-room; she came about seven o'clock, and was there till after the robbery; she was entirely occupied in the bed-room. My husband was not at home.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no Defence.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 15.</p>
               <p>The Jury stated it to be their opinion that the prisoner did not open the window in the first instance. Recommended to Mercy by the Prosecutrix, on account of his good character.</p>

            . I am an umbrella maker, and live in Gun-street, Old Artillery-ground. On the 10th of November, about half-past seven, or a quarter to eight o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18271206-22-crimeloc112">Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

I was looking towards Spitalfields-church, and saw a man lying in the road, under the shaft-horse's belly - I was on the near side of the dray, and saw the near-wheel pass over his body; I hallooed out, and ran to pick the man up; I held him there till assistance came - the prisoner drove the dray; I did not see him at that instant; I cannot say he was not on that side the dray: he came to my assistance in a minute; he came as from the fore horse's head: I had not seen him there before; he helped to carry the man to the doctor's; the man sighed as I crossed the road, and he was dead when we got to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner came to your assistance the moment you called out? A. Yes, and stopped his dray; he seemed as sorry as a man could be; he could not go slower than he went: the deceased laid across the road; I cannot say whether he was drunk; he laid there as if he was dead, before the wheel passed over him; he might have been dead before the wheel touched him, for what I know; he did not speak after the accident, or show the least signs of life.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. You had not seen the prisoner before the deceased was under the horse's belly? A. No; he sighed after we took him up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you meet the dray, or overtake it? A. I met it; I did not see the prisoner at his horse's head, I did not pay attention: if he had been there when I met the dray, I must have seen him; I did not see him come as from the horse's head till after the accident.</p>

            . My husband is a silk-weaver; we live in Silver-street; I was at the corner of Union-street, coming up Bishopsgate-street, and saw two drays; I wanted to cross, and stopped for them; I saw a man on the ground, about a yard and a half from the curb - I was on the near side of the horses; the man at first prevented my crossing; the first horse stepped over him without touching him, and, I believe, both horses stepped over him; the prisoner was at the side of his horse when the wheel went over the man; he was near the wheel, where the body lay - he came from across Sun-street - I saw him a minute before the wheel went over the man; he was on the right side of his horses - he had not time to stop them; I had seen the deceased before - his name was Isaac Boddy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not the dray-horses as quiet as possible? A. They could not go much slower - it was a dark night - the man laid in the road, as if he was dead, before the horses came near him - his bundle laid at a little distance from him; he did not seem to move hand or foot; when the alarm was given, the prisoner ran round, and seemed much agitated - it was a dark rainy night; I must have stepped on the man's legs myself, if I had stepped off the curb.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the horses come quite up to you before you attempted to pass? A. No; they were so near I did not think it safe to pass; the prisoner at that time was coming along by the side of his fore-house - he was nearly as close to me as the fore-horse; I believe he did not see the man - he stopped the horses the moment the alarm was given - he called out, "Whoa!" and caught hold of the horses bridle as soon as ever he saw the body - that was after the mischief was done - he had not time to do it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to lay hold of the bridle before the wheel went over the man? A. No; he did not see him; I saw the man before the horse came up, but it was very close to him; I did not call to him to stop - I was speaking to my sister at the time.</p>

            . I am the wife of Simeon Robinson, of Spicer-street. On the 10th of November I was in Bishopsgate-street, near the corner of Union-street, and saw two drays; one had passed except the hind-wheel; when I got up I saw something on the ground; my sight being bad, I could not discern whether it was a man or woman - the wheel went over it; I was taken with a violent trembling and giddiness, and was scarcely able to stand - I do not recollect seeing the prisoner, except at the workhouse, where the Inquest was held.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any man attending the dray that night? A. I saw something white, apparently like the jacket of the drayman, sitting on the shaft, but my eyesight is so very bad.</p>
               <p>Q. You have given an account of this before; had he a whip in his hand? A. I saw, as I thought, a man put something out of his hand, but it was very dark; I was much frightened - my sight failed from the giddiness of my head; I was obliged to support myself against the shutters of a linen-draper's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the dray before it came up? A. Not the first one - it was going very slow.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About what hour was this? A. A little before seven o'clock - he was all over dirt, and asked for a small dram, which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. He being as drunk as he could be? A. I did not see that he was drunk then; several people were about him; I saw that he was drunk from the manner he came in; he was scarcely able to stand when I took him to the door - it was a very dark night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. You did not feel your handkerchief when you felt your pocket-book? A. I felt both my pockets, and thought it was safe; my attention was principally directed to my pocket-book - I think it impossible it could have been taken any where but at Windus' - I was hustled there - I stopped at no other place; no one was near me all the way home; it was between eleven and twelve o'clock - Mr. Windus' house is in the City.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I was in Bishopsgate-street, near Mr. Windus'; my attention was attracted by seeing a party of persons round his shop - I went there, and saw the Lord Mayor's carriage - I did not see Mr. Ryder to know his person; the first I saw was Henley turning up the cuff of his coat, and Cochrane close by him; they looked me full in the face - I did not know them before, nor do I know that they have ever seen me - suspecting them I went a round about way, and came to the house - I went into a public-house directly opposite Mr. Windus', and had a clear view of the prisoners, through the glass of the door - I saw them attempt the pockets of several persons, and the baskets of females; they moved away from the spot several times, and talked together; I saw them both press against a person, whom I suppose to be the prosecutor - I saw Henley draw a handkerchief from that person's pocket, at Mr. Windus' door; he put it under his coat, without putting it into his pocket, and ran off, followed by Cochrane - I crossed the road, got before Henley, seized him round the waist, and took the handkerchief - Cochrane was rather before Henley, and as soon as he saw me take Henley, he turned back - I called Stop him! and he came towards me - I took him into a tobacconist's-shop - Mr. Ryder's name is at full length on the handkerchief in ink - I found him out by the Directory, and he claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HENLEY. Q. Will you swear you saw the handkerchief taken from that gentleman? A. I saw it taken from a gentleman; he had a dark coat on, either black or olive - I could see your countenance for twenty minutes; when I called Stop him! Cochrane stopped directly, and came to me; my partner was with me; we were going to see his son, who is in service, and he went into a sadler's-shop at the time this happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. Why not tell me you had another officer with you? A. Mr. Hobler did not think it proper to bind him over, as he did not see the transaction - directly I called Stop him! Cochrane turned round, and came to me - Henley was certainly the most active person; they both pressed against the prosecutor; I suppose it to be the prosecutor. I have been an officer for five years.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>HENLEY's Defence. I was coming up Petticoat-lane, and saw a Jew with some clothes, and the handkerchief; he offered it as a bargain, for 4s. - I said I had but 2s. 6d.; he would not take less than 3s. 6d., which I gave him - I put it into my breast, as another person might; it has now become a fashionable way; I was going along Bishopsgate-street, looking at the carriage; this lad came up, and asked what was the matter; the pressure was so great, I could not get near to see - I pushed into the crowd and saw it was a carriage - I walked on, and the officer came and took me; he called to the prisoner, who was crossing the road, and he came to him.</p>
               <p>Cochrane received a good character.</p>

I went to the end of the square, stopped a few minutes, and presently saw Barnett standing outside - he went up the garden - Moffitt was also outside. Barnett received a parcel from the parlour window - a little boy jumped from the window, and all three went off together - I cannot say who the boy was - he had handed the parcel out - it was wrapped in something white. I am sure the prisoner is not one of the three, for two have been convicted, and the other was a smaller boy - there could not be any other boy on that side of the square without my seeing him.</p>

            . I work for my brother-in-law. I was in the Horseferry-road, which is five or ten minutes walk from Mr. Greig's house, and saw the prisoner carrying a clock under his arm - Barnett was with him; they ran down a little court, and Cole after them - I do not know what became of them. I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

            . I live in Royal Hospital-row, Chelsea, and am a green grocer. I have known the prisoner three or four years as an acquaintance of my son's. On the 10th of October he called with another person, whom I do not know, to sell me some potatoes - they did not show me any sample; the prisoner asked me to give him change for a 5l. note, which he gave me - I gave him five sovereigns, and he wrote on the note of his own accord, in my presence "Nathaniel Peppiatt, Croydon;" they went away. I put the note into my purse, which I kept in my pocket till the 14th, and then gave it to James Dubois, who lives in our row, to pay to Mr. Badcock. Dubois brought it to me again on the 19th, and said it was bad. I returned it to him to keep till I found the prisoner. I told my son if he should meet him in Covent-garden market, not to mention any thing about the note, but to say I wished to see him, and next day, the 20th he came to me,(looking at the note) this is the note he gave me - I know it by the writing on it. I had not other with that writing on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You had known him some years? A. Between three and four - he was always on friendly terms with me. I do not know whether he came to my shop in a gig, for I found him there. I could not tell that he had written the word "Croyden" under his name, till I got a gentleman to read it, it was so blotted; but whatever the word was, I am sure nobody but him wrote it. I am sure there was a third word on the note - it was an elderly man who was with him; they said that the man had some potatoes in the country, and was going to have some up. I did not see the prisoner put the sovereigns into the other man's hand; he did not say he was going to establish the prisoner as an agent in town; the prisoner has collected debts, and done other things for me. I have always found him strictly honest.</p>

            . I am an appraiser, and live at Chelsea. On the 12th of October I received this note from Mrs. Faulkner, and marked it; this is it (looking at it) - it was afterwards returned to me, as forged; I took it back to her on the 19th; she said at first, that was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060021"/>the note; I asked her by what means she knew it was not - she said Peppiatt had wrote his name on the back of it; and after minutely examining it, she found the name written in pale ink, and showed it me; I knew it was what she paid me, for I had written on it, "Mrs. Faulkener, 12th of October, J. D." On the 20th of October, in consequence of information, I accompanied Wicks, the officer, to Mrs. Faulkener's, between six and eight o'clock in the evening; I found the prisoner there, and said to him,"Do you know the note you paid Mrs. Faulkener is forged?" he said, "Is it?" I said, "Yes, from whom did you receive it?" he said, "I received it of Mr. Sully;" I said, "For what?" he said, "For some hay which I sold him;" I asked who Sully was; he said he was a gentleman living at Pimlico: I said, "Does he keep cows or horses, that he should buy hay of you?" he said, "He don't keep cows, but he keeps a horse and gig or two;" I said, "I presume Mr. Sully will have no objection to give you the money for it?" he said, "Oh, No, he will have no objection; if you will jump into my gig I will take you to the house where Sully lives;" the gig was at the door: he eventually drove me and the constable to No. 12, Trellick-terrace, Vauxhall-road; he said, "Here is where Mr. Sully lives; I will get out, and get you the money;" Wicks said, "No, you stop here; Mr. Dubois is quite capable of making the necessary inquiries;" I got out, and gave a double knock at the door, which a female opened, who turned out to be the prisoner's mother; I asked her if Mr. Sully lived there; the prisoner was near enough to hear what passed: she said, "Mr. Sully? Mr. Sully?" with a sort of hesitation; I said, "Yes, does Mr. Sully live here; do you know any thing of Mr. Sully?" she said, "He neither lives here, nor do I know any thing of him:" at that moment my hands were against the doorpost - the prisoner run betwixt my arms, and said, "Yes, Yes - No, No - here, tell Mr. so and so to come; Mr. What-do-you-call-him to come here; here is a forged note come home - for God's sake, give me five sovereigns:" his words "Yes, Yes" were in answer to her saying Sully did not live there; at that moment there was a scream or shout in the house, from two or three women or children, and they said, "Here are the traps - they are after us, by G-d." The prisoner was just within the passage - I had hold of him; he could hear what passed: I heard those words distinctly, in the parlour, the door of which was open; they were repeated half a dozen times. I said to Wicks, "We have our answer," for I was afraid of a rescue - I saw two men, one indistinctly, but the other (who was a man of colour) followed us out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you found the woman was the prisoner's mother? A. Yes, she had lived in Chelsea, not a dozen doors from my house, with her husband and family, about three years ago, and I knew her when the light came, but she opened the door without a light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then had you known the prisoner during his father's life time? A. Yes - his father was a cow-keeper; I understand he had been dead a few months; the prisoner generally lived with him, I cannot say always; it was a female's voice that said "the traps are after us."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to detain any of the men in the house? A. The prisoner's mother caught hold of him, and attempted to pull him inside; I said, "If you don't let go, you are attemptin a rescue;" she then went into the parlour, and a man of colour came out; I did not go to any constable, to have the persons in the house secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been on ill terms, at any time, with the prisoner and his family? A. Upon cautious terms with the whole of them. I am an appraiser and carpenter. I was never interested, in any way, in the sale of bread; I have been living at No. 5, Hospital-row for fifteen or sixteen years; I know Wicks. When Mr. Faulkener died he was in difficulties, and, as a friend, I compounded with his creditors for the widow; I was to receive the monies for the principal creditor, and pay it to him.</p>

            . I am constable of Chelsea, and live in Royal Hospital-row. I was sent for by Mrs. Faulkener on the 20th of October; I went, and found the prisoner there; Mr. Dubois first spoke to him; I also asked him where he got the note; he told me he had taken it from Mr. Sully, in Vauxhall-road, for a load of hay, and if I would get into his gig he would take me to Sully's house; just as we were going to step into the gig; he said, "We don't want Dubois with us;" I said, "Yes, he will go with us:" we all three then got into the gig; the prisoner drove us to No. 12, Trellick-terrace, and said, "This is the house Mr. Sully lives in - I will get out and get the money;" I said, "No, let Mr. Dubois get out, and make the inquiries;" Dubois got out, knocked at the door, and said, "Does Mr. Sully live here?" the prisoner's mother, who opened the door, said,"No, he does not;" Dubois said, "Do you know such a person?" she said, "No, we don't know such a person as Mr. Sully:" the prisoner then jumped out of the gig, without saying a word to me - he ran to the door, and I after him; I caught hold of him, and prevented his going into the house; I saw Mr. Catts, a man of colour, in the passage, and two or three women and children running about the house: the prisoner seemed very much confused, and said,"Oh! Mr. So-and-so, lend me five sovereigns, for there is a bad note come home."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he used the words "So and so?" A. Yes - he seemed much confused, and wanted to get into the house; there was a cry of "The traps are after us, by G-d;" it appeared to be a female voice; the prisoner's mother caught hold of him, and wanted to drag him into the house; I told her he was in my custody, and should not go in; he repeated several times, "Lend me five sovereigns, do, to take this note, or to pay for the note;" I said I had nothing to do with the money, and must take him before a Magistrate; I dragged him from the door - he said,"Don't drag me along - let me go in the chaise again;" I said he could, but Dubois must drive: Dubois got up - I was going to hand the prisoner up, but Catts came out, and said, "Oh, what is this - this here little matter, can't I settle it," and as I was going to get up, he said, "Oh! d-n it, you are not going to run away with my chaise." I then took the prisoner out of the chaise, and suffered Catts to take it away, and I took the prisoner away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who is Catts? A. Not a man of very good character, I believe; I did not know him before - I have seen him since at Queen-square; he was not taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060022"/>up about this. The prisoner knew I was a constable - I do not know how long his father has been dead.</p>

            . I am an apothecary, and live at Pimlico; the house, No. 12, Trellick-terrace, belongs to me. On the 20th of October, a man, calling himself, William Peppiatt, was my tenant; he took the house of me on the 1st of September - a man, calling himself Sully, was witness to the agreement drawn up about the house; I know him by sight, but do not know his name to be Sully- here is the agreement; he did not sign his name to it, but was present - I did not know him before; he was called Sully by those who were present; I have seen him several times since; he had no interest in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know whether he lived there or not? A. I have seen him there, and conversed with him; he is about fifty-five years of age - he had not the appearance of a respectable person; the prisoner was not present when the agreement was made; I never saw the man Peppiatt, who took the house, afterwards- I have seen the prisoner's mother there repeatedly; I did not consider Sully as a lodger, but as a friend of their's- I never saw any lodgers there; I never saw the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you got possession of your house again? A. Yes, about ten days after the prisoner was taken; I found it quite abandoned.</p>

            . I am a patrol, and often go up Trellick-terrace, and have seen the prisoner at No. 12 - I saw him there on the morning before he was apprehended, Friday, the 19th of October; I also saw him there on the 7th, 8th, and 10th of October; on the morning of the 8th I saw him coming down stairs, tying his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time in the morning was that? A. Seven o'clock; I have no doubt he slept there of a night - he knew me to be a patrol; he sent for me on the 7th, to take charge of a person who had stolen a cart from him. I never noticed that he seemed to avoid me - I know his mother lived there, and let lodgings.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Do you mean to say you knew she let lodgings? A. No; I know nothing of her letting lodgings - I understood the gentleman to ask whether she lived in lodgings there. I know a woman brought some fire-irons there, as if she was a lodger.</p>

            . I keep the Bell and Crown public-house, Camden-town. I did not know the prisoner before the 20th of October, when he came to my house, in company with a man named Shorter, whom I knew before; they came together, and took refreshment together; Shorter wanted me to take some premises for the prisoner, for a potatoe-warehouse; Shorter asked if I wanted a load of good hay; I made a bargain for a load, but it was never delivered; they lunched there; Shorter produced a 10l. note, and paid me for what they both had; I gave Shorter 9l. 17s. 6d. in change; I gave the note to my wife, who marked it, to the best of my knowledge; I do not recollect seeing her mark it; (looking at one) this is her writing; I took another 10l. note that day, from a Mr. Grant- I received it before I took this one, I think; it was loose in my pocket, for I was very busy that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the one you received of Shorter? A. I put it down; I cannot say exactly which of the two notes it was, but I put it down on the desk, and told my wife to mark it - I gave her both at one time, to the best of my knowledge; I do not know whether she marked both: I paid them both away that afternoon, to a cheesemonger, who lives in Tottenham-court-road, in change for silver - this note was afterwards returned, as forged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say which of the notes you took from Shorter? A. No, not to say with certainly - Shorter talked most: they came in a chaise; I think the prisoner was not in the room when Shorter paid me the note - he went out about the horse.</p>

            . I am waiter at the White Hart public-house, Temple-mills, near Hackney-marsh - it joins the marsh; there is a road through our premises to the marsh, and a gate there. On Saturday, the 13th of October, I saw some persons in the marsh - the prisoner was one of them; I had seen him before, and am not mistaken in his person; Hilt, and another person, whom I knew by sight, and now understand to be John Holden, were with him; I knew them all three well; I knew the prisoner by name - they called him Crummy Newman; they had nothing with them, but were all three walking together on the marsh; I saw them all three together again on Monday morning, the 15th, at six o'clock; I saw them pass through master's yard; the prisoner was riding on a black mare, about fifteen hands high, with a white blaze, a white stripe down the nose, and a white fetlock on the off hindfoot; one of the others was riding another horse, and the third one opened the gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know what has become of Holden? A. No; he did not live in the neighourhood - he was very well dressed - better than the prisoner; I have not seen him since.</p>

            . I am an innkeeper and farmer, at Brickwall, Hatfield, Herts. On Thursday, the 18th of October, the prisoner Newman, and a person, who I have heard since goes by the name of Holden, came there, between two and three o'clock - they were the only two persons; they brought two mares and a gelding, all black; there was one young mare, fifteen hands high, which Mr. Mash afterwards claimed; Holden brought the two mares into my yard; the prisoner stood by the gelding, outside the gate; I believe he was within hearing; Holden asked me to take the mares in to grass till Saturday morning, when he would call again for them; they stopped to see the mares fed; I think the prisoner went into the stable, but am certain Holden went to see them fed; the prisoner mounted the gelding; Holden went away on foot, a little before the prisoner; Holden was to return on the Saturday; on the Sunday evening, about six o'clock, the prisoner came back alone; he said his master was detained late on Friday night at Smithfield market, and could not come on the Saturday as he proposed, but would come on Monday night, or Tuesday morning; he said he had come to see if the mares were taken care of, or how they were, or something to that effect; I had suspicions then; when they brought the mares to the stable, I asked Holden if the mares were for sale; I cannot say where the prisoner was then; he said he had some thoughts of asking 18l. for the mare, but it was in bad condition; I asked if it was the lowest, and he said he might take a little less; when the prisoner came on Sunday night, I persuaded him to stay all night with me, and, after having some refreshment, I asked him if he thought the mares could be sold; he said Yes; I said, "Your master talked of 18l.; I have a horse or two, and should have no objection to change with him; do you know whether she will go in chains?" he said No; I said, "Well, in the morning we will try her:" while he was having his refreshment, I sent for a constable, and in the morning I took him into custody myself; he was taken before the Magistrate, and discharged (this was on the 22d), as the owner of neither of the mares was there; the prosecutor came on the Friday following, and claimed this mare; she was delivered to him on the 11th of November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know Holden at all? A. I thought I had seen him before, but am not positive; he was dressed more respectably than the prisoner; the prisoner called him his master all through, and I supposed him to be his master, as the prisoner himself gave no orders about the mares.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner offered 5l. for one of the horses? A. Not by me, nor in my presence, to my knowledge - several persons were present, and had a deal of conversation with him; he might have been offered money for it, without my bearing it - Holden did not come back.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the prisoner returned on the Sunday, had you made a noise about the neighbourhood? A. It struck me they were stolen, and I had been to a Magistrate, and I employed men to sit up, in case they should come and take the horses by force - Holden paid for the refreshment - I believe he was paymaster, but I was not the person who received the money.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. When did you make a stir about the horses? A. On the Saturday.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner in his father's cottage, in Wick-lane, Hackney, and have endeavoured to find the other persons - I know Holden - I do not think he is a horse-dealer - I took the prisoner on Monday, the 12th of November, I think; I told him it was for felony, and asked what he had done with the horses; he said he took them to Enfield-highway; he said, "My intention was not to steal them - I gave my right name and address - I might have sold them over and over again."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Now tell us exactly what passed?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060024"/>A. A good deal of conversation occurred; he said Hilt had accompanied him into one of the green lanes, riding one of the horses; that he then delivered him the other horse, and he took them both to Enfield-highway; that he had been bid money for the horses, but refused to sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he had not the least intention of stealing them, and might have sold them over and over again? A. Yes, and that he had given his right name and address to the publican in Enfield-highway.</p>

            . I live in Baldwin's-gardens, in the top attic of the next house to the prisoner, and could hear what passed in his room - I only knew Barrett by sight. On the 30th of October, I was at home very poorly in bed. I knew her voice, and between eight and nine o'clock I heard her cry Murder! and Oh! I heard her open the window and call Murder! she called Mr. Bigmore twice - the second time her voice was faint. I heard the window shut with force, and she fell. I heard the prisoner say he could not go to work without his wash-brush, and say, with an oath, that he would murder her - this was after the window shut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know this woman? A. I had known her five months. I never saw her in liquor but once, and that was on a Sunday afternoon.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Gerrard-street. I was called in to attend the deceased on the 2d of November, at No. 35, Church-street, Soho - I found her in bed; she complained of a difficulty of breathing, and a pain in her chest - that she had fallen down in a fit, and hurt her left side against a chair or table. I found she had broken a left rib; the skin over the fracture was discoloured; she was then suffering from inflammation of the lungs, which, in spite of the usual means, terminated fatally on the 9th of November - I saw her daily. I examined her body two days after her death; there were two or three bruises on both her legs - the rib was broken in the most favourable manner possible; there were no external appearances to account for her death. I opened the body; the lung on the injured side was very little inflamed, only one rib fractured; there were no appearances on that side to lead me to account for her death, but the right lung was very acutely inflamed; there was no disease on the chest;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060025"/>the liver and the lining membrane of the stomach, had evidently been suffering from a low degree of inflammation a considerable time - it might have been going on for months, and that of the right lung for a considerable time - these are the appearances we generally find in dram drinkers. I ascribe her death to the inflammation of the right lung; the fracture, in my judgment, had nothing to do with it.</p>

I had an opportunity of observing their features, and believe the prisoner to be one of them, and to be the man who snatched the chain, but I will not positively swear to him.

               <p>MR. LANGDALE. I am a stranger in town, and cannot say in what direction I pursued; I did not follow more than twenty or thirty yards; I picked up a hat, which I gave a person, whom I then thought was assisting me, but he immediately made a snatch at the remaining part of my chain, and got it. I pursued to the wide part of the Old Bailey; I do not remember now which eye was black - I had not dined, nor drank any thing.</p>
               <p>HEZEKIAH WILMER. When I first saw the prisoner he was coming as if from St. Sepulchre's church - he turned at first towards Smithfield, but seeing me crossing he came towards Newgate-street - we asked the prosecutor for a description of the people; I had seen three persons of that description go down the Old Bailey ten minutes before: he said one was dressed like a sailor - the prisoner was so dressed.</p>

On the 9th of November I left the stable as the watchman was going past eight o'clock in the evening - all was safe then; I returned about twenty minutes after eight, and found the door bolted inside; I had not left it bolted inside, but had locked it, and taken the key with me, leaving every part of the building safe. I could not get in - I got assistance, forced the door open, and got in - I did not examine the lock afterwards; I am certain I had locked it; we searched the stable, and found nothing- we went into the loft, and found nobody there - but in a sort of cock-loft, over the room in which I live, we found both the prisoners; they were perfect strangers to me, and had no business there - I never saw them before, to my knowledge - we secured them. I looked at my box, which had contained three shirts, six pairs of stockings, three neck-handkerchiefs, three towels, three shifts, two waistcoats, and a gown - they had all been moved out of the box - I found them in a basket in the same room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Does any body else sleep there besides yourself? A. Only my wife. - The things were in a box in the loft adjoining the room where I sleep. The prisoners were in a cock-loft over my room; my wife is not here - I might not have seen the things for a day or two before: I had been to the box on the Wednesday - this was Friday. I had seen the box every day.</p>
               <p>Q. For what you know, the things might have been moved into the basket before? A. I saw the basket the same evening, before I went out - there was some wet linen in it, but none of these things - I will swear there was no dry linen in it; I had seen it ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I went out - my wife went out with me: there are windows to the place - there is a stable and coach-house door - I had fastened them both about eight o'clock, and fastened all the windows: I am certain none of them were open. I missed the linen directly I found the prisoners there, but did not examine particularly what articles they were till we took the prisoners to the watch-house - nothing was found on them.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's wife. I have been married to him eleven weeks to-day; we lodged at my father's house. On the 10th of November he left home about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, and told me to come over to the Greyhound at Enfield, to meet him, at half-past six in the evening; we had then been married seven weeks, all but two days - I went to the Greyhound exactly at six o'clock; it is about one mile and a quarter from our house; he was not there - I went again a little after seven o'clock, and found him there - I opened the door of the room where he was sitting, and beckoned to him to come out - I waited outside about three quarters of an hour; he then came to me, and asked if I would come in - I said No, and he asked if I wanted to go home - I said Yes, as soon as I could: he said he was not going yet; he went in again - I staid at the door; he came out again in about five minutes, and brought me 5s. - I asked if that was all he had got, as I had had but 3s. 6d. the week before; he said it was - I went to a shop, and got some things which I wanted, then went back to the room, and waited till he was ready, and about three minutes after ten o'clock he got up to go away - after he came out I asked him again if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060027"/>had no more money for me; he said No, he had but 1 1/2d. - I said I thought he was very much to blame for spending his money at a public-house, when he knew it was wanted at home; he abused me, and said he had no more for me, and after that he gave me 1s.; we were going through Enfield town at that time; he kept abusing me along the town, and after we came to Mr. Fox's, the corn-chandlers, he gave me another 1s. - I went into the corn-chandler's, bought a quartern loaf, and a peck of coals - I gave him the coals to carry home; he had a round basket, with a handle across it, and his hoe through the handle; it was empty; we went on; he rested just before he came to the fields, and wanted me to go over the fields - I said I should not go that way; there is a path across the fields, up a bye-lane - I refused to go that way, and went along the highway; he stopped against the lane leading to the fields; he followed me along the road, about twenty yards behind me; he overtook me directly afterwards, and when we had got about one mile along the road, he kept calling me very abusive names - I said very little to him - I made him very few answers - I was afraid of him, for he swore at me a great deal - I did not use any threats to him; he was not drunk; he had one pot of beer; he did not appear drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to know what he was about? A. Yes; he had been in the public-house, from six till ten o'clock - I was outside - I do not know how long he had been drinking; he was saying, at the Greyhound, that he would go and see a young man, called Jockey James, who was in Chelmsford gaol, and while he was swearing at me on the road, he said, he should soon be where Jockey James was - I did not know James - I only knew there was such a person; after saying that, he abused me again, and said, when he got me home, he would kick me out of doors like a dog - I told him it was at his peril to do that, for there was nothing there belonging to him, and if he did not like me, to leave me, for he had used me ill ever since he had married me; he kept calling me every thing that was bad, and just as we got over the bridge, at Forty-hill, I said, "You good for nothing fellow, you ought to be ashamed to call me such names;" he stopped, and set down the bag of coals off one shoulder, and the basket off the other; I thought he was going to rest, as he had done before, but he drew the hoe deliberately from the handle of the basket, and knocked me down on the bridge; he hit me with the hoe - I do not know whether it was with the back or front of it, but it was with the iron part; he hit me on the head with it; it knocked me down, and took away my senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cut your head, or make any wound? A. He cut my head - I had a bonnet on, not the one I have now; he did not say anything - I do not know how long I remained insensible - I am not sensible of his giving me any other blow; when I came a little to myself, I did not know what was the matter with me - I could not believe he had done such a thing - I felt something very warm falling down my face, and thought it was perspiration, but when I came to myself, and found it was blood, I screamed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he? A. I do not know - I did not see him - I screamed very violently - I could not speak, but could scream - I heard somebody calling out of a window, but could not answer for some time; my husband then came to the left side of me, as I laid on the ground; he was knocking me with his knee on my arm, and told me to hold my noise - I still screamed, and when I came a little to myself, I pushed him away, and told him to go away, for he should never come near me any more - after that, a woman came to me, with a light, she never spoke, but turned back again when she saw me - I got up, and the person called to me out of window, to know who I was, I answered I was Joseph Scott's daughter; the woman with the light came back, with a man, and they led me home, and when the woman got opposite her house, she went in for a stick, which she walked with; my husband came running up the road, saying, "If any man has a mind to take me, let him take me - I know what I have done" - I do not know what became of him afterwards; he did not go home with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he struck you, you say he took the hoe deliberately out of the basket - did he say any thing before the blow was given? A. No; I had two wounds on my head, in different parts; I should think they had been inflicted by different blows.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he abused you all the way - did he threaten to do you any bodily harm? A. No, except that he said he would kick me out of doors; he kept swearing at me, and calling me abusive names; I have been under the surgeon's hands ever since.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the Post-office, at Forty-hill, Enfield; my house is within a very few yards of the bridge. On the 10th of November I went to bed about ten o'clock, or a few minutes after; I was in a very sound sleep, and was disturbed by very severe shrieks, which alarmed my wife first; she got up and that awoke me; I opened my window, which looks directly down to the river - I heard very severe shrieks - I called out, "In the name of God, what is the matter - is there murder going to be committed?" I repeated the question seven or eight times, but nobody replied - the shrieks continued, but I got no reply; I heard a man's voice say, "Don't make such a noise - don't make such a noise:" I then heard a female voice say, "I don't know where I am - I don't know where I am: I wish my mother was here;" and I heard her say,"You have been a cruel husband to me, you have cut me down with the hoe; I am all in a gore of blood, and you have nearly murdered me;" the voice then was quite different to what it is naturally - I could not tell whose voice it was; at that moment I saw a woman come along with a lantern; I begged her to go to the bridge, and see what was the matter; she went to the prosecutrix, and exclaimed,"Oh, my God! I never saw such a sight in my life;" I was without my clothes, and did not go myself.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Astbury, a surgeon, at Enfield. On the night in question, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, I was fetched to the prosecutrix, at Scott's house; I found an incised wound, three inches in length, on the top of the scull - it was cut to the bone, but had not fractured the bone; there was also a wound about two inches from that - it appeared to have been done by the same instrument, but with a lesser degree of force, and not at the same time; it was an incised wound, but not quite so deep; there was very little difference; there was a bruise on the forehead, which I suppose the stick of the hoe had done.</p>
               <p>Q. If the bone had been fractured by the first wound, might it have been attended with more dangerous consequences? A. Not more dangerous than showing the degree of force of the blow; the same members go inside - it was certainly done with an instrument that would effect a cut; it is a contused incised wound, not done with an instrument usually used to cut, but which would cut if force was applied; there was an artery divided, which had bled freely previous to my seeing it; in my judgment, the two wounds were produced by two different blows, and not by the same force; I attended her above a fortnight - I bled her twice, and kept down the inflammation; she is quite well now; if she had not been bled, there would have been an affection of the brain probably.</p>
               <p>Q. In what time does that affection of the brain take place? A. A month probably, but we have kept her low, and attend to her now; in my judgment the wounds might have been inflicted by this hoe. (looking at it) I have not seen it before this morning - I do not know where it came from.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. - It now becomes my painful task to offer some defence to the serious charge alledged against me - I trust, that when you have seriously considered of my unfortunate situation, that under all the circumstances attending it, I shall be entitled to your pity, rather than rebuke. I kept company with my present wife about three years, and she went to another part of the country for two years; during her absence from keeping my company, she got acquainted with some strange man, who got a child by her, and afterwards left her. After our marriage, which took place about two months past, since which, I was respectably informed, that during my absence in my work, she would encourage strange men, and on the Saturday evening, when this unfortunate transaction took place, we were drinking together at a public-house, by appointment, at the Greyhound, Enfield Town. I gave my wife 8s. and kept the residue of my wages, to pay her mother what I owed her; my wife began abusing me, and both of us being rather intoxicated, a quarrel ensued about the young man by whom she had the child, by which means the blow was given at the moment, for which I solemnly assure you, gentlemen, I am very sorry, and have written to my wife to that effect, and to her father and mother, hoping their forgiveness, and promising that I never will molest her again, and that my wife can live with the man if she pleases, without any fear from me. Gentlemen, this is a brief statement of facts, and the truth of my unfortunate and very distressing case. I therefore most humbly beg leave to throw myself on the mercy of this most Honorable Court, and fervently hope that it will be extended to me, and restore me to liberty.</p>

I saw her on the 5th, standing before my own door; she was missing early on the morning of the 6th. I took considerable trouble to find her, but without success. I came to town afterwards, in consequence of a letter, and saw the prisoner Johnson. I saw Chapman at the Police-office, on the 10th of November. I think I have seen him before, but cannot swear to him. I have seen Johnson several times at Marshfield, but always knew him by the name of Carter.</p>

            . On the 5th of October I put Mr. Jones's mare Poppet into the field - I fastened the gate of the field. Jones is a publican and a farmer also. I know Johnson, and saw him that night in Mr. Jones's tap-room - he was having a pot of beer, and had the newspaper - he had a white smock-frock on, grey-stockings, and low tied shoes. I knew him long before - he went by the name of William Carter down there. I came to town afterwards, and saw the mare - it was the same.</p>

            . I am a carrier from Marshfield, and know Johnson - I saw him on the 5th of October, sitting at the King's Arms public-house, which is kept by Jones - he had then got on a smock-frock, grey stockings, and low shoes - that might be between four and five o'clock in the afternoon - I saw him again up in the street, between ten and eleven that night: he then had boots and spurs on, and a light coloured top coat - the front of the coat appeared pushed out on one side, and was buttoned up. I said, "Good night, Carter," and he said,"Good night, Bond." I cannot be mistaken in him, for I have known him for years; I watched him a good way down the lane which leads to Jones' field, where the mare Poppet is kept. I have seen the other prisoner before, but did not see him in Marshfield that day - his name is Thomas Derrick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long before you saw Johnson at the King's Arms had you seen Chapman? A. I might not have seen him for six months, not to notice him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON. Q. What day was it you saw me? A. On the 5th - you were at the King's Arms, and opposite Mrs. Martin's - it was not dark; the moon was full that night.</p>

            , and the same features - I never saw him before that I know of: I met him in the street, and had an opportunity of observing him - I think he had a blue coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the man at the bar is the man? A. He is the same features, and he is the man - I saw him first about the middle of the day, and I saw him again sitting on a wicket-gate, which goes into one of Jones' fields, about a quarter-past three o'clock. I saw Derrick at the office in town afterwards, and had not the least doubt of his being the man I saw on the gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why then do you say it was a man about the same height and features? A. He is the man; I thought I was going to be asked the description of him- he had a black hat on; I know he had a coat, but will not swear what colour it was. I saw him first about the middle of the day; I do not think I ever saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Chapman shown to you at the office, and you asked "Is not this the man?" A. Yes - I said it was. I have not a doubt of him; I saw him coming twenty yards off, and he passed within a yard of me. I saw him on the gate for five minutes - he got off the gate, and got on again; I went down a field, and when I got to the bottom of it he was still there. I knew Johnson before - I do not know that I saw him that day: I heard they were both taken for this offence. I do not recollect that Derrick was pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. We understood you to say he was pointed out, and you were asked if he was not the man? A. I do not recollect it - I do not know that any one pointed him out; I knew him directly I went in, and said, "This is the man;" I had not the least doubt of him - I really do believe he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you are not quite confident? A. I mean to say that is the man.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was not Chapman brought into the yard and pointed out to you, as the man who was apprehended with Johnson? A. Nothing was said to me, to the best of my knowledge; I knew him as soon as I saw him.</p>

            . I am a coppersmith, and am owner of some stables in Bath-street, St. Luke's. On the 8th of October, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came in company together to my stables - they had each a mare, and wished to leave them there for the night, which they did; they told me to feed the mares- they each unsaddled one; Johnson principally gave the directions - they were both present. I locked the stable door, and asked if I should feed them in the morning - Johnson said No, they would come in time to see them fed, which they did, and stood talking for a little while; Johnson examined the shoes, and asked who was my farrier; I named Blake, and the mares were sent there by Johnson's direction; they went away, and about seven o'clock in the evening they both came again; one of the mares was still at the farrier's - I sent my son for it, telling him to bring a bill; he brought it, and gave Johnson a bill of 8s. - he gave him a sovereign; my son paid the bill, and returned him the change: the mares were fetched from my stable on Thursday, the 11th; Brown, the officer, brought Chapman to the stable that evening, and asked him, in my presence, if the mares belonged to him - he said they did not, they belonged to the other man; Chapman was left there, in Armstrong's custody, and Brown returned in five minutes with Johnson in custody, and asked him if those were his horses or mares - he said No, he had never seen them before; Chapman was present.</p>
               <p>Q. The principal, if not all the conversat on which passed with you was with Johnson? A. Yes; I do not know that I exchanged two words with Chapman; I had let part of a stable in the same yard to William Hallam - these mares were in my part of the stable.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 11th of October I went to the stable in Bath-street, and left Armstrong in possession of the two mares - I then went to No. 5, Coleman-street, Bunhill-row, St. Luke's, and apprehended Chapman in the top room of the house - that is Johnson's room; I took him to the stable in Bath-street, left him in Armstrong's custody, and as I returned to No. 5 again I met Johnson, within two doors of the house - I took him also to the stables. - The mares have been in our possession ever since. Armstrong asked them both who the mares belonged to - they were both handcuffed together, and both denied all knowledge whatever of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners, in your presence, afterwards say any thing about these mares? A. Yes, about a fortnight afterwards; they were brought before the Magistrate, but no examination was taken - they were merely brought to the bar, and sent back for re-examination; Chapman then said that the black mare, which he had rode to Wilkins' stable, was his own - that he had bought it, and paid for it; nobody had claimed the mares at that time: he said he had bought her of a man, whom he did not name, but I think he did name a place, which I do not recollect. The prosecutor afterwards claimed that mare; it was one of them which I had brought from the stable in Bath-street; it has not been out of our custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at the stable with Wilkins when you had Chapman in hold? A. Yes - I have heard Wilkins examined, and heard him state that Chapman said the horse was Johnson's - he did not say so to me; he might think I was there - I never heard it said. Wilkins was there when I brought Johnson in. Both of them, when I asked, said, "No, we know nothing about them."</p>
               <p>Q. Has any reward been offered? A. No; I had seen no bills about them, and I do not know of any reward - I have not been promised any reward if they are convicted; I expect to be paid for my trouble, either by the prosecutor or the Court. I asked Jones, when he first came to town, if there was a reward, and it may have been talked of since - I do not know what reward there is; I have talked to him about being paid for the food of the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not talked to him twenty times about the reward? A. No, nor ten times; I think about 5l. has been named, and I have had the horses to keep all this while.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on your oath, was not your share of the reward to be 5l.? A. No, I cannot tell what it would be till I come to share it among those who have had the trouble - I do not expect more than 5l. from Jones.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who has kept the mares all this time? A. They have been at a livery-stable - I expect I am responsible for their keep. It will make no difference to me whether the prisoners are convicted or not.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do not you know the stable-keeper has been paid? A. I am sure he is not, for the bill will not be given in till after the trial - I expect it to be sent to me - one has been sent some time ago, expecting the horses would be sent home before the trial.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 11th of October I was at Wilkins' stables, and saw both the mares; Brown gave Chapman into my custody, and brought in Johnson: I handcuffed them together. I pointed out the two mares to both of them, and asked them how they came in possesion of those mares; I am sure I asked them both that question - they both denied ever seeing them before: they gave their names as Chapman and Johnson; I searched Johnson, and found on him a small farries's bill, which I put into my pocket, in going to the office, and have lost it. About a fortnight afterwards I was present at the office when they were brought up to be remanded, and told they were committed for another day; there was no examination whatever at that time, as we had not found an owner; no deposition was taken, nor any body sworn - no threat or promise was held out to them; Johnson said he bought his mare of a man at Portsdown fair - Chapman said he bought his of a man, but he did not know his name; those were the two mares of which they had previously denied all knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was this conversation? A. At the bar, before the Magistrate; the depositions had been taken at a former examination - they were not questioned at all: they came up boldly, and asked for their own property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, having said a fortnight before that they knew nothing about the mares, they came forward voluntarily, and said where they got them from? A. They did - nobody had claimed them then.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the prisoners know that? A. That I cannot tell, but nobody had appeared against them- they were present at all the examinations, and when the depositions were written down.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you looked at these boots? A. Not particularly - I believe they belonged to Johnson, for he claimed them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to THOMAS WILKINS. Q. Did you take sufficient notice of the mares as to know on which each of the prisoners rode? A. Yes; Jones claimed the one which Chapman rode.</p>

            . I am married - my husband has left me - I live in Broadwall, Blackfriars - the prisoner Chapman came to sleep at my house on Tuesday evening, the 2d<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060031"/>of October - I did not know him before that - he slept at my house every night till the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing which enables you to recollect the time from the 2d of October till the Sunday? A. Yes; I had a letter from my friends, concerning my husband - I do not know what the prisoner's occupation was - he never went out till after breakfast - he sometimes breakfasted at ten o'clock; sometimes at eight or nine - he slept at my house every night till the Sunday - ten o'clock at night is the latest hour he ever came home.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where do you now live? A. Down at what's-the-name of the place? Blackfriars, 19, Bear-lane - I have lived there three weeks, with one Mrs. Hunt - I have a room there - the prisoner was the only lodger that I had on the 2d of October - my husband had left me, and I thought I must get a bit of bread somehow - I have since sold my things - my husband has left me five months today - the prisoner is the first lodger I had - he came and asked if he could sleep there - I said he could - I made no inquiry about him - I have a child about four years old - the prisoner went by the name of Thomas Chapman.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear you were to be examined here to-day? A. I heard nothing of it till Thursday, when a person came and told me he was in prison, that was his father - I had never seen him before; I went to Mr. Isaacs', the lawyer, and told him what my evidence was - I remember the 2d of October by the letter I received - there was nobody in the house but myself and child; the prisoner had what victuals he wanted - he cooked it himself - he sometimes came home to dinner, and sometimes did not - not a soul called on him while he lodged with me; when he left me he said he was going to Weyhill fair; he came back again, and slept at my house on the 10th of October; I am sure it was the 10th; it was Wednesday night; he paid for his lodgings, and left; I did not ask where he was going, nor did he tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask him before where he was going? A. I made it my business, as he was in the way of travelling, if he should see my husband to ask him to be so good as to come home - I do not know what part of the country my husband is in.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he to know your husband? A. I do not know - he might have seen him before perhaps - I do not know whether he knew him - I said if he should happen to hear his name.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you quite sure he slept at your house on the 10th of October? A. I am.</p>

            . I live at Bristol. I know Chapman - I came to town on Monday, the 1st of October, under the idea of obtaining a situation - I was in Smithfield-market on Friday, the 5th, and saw Chapman at Harry Harmer's, the Plough public-house, Windmill-court - I have known him for the last four or five years; he asked me to drink, and we went to Harmer's together, and drank.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who gave you the drink? A. The girl brought the porter into the room - there were several persons in the room - I have known Chapman under the denomination of a horse-dealer - he kept his cattle at his father's at Bedminster, near Bristol - I cannot say where he lived in town - I did not ask what brought him there; his name is Derrick - I never knew him by the name of Chapman at Bristol - I never heard him called Chapman, to the best of my recollection - I have known him for the last four or five years, seeing him about, and have drank with him - I am not sure whether I told him what I came about - I asked him how he got on - he said pretty fair - I said you look the same as usual, and that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you had come to get a situation? A. I signified such to him - I had been at Marshfield - it is about eleven miles from Bristol - Bedminster is about one mile from Bristol - I am an accountant and collector of debts - I did not get a situation in town - I left, and came up again - the prisoner's father brought me from Bristol, to this trial - I was in London a week - I did not appoint to meet the prisoner again, and did not see him, except that day, Friday, the 5th - I have not seen him since - it was about two o'clock when I met him.</p>
               <p>JOHN BISHOP. I am a carrier - I have a horse and cart, and live in Pitfield-street, Hoxton - I know Chapman - I saw him on the 5th of October, at Mr. Harmer's, the Plough, at Smithfield, about three o'clock in the afternoon - he came with me to Smithfield, to buy a horse for me - we bought one of a person named Kimpton, of Highgate, for 4l. 10s. - the prisoner went to look out a good one for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is Kimpton? A. A horse-dealer - he gave his address at Highgate - the prisoner asked the price of it, and spoke to him about it a good deal - I suppose we were half an hour making the bargain - we had something to drink at Harmer's - nobody but the prisoner was in my company, nor was anybody in his company that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the last witness there? A. I did not see him - he might be about; the place was very much crowded; he might speak to him; he was not drinking with him while I was there - I went in about three o'clock- I had met the prisoner in Smithfield about half-past two o'clock, and remained with him till we went to Harmer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a carman? A. Yes; I move any goods - it does not make any odds to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had the misfortune to fall into trouble? A. Yes; I do not think I am obliged to say what.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not asked whether you were guilty or not, but what were you accused of? A. I do not think it is my place to say - I do not wish to tell; I was taken up twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell what you were taken up the second time for? A. I do not wish to resolve that question - it was sometime ago; it is about two months.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you certain that on the 5th of October, at half-past two o'clock, you met him in Smithfield? A. Yes; I cannot tell who he might have met before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to Harmer's with him? A. Yes, but I left the house first.</p>

            . I am the wife of John Peter Latzou; he is a Swede - I am an English woman; we arrived in town on the 11th of October, from the Brazils, and went to lodge at the prisoner's house, <placeName id="t18271206-40-crimeloc197">No. 36, Edmond's-place, Aldersgate-street</placeName>

On the 13th of October, in consequence of something that took place between my husband and myself, the prisoner came into the room; this property at that time was all spread on the table; the trunks were then all in the front-room; in consequence of what happened that day, I moved the small trunk, containing the property, under the pillow that night; it was locked, but the key was tied to the handle - I continued in the lodgings till the 20th of October - I kept the box under the pillow day and night, till then; we left in consequence of a disturbance with the prisoner - I made the bed myself, and saw the box safe every morning - I saw it under the pillow about half-past seven o'clock on the 20th, when I got up - I and my husband quitted the lodgings about ten minutes before eight o'clock; we took away every thing, except the small trunk, which I forgot, as the prisoner was quarrelling with me; we moved to No. 5, Princes-street, Ratcliff-highway, and ten minutes after I got there, I opened one of the large boxes, and seeing the vacancy in it, I recollected I had not taken the trunk from under the pillow - I returned directly, the prisoner opened the door to me - I said, "Mrs. Cornell, will you give me leave to go up stairs, for I have left my small box here, with all my property?" I got back there within three quarters of an hour, or an hour; she said, "Oh, Ma'am, walk up stairs, there has no one been up, only myself;" she went up with me - I took the pillow off, and saw the vacancy where the box had been, but the box was not there - I said, "Oh, Ma'am, I left my box here, will you please to give me my box again?" she said no one had been up stairs but herself, not even the woman, whom she had sent for to clean the carpet, had been there; but I was a silly woman, and ought to have taken better care of my property; and if it had been her's, she would have taken better care of it - I said, "Be so kind as to give me my property back, for it is all I have;" she said, "Go along, go along - you ought to have taken better care of it" - I went down, and said, "If you don't give it me by good means, I will make you give it me" - I went back, told my husband, and went with him to the Mansion-house; two officers went to search the house, but they went without a warrant; they did search, but found nothing - I went back with my husband to my new lodgings, and there saw the witness Anderson.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the prisoner's, with the officers, in what state was the bed? A. All tossed over - I had taken off the top-sheet myself, to show her what kind of sheet she had put on, but I had not touched the lower sheet; but on my return, the lower sheet and the pillow were tossed about - I asked Anderson to go to Mrs. Cornell to get my property: he went, but did not succeed - I had the prisoner apprehended that day week - Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060033"/>Satchell, a witness, was apprehended with her - I gave this account to the Magistrate - I have not recovered any of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you employ any body to assist in taking away your trunks? A. Yes, the carmen; they are not here; they went straight to my lodgings - I had brought the bed from the Brazils; I did not sleep on it at the prisoner's room: we slept on her bed; my husband and I went to Princes-street together - I did not tell him when I first missed it, as I thought I could get it back without his knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he thought he could get it without your's? A. No, if he had it, I had it - I have been at the Brazils ever since I was a child - I have had two husbands - I have been married a year to the last; my first husband dealt in all the produce of the country - I was a widow eleven months; my second husband came to the Brazils to seek an uncle, and he was engaged as a performer at the Imperial Theatre, and not liking the country, he asked for a licence to travel; he was not a conjuror.</p>
               <p>Q. When you have been at words with him, have you not told him he was nothing but a conjuror? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were quarrelling on the 13th, and this property was on the table, was not the dispute that he wanted to have part of the property, and you said "No, it is all mine, you are nothing but a conjuror, and have no right to it? A. No - he wanted three or four hundred dollars to change. I said "Don't change above one hundred," as I expected a great loss from them. I had one in my hand - he squeezed my hand to get it out - I screamed, which brought the prisoner into the room. Mr. and Mrs. Satchell also saw it. I afterwards showed her my jewels; my husband had not a pair of tongs in his hand when he squeezed my hand - he never struck me in his life - he is not able to do that; we had then slept there two nights. Whenever I went out I shut the door, and took the key with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner, or her husband, want you to pay for two weeks lodging, and you wanted to pay for but one? A. She said I had been there nine days, and should pay for two weeks. I said I did not know the rule of the country, and did not like to pay her 16s. for one night; two or three dozen spots of wax had fallen on her carpet, and gave her 2s. to pay a woman to scower it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not an officer called in? A. Yes - Harrison the officer came in, about a quarter of an hour before we left.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray was part of the quarrel with your husband, that he could have no part of the property, as he had another wife? A. The quarrel has nothing to do with the robbery. I never heard that he had another wife, and never said so. I had first seen Anderson two or three days after I was in my new lodgings. I did not employ him as a friend, but as a steady man, who would speak to her, and perhaps get my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go to a Police-office? A. Because I was a stranger, and did not know much about this country. I could not speak English very well, but being an English woman I have got the language back again since; Anderson speaks English.</p>
               <p>Q. You could talk to him? A. Very little - it was through my landlady, who speaks Portuguese - her name is Lloyd - she interpreted. I went before the Lord Mayor the day I was robbed - I spoke very bad English to him - I understood him, and could speak a few words. Two officers went to search the house. I went before the Lord Mayor again on the 20th - I did not speak then. I went to Guildhall on the 27th, I believe, to swear my deposition. Mrs. Satchell and her husband lodged in the prisoner's house - I never charged her with the robbery - she was brought up about it.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. How she was brought before the Magistrate' you do not know? A. No - I received a communication from Anderson on Monday, the 22d - in consequence of that, Satchell was arrested. I do not know whether there were any other lodgers. I only saw the prisoner's husband one night, that was on the 13th.</p>
               <p>JOHN PETER LATZOU. I am a Swede. I was at the Brazils about two years and a half, and married my wife there about ten months ago; we arrived in London on the 11th of October, and took lodgings in Edmond's-place; I took four large trunks, a bed, and a basket with me; in one of the large trunks was a little box, with money and my wife's jewels. The prisoner was landlady of the house. On the 13th I had a quarrel with my wife - the money and jewels were then on the table; the prisoner came into the room, then Mr. Satchell, and then Mrs. Satchell; they stood by the table - I counted the money to my wife; Mrs. Cornell took my wife's bracelets off the mantel-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, in consequence of what you saw her do with the bracelets, did you suffer the small box to continue in the large one? A. No - after she left the room we placed it under the pillow; Satchell and his wife were also gone when we placed it there; we remained there nine days, and then moved to Princes-street, taking the four large trunks, the basket and bed: when we got there, on my wife going to the trunk, she came and told me, "Oh, my G-d! - we have lost all the money we have!" I have seen none of it since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you were in full dress when you and your wife had the quarrel, on the 13th, or had you any clothes on at all? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not your coat and waistcoat off when Mr. and Mrs. Satchell came up? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not your shirt off? A. I had my clean shirt in my hand; I do not recollect whether I had the tongs in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not beating your wife with the tongs? A. I do not understand English.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you struck your wife with the tongs? A. No, I did not touch her with them; she called out Hoy! she did not call Murder! I swear that. I was not standing over her with the tongs in my hand; I have been engaged in the Paris Theatre, and at the Imperial Theatre, as a mechanic, trying experiments with instruments; I am not a simple performer, and do not use cards and dice - I do not show for the public. I know something to make pleasure in families; I have played at cards with a few friends.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were quarrelling, did not your wife say you were a poor conjuror, and had no property when she married you? A. I do not remember it - I did not hear it; I do not know that she said I had a wife before at the Brazils; I do not understand it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she accuse you of having left a wife behind you at the Brazils? A. No - I swear that. No officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060034"/>was called in at that quarrel - that I swear; no officer was called in on the 13th; I did not see Harrison that day - he came into the house on the 20th, the day we left the lodgings - that was by my desire; I had no quarrel with my wife that day; we left the house about a quarter of an hour after he came: I do not know who called the officer in. I went out to fetch two carmen to take my property off, and when I came back Harrison was there - I did not call him in, nor did my wife, to my knowledge. I swear I did not hear Harrison tell the prisoner the sooner she got rid of us the better.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not send Anderson to Mrs. Cornell, to say you and your wife were sorry for the way you had behaved to her? A. No; I sent him to tell her to give the property back - I said nothing about bad conduct.</p>
               <p>MRS. LATZOU re-examined. I sent Anderson to the prisoner, to tell her to be so kind as to give my property back, as I had lost all, and, being in a strange country, I had nothing to exist on; I did not send any apology for misconduct.</p>

            . I am an American, and by trade a bar-pilot, belonging to New Orleans, and lodge at No. 5, Princes-street - I lodge there still; I was cast away, and brought to this country by the brig Havannah, and am now under the Consul's hands. I first saw Mr. and Mrs. Latzou when they came to lodge at No. 5, Princes-street; I saw them the first day they came; I had some conversation with them on Monday, the 22d of October, and went, by their direction, to No. 36, Edmond's-place, Aldersgate-street. I saw the prisoner now at the bar - I took more particular notice of her, as I was sent on a message to her- I asked her if a Mrs. Coleman lived there; she said perhaps she was the person I was looking for, and requested to know my business; I said I was sent with a message from Mr. and Mrs. Latzou; she said, "Oh, I know your business - walk in," and observed that her name was not Coleman, but Cornell; I saw several persons there, apparently females - I did not take particular notice of any, except a young lady, whom I saw up stairs in the second floor, with the prisoner - her name is Satchell: the prisoner desired me to follow her up stairs, and showed me a large room, containing a round table, and a small bed-room, stating they were the rooms which Mr. and Mrs. Latzou had occupied.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her what you came for? A. I said I was sent on a message from them; she did not wait to hear the message, but asked me up stairs (after running up), and desired me to search - I said I was not sent for that purpose, but only to know from her if she had found a small box belonging to Mr. and Mrs. Latzou, and whether she would return it or not - I was then standing in the large room, but very near the door of the smaller room; Mrs. Cornell was backwards and forwards; and a little time after, as I stood in the large room, I heard a conversation take place between her and another woman - (as it was a female voice) I could distinguish very well that the prisoner was one of the persons talking; I could not see the other person's face, but it was a woman, by her dress and voice; although they were speaking in a low voice, I heard very plainly every word that passed: they were in the small room; the door was open: I heard the other woman say to the prisoner, "It will be better for you to return the box, for I see plainly it will cause a great deal of trouble, and disgrace upon your family and house." I heard Mrs. Cornell reply, "Oh, it is now gone too far - it cannot be brought back," she then turned her head, and looked over her shoulder at me, as I stood very close, in fact, nearly in the door of the small room, looking at her and the other woman; she then caught the woman by her arm, and said, "But stop a little;" she then came out into the large room, and inquired if I had any former acquaintance with Mr. and Mrs. Latzou; I said I never had seen them till they came to the house where I lodged, but I understood, from their conversation and appearance that they were foreigners, and I did not think it was their intention to remain long in London, or in the country - she then went back into the small room, and in a short time returned with a small net purse in her right hand, laying it on the table - it appeared to contain small gold coins, as if it was sovereigns - she said, "My good man, I will give you fifty sovereigns if you will go and say to Mrs. Latzou that no discovery can be made, nor any evidence produced concerning their property, and persuade them to leave the country, and say no more about it" - I observed to the prisoner now at the bar, that I was a stranger in this country, and was afraid of being led into any trouble or difficulty - she assured me if I would follow her directions, she would stand between me and any trouble or difficulty, observing, that I was a poor man, and fifty sovereigns would be of great service to me - I then said, I was willing to do any thing for her that laid in my power, as a servant, but that I understood from the conversation I had heard between my landlady and Mrs. Latzou, that she was an English woman, born in London, and had an uncle and some very respectable friends or relations in this City - she then desired me to go quickly, and bring the address of this uncle, for she wished to know who and what he was, and she would pay me well for my trouble - I then went home - Mr. and Mrs. Latzou were not there, I inquired of the landlady who their relations were; I brought the direction to Mrs. Cornell's house, and delivered it to her - she received me very kindly - gave me a chair to sit down, &amp;c. and asked me to have any thing to drink - she gave me some drink in the small room below stairs, where I saw the same young lady, sitting at tea, whom I had seen up stairs with the prisoner in the morning, accompanied by a young gentleman - after taking the refreshment, I left the house, Mrs. Cornell having first invited me to stay all night, saying, I could have a bed or any thing else - I said, being under the protection of the Consul, I could not be out at night - this conversation was in the passage; after bidding good evening she came out with me into the court, and gave me a nudge, as if she wished to say something to me in private - I followed her round to the corner of Aldersgate-street; she put two half-crowns into my hand, desiring me not to let any person whatever know what had passed between me and her - neither did she wish any person to know what money she had given me, saying, her husband was a very desperate man, and she did not wish him to know any thing of the circumstance; but for me to go home, and take particular notice what Mr. and Mrs. Latzou were talking about, to find out how they intended to proceed, and return next morning and let her know, that she might know what to do, and I should be well rewarded for my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060035"/>trouble; I went home, and made every circumstance known, showing the money I had received to the lodgers and to the two injured foreigners; I went next morning and saw the prisoner; she said she could not speak to me then, there were so many sharks about her house she could not go out without being watched - I might go and come again another time, and she should be very glad to see me; I left her house, and did not return till I went with the officer from Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. That was the same day, was it not? A. No; I cannot say how long afterwards, I did not make a memorandum of the day; it might have been two or three days after; I never saw the prisoner before I was sent to her; I did not see any body in the room, except Mrs. Satchell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Satchell the woman she was talking to in the inner room? A. I did not see the face of the woman, but there were but two women in either room at the time the conversation took place.</p>
               <p>Q. She retired to the room to have private conversation with the woman? A. Yes, more to her misfortune; they both spoke loud, for I believe the prisoner is a little deaf; the door was open; she seemed to see me very sharp, and much astonished at finding me there; I did tell her I had come to make an apology for Mrs. Latzou for their behaviour; they did not send me to say so, but I recollect saying it in the course of conversation; I said so before I went up stairs; I do not believe any person saw the purse put down besides myself, for nobody else was in the room; it was in the large room; I suppose she offered me the fifty sovereigns because I had heard the conversation, for she seemed much astonished to find me so near; one room opens into the other.</p>
               <p>Q. She talked loud enough for you to hear, and then offered you fifty sovereigns? A. It seemed so; the fact was she wished to bribe me not to say any thing, after finding I had heard the conversation; I refused fifty sovereigns, and took 5s.; I was well aware if I took the fifty sovereigns she would have made an instrument of me; I am under the American Consul's care; under his hands, the gentlemen in his office know me by sight; I do not suppose they know my general character; I never attempted to defraud them; I know Mr. Le Suth; I do not know Mr. Hughes by name; Mr. Lloyd is the landlord of the house where I live; he boards all the men, and clothes them.</p>

            . I lodge at No. 6, John-street, Mileend-road. On the 13th of October I lodged in the prisoner's house, and had been there about three months; I remember Latzou and his wife coming to lodge there; I heard a quarrel the day they went away, and after they were gone I went up into their front room with Mrs. Cornell; I attempted to go into the inner room, but Mrs. Cornell shut the door in my face; this was between a quarter and half an hour after they had left; when she shut the door, she said I had better not go in there, for the place stunk; I mentioned this to my wife, and went out in about twenty minutes; Mrs. Cornell had gone out twice previous to that, and I met her in Newgate-street; she appeared very much flurried, and wished me to call at the Swan Inn, Holborn bridge, to tell her husband she wanted him; she had asked me if I was going by there; I called and left the message.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go up into their room on the 13th, when there was a quarrel? A. Yes - Mrs. Latzou was crying out apparently in pain, and wanting assistance. I went up and burst the door open being the only male in the house. I thought it right to go up - the door was not locked; as I entered, the prosecutor was standing with his back to me - he had neither shirt, coat, nor waistcoat on. I saw nothing in his hands, but there was a great deal of confusion - he might have had something without my observing him; after seeing him in this state, my wife came up - he then retired to the inner room, and came out with a clean shirt on; his wife appeared in great distress - she said he was a conjuror, and had married her for her money - she said that to his face, before the quarrel was settled; she did not positively accuse him of being married, but she said she believed he had other wives, or something to that effect; she did not say that she knew it; she mentioned several times that he had been a conjuror - whether she meant that as a slight, I cannot tell. Mrs. Cornell was flurried, and there was such a disturbance that Harrison, the officer, was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. She said the room had a bad smell - was not part of her complaint, that they had left the room in filth and grease? A. Certainly it was - the grease was in the front room. I never heard any thing said about the back room; they had my wife taken up - she was discharged.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. When there was the quarrel on the 13th, did you see any property on the table? A. I did, a vast quantity that astonished me - dollars and doubloons; in fact a large round table was covered with them nearly. Mrs. Cornell came up after me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Harrison, the officer, sent for on the 13th, or on the day they left the lodgings? A. On the day they left, not on the 13th.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I was taken on this charge. I was present on the 13th, when the prosecutor and his wife quarrelled - I went up. I saw silver, gold, and trinkets of different sorts on the table. I was in the room with Mrs. Cornell on the 20th. and remember Anderson coming there. I saw Mrs. Cornell go out with him the second time he came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. She went out at the same time as him? A. Yes - she came back in about ten minutes, or not so much; it was the prosecutrix's screams that took me up on the 13th - we thought her husband would hurt her - she called Murder! I believe; I think the prosecutor had the tongs in his hand - they talked in their own language a good deal about their property and jewels. I heard her say he wanted to take away her property, and spend it in his own extravagancies; she told him she was not his only wife - that he wished to take all her money from her, and had brought her into a strange land for that purpose. I did not hear her say any thing about her having respectable friends, who would see her righted, or about an uncle in Winchester-street. On the day they left, the prisoner told them they had made the rooms very dirty, and dropped the tallow about the carpet; the woman said "If you say a word about paying for two weeks, when we have been here but nine days, we will stay two weeks, and spoil every piece of furniture;" this was said down stairs - the husband was not present; the prisoner was obliged to call Harrison in. I was present when they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060036"/>went away. I did not see the prosecutrix pull her bed clothes off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, some time after this an American coming? A. Yes - he said in the passage, that he had come to make an apology for their bad behaviour. I went up stairs at the same time as him and Mrs. Cornell. I was not in the room all the time he was there. I was in the bed-room with Mrs. Cornell - Anderson was in the bed-room also. I could see him there - there was no other woman in the bed-room. Mrs. Sparkes was sitting on the sofa. I was the person Anderson saw in the bed-room with Cornell - she did not address herself to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to her, "You had better give up the box, for it will bring you and your family into trouble?" A. I did not say any thing of the sort, nor did I hear any thing of the kind mentioned; the prisoner did not say"It is gone too far now, it cannot be brought back," nor any thing of the kind - she did not utter a single word tending to show she had any guilty knowledge of the box. I was taken up as accessory to the robbery afterwards, and was bailed. I heard Anderson examined before the Alderman, and said all he had said about me was false; also all that he had said of the prisoner, as far as I had any knowledge of it; he said I was the person with whom the conversation took place in the bed-room - not a word he has stated did take place.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When Anderson was there, did you hear your husband say any thing in the prisoner's presence about the box? A. I do not recollect hearing him say any thing; the prisoner is rather deaf, and more so sometimes that others. I was not in the room all the time Anderson was there; my husband came in and called me down - I left the prisoner in the room; she never spoke while I was there.</p>

            . I am acquainted with the prisoner, and was at her house on the 22d of October, when Anderson came; I went up stairs with Mrs. Cornell and him; nobody, to the best of my knowledge, except Mrs. Cornell and him went into the bed-room - I sat on the sofa, and did not see Mrs. Satchell go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, or hear any body else say, "You had better restore the property, or it will bring great disgrace on your house and yourself?" A. Never; nothing of the kind passed, nor was it said the thing had gone too far, and could not be recalled - I was in the large room with Mrs. Cornell and him all the time; no purse of gold was produced.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. You are positive no person went into the bed-room, but him and Mrs. Cornell? A. No - Mrs. Satchell stood against the bed-room door; the sofa is in the front room, close to the bed-room door - I could see into the bed-room as I sat there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If any body had said, "You had better return the box, or it will bring you into trouble or disgrace," must you have heard it? A. Even if the door had been shut, I could hear almost every word, but it was open - I swear no such conversation took place.</p>

            . On the day I quarrelled with my husband these bracelets were on the mantel-piece; the prisoner came up between two and three o'clock- I heard my husband say to her, "What have you in your hand?" she said, "What do you mean, I don't understand you?" he said, two or three times, "Give me my wife's bracelets, which you have in your hand;" she said,"What do you mean, what do you say?" and then doubled up a small carpet, shook it three or four times, and let the bracelets fall - I picked them up, and took them; she thought they were diamond bracelets - Mrs Satchell saw them in her hand.</p>

I was present, but did not see the bracelets taken - I saw them in the prisoner's hand; she would not own that she had them in her hand; but as she stooped to take up the rug, which had been folded up, I saw them in her hand; she took hold of the rug, and shook them out - I heard nothing said about her stealing them.</p>

I was in George-street - I now know that is the name of the street - I asked the prisoner and some others, who were standing together in George-street, the way to Mr. Boyle's, a publican, who I was going to, and who lived in the neighbourhood; on my asking the prisoner the way, he said, if I turned down there, pointing to a turning, that Boyle's was close by; I was going away, and directly I moved the prisoner laid hold of my bag; he took hold of it by the end - I had the string of it twisted round my wrist; he tried to take it from me, and I collared him with my left hand - I then received a blow from one of the men who was with him; I was knocked down with sticks; the other men had sticks, but the prisoner had no stick; I received a blow on the head from a stick, which knocked me down; I still kept the prisoner - I did not let him go - I kept hold of the bag also; we got up together - I still held him, and at last I could not hold him any longer; he took the bag away: I called Watch, and Stop thief! and followed him till he was caught, and never lost sight of him; I do not know what became of the bag - I do not know what he did with it; there were from twelve to twenty men; I suppose I received about one hundred blows altogether, and had my hat cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was a good deal of struggling with you and the prisoner, and at last they got the better of you? A. Yes. I never lost sight of him, and swear positively he is the man - here is my hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who has had the hat ever since? A. The officer - I gave it him two or three days afterwards, but I showed it the same night; the officer told me to take care of it - I was not drunk; I had been drinking certainly; I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge - I knew Boyle before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been to his house often before? A. No- about twice in my life; I will swear I have not been there more than three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not so drunk that you did not know the way? A. I did not know the neighbourhood - I might not go there above once in four years.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had one hundred blows - did you not have more? A. I might; I did not beat the prisoner - I was obliged to let him go; we caught him just by Boyle's, which is only round the corner, down the next street; I did not lose sight of him in turning the corner - I followed him, calling Stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but you were surrounded by twelve or twenty men? A. Yes, but they let me go directly he got away: I swear I never lost sight of him from the time I was knocked down till he was secured; I never lost sight of him from the time the bag was taken; I did not see what he did with the bag: I looked at him, and when I caught him he had not got it; I do not know what he did with it.</p>

            . I live at No. 68, New Compton-street, Soho, and am a journeyman bricklayer; I am always in employ - I work for Mr. Meux, the porter-brewer; I have been in his employ for six years, and am so now. I have seen the prisoner as I was going up and down the street, in my employ - I only know him by sight; I am not acquainted with him. I am allowed a pot of beer at the Two Brewers public-house, in George-street, every day; and on the 30th of November I saw the prosecutor, as I came out, on my way home, in Buckeridge-street - I first saw him at the bottom of Bainbridge-street; he appeared a little tipsy, from what he said to the beadle; I do not mean to say he was drunk; he went down towards Buckeridge-street, and I was going on my way home. I saw him stand in the middle of the street; he had a bag under his arm; I saw two or three young men by the gas-light, apparently about my own height, behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell how many young men were behind him? A. Two or three, according to what I could tell; I could not swear to their persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to tell whether the prisoner was one? A. Apparently not, by his height; the three men did not appear much taller than me; he is shorter than me.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to the prosecutor? A. I suppose, by his singing out Stop thief! he lost his bag; I saw nothing done to him, for I stood at the corner, but he cried Stop thief! and they all ran up the street, and there was a flustration - I stood there, and saw them run down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether the prisoner was one of the persons running? A. I would not wish to take a false oath; he was not one of the three young men that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was not one of those who were behind the prosecutor when he had the bag? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You swear distinctly to the prosecutor being there? A. Yes; I do not know his name; he was an entire stranger to me; I could not notice the three young men so as to swear to them; I had never seen them in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. There were only three congregated together? A. Two or three.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, when there was a cry of Stop thief! they all ran - did only the three men run? A. The street was all in confusion; I cannot tell who the others were: a great crowd joined in the run.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think there was a robbery committed? A. I was so struck I did not think of it. I go to have my pot of beer in George-street every night; I go this time of year a little after six o'clock. I never heard a cry of Stop thief! in George-street before; I was so struck I could not move - I do not know what a rescue is; I know nothing of their getting a man out of custody: I am not often in George-street in the day time. I have seen the prisoner when I came up and down the street, to our shed - I do not know how often I have seen him there, perhaps twice a day; I have frequently seen him in George-street: I neither saw nor heard the prosecutor ask the way to Boyle's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him ask any question? A. No; I saw him speaking to the street-keeper at the bottom of Bainbridge-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the three persons? A. This was in Buckeridge-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any persons running? A. When the prosecutor called Stop thief! people came out of their houses; I cannot tell who was running first: I will swear I did not see the prisoner in George-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have been there without your seeing him? A. If he had been there he must have been in some house or other, for I am sure, if he had been there I must have known him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw three people in the street, and people come out of their houses - must you not have seen all the persons in the street? A. Yes, two or three behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there were not twenty? A. I only saw three behind.</p>
               <p>Q. In George-street? A. In Buckeridge-street, where the cry of Stop thief! was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard where the robbery was? A. It was in Buckeridge-street where I saw the three young men behind him, and he sung out Stop thief! one end of it comes into George-street; I saw no more than three behind him.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear there was not a mob of ten or twenty persons? A. My Lord, I cannot say, but I saw two or three behind him; I only say, by the gas-light, there were only two or three behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear, that at the corner of George-street, or where the robbery was done, that the prisoner was not one of them? A. He was not one of the two or three behind him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060039"/>Q. Will you swear he was not there? A. I swear I did not see him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is not the Two Brewers Messrs. Meux's house? A. Yes, it is; I do not know that Mr. Meux knows me personally, but the firm do; I work in most of their houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you distinctly see the two or three persons who were about the prosecutor when he had his bag? A. I saw two or three behind him, but to swear who took it I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear the prisoner was, or was not, in George-street? A. I swear I did not see him.</p>

               <p>MR. A. PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARD GALLOWAY. I am the son of Mr. Alexander Galloway, and assist him in his business; the prisoner Davidson was employed by my father as a <rs id="t18271206-44-deflabel216" type="occupation">clerk</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t18271206-44-defend349 t18271206-44-deflabel217"/>; I have no share in the business - my father has no partner. On the 25th of October, Coleman was employed to fetch some iron from Crawshaw's yard, in Upper Thames-street, and bring it to our manufactory in West-street, Smithfield; in consequence of information, I went to Mr. Llewellyn's premises, the Waterloo Foundry, Cow-cross, near St. John's-street - I believe it is in the City: I saw some Langley-field pig-iron there - it is the same sort of iron as was to be brought from Crawshaw's; we had never sold any of it to Llewellyn, nor any kind of iron; he was not a customer of ours; in consequence of this, I had some conversation with Davidson; I did not hold out either threat or promise to him; I taxed him with having sold to Mr. Llewellyn two tons weight of this Langley-field pig-iron; he admitted it; he said he had sold it to Mr. Llewellyn, and it was in consequence of his being involved in difficult circumstances; that he had sold it for, I think, 6l. a ton - the market price was about 8l.; he said he had received 4l. from Llewellyn on account. Coleman's cart was employed all day, on the 25th of October, in bringing iron from Crawshaw's wharf; I gave him the order myself - it is necessary I should say, that when we have a lot of iron at a wharf, I merely order it to be fetched up till it is all removed; a two-horse cartload would be two tons. or two tons and a half; he had two horses that day; I know Davidson's hand-writing -(looking at a book) - this is his hand-writing; here is an entry of iron, on the 25th of October, from Crawshaw's - it is 19 tons, 7 cwt., 2 qrs., and 12 lbs. - that is the total quantity he has entered as brought on the 24th.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you conversed with Davidson, did you say, "Why, Sir, here is something awkward, and it will be better for you to tell the truth?" A. I do not recollect having said so; I think I can swear I did not; I certainly did not hold him out any inducement - it was quite unnecessary; I say I held him out no promise or threat whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say he was in a bad scrape, and had better tell the truth? A. I really do not think I said any thing af the sort; I will swear to neither one nor the other, but, to the best of my recollection, I did not say it would be better for him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you tell us all that passed between you? A. The moment the information was communicated to me, and I had made the necessary inquiries, the cart(which was then employed to bring iron from another wharf,) was entering the yard; I called Davidson into the counting-house; I desired him to bring his book, and show me how many loads of iron had been brought into the yard by Coleman that morning; he brought his book, and stated that only two had been brought in; I then asked him whether he meant the one in the yard to be the second or third, and he admitted that to be the second; I then asked him whether he had not given Coleman orders to take a load into St. John's-street, and he admitted that he had; I asked him by whose authority, and he admitted that he had received no instructions from myself, my father, or brothers, to that effect; I then asked him whether he and Coleman had agreed together, why the iron should be left at Dobell's yard, or whether he was to give him any thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This relates to another indictment? A. Yes; he then said he had given him orders to take two tons odd to Dobell's yard, on the previous week, of this Langley-field iron and that he had given Coleman 2l. as a share of the plunder.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you told us all you said to him before he told you this? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You said before, that you would not swear you had not said it would be better for him to tell the whole truth - have you still a doubt whether you held him out any inducement? A. I will undertake to swear I held him out no threat or promises previous to the conversation I have now stated.</p>
               <p>MR. C. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you undertake to swear that, at any time during the conversation, you did not say something to this effect, that he was in trouble, and it would be better for him to tell all about it? A. I really believe I said nothing of the sort - I swear positively I did not say any thing to that effect, previous to the conversation I have just stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell at what period of the conversation you might have said it? A. I do not admit that it occurred at all; I will not undertake to swear on so trivial a thing, because it might have been said by me, though, to the best of my recollection, I did not say it at all - I will swear I did not say it previous to the conversation I have stated; if I did say it, it must have been after the facts were before him in such a way, that nothing but downright lies would have excused him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say that before he said any thing about the entries in his book, you did not say it would be better for him to tell the truth about it? A. I will.</p>
               <p>MR. A. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he say any thing of the entries of the quantity brought on the 25th? A. He admitted that two tons had been sold to Llewellyn; I said to him you have ordered Coleman to leave a load of iron at Dobell's yard, by whose authority did you do so; he admitted it was by no authority; I asked if he had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060040"/>ordered Coleman to leave two tons odd of Langley-field iron last week; he admitted that he had, and by nobodys authority; and he admitted that the two tons odd formed part of the nineteen tons which he had entered in the book, as having arrived in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. A short time after this, I believe, you saw Coleman? A. Yes; in a minute afterwards, I asked if he had left a load of iron that morning at Dobell's yard; he said he had, and by Mr. Davidson's order: I asked if had received any thing for delivering that iron at Dobell's; he at first said Mr. Davidson had lent him 1l.; I asked if Davidson had not given him the 1l.; he said No, and equivocated very much; he said at last that he had received 2l. from Davidson; I then asked whether he had not delivered, in the previous week, a load of iron at Dobell's - that was the iron in question - he then said he had delivered a load of Langley-field iron on the previous week at Dobell's, and by Davidson's order - I then asked why he had not mentioned it to me that he had delivered it, as he must know there was something wrong in it, and if he had any delivery note from Mr. Davidson - he said No, and that he was going to mention it to me - I asked why he allowed such a length of time to pass without mentioning it, it being upwards of ten days - he did not answer, and the conversation ended.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it usual for the carmen to deliver goods before they came to the premises, with or without an order? A. Never without a delivery note and a receipt - we never sent iron out without its being previously weighed, and in two instances this was not weighed, as it was drawn away from the wharf; it should be weighed at the wharf, if taken from there, and if from our place it should be weighed there; Coleman had been our carter eighteen months, or near two years, and understood the business perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. C. PHILLIPS. Q. Had not Davidson a superior situation to that of Coleman? A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you ask if he had given him orders, if he had not power to order him? A. If I am engaged I cannot go out to give the carmen orders, and Davidson sometimes did; I did not ask Coleman whether he had delivered iron at Dobell's, but if had not delivered it, it was for him to deny it; he said at once that he had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When does the iron become your property? A. When it is invoiced to us - it is ours when it is at the wharf; this iron was bought by us from Crawshaw's yard; I believe I was present at the purchase; the party who sold it put the order into my hands, for Crawshaw's to deliver it to us; it was my father's property when it lay at the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Then had not Davidson a power to direct the carmen to take it away? A. After I had issued orders to that effect; I myself ordered Coleman to bring it all from Crawshaw's to our yard; if contrary directions had been afterwards given, there would have been a written order delivered to the carman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, in the common way of business, would the iron have been removing from the yard? A. That depends upon how we are engaged.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you expect to see it there in less than a week or ten days? A. No, if the carts were otherwise employed - if Davidson ordered it elsewhere in that time, the carman had no authority to take it without a written order.</p>
               <p>Q. Davidson had power to order him to move it? A. He had the power of seducing the carman; he had the power to order; I do not say he had a right.</p>

            . I keep the Black Bull public-house. St. John's-street, Smithfield, my yard is in Peter's-lane, which is in Middlesex; one morning, about the middle of October, I saw several pigs of iron in the middle of the yard; Davidson and Llewellyn were at my house between seven and eight o'clock on the morning, after I saw the iron there; Llewellyn said, in Davidson presence, that he had been up my yard, and bought some iron; I said I could not think whose iron it was, I could not think who took the liberty of putting it there; Davidson said, "It is my iron - I thought you would have no objection to my putting it there, as you have plenty of room;" I never had iron there before; I have beasts and bacon, and carts kept there.</p>

            . I live at No. 13, Greenhill's-rents, and am an iron-founder; my foundery is in Cow-cross - I know Davidson - I met him in Cow-cross, on Wednesday, the 31st of October; he said, "Llewellyn, do you want any iron?" I said, "What, do you deal in pig-iron?" he said he had got some pig-iron, which he had taken for a bad debt - I asked where it was; he said,"Up in Dobell's yard" - I said I would go and look at it; he went with me, and pointed it out; it is what we call No. 2 iron, and marked "Langley-field" - I asked what he wanted for it; he said, 6l. a ton - I said, "I have got iron at 6l. a ton, which will answer my purpose, at six months' credit" - I agreed to give him 5l. 10s., and to pay him next week; he asked if I could not give him a part then, as he was very short of money, and was fitting up a shop - I gave him two sovereigns, and on the Saturday following, he called, and I gave him two more - I have used some of the iron - Mr. Galloway has seen what was left.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you saw it this morning, did you examine it carefully? A. I did- it has three white legs and one black.</p>
               <p>Q. Three white legs? A. Part black; the near hindleg and the off-legs are both black - I never advertised it, and do not know of its having been advertised - I never described it at the office - I described it to some friends, who did not know it, in case they should meet such a one - I never described it, in order to have it advertised, and never said that only the near hind-leg was white - I sent it to the Isle of Dogs, on the 6th of April, I think - I mentioned the date at Worship-street - I had had it between one and two years; it was eight or nine years old I suppose - I know Gunn, of Stepney - I did not tell him to advertise it - I had some conversation with him about it, but did not tell him, that only the hind-leg was white - I expected him to make it good, as it was in his care; to the best of my knowledge, I never told him to advertise it - I will swear that I did not tell him - I never saw it advertised, and do not know that it ever was - I call it a brown gelding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never call it a bay? A. Brown and bay are much alike: many people call a brown horse a bay one. I am a brewer, and keep nine or ten horses.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is Gunn the holder of the marsh in which the gelding was turned? A. He is - I expected him to make the horse good - I left it to himself whether he would advertise it or not, but never told him to do it; he never charged me for an advertisement.</p>

            . I am a farrier. Richmond's gelding was under my care - I attended it after all the four legswere blistered, for a week or a fortnight in the stable, and then took it myself to Gunn's marsh, which is in Middlesex - I should know the gelding again - I turned it on the marsh on Friday, the 6th of April, and saw it there on the Sunday following - I went on Monday, at nine o'clock, and it was gone - I have seen it twice since, at Worship-street, and in the Court-yard to day. I am sure it is the same gelding.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you worked for Mr. Richmond? A. Two or three years; I did not blister the horse, but attended to it, after it was blistered - I know it was in April, because I set it down in my pocket-book, the evening I turned it out - I turned no other horse out there in April - I call it a bay - I said no thing to Gunn about the legs, nor did I describe it at all to him, or he to me - I talked to him about its being lost - I described it at Worship-street, as a bay horse - I have never seen it advertised; the marsh is not extensive; it is partly fenced, and the other part is divided by the canal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could the horse have strayed there? A. No - I saw it this morning, and still think it a light bay; the horse in the yard is the one I turned out.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Does the marsh lay between the road going to Greenwich? A. It is the one by Limehouse-hole; there is a gravel path by the side of the caual - I know of no other thoroughfare; there are three gates. I never saw them left open.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Brockhurst, near Gospert, in the parish of Alverstoke. I saw the gelding claimed by the prosecutor, about the middle of May - I saw the prisoner drive it in a gig on the road from Farnham to Gosport. I am sure it is the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you seen it before? A. Yes, when he drove it up the road; it was not more than two minutes in my sight - I did not notice the colour of its legs - I had seen it before that, in his stable, some few days, I cannot fix the date.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in trouble yourself? A. Many times; there are very few men but what are, I believe.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The counsel means, have you ever been in prison, or in trouble from loss of character? A. I have never been charged with any crime in my life.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you not convicted before a Magistrate of any crime? A. I was convicted for shooting without a certificate, not for poaching.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never charged with any thing else before a Magistrate? A. Let me see - I do not recollect at present, I might by and by perhaps - I was taken before a Magistrate on suspicion of smuggling, but was acquitted - I was not sent to gaol; that was the only time - I was a farmer at Alverstoke a few months ago, where I was born and bred.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any land there? A. I lived with my mother, who held land under Mr. Potter; she has left it four years - I was working as a farmer three months ago, with Mr. Page, who has land at Alverstoke - I do not know how long I have left Brockhurst; it may be six month ago; if I have said three, I meant a few months - I will not swear how long it was - I will not swear it was not nine. I have been doing what I could since.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Are you sure the horse you saw in the prisoner's stable, is the same you afterwards saw in the possession of Alexander? A. It is the same - I assisted Alexander in treating with Mr. Lock for the purchase of it, some time in August; he lives in the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060042"/>parish - I was not present when the purchase was completed, but when it was treated for. Cutts was not present.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see it in the possession of Lock? A. I went to Lock's house about it, but did not see it there. Alexander treated with Lock for it - I think it was in Cutts' stable about that time. I had seen it in his stable about ten times - the same horse is in the yard now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard it described as Lock's horse? A. Not particularly this one; some of the horses in Cutts' stable were considered as Lock's; there were six or seven in Cutts' stable; they were all claimed as Lock's at the time Alexander was treating for this, because Cutts was away at the time. I believe he was away at some fair - he lived at the stable - he is a horse-dealer. Lock had many horses in Cuttss' stable, which he said were his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say all the horses in Cutts' stable were claimed by Lock? A. When Cutts was away, Lock used to deal about them, but what the understanding between him and Cutts was I do not know. I never heard Lock say the horse now in the yard was his, but it is the one Mr. Alexander and I spoke to Lock about.</p>

            . I am a distiller, and live at Brockhurst, about two miles from Gosport; the horse now in the yard was formerly in my possession. I bought one of Lock the beginning of April for 23l.; it did not answer my purpose, and about the 10th of August, the one in the yard was brought to me by the prisoner; but I was changing with Lock, the horse I had of him against this, I saw the prisoner once in the transaction - he is the man who brought the horse to me, and I paid him the balance in money, as he told me, for Lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he received the money for Lock? A. To the best of my recollection, he did - I think I am certain of it. I knew the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he concerned in business with Lock? A. There is only the name of "Brown, horse-dealer" on the board, on the house - his name is Brown. Lock lives about three quarters of a mile off - I believe the stables are Brown's. Lock has premises four or five doors off - he has a house, and a little stable belonging to it, for two or three horses; the stable in which this horse was, belongs to Cutts. I told Lock I would not keep the horse I first bought, unless he had something that would suit me better; he then showed me this horse - Cutts was not present; but I had bid Cutts money for the very same horse three or four weeks before, but we could not agree about the price, and he turned the horse out I think: at all events, it was missing for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you treat with Cutts as if it was his own? A. Yes. I bid him money for it; they were both together at that time - I now recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You bid the money to Cutts? A. They were both together. I think, when it first came down I spoke to Cutts alone about it. I bought it on the 10th of August - it came down three weeks or a month before that - I then saw it in the hands of Cutts and Lock - they were both present - one of them rode it. I do not know whether they were in partnership - it was no concern of mine. I serve them both with beer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You dealt before this with Lock for a horse? A. Yes; he treated that as his own, and he dealt with this about the same. I know he used to keep some horses at Brown's. I let him some stables myself about a quarter of a year ago, and he still kept them - they would hold seven or eight horses; he was constantly chopping with horses. I should not have hesitated about paying him for it. I considered that I was paying Cutts for Lock; he asked me to let the money alone till after the fair. If I had had an account with Lock, I should have debitted him for the money.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where is Lock now? A. Oh, a great many people want to know that; directly Cutts was apprehended Lock went away; I took no receipt for the money; my man is here, who saw it paid; it is not very often that I do take receipts of these jockies; I paid 11l. in cash, making the horse 34l.</p>

               <p>MR. RICHMOND. I did say, that at the time I turned him out, as he was blistered, he was not, to appearance, worth more than 10l.; but to me he was worth a great deal.</p>

I am waiter at the White Hart, Temple-mills, close by Hackney-marsh; there is a road from the marsh throughour yard; on Saturday, the 13th of October, I saw the prisoner at the bar, also Hilt, and Holden - I knew Hilt very well, and knew the prisoner very well, but did not know Holden's name; they were all walking about the marsh together - I have known the prisoner five years, and cannot be mistaken in his person; on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060043"/>Monday, the 15th of October, at six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner again, with Hilt and another man, who I knew very well by sight; they had a black mare, which the prisoner was riding on - they had two horses - Hilt was riding the other - that was black also, but I could not tell whether that was a horse or a mare; there were only two horses - the third man opened the gate for them - he had no horse - he was going from the marsh.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How near were you to them in the marsh? A.

            . I am a publican and farmer - I live at Brick wall, in Herts. On Thursday, the 18th of October, the prisoner and another person came to my house, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, and brought two mares and a gelding - the mares were both black - the other man gave me orders about the mares - he told me to turn them to grass till Saturday morning - I believe the prisoner was within hearing - while I was in the stable I asked the other man if he was disposed to sell one of the mares, not the one in question.</p>
               <p>Q. When they went away, who mounted the gelding? A. The prisoner - the other went away first, a little before him - they had not paid for the keep of the mares - I called after them to say so, and the other man said he would come on Saturday, and pay it altogeter, but he did not come - on Sunday evening, about six o'clock, the prisoner came, and said his master, being detained late at market on Friday night, could not come down that night, but would come on Monday night or Tuesday morning, but he did not come; I asked the prisoner if he intended to go back that night - he said he thought of doing so. as he had to meet his master the next morning in Smithfield - after he had some refreshment, I asked if he was authorised to sell or exchange the mares; he said, Yes; I told him his master talked about 18l. for the other mare (not for this). but perhaps he might take less, it being out of condition; I asked if he was authorised to sell or exchange either of them - he said he was, or words to that effect; I proposed to try the other mare, (which was claimed by Mr. Mash) the following morning, but on the following morning I told him I suspected they were stolen - I had had an officer there all night; the prisoner had slept in my house that night, in the same room with the officer, and myostler, but I had not told him the man was an officer, and he did not know it. I said to him next morning, in the officer's presence, "I strongly suspect these horses are stolen, and before you leave here, you must go before a Magistrate;" as he had not come for the mares at the time appointed, I thought it my duty to go to the Magistrate, to ask what I was to do - he rather objected to go to the Magistrate; he said, "I never stole a horse in my life, and I am afraid you want to put me in the watch-house;" he said, "My master has got a relation who lives at Dyer's farm, and he will come forward and say the horses are not stolen." The horses were afterwards owned, one by Mr. Mash, and the other by Mr. Starkey; I delivered Mr. Starkey's to his servant. Knowing there was a person of the description he gave me, I let him go, but called him back when he got twenty or thirty yards, and we went before Mr. Faithful, the Magistrate; he took some depositions down in writing. The mares had not then been claimed.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, before you went before the Magistrate, did he say any thing to you about where the mares came from? A. I asked him, and he said they came from Brentwood fair, which was held on the Monday, to Royston fair on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he and his companion came from Brentwood fair? A. He said one mare was bought at Brentwood fair, and the other at Royston; he was discharged by the Magistrate, and did not come back for the mares; neither he, nor any other person came for them - they were left with me, and afterwards claimed by Mash and Mr. Starkey's servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is the second trial we have had about these mares? A. Yes - he was indicted for stealing the other, and acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. You used the term "Master" - did not Holden, who came with him, appear more respectable dressed than the prisoner? A. He was certainly more respectable than the prisoner, but not very respectable; the prisoner treated him as if he was his master all through.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you consider him as acting as the servant? A. Not exactly so - I asked him about his master, but, from a conversation which took place, I asked him if he was authorised to sell it, thinking he was concerned; they came to the gateway together - Holden came to the stable first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Holden say one or other of them would come back? A. I think his words were "Take them to grass till Saturday morning, and we will come and take them." The prisoner was within hearing when I asked Holden if he would sell it - I afterwards asked the prisoner if he was authorised to sell it; Holden did not come back: I had been before the Magistrate about the mares, before the prisoner came back, and made it known that I suspected they were stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner tell you he had been to several fairs, where Holden had chapped and sold horses? A. I think he said he had been with him about three months; he did not say he had been to several fairs - he said he had been with him three months, and his employment was to ride and run horses for him, as well as for other dealers; I remember his saying his father lived at a cottage at Hackney-wick; he said that before the Magistrate, and he was taken up there, I believe, but I was not present.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. You say, when they first came, the other acted more as master? A. Yes, but my opinion was afterwards changed; I did not make my suspicions public - I only went to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell other people besides the Magistrate, that you thought the horses were stolen? A. I did: he told the Magistrate one mare was bought at Brentwood fair, and the other at Royston - and I believe he said so to me, as we went to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was discharged did he give any other account? A. Not to my knowledge - he left me very soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060044"/>JOHN VANN. I keep the White Lion public-house, Hackney-wick. I have known the prisoner four years and a half, perfectly well - I know John Holden and John Hilt- Hilt had lived with me twelve months, as ostler, and left me in September; I never knew he was a horse-dealer, and I have only heard that Holden was a horse-dealer; I do not know what business he was. During the time Hilt was in my service he attended to the the tap-room when he had time to spare; Newman and Holden occasionally came in, and they seemed very friendly together; I have seen the prisoner on the road to Hackney-marsh since Hilt left me; I suppose Holden to be about twenty-three or twenty-four years old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you have seen hundreds on the road to the marsh? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol, at Hackney, and have been so six months. I know the prisoner, also Holden and Hilt - Holden lived in North-street, Cambridge-heath, and Newman in Wick-lane, about half a mile from Holden - I have seen both of them frequently together with the prisoner; Hilt has been a waiter; he was not a horse-dealer, nor a stable-keeper; I know they were all three acquainted - I have been looking for Newman, Holden, and Hilt, neither of whom I could find. Newman was apprehended by another person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have not been able to find Holden? A. No; he is a thin man - he does not go respectably dressed: he has absconded. The prisoner's father's cottage is in Wick-lane - it was Goddard who took him up: his father has a family.</p>

            . I live on a small income, at Hitchen, in Herts. I know the prisoner perfectly well; I saw him at Hitchen in October, but I cannot say on what day; it was near the middle, I think, and on a Thursday, to the best of my recollection; he was with a person taller than himself; I followed them into the stables of the Cock public-house, at Hitchen; they had two black mares and a poney; the other man asked me if I would buy one of the mares; the prisoner was in the stable with him, and must have heard it - my answer was, that I did not want a horse of any kind; the taller man pressed me very much to make a chap with him, if I had any horse likely to suit him; I said I had got a poney which I should be glad to part with, and would sell him, but I would not chap - he proposed going to my premises, to look at the poney, which I objected to, and sent for it, but we did not deal; I did not see them leave the town.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol. I apprehended the prisoner about the 12th of November, at his father's cottage, Wick-lane. I had been looking for him for a week or more, and could not find him. I told him I apprehended him for felony, and asked what he had done with the horses which were stolen out of the marsh; he said he would tell me every thing. I said, "Mind, I don't hold out any promise," and cautioned him; he then said he went in company with Hilt in the green lanes, where be received the two horses, and took them to Enfield-highway - that he gave his right name, and might have sold the horses over and over again if he chose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you ever asked him what name he went by? A. I knew his name was George Newman, but his nickname was Crummy Newman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say they rode off the marsh? A. Yes; we had a deal of conversation; he said he was in bed, and was called up, and accompanied Hilt and Holden into the marsh, and helped them to catch the two mares.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell one word of this on the last trial? A. I do not think I did. I expected to have been asked these questions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, if he had any intention of stealing them, he might have sold them? A. He did - I believe. I had been looking for him frequently, past his father's house, and had been to the house and enquired of his mother - I suppose it was; she knew I was an officer very well. I found him at the house afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday, the 15th of October, Holden, my master, came to my father's house at five o'clock in the morning, and asked me to take two horses to the Red Lion public-house, Enfield-high way, and he would give me half a crown; he told me to come towards the White Hart public-house, and when I got there, these two horses were there, and Hilt; he gave me half a crown to pay the turnpike and my expences, and the rest for myself; he told me to take the horses, wait there till he came, and tell the horse-keeper to feed them, and he would pay. Hilt came with me as far as Lee-bridge-road; the ostler asked me whose they were - I said Holden's, my master, of Hackney. On the same evening, Holden came down with another horse, and told me to stop all night with him; next morning he asked me to go to Royston fair, and he would pay me for it; we went on Tuesday night, and on Wednesday he changed one away for a horse.

On the 6th of November he was employed in fetching iron from Messrs. Drew's wharf, Steel-yard, Upper Thames-street, to my father's premises; he brought, on the 6th of November, to my father's premises, two single horse-loads, about 25 cwt. In consequence of the information, which Mr. Carden gave me that day, I went to Mr. Dobell's yard, in St. John's-street, and from the information which I got there, I went to Llewellyn's, in Cow-cross; I then returned to our manufactory, and saw the prisoner Coleman just entering the yard with a load of iron; I called him into my father's office (this was before twelve o'clock) - I did not hold him out any promise or threat whatever; I asked how many loads of iron he had brought that morning from the Steel-yard; he said he had brought in three loads that morning - I knew myself he had brought but two, for I had seen him deliver one load, and he was then bringing another in- he had left the premises about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; he delivered one load about nine, and it was between eleven and twelve when I questioned him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the time taken in the delivery of these two loads more than usual? A. It certainly was considerably longer than he should have been; he said this was the third load; I denied that he had brought in two, previous to the one then in the yard; after hesitating a little, he said the one he had just brought in was only the second; I asked if he had been any where else with any iron that morning from the Steel-yard; he said he had not; I then asked whether he had not taken a load to Mr. Dobell's yard, in St. John's-street; he said Yes, he had; I asked by whose orders; he said by Mr. Davidson's; I asked whether he had received any money from Mr. Davidson for having conveyed any iron that morning by his orders; he said he had received no other money but 2l. - 1l. on the former week, and 1l. on the day before, which was Monday; he did not say what iron he had received it for, but that he had received but 2l. from Davidson: I saw Davidson, and asked him how many loads had been delivered that morning by Coleman; he also said there had been three delivered by him, and that the load then in the yard made the third; I then asked whether he had given Coleman orders to take iron to Dobell's yard; he said he had; I asked if he had given him any money for conveying that iron; he said he had given him 1l. yesterday, but I had stated the two transactions together.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way were orders given to your carman? A. When we have a quantity of iron at the wharf, it has happened, that after I have given a written order for the delivery of the whole, that Davidson has given a verbal order for a single load; if iron was to go any where without coming to to the premises, it should be weighed at the wharf, and a delivery and receipt note made out - that is the invariable practice; Davidson said there was no note on this occasion, and Coleman said so also.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the authority of Davidson sufficient for the carman to deliver iron? A. Certainly not; I went to Dobell's yard in the afternoon, after this conversation; I also went before the Magistrate at Guildhall, then to the stables of a man named Birmingham, in Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross, and there found a quantity of Madely-wood pig-iron, with that name cast on it; I took it away in our cart - it weighed about 30 cwt. odd; it corresponded in quality with that at the wharf, and had the name on it - I had given the carman a written order for the conveyance of the Madely-wood iron from the wharf; he was to bring the whole to our manufactory, and did bring it there previous to the 6th of November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have not got the order here? A. No; it was given to him to deliver to Messrs. Drew's; my inquiry about the iron in the former case, was also on the 6th of November; the conversation was kept up some time, and we were separated before it concluded; Coleman was separated from Davidson - I had taken one into another room; the prisoners' situation had not been altered while they were in our employ; the iron in question was the first that I questioned Coleman about; he did not say he had delivered one load by order of Davidson till I asked him the question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he had delivered two at the yard, and one by his order at another place? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Which of the two transactions took place first? A. This is the first I questioned him about; the other iron was first taken, but it was not discovered till the 6th of November.</p>

            . I keep the Black Bull public-house, St. John's-street. On Tuesday, the 6th of November, about nine o'clock, I was called up, and saw this iron down in the middle of the yard; I did not know who brought it, or or whom it belong to; I immediately ordered Cowderoy to go and inquire who it belonged to, and ordered it immediately to be removed, as it stopped the passage of carts into the yard; Davidson came up to me afterwards, and I quarrelled with him about bringing the iron there; I told him he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060046"/>might as well take possession of my yard and house at once, as to put iron there without my leave; he said it should be removed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was a great deal of iron there, was there not? A. Only this; the other had been moved about a week or more before; my yard is in Middlesex - I do not know who moved the iron away.</p>

               <p>MR. CARDEN. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Newgate-street - I rent premises in Dobell's-yard. On Tuesday morning, the 6th of November, I saw this iron in the yard; Davidson was talking to Dobell when I first saw him, and after Dobell left, I saw him giving directions to a carman, to convey away some iron, which I had complained of, as being in the way of our carts; I did not know him before. I heard, in the yard, in whose employ he was; I inquired of him what was the value of the iron which was then loading in the cart - he said from 5l. to 6l. a ton; I asked if he was a dealer in iron; he said he was - that the lease of his own premises had expired, and he had engaged Dobell's yard to put his iron in. In consequence of what I saw I went and informed Mr. Galloway.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it Coleman who was removing it? A. No.</p>
               <p>ISAAC DOBELL re-examined. I had had no conversawith Davidson about taking my yard; I was angry with him for placing the iron there.</p>
               <p>- BIRMINGHAM. I am a jobbing carman, and have a stable in Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross, Middlesex. On Tuesday, the 6th of November, Davidson came to me, as I was waiting for a job, and asked if my horse was engaged; I said, No; he said, "Will you go and move a load of iron for me?" I harnessed my horse, and he took me to Dobell's yard; he walked before me to show me the way - I there found the iron - he told me to back the cart up, and begin to load, which I did; I put it all into the cart, and asked him where I was to go with it; we went over to Greenhill's-rents; I asked where I was going with it; he said, "The lease of my premises is expired, and I will give you 1s. to let it remain in your place;" it was deposited in my place.</p>
               <p>MR. R. GALLOWAY. I saw the iron on this man's premises, and moved it by our cart to our manufactory; we had about 30 cwt., and it was the same sort as we had at Drew's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Nobody else has that sort of iron, I suppose? A. Oh, Yes; we never sold any; we work it up; it was worth 7l. or 8l. a ton.</p>

            , ESQ. I am proprietor of the premises in West-street. On the 6th of November Coleman was in my employ, and was sent to fetch iron from the Steel-yard; I recollect seeing him about the middle of the day - I asked him how many loads he had brought that day - he said, "Two" - I said, "Only two?" - he then attempted to hesitate, and at last reluctantly acknowledged it was three - I then asked him if he had delivered those three loads in our yard - he again hesitated, and again reluctanty acknowledged that he had taken one load somewhere else, and, after a good deal of trouble, he acknowledged he had taken it to Dobell's, in St. John's-street - I called Davidson into the counting-house that day, in consequence of a communication from Mr. Carden, relative to some iron - I communicated my suspicions to him, and he acknowledged that he had directed Coleman to take the Madely-wood iron; and subsequently he acknowledged that he had directed him to take two loads of the other iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Confine yourself to the Madely-wood iron - did you see Davidson in company with Coleman? A. I did, and he accused Coleman of having received 2l. of him for conveying iron to Dobell's yard - he said he was to give him 1l. a load - Coleman at first denied it, but at last acknowledged that he had paid him 2l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was your son there at the time? A. He was; I was at home this morning, when the last case was tried; I heard of the verdict - I cannot say whether my son was present during the whole of the conversation - I believe he went out once or twice - I am sure he was not present the whole time - I have no partner, and am sole proprietor of the business.</p>
               <p>COLEMAN'S Defence (written.) I am unfortunately brought to this bar for an offence of which I can assure you I am perfectly innocent; if I have done wrong to my worthy master, it has been through ignorance, and under the impression that I was bound to obey the commands of George Davidson, clerk and superintendant of Mr. Galloway's manufactery, who was my superior in education and situation; and further I might have lost my situation, which would have brought distress upon my dear wife and family of small children, together with myself. I therefore was obedient to all and every one of his commands. On one occasion I certainly asked him a question, at which he seemed offended, and morosely said, "Did Mr. Galloway order you to obey me or not?" I answered him, Yes! He immediately said, "Then obey. my commands," which I was forced to do, under the pain and penalty of losing my situation. Gentlemen, you will see by this statement, that I had no will of my own, but my will was to obey the commands of my superiors, mine being a menial station in life, in which I was at the command of all my superiors, one of which was Mr. George Davidson; therefore you will please to take my hard case into your serious consideration, as I am no scholar, and not qualified for any higher or better situation; therefore I cannot be so much to blame as might appear, had I not have laid this statement of my injured case before you. - Gentlemen of the Jury, 1 beg leave to thank you for your kind attention, and hope you will consider of this my unfortunate case, and restore me to my disconsolate wife and family of small children, who are wholly dependent on my small efforts for their daily support; and thus I throw myself upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BANE. I live at Marshfield, near Chippenham, in Gloucestershire - it is one hundred and four miles from town. I had a mare in my possession, which I put into the field myself, about seven o'clock on the evening of the 5th of October - I locked the gate; the field has a fence round it, and the mare could not stray; I went to the field myself about half-past seven o'clock in the morning of the 6th, and it was gone; I found the gate open. By getting over the wall, the latch could be opened inside; a public road runs close by the field: I found her in London, in possession of Garton, the officer, on the 10th of October - I am quite sure it is the mare I had missed; I had had her ever since the 4th of May.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Marshfield. On the evening of the 5th of October I saw Johnson at Marshfield, in Mr. Jones' tap-room; I knew his person before, by seeing him about there, and have no doubt of his being the man; I saw him again on the 17th of November, in London, and knew him; I pointed him out as the person I had seen before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often had you seen him at Marshfield? A. Sometimes once or twice in the course of a year; I never saw him above two or three times before the 5th of October.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON. Q. How long have you been out of Devizes gaol? A. I never was in Davizes gaol in my life; I was in Horsley gaol, Gloucestershire, for a month, for an assault, for striking a man - I was confined a month.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the charge for an assault, or for taking any thing as well? A. No - it was only for striking him; I was confined a month there, to hard labour; I was tried before a Justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON. Q. Do you know you are on your oath? A. Yes; I am telling nothing but the truth.</p>

            . I am a carrier from Marshfield to Bristol. I know Jones' house at Marshfield - he keeps the King's Arms. I saw Johnson there on the 5th of October; he had a smock-frock on, and grey stockings - I spoke to him, and have no doubt of his being the man: I knew him before, for a year or two; I saw him again between ten and eleven o'clock the same night, in the streets at Marshfield: it was a moon-shiny night - the moon was full; I said, "Good night, Johnson," and he said,"Good night, Bond." I know Mr. Bane's field - he was going towards there; I parted from him about two hundred yards from Bane's field; he goes by the name of William Carter at Marshfield: I said, "Good night, Carter," not Johnson. I know the other prisoner, by seeing him at Bristol-market - I always knew him by the name of Thomas Derrick; Marshfield is twelve miles from Bristol - when I saw Johnson in the street, he had boots and spurs, and a light coloured great coat on, and a little stick in his hand; his coat was buttoned up, and rather swollen out on one side, as if something was under it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON. Q. Where did you meet me? A. Just over-right the lane, about half way up the town, opposite Mrs. Martin's, where you turn off to the road.</p>

            . I am a coppersmith, and owner of some stables in Bath-street, St. Luke, Middlesex. On Monday evening, the 8th of October, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw both the prisoners (I had never seen them before) - they came to my yard with a black mare each, and requested the mares might stop for the night; I have a board over my gate, as a livery-stable - they took the mares into the stable, and unsaddled them; I asked if I should feed them - they said No, they had not come far since they were fed: they wished them to have a rack of hay; they left the mares with me, and came again for them the next morning, between eight and nine o'clock: I fed them in their presence. Carter asked who did my smith's work, as they wanted shoeing - I said Blake, and they were both shod by Blake, by Carter's direction, and he paid for the shoeing; he gave me a sovereign - my son gave him change - Chapman was present at the time. Johnson rode out on one of the mares while they were in my care; the mares were both taken away from my stable on Thursday, the 11th, by Brown and Armstrong, the officers: I was present. When Brown had brought Chapman into the stable, in custody, Brown asked him, in my presence, if those horses belonged to him - he said, No, they belonged to the other man, meaning Johnson; Chapman was left there, in Armstrong's custody - Brown went out, and in about five minutes brought in Johnson: he was asked, in Chapman's presence, if those horses were his - he said he never saw them before. Both denied their belonging to them. I have no doubt of the prisoner's identity, and of the mares being what they brought.</p>

I cannot say on what day, but during that week I did see him; the impression on my mind is, that I had seen him there that week, but I am not positive that it was within the week. I have very often seen him in Marshfield - he knew the place well. I am a farmer as well as a publican.</p>

               <p>FREDERICK ARIS DOWLEY. I live at Sidbury, in Devonshire - I live on my income. On the 2d of November I was passing up Goswell-street, towards Islington, about six o'clock in the afternoon - the gas-lamps were lighted. I had three ladies in my company - two were walking some distance behind, and one had my left arm - my watch was in my fob; when I came within two or three yards of <placeName id="t18271206-49-crimeloc245">Bell-alley</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18271206-49-crimeloc245" type="placeName" value="Bell-alley"/>

                        targets="t18271206-49-off243 t18271206-49-crimeloc245"/>, I observed the prisoner standing against an iron post in the entrance of the alley; the moment I came level with the alley, he made a spring, and seized my watch-chain; the snatch broke the bow of the watch, and he got the chain; it was done with such force that he drew my fob up; he did it so suddenly, that I could not stop his arm. I immediately pursued after him, and just at the entrance of the alley; several persons surrounded me, and attempted to stop my progress - he ran down the alley. I cleared my way, and ran after him, calling Stop thief! - he had got some yards before I got up to him; there is a thoroughfare from the alley into Golden-lane; but he took a turning to the right, and then into Great Arthur-street. I had lost sight of him in turning the corner, but was certain the same object presented itself to me the moment I turned - it is impossible I could catch sight of any body in turning but the same person, and I say I am quite certain I never lost sight of him; when he got into Great Arthur-street, he fell - there was nobody near enough to him for me to mistake him. I made sure of taking him then, but just as I got up to him, I fell myself - he got up, and I got up and pursued; some of his companions were running behind me at the time, but I outrun them; he ran down Great Arthur-street, turned to the right, then inclined to the right again into what is called Pump-court. I lost sight of him in turning the corner there, and he ran into a house, just as I turned the corner of that court; a voice or two cried out "He is gone into this house." I went into the passage, and a man, apparently a blacksmith, came out and said, "Shall we go up." I said Yes; a woman put her head over the bannisters, and said "There is nobody here that don't belong to the house - I insist upon it you don't search my house without a warrant." I then staid down stairs, and shortly after a man came in and went up stairs - that was not the prisoner; in a short time two persons came down together - I was then watching just outside. I instantly seized the prisoner, who was one of them, and said "This is the villain who has robbed me." I have no doubt whatever of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person who offered you his assistance at hand then? A. I do not know - there was a great crowd; the people immediately cried out "That is not him, he belongs to the house; the man who has robbed you has gone round the corner;" they immediately got round and hustled me. I loosed my hold of the prisoner, and he disappeared. I saw him in Clerkenwell prison in about a week. I had returned to Devonshire, and come back again. I was certain he was the man, and have been certain of him from the robbery to the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. Setting aside the question, whether he had robbed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060049"/>can you be certain he is the man whom you seized coming out of the house? A. I have no doubt of it, and am certain he is the man who robbed me. I had a full opportunity of examining his face. I have not found my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were the ladies friends of yours? A. They were; I have not brought them here. I cannot say whether the one who had my arm saw the man who made the snatch - she lives in St. Martin's-le-grand. I was a little alarmed. I let her arm loose, when I pursued the prisoner. I cried out, "I am robbed," or something of that kind; the other persons attacked me after I was robbed. I only lost sight of the prisoner for the instant, as he turned two corners, until he went into the house; my brother has not interfered in the business. It might be nine or ten days after that I went to Clerkenwell; the prisoner was not pointed out to me - there were thirty or forty prisoners; he was not at all distinguished from the rest. I pointed him out immediately - there was no light in the alley.</p>

            . I am a special constable of St. Luke's. I heard of this robbery, about two days afterwards - I made inquiry in Goswell-street, and was directed to a person named Buckle, in Arthur-street, from information - I afterwards saw Mrs. Buckle, the landlady of a house in Arthur-street, and about a week afterwards, I and Harrison went to a house in Gravel-walk, Blue Anchor-alley, and found the prisoner in bed with a young woman - I went to search his clothes; Harrison, said, "Billy, I want you;" the prisoner said, "What for?" Harrison told him for a bundle taken in Chiswell-street; he jumped up out of bed, and said, "I know that is a lie - I know what you want me for, it is for a robbery in Goswell-street, for the watchman told me the officers were looking after me;" we then said it was for that; we sent for Buckle; he brought a lad to the watch-house, who said he was the man.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and live with my mother, at No. 3, Great Arthur-street, Goswell-street. I work for Joseph Emms, who is journeyman to Mr. Townsend, a paper-stainer. I was sitting at tea with my mother, between six and seven o'clock, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went to the door, and saw some persons running down Arthur-street - I first of all saw the prisoner being chased - Mr. Dowley was next to him, close behind him, and others were running behind him - I am quite sure of the prisoner - I knw him well before; he ran into a house, at the entrance of Pump-court; the door is under an archway - I believe Mr. Baxter keeps the house; three or four people live in it; Baxter is one; Mr. Dowley went under the archway, and lost sight of him - I said, "He is gone up here," and showed him the house; he went just inside the threshold - I afterwards saw the prisoner come out with another man - Mr. Dowley seized him, and said, "This is the man who has robbed me;" two or three men rushed in between them; Dowley lost his hold, and the prisoner got away - I saw him again on the morning of the Tuesday week afterwards - I knew his name before, and told the officers who it was, and told Mr. Buckle - I saw him when he was taken up, at the watch-house, and cannot be mistaken in him.</p>

               <p>JEREMIAH McCARTHY. On Sunday evening, the 23d of September, I spent the day with John Harman, in <placeName id="t18271206-50-crimeloc249">John-street, Whitechapel-road</placeName>

                        targets="t18271206-50-victim400 t18271206-50-viclabel250"/> - I was out of work; my last place was at Messrs. Severn and Co. - I had left them about six weeks, having been ill, and was just getting well, when this happened - Harman was in the room when the prisoner came in - I knew them before, but did not wish to come across them, if I could help it; they staid there about half an hour then - I bade them good bye; they had insulted a first cousin of mine, who was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were in the room? A. Three or four women and four men; about ten persons altogether, besides the prisoner; we had a little to drink - I had drank beer and gin, but not much, because my doctor told me not to drink for a fortnight, or three weeks - I was sober when I left the room, with my cousin; when they insulted my cousin, I asked what they wanted, and who sent for them, and the prisoner made a slap at me, but I was on the other side of the table, and escaped from him; he did not hit me - I did not lift my hand to him - I tried to get away, because I was so weak and low in spirits; we stopped there half an hour after that; we had sat down again, and the dispute was over; I and my cousin came down stairs together; his name is Daniel Hayes; he is not here; we were going home together, till the Ragens pounced between us; he was a little distance before me, about twice the length of this Court; they came across me.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by their coming across you? A. The prisoner came before me in the highway; he came sideways, and struck me, and knocked my hat off at one blow; they had knocked my cousin about, before they attacked me, and almost killed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before your cousin was struck, had the Ragens passed you? A. I had not seen them till they came before me, and struck me; they might have passed - I had not seen them strike my cousin; it happened in John-street - Michael's wife came and asked to shake hands with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know your cousin was ill-treated? A. There were signs on him, and he told me of it - I had not heard him knocked about; it was not a very dark night; my cousin was out of my sight when I was attacked.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came up to you? A. The prisoner; he did not speak a word, till he stopped me, and struck me in the highway - I remained standing - Michael then came up, and kicked me; it was between eight and nine o'clock - I tried to run away, but Dennis ran after me, and collared me; he struck me, and knocked me against the wall, and said, "You b-y rogue, I shall give it you," and said he would have my life; he said nothing about money - I stood against the wall; Michael collared me, and gave me a kick, and brought me on my knees, and while Michael was holding my collar, Dennis put his hand into my right hand waistcoat pocket - I had two sovereigns loose in that pocket - I know they were safe when I left my friend's house, for I had had my hand on them the moment they came up to me - I begged for mercy, and put my two hands up; he tore my pocket, and took the two sovereigns out; here is the pocket; I have had it mended; when he knocked my hat off, I ran to pick it up- Michael's wife picked it up - I saw it in her hand, and do not know what became of it, till I got a warrant against them, and the officer got the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the warrant for? A. I swore a highway robbery against them; I told the Magistrate I was robbed - Mr. Lee had the warrant - when I went to swear the highway robbery, two or three officers would not let me in - they brought the book outside, and swore me, and they did not make any thing of it but an assault - I told my story to the Magistrate after he had signed the warrant - when the men were taken on this warrant, I thought it was all right, but he got false bail, and I cannot find the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sent to gaol or about his business? A. He was sent to gaol of course; he had his trial before the Magistrates; he was sent to Clerkenwell, and got bail.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went to the office, you say the officer would not let you in? A. No; the warrant was granted without my going before the Magistrate; the officers shut the door, because they said I could come down upon them with the warrant, and find him; I and my cousin both went to the office.</p>
               <p>The warrant, being here produced and read, was for a common assault.</p>

               <p>Q. What further passed, was Michael's wife with them? A. Yes; she asked me to shake hands with her; she kept delaying me till my friend got out of sight, and was knocked about; I felt my money between the prisoner's fingers when he tore my pocket, and he ran away as soon as he got his hand out - I went to the office next morning, and they would not grant any warrant, but kept me about for two or three days, and afterwards the officers would not let me in, but brought the book to me, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060051"/>made nothing but an assault of it, and I indicted them both; I saw two watchmen, and told them I was robbed - I asked them to come after the prisoner - one of them said, "Do not you know what way the watchman was served the other day? he was struck by an Irishman, and knocked down with a stone and killed, you must go to Whitechapel watch-house, and get an officer" - I did not go to the watch-house - I have subpoenaed two witnesses, named Riley and Graddon, who saw me knocked down, but they will not come.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been ill in the hospital, how came you to have two sovereigns? A. I got it from my master - the foreman paid me off - he gave me 3s. 6d. after I came out of the hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Now, on your oath, did you say a word about the sovereigns till you went before the Grand Jury? A. Yes; I said I was robbed of two sovereigns - I told Lee, the officer, so - I am sure Michael held me while the prisoner robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate the prisoner and Michael robbed you? A. Yes, when they led me in the second time; I swore the first time before the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to persist that you swore before the Magistrate that you lost two sovereigns? A. I swore it from first to last, and proved it too - I have known them since I was twelve years old - we only had a few words inside the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were in the street when you were robbed. A. The two Ragens, Michael's wife, and me - the disturbance did not last long - when they first struck me, I ran away about twelve yards, and Michael came and put his hand into my pocket - I cannot swear how long it lasted - one of my witnesses was present - I told my cousin I was robbed - I saw him as soon as I got home, and told him of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you cry Stop thief! when you got up? A. Yes; but he was gone as soon as he got the money - I hallooed out, Watch! Stop him! the watchman came up, and two men hallooed out, Shame and Murder! they are not here; I subposuaed two men, but they will not come; they are Irisltmen, and acquainted with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did you take your cousin before the Grand Jury? A. No; he did not see any thing of my robbery; we had one of them before the Justice.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bethnal-green. The prosecutor came to me early one Monday morning, and said he had been robbed about a month or three weeks ago - I found his hat in the first-floor room, at No. 18, John-street, Whitechapel;

            's wife occupied that room - I saw the hat taken out of there into another house - when I went to apprehended Michael, I saw him escape over the wall, on a signal being given to him - he is a labouring bricklayer, and when I got on the scaffold, a signal was given, I took the person who assisted him over the wall, but did not take Michael - the prosecutor went before the Magistrate with me, and swore a robbery against them both - only Michael's wife was before the Magistrate - he discharged her; I did not see Dennis or Michael afterwards - I was not before the Grand Jury - the prosecutor subponsed me last Monday - he came early on a Monday morning, and gave me a warrant for felony - I do not know who it was signed by - I cannot read writing, but I gave it to somebody to read - I read the printed part of it - it was from Lambeth-street - it was for felony - I gave it to several people to read - I gave it back to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is it now? A. The Magistrate took the warrant, rolled it up, and threw it away, and said he would have nothing to do about it, and abused me in some respect; a person in the office took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said you gave it to McCarthy? A. Why, after a bit, I asked the Magistrate to have the kindness to give me the warrant - he gave it me, and I gave it to McCarthy.</p>
               <p>Q. What, after he had thrown it down? A. No, before that; he requested to see it again; he rolled it up and threw it down, and said he would have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you in the habit of taking warrants for felony from the parties themselves? A. Sometimes I do; the officer who had it first would not go. I did not know the Magistrate had said he would have nothing to do with it; it was after I had it that I heard the Magistrate say so. I thought it would be my duty to apprehend the prisoner, particularly as the man was knocked about and robbed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say you would have taken a man on a warrant for felony, which you saw the Magistrate reject, and say he would have nothing to do with? A. I mean to say when it first came into my possession; but after the Magistrate rolled it, I should have nothing to do with it. I first knew McCarthy about a week before he gave me the warrant. I found the hat about twelve o'clock on the day he gave me the warrant.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH McCARTHY. This is the hat they knocked off my head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Myerson the first person you applied to? A. No - Mr. Lee. I went to him several times before he went after the prisoner. I was obliged to give him 5s., for he used to say "I am tired and busy now;" he went and found the man on the top of the scaffold. Lee did not take the prisoner; the street-keeper of London-bridge took him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Myerson requested me to go after the men. I went to a house where the hat was found - we did not find the prisoner there; we went to a building, and a signal was given to Michael to escape. I did not read much of the warrant, and cannot say whether it was for felony or assault.</p>
               <p>- LEE. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I did not see the prosecutor at the office when he applied for the warrant. I apprehended Michael and saw the prosecutor at the office then; he spoke of a fight between them; he made no charge of robbery, and no warrant was granted for felony - it was a peace warrant; he said he was afraid to go about, for he was in danger of his life, and that the people had threatened to kill him; the Magistrate granted the warrant produced.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long was he stating his case to the Magistrate? A. I suppose about ten minutes - he was heard all through patiently; he said he had lost two sovereigns in the scuffle, and his hat, but it was not stated in the way of a robbery at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew his torn waistcoat before the Magistrate? A. He did not.</p>

On the 25th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was at the corner of the street in Hackney-road, and saw the prisoner coming with something on his shoulder; when he came up to me he crossed the road; I ran, and stopped him with these sashes in a rug - I asked what he had got- he said, sashes - that they were his own, and he had brought them from Hackney; he said he got them from his master: my brother watchman said, "I won't stand that;" he then threw them down, and ran away; I pursued, and sprang my rattle; he was stopped, without my losing sight of him. I have seen the sashes fitted in the house by the carpenter.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Rosemary-lane. On Thursday, the 1st of November, the prisoner came to my house, and offered a copper lock for sale for 5s. - I told him I did not like the look of it, and asked if he would take half-a-crown; he said it was worth more, but agreed to take it; he said it was his own; I asked where he lived, and he wrote his address, "Jonathan Davey, New Charlton;" while he was writing it, I told a man to go and get change for a half-crown, and I sent for a headborough - I had shot the lock, and seen the broad arrow on it; the man returned with the change, and I gave the prisoner four sixpences, and 6d. worth of copper; I then asked him how he came by it, as it was a King's lock, he again said it was his own; I said he must go with me, and I took him to the Thames Police-office; in going there, he said he would give me the lock and 5s. if I would let him go; I said it was a trick played upon me, and he must go before the Magistrate, who might do as he pleased about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is it a perfect lock? A. Yes; there is nothing wanting but the key, and the box which the lock goes into - it is worth about 2s. 4d. as old metal, but it might be used as a lock, with a key; as a lock it is worth about 1l.; I did offer half-a-crown for it; I knew it was a King's lock as soon as I saw it, as I have been in the King's service myself - I could swear to it without seeing the broad arrow on it.</p>

I put my box on the table, and opened it: the prisoner said she should like to buy something, but she had no money; I said I would take old silver or rings in exchange; she said, "Let us go into my room, and very likely I have got some there;" she took me into a room up two pair of stairs; I put my box on a table; she took hold of a coral ring, tried it on her finger, and asked the price; I said 8s.: she then took up a French opera-glass, and asked the price, which was 4s. - she put that into her bosom; I said, "Now, where are your old rings?" she began to laugh at me; she then collared me, and turned me out of the room - the other girls were down stairs; I went down, and tried to get out, but the street door was locked; she followed me down stairs - there was one of the other women in the passage; I passed her, and went up to the door; the prisoner then came up to me in the passage, and struck me on the side of my head; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060054"/>fainted away nearly, I was so frightened when she struck me; the servant came up from the kitchen, and said,"What is the matter?" I said I was not well, and asked for cold water, which she brought me; I washed my face, and got better: I then said to the prisoner, "Pray open the door - I want to go about my business?" she said,"You had better come into the parlour, and open your box, to see if you have lost any thing;" I said I knew I had lost the ring and opera-glass, and would not go into the parlour; she said, "You shall not go out if you don't look - may be you will find them in your box;" I said "I cannot open my box here, for I am afraid I shall lose more, and if you don't open the door, I'll make a row here;" she then opened it; I went out, and went to a baker's-shop, at the corner, and told them what had happened: I waited there about half an hour, till an officer came by, and I went with him to the house; he asked the prisoner to give my property back; she took the opera-glass from her bosom, and gave him; she had the ring on her finger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she take the ring off her finger up stairs? A. She put it on her finger; I did not see it afterwards; I was about five minutes in her bed-room - I made no proposals to her; I only went to sell my goods; the officer saw the mark of the blow on my forehead - I did not kiss her; her clothes were not disordered when she came down. I swear there was a lock on the door, and it was locked. The officer went up and searched, but the ring was not found; she said I had given her the glass, having taken liberties with her, but I had not - it is against my Religion; she said she would look for my ring. I swear I never said to any body, that the ring might have rolled away, and the servant got it.</p>

I went up stairs - she wished to go before a Magistrate, and we went; I did not examine to see if there was a lock on the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what state was she? A. Her hair was loose, and her bosom open, and when we were up stairs she pointed to the bed, which was tossed about, and stated, before his face, that he had taken liberties with her.</p>

I saw the two prisoners take the pigs from the bottom of our garden, which is about a quarter of a mile from her premises, on Wednesday, the 7th of November; I saw them driving them among the bushes: some persons were coming up, and they left them - they returned again, took the pigs out, and drove them away, across Wanstead-flat, towards the Rabbits public-house, in the Ilford-road; they then crossed the road, and went on to Plaistow; I followed them, and in Plaistow I got an officer, and gave charge of them - they were both driving the pigs.</p>

            . I am an officer. Hatchard spoke to me, and I went and overtook the prisoners; Brown was then driving the pigs; Flynn was walking on the pavement, just abreast of him; I went up to Brown, and asked if they were his pigs - he said No; I asked if they were for sale; he said No, but that was his master (pointing to Flynn), who had employed him to drive them. I then asked Flynn if they were his pigs - he said, "Yes, Sir;" I said, "Are they for sale?" he said No: I said, "I suppose you are driving them to town?" he said, "Not quite to town;" he then made a stop at a shop, and pointed to something, as if inquiring the price - he came out again, and crossed the road; I crossed too, but he did not see me: he then went on, and turned up a street. I then went and took them. There was a sow and two store pigs, which Mrs. Hargrave claimed.</p>

            . I live near Mr. Weaver. I saw the prisoner and another person carrying a piece of beef, about one hundred yards from his shop; they walked slowly, and stared at me; I think the prisoner had the beef. The prosecutor came up in about four minutes, and I assisted in pursuing the prisoner - he was secured; the other got away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had lived with Mr. Haddon, and had been up to Sloane-square, to see a young man; as I was coming back a young man was walking with this beef, and he asked me to hold it while he went into a house: we walked on, and the prosecutor came and took me - I started when I heard it was stolen. The other man stood talking with them. I had time to get away if I had chosen.</p>

They were not due; I paid him 3s.; I did not give him leave to keep these sums for wages; he had been but sixteen days with us; I authorised him to go and sell twelve quarts of peas, and bring the money to me, not to pay his wages; I never had the money - Mr. Bland's mother was not at the house - she lives in the country - there was an execution in the house, but the peas had not been seized - the officer saw me send them out.</p>

I said No; but she urged it, saying, "Do come - I'll treat you with any thing you like for your kindness." I went, and had a glass of peppermint, and she a glass of gin - we came out; she asked me to have something else. I said I would rather not; she said she found herself perfectly well, and I must go and have something else.

I took out my purse, took out a sovereign, and got change. I put the change into my purse, drew the ring down on my money, and put it into my pocket again; when we had drank the beer, I told her to take up her money again; we came out together, and she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060058"/>said, "Will you see me home?"

I pursued her a little way. I then went to a public-house, and found a constable. I described her to him - she was taken next morning; the purse and six sovereigns were found.</p>

            . I am a constable. Hopkins described the prisoner to me. I found her next morning at No. 23, Tothill-street. I told her I took her for taking seven sovereigns from a man last night."Poh! poh! nonsense" said she, and wanted to push by me - she got a few yards off; I seized her, and called on Hopkins, who said, "That is the woman, I will swear to her;" she then said "It is all right, I have taken care of it for him," and said, she would go with me, and show me where they were. I wanted to search her, but she said her husband knew nothing about it, and I did not. I went with her to her friend's house, where she said she had left them; she said, on the road, that she had got four sovereigns in her stocking. I made her let it down, and give me them out - they were in this purse; when we got to her friends, we found two more, which she said she had left there.(Purse produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Kensington; the prosecutor offered me his arm, I was ill; he asked me to drink, and wanted to go home with me. I said, I could not, as my husband was at home; he then gave me the purse, which I believe he thought had only got the change of the sovereign in it. I went home, and on finding what was in it, I left the two sovereigns with a friend, and gave up the others.</p>

I said, "What the d - l are you about?" and missed my money directly. I charged her with it - she said, "Oh! my dear, if you are fond of going to the watch-house, you shall go."

            . I am an officer. About nine o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoner, with two others, go up to Mr. Browne's shop; a young man was cleaning the windows; one of them went by the side of the ladder, as if to take his attention. The prisoner and another, who he called Frank, immediately ran off towards Drury-lane; I suspected they had something, and followed them to an archway, where I seized the prisoner, and called out some name, to make them think I had somebody at hand; he called out, "Frank, muzzle him," and he immediately attacked me - he was fighting me all the way down to the Coal-yard; I saw a door open, pushed him in, and left him in charge of the man of the house, while I went after the other, but he got away; it was Frank who took the shawl, and put it into his hat - but under the archway he took it out, and was showing it to the prisoner; I seized it: the prisoner was at the doorway with him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up Holborn, and fell in company with Frederick Bentley and James Rush; I asked where they lived - they said they had nothing to do; that they had been out two nights, and had a good mind to steal something to get a lodging; Rush took the shawl - they ran, and I followed, fearing I should be taken; he was showing it to Bentley, by the gateway.</p>

I went in, and saw Ball sawing up the harrows; I touched him, and said, "Samuel, I am sorry for you." Here is the piece he was cutting; I then called in Brown; we took Ball and the harrows; I am positive they are master's - I saw them making, and used them many times about the farm.

            . I am cook and housekeeper to Mr. Salisbury; the prisoner was in the same service; soon after he came into the service, he asked me if master had not been accused of an unnatural crime - I told him the report had been so, but I did not believe it; he said he had heard many such reports, and if he offered such a thing to him, he would make him repent it - he would make him pay for it; he said more than once, that he would make him pay for it; before he came into the service, which was on the 7th of July, (I think,) master had broken his arm, and went out of town in consequence of the accident; this conversation took place before he left town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did this conversation take place? A. I think three or four days after the prisoner came into the house - I am sure he did not come into the service before July; he remained in master's service till the 10th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did he go out of town in company with the prosecutor? A. I do not know - I have been with master nearly three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with him at the time of the present charge? A. No - I lived with him four years, two years ago. and then left him - I returned in July, the prisoner and I both came the same night - I was aware such a charge had been previously made against master - I had left on account of ill-health - I did not inform master, or any body, of the conversation I had with the prisoner - I was first told to come here and give evidence, the day before yesterday - I know nothing of the bill being found in September.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a word from your master, or any body, about your coming here, before last Tuesday? A. Not positively; master broke his arm on the 11th of June, I believe - I called there a few days after accidentally; and heard he wanted a servant - I had called many times since I had left him, and he had spoken to me about coming again, but I was in service; when he left town I do not know where he went; he left town with the prisoner more than once - I cannot say how many times: my master first told me I was to come here - I have not been examined by his attorney.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you not examined by some gentleman previous to coming here? A. I was asked a few questions - I do not know whether it was taken down.</p>
               <p>RICHARD ANTHONY SALISBURY. I am in the sixty-eighth year of my age, and live at No. 18, Queen-street, Edgware-road. Some years ago I was accused by a person of an attempt to commit an unnatural offence upon him - I was not brought to trial; the man's name was Tomes. About the middle of June last I broke my arm in three places, and crushed my hip - I could not turn in bed for some weeks - I keep two men servants, but at that time I had but one; he was going to leave, and I wanted additional assistance - I had seen the prisoner repeatedly before that, working in the garden of Mr. Jenkins, in the New-road, where I was in the habit of buying plants: knowing the prisoner there, I engaged him; he brought me a written character, which I knew to be true, from other circumstances; he had before that applied to me, to recommend him to another situation, and, in consequence of my accident, I engaged him for four months positively, and said, if the situation suited him, I would do something more for him - I was labouring under the effects of my indisposition all this time, and required the constant attendance of a man servant, and now I can put on my braces, but cannot button them, or my shirt, my nerves are so paralysed - I shall never have the full use of my hands again - I left town, and took the prisoner with me, not only for assistance for myself, but for recreation for him, and to introduce him to the gardens - I went to Maldon Wells, to the Well's House, which is an hotel; the prisoner went with me; this was in September. On Sunday morning, the 9th of September, I went up into my bed-room, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and to my surprise, I found him dressed for travelling, when I expected to find him in his usual morning jacket - I expressed my surprise, and he said, "Sir, to be plain with you, I must be off; if you will give me 50l. I will go off to Liverpool, and never give you any more trouble, but if you do not, I will accuse you of an unnatural crime."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he explain, whether Liverpool was the end of his journey? A. Not at that time; I told him he was a villain, to go to hell, and leave my presence; he immediately left the room - I was sick, and a full hour before I recovered myself - I then went down, and inquired after him; he was not to be found; I sent all my servants to seek him - I did not see him again at Maldon - I was at that time in my usual morning dress: when I put on my coat and waistcoat I found a letter in my waistcoat pocket (looking at one) - this is it; it was in the pocket of my dinner dress clothes - I can swear it is his handwriting - I had opportunities of seeing him write before - I travelled post all night, and arrived in town on Monday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060062"/>- I drove to an hotel, and next day went to my residence in town, but I went to consult my attorney as soon as I came to town - I did not sleep at home till next night; my servant presented me with this letter (looking at it) the morning after I slept in town; the direction does not look like the prisoner's writing, but the contents I have no doubt are his; I had gone to my house early on Tuesday morning, and laid down, and got up at eight o'clock; I went to Bow-street on Monday night, about the letter I received at Maldon, and then again on Tuesday, about this other letter. I remember going home on Wednesday night, the 12th of September, in company with my servant Scott; when we got to Queen-street, the watchman was going past ten o'clock; I told Scott to stop and get something, which he did; and, while I was walking by myself, I saw the prisoner; he came over the street to me, and immediately said, "Will you give me the 50l.?" I said, "Go along with you, villain! I will hold no converse with you"- I was alarmed, and the watchman was at a distance - I retreated, and saw Scott coming - I then went on, wishing to get into my own house - the prisoner came up again, and said, "If you will not give me the 50l. I will accuse you of an unnatural crime; but if you will, I will be off to Dublin, and you shall hear no more of it" - he said this in a very loud, menacing, passionate tone, the last time, but not the first - Scott was close behind me the last time, and there was a man named Smith there, I did not know him at that time, but he was coming the other way - I think he must have heard the words Morton uttered - he might have been heard across the street - I said I would give him in charge; he took to his heels, and ran down Seymour-place, and I rushed into my own house - I afterwards consulted Mr. Adams; he thought fit to get an indictment, and we went and got the bill - Mr. Smith left his address; we wrote to him, but he was not to be found then; we had a warrant against the prisoner before this: I employed people to search diligently for him; I left the business with my attorney - he was taken a long time afterwards. I had a letter from an attorney, named Woolley before he was taken. I attended at Bow-street on Saturday, the 10th of October, to identify the prisoner, but he was not there - I attended again on a Monday, in November, and saw him - I had in the mean time been in communication with the Magistrates at Bow-street, as so to attend them if I was wanted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say the prisoner was taken a long time after you obtained the warrant; on your oath, was he taken at all, or did he surrender? A. He did not surrender; Smith took him into custody; he is an officer, and got the warrant from the other officers - I found the bill in September - I had a warrant before that; and another after finding the bill - the Magistrate gave it to Taunton, and he let Smith have it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do not you know the warrant never was executed? A. No; I did not desire it should not be executed - I know he was taken on the Monday - I do not believe that he voluntarily surrendered to the charge - there was an appointment made by Woolley, his attorney, to meet me there, but whether he came in custody I do not know - I did not see him come - I believe he was there before me - I did not see him till he was in the office - I believe he was in custody, but I do not know the forms of the place - I went to the Portugal hotel, Fleet-street, on coming to town - I did not sleep there, or sleep at all, I was so agitated - I passed the night partly at the hotel and partly walking up and down, and at five o'clock in the morning I got home - I had not spent much time at the hotel - I went to Bow-street on the Monday evening; I got to town about twelve o'clock on Monday morning, then went to consult my attorney, and went to Bow-street at seven o'clock in the evening, when they met - I staid there an hour at least.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to from Bow-street office? A. I am not certain; I went to a public-house opposite - I do not know the sign - I am a gentleman, living on my fortune - I have some times been in a common public-house- I took some coffee, and remained there perhaps half an hour - Scott was with me; he did not take coffee with me; I will not swear that - I walked homeward after that - I continued to walk homewards till twelve o'clock; it might be nine before I left the public-house - I walked up and down Portman-square - I had my reasons for not going home; I was unhappy, and walking relieved me; I was relieved in some degree at twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go home at twelve o'clock? A. I did not choose it - I was unhappy, and went meditating; I was in a nervous frame of mind: that is the only reason I give for not returning home - I felt no inclination to go home - Portman-square is near my residence, but I walked up and down Edgware-road till five o'clock, and then went home - I was better at five o'clock, but not much - Scott left me in the street, I cannot recollect the precise place, probably near some of the streets turning from Oxford-street, before I got to Portman-square - he might leave me about nine o'clock, I cannot say - I paced the square several times - I got home at five o'clock; I have always the key of the area-gate - all my servants were in bed when I got home - Scott and the female servant were in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go home then? A. Because I chose; my mind was materially relieved.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not directed by your attorney to go home as fast as you could? A. He might - the prisoner came into my service early in July - I once told him when I saw him at Jenkins' nursery, that I knew a situation that would suit him - I do not recollect telling him what situation it was - I had seen him at the nursery frequently before I told him this, and he had applied to me two or three times before I hired him, for a gardener's place - I swear that he was not an acquaintance of mine - I had seen him there, and I have recommended gardeners to some of the best places in the kingdom.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he introduced himself to you? A. He had come and asked me the name of plants repeatedly - he was told I was a botanist - all the men at Jenkins' know that; when he asked me to get him a situation, I said I would if I could, and about a fortnight before I hired him myself, I told him I knew of a situation which would just suit him - I do not know that I told him whose place it was; on the 6th of July I went to Jenkins', and told him I would take him myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him that was the situation you spoke of? A. No, but I had seen him a handy clever fellow. I said he would have to take care of the plants in my courtyard, and do a great deal in the house besides, and I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060063"/>give him all the instruction in my power; that his wages would be 40l. a year, and if he behaved well, they should be 50l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, that after your decease, he would be provided for? A. I told him, at my decease, all my servants would have a sum left them, if they had continued a year with me, which, by my will they are entitled to; he told me he was in a destitute situation. I said he should have 5l. in advance, and he had a sovereign of it. I cannot recollect telling him he should have 5l. that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him you had a woman making a silk waistcoat for him? A. That was afterwards. I did tell him so - he wished to have one like mine; it was soon after he came, because he had not clothes to appear in - he had clothes of every description made for him. I ordered a blue coat for him when he came into my service, He brought some plants home to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he brought them into your parlour, did you not tell him to try on the silk waistcoat? A. I cannot tell - there were two silk waistcoats; which do you mean?</p>
               <p>Q. Which did he try on when he came to you with plants, as the servant of a market-gardener? A. That was the blue one.</p>
               <p>Q. On that occasion did you give him 5l.? A. I believe I might. I do not know whether I gave him the first or second - he had 10l. in advance. I have no garden at my house - there are between two and three hundred plants in pots; every upper servant I have had used to take care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me the name of one? A. The last man I had turned out insane; James Crawley, who is now with Lord Foley used to take care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 13th of July, did you give the prisoner a brooch? A. Yes, a very handsome one, similar to one I have here - they are called diamonds, but I believe they are not. I did not give him a chain, seals, and key - they were to be deducted from his wages - the brooch was a gift. I let him have an old coat of mine in July - it was too small, but he wore it a few days till another was made for him. I went to Seven Oaks in company with him, in my own carriage, as my servant and companion, his behaviour was such, I treated him with uncommon kindness.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not pass him off at Seven Oaks as your intimate friend? A. No; but he was a very amusing man; he would tell several stories like Denisan, in the Arabian Nights; that was not entirely the reason I took him in my carriage, for he had the tooth-ache very bad, and he is an incomparable mimic, he can take you or any body off; he said, "Will you allow me to amuse you, by seeing how I can behave myself like a gentleman." I took him to the Duke of Dorset's garden, and took his arm there, as I was lame, and wanted assistance; we did not go into the gardens - we walked round. I wanted assistance to walk up the hills in the Duke's park.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he equally serviceable to drink punch with you? A. Yes; I passed him off as my friend at the Crown Inn - we slept in a double bedded room there, at his particular desire - no infirmity of mine made it necessary; the reason he assigned was, that he should be ready to assist me.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath you have taken, (it is my duty to ask), after taking your tea and punch, and retiring at that inn, did you not ask him to come into your bed? A. Never, never, nothing like it. I never said any thing about*****, nor had we any conversation about women on that journey, I am quite sure; he was particularly delicate with me, and never talked on any b-w-dy subject, nor did I to him - it is all an invention of his own. I missed some rings when I arrived in London, in August, and wrote to him on the subject. I addressed him "J. Morton, Esq." to indulge his whim and frolic, at his request, and because I had represented him as my intimate friend. I have repented it but once since. I do not recollect telling him I had made an Esquire of him, and would do more for him yet; I believe I did take him to the Bank with me in August - he might go. I did not tell him he was to do all my business for me. I said he might have to do business - we went to Blackwall together - I fed him on white-bait, and we had punch together. I bought him a gold ring - I do not recollect whether it was the same day, or what I gave for it. I told him at first that I would make him look like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the 4th of September, order him to come to town to buy a gold keeper? A. Yes; I went to Mr. Walker's, but could not get one. I bought silk stockings and gloves. I do not recollect whether he went arm-in-arm with me. I went to Worcester with him about the 5th of September; the carriage was at my door at nine o'clock, and the prisoner was told to get up behind, and he got inside at Kensington - it was his wish. I did not take Scott that day as he was ill, and thought he might be unwell on the road - his going was talked of. I do not know whether I told him why I did not take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on that occasion give the prisoner 25l.? A. Yes, to pay for the journey. I do not recollect how much it was - I will not swear it was not 25l. I did not tell him the cheaper he travelled, the better, as he should have the rest when he got there, or that if he got off a large portion of the expences, I would put the rest in the Saving-bank for him. I travelled on to Oxford, and met Dr. Williams, a professor of botany - I did not introduce the prisoner to him as a young gentleman fond of botany, but as a young man fond of gardening and botany; I do not believe I introduced him as a gentleman - I might, I will not swear I did not. I did tell Dr. Williams I and my companion were on a botanical tour; we had a double bedded room at Woodstock, at his desire. I got a medical mixture for him at the next house, and it relieved him; he said he had an eruption in his shoulder - I told him he must rub it - I did not see him do it; I was in the same room, but the curtain was drawn - I swear I did not see him use it; he was in the arm-chair by the side of his bed - I was on the other side of the room, and in bed. I did not see him naked - he always saw me in bed before he undressed - I had supper and punch with him. I never went by a different name on my travels with him - I know nothing of the name of Malcolm - my family name is Markham; I had 10,000l. to change it, and have the King's sign manuel to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the landlady your name was Markham? A. He wished it to be done. I am acquainted with the classics - I have read Virgil, in Latin, and Homer, in Greek - I recited passages to him, and he began to learn Latin; I have heard him lessons. I have been charged with a similar offence before.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on the oath you have taken, before your Ma<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060064"/>ker, and as you shall answer it before your Maker, did you ever, at Woodstock, Oxford, or any other place, take any indecent liberties with the prisoner, when you slept in a double bedded room? A. Never.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was he to be your servant out of livery? A. Yes - I let him have these things because he was not fit to be seen; the clothes were to be deducted from his wages. I made him these presents at his desire; he wished to appear a gentleman, and to dress like me; I never introduced him to any individual as my companion, nor took him to any party of friends, as my equal; he always waited on me as my servant, but when we were alone this familiarity took place. On our journey to Seven Oaks and Maldon I had 250l. about me, and he said it would be safer by sleeping in a double bedded room, and he wanted me to buy pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you walked the street in great agitation - had you not been out of bed two nights? A. Yes - I went in at five o'clock, and went to bed. I left the warrants to my attorney, and left word with the Magistrate where I might be found at any time. I was never out of the way, but was always ready to meet this, and the former charge. I went to Bow-street, expecting to meet the prisoner and Woolley.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How often had you seen him write? A. Repeatedly, in the house - he has written copies and bills, and several verses, which he took down; I swear both letters are his writing - part of the second letter is in pencil, but it is all his.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were any proceedings taken against you, on the receipt of the first letter? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were there never any proceedings from any person on his behalf? A. Yes, from a man named Barton - that was shortly after the receipt of the first letter.</p>
               <p>The letters being read were as follows: -(First Letter.) Holywell House, September 9, 1827.</p>
               <p>SIR - I have to let you know that, owing to the treatment I have received from you since I left London, I am compelied to take an opportunity of vindicating my character, and declaring your guilt to the world at large. I leave here with the intention of proceeding to London, and from thence to a gentleman's residence, who will vindicate my cause; you may depend on hearing from me, by letter, on your arrival in London, until which time I intend to exercise my faculties to the utmost, in making an appeal to the tribunal of justice of my country, where I doubt not I shall have justice done me. As I cannot consent to s-d-y being committed on my person, I find it useless stopping longer in your service.</p>
               <p>I am your injured Servant, J. MORTON.</p>
               <p>N. B. I intend to prosecute as far as the law of my country will allow, so that you have very little to expect, and the sooner you proceed to London the better for you.(Second Letter.)</p>
               <p>SIR - If you will send a certain person 50l. as soon as you return, he will go directly to Dublin: you will repent if you do not. Your sincere Friend.</p>
               <p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Salisbury, and have been so from the 5th of August - the prisoner was there before me; he and master went to Maldon. On Monday, the 10th of September, I saw the prisoner, when he returned - I did not expect to see him alone; I went to him afterwards, (in consequence of a person calling on me,) to a public-house opposite our house, and saw him; I said I was surprised to see him, and asked where master was; he said he had left him at Worcester; I said, "How so?" he said, master intended to discharge him as soon as he came to London, and he thought he would take the opportunity first, so he had written a letter, and left him; he then gave me his address, and told me if master gave me any money, I should know where to bring it to him, but I was not to let master, or any body else, know his address. On Tuesday morning, the 11th, I went into the front area, and picked up a letter, which I took to master, and he read it; I went to the milkman's in two or three hours, and saw the prisoner there, taking brandy and water with the milkman; he told me he was very sorry for what he had done, and did I think master would take him back again - I said I did not know, he had better see master himself; master went to get a warrant against him that night; I saw master in the street on the Wednesday night, and saw the prisoner there: master was at the Portugal hotel - I went to meet him. I was returning with him, about ten o'clock - I was a few yards behind him, and saw the prisoner walking backwards and forwards before the house; I recollect seeing the witness Smith; the prisoner went up to master, and asked him for 50l.; master said, "Go along you villain - I will have nothing to do with you;" the prisoner went away a few yards and came up again, and said, "If you don't give me 50l. I will charge you with an unnatural crime; and not leave you a feather in you cap, and if you give me the money I will be off to Liverpool, and you shall hear no more of me;" my master called out Watch! and the prisoner made his escape down Seymour-place, and I saw him no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What, did your master go to the Portugal hotel on the 12th? A. Yes; that was not the night he came home; I went home the night he came home; I did not go to the office with him on the 1st instant - it was Tuesday night - he went home after he had been to the Police-office; I do not know what time he left the office - he went straight home - I was with him, and walked home with him; I cannot tell what time he got home; I think I was at home by ten o'clock; I am certain we were at home before twelve - I went in at the area gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you were not in bed and asleep when your master came home? A. Yes; we went to no public-house, or coffee-shop, as we went home - we did not take tea or coffee together that night, I am sure. The milkman's name is Webber; When I went into master's service, his arm was broken, and in a sling.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he capable of walking for eight hours, without being fatigued? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoner after his return, did not he say his master had taken indecent liberties with him? A. No; nor did he say so at the milkman's - I do not recollect his saying any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never heard of such a thing before? A. No farther than what the prisoner said when he came, and what the housekeeper said. I gave evidence at Bow-street - I do not recollect when I was told to come here.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. When you first saw your master, what time was it? A. About the middle of the day, on Tuesday.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live at No. 33, Mitre-street, New-cut. On the evening of the 12th of September I was in Queen-street. I saw three persons in a scuffle, as I imagined, and heard Watch! called - it was about the middle of the street; I crossed, and saw a man run away, saying at the same time, "If you don't give me the money, you shall repent it:" this was a little after ten o'clock; I should not know the man; I went up, and saw Mr. Salisbury was one of the persons there; the observation appeared to be addressed to him - I did not know him before - he went into No. 18; I have had no intercourse in the way of trade with him; I left my address, as I was requested; I was not before the Grand Jury, as I was absent, and the bill was found before I returned. I called at Mr. Salisbury's, and received a subpoena to attend last Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far were you from the person? A. Within two or three yards - I had not seen the prisoner before; my address was asked of me by the footman.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what age and appearance was the person who ran away? A. About the size and appearance of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was in Holborn, and saw the prisoner passing and repassing in front of this shop; I crossed the road, and got behind a cabriolet: I then saw him in the shop, drawing the flannel to him; he whipped away with it, and ran down Southampton-buildings - I am certain of his person - I knew him well before; I followed, but lost sight of him; I stopped, took the flannel from the shopman, and went down to where he lived, but did not find him there; I found him at eleven o'clock that night, at a public-house in Chick-lane. I took him to another public-house, in Snowhill, and told him I wanted him for a roll of flannel; he denied it, and said I was wrong. I took him to the shop, and he then said he had done it through distress, and that his mother lay dying.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever say to any body, that it was in consequence of the way you was treated on the trial, that you preferred this bill? A. Not, to the best of my recollection. I think the Grand Jury were discharged on the Wednesday, and I believe it was in the early part of the day; he was discharged from here - I took him up the night after the Sessions; I could not get the copy of the indictment to prefer the bill on Tuesday. I went from here to Mr. Stafford, who made out the bill, and I went before the Jury - I could not force them to have the bill; I told Mr. Clark I had preferred another bill, but the prisoner had been discharged on the evening he was tried. I think they told me he was discharged an hour after the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to one of the prisoner's relations, that you preferred the second bill because you considered yourself ill-treated on the last trial, by his counsel? A. No - that I swear positively; I never said so, I swear positively, to any body, nor any thing like it; nor did I swear I knew him to be a boy of bad character.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that Sir

             let the prisoner out on bail, saying it was the most scandalous thing he ever heard? A. I can vouch safely, if I was to die before I moved, I never knew he was out on bail till yesterday. Phillips appeared on the last trial.</p>
               <p>JESSEE PHILLIPS re-examined. Q. When did you hear the prisoner was to take his trial to-day? A. I heard nothing about it till I was sent for this morning, about twenty minutes past nine o'clock. I never knew any thing against the prisoner. Whittingham did not, to my knowledge, say on the last trial, that he knew the prisoner to be a bad character - he knew Wells to be so; to the best of my belief he did not say so of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you in the habit of walking with this officer at night? A. Yes - to detect persons of this description.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to WILLIAM WHITTINGHAM. Q. Is the street-keeper here? A. No, nor the watch-house-keeper. I believe his Lordship told me on the last trial I ought to have had them here. The Jury did not request that I should not have my expenses - on the contrary, they desired I should have them, and I had two days allowed me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. Yes, upwards of seven years. I am a broker, and live at No.29, Great St. Andrew-street. I was one of his bail, for 50l.</p>
               <p>- WILLIAMS. I am the prisoner's sister. I never saw Whittingham till I went to him, to inquire where my brother was - that was when he was in Newgate last time; I saw Whittingham the night he took him the second time, directly after: he said he was ordered by Mr. Sergeant Arabin to find another bill, and he was compelled to do it by his conscience. Phillips said, "Bill, you can't lock him up;" he said, "I will take him - I am compelled to to take him;" Phillips said, "If you do, I am blowed if I appear against him, unless I am dragged - you see the lad is going to work." He had worked for his father, as a plasterer, before he was first taken, till within three weeks, and he was still at home till he was taken away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever hear the name of Wells? A. Not till my brother was taken. I saw him in Newgate when my brother was taken.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information I went on board a smack in the Thames, and saw the prisoner; I asked what he had done with the watch which he took from Aberdeen; he said he had taken no watch; I found this watch in his fob.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to WILLIAM MATTOCKS. Q. Can you swear I stole it? A. It is mine; he was only three days with me: he came from America.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought it of a shipmate who lodged in the house, a quarter of an hour before I came away. Witness. There were two lads lodged in the house; one of them came home drunk that night, and said, "Bill is off with the watch." The prisoner had not seen me use it; his shipmate could get to the room.</p>

I said, "I know you;" he has been in my shop before and taken things - I have cautioned him about it; he drew me to the street-door, and then I drew back; he took the basket out, but dropped the chesnuts about the street; he was taken on the Tuesday following - he lived a little way off.</p>

            . I live in Ram-alley, and am a willow-cutter; the prisoner has lodged with me for two years, and works for me. Last Sunday week, at the time this robbery is charged, he was in bed; I will swear before God, my maker, I roused him up myself at eight o'clock, and sent him to this very shop for a pint of beer - I did not send him there, but her husband tells me he went there - he brought no basket back; I heard the clock strike eight, and then roused him, as I often do, for he is fond of sleep. I know the clock struck eight, but the husband told me he came a quarter before eight, and the woman said it was a few minutes to seven, which I know to be false - I counted the clock particularly that morning.</p>

I suspected by the prisoner's manner, that she had taken something; I turned round to her; she desired me to cut a yard off, which I did - I wrapped it in paper and gave it to her; she put down 1s., which I took to the desk and got change; I took it to her, then told her I suspected she had taken some ribbon, and desired her to come to the end of the shop; I asked if she would let me look under her shawl, and there I found this half piece of ribbon - it has my writing on it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the evening of the 1st of November he asked me to mind the shop, which I did - he went into the yard, and in a quarter of an hour brought in some water, and sprinkled the shop; he went into the yard again for about a quarter of an hour, then returned, and began to shut up; he appeared much agitated, and could only put up three shutters - he then left without finishing - I put up other shutters; he had began to shut up about a quarter-past ten o'clock - he did not go away till about eleven. I saw a pair of shoes in his trousers pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did not he appear very ill? A. No; he went into the yard twice - I saw the shoes quite plain.</p>

I took the prisoner in charge on the Friday following, and asked what he had done with the shoes - he seemed much agitated, and began crying; he said they were at his lodgings, but he meant to pay for them.

            . I am in partnership with Thomas Wasp; I heard of this circumstance; the prisoner has worked for us some years; he had permission, about three weeks before, to take a pair of shoes for his wife; he brought them back, saying they would not do, and he would make a pair - I told him to do so, and not take any more, as we did not like it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not a fresh quantity arrived on this night? A. Yes; he might find a pair to fit her among them - his character has been excellent.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN to MRS. GILL. Q. Had you authorised him to pawn any of this property? A. No; I know he has a wife and one child - I never allowed him to pawn any article - I did not take him when he gave me up the duplicate, as I thought I could get my property; but they would not give it up - he slept in my house that night, and next morning I said to him, "You will go and point out the property at the pawnbrokers," and when he got out he ran away, and was not taken till November. I am very sorry, indeed, to prosecute him.</p>

On the 18th of November the prisoner and another person came in, and had liquor and porter, and about two o'clock the other went down stairs, and came up again. The prisoner then went down; I had some suspicion, as I had seen them there a fortnight before, and told mistress of it - I then heard a rush out at the door; I directly looked, and missed the boots; I went out, and saw the prisoner running with them - he threw them away and I stopped him, without losing sight of him.</p>

In September last I was working at the Victualling-office, at Deptford; on the 3d of September, and for three weeks after, I was backwards and forwards there, and could not so well attend to my property at home - when I came home to remain, I missed property to a considerable amount - I called my servants together, and questioned them. William Dixon was one of them - he was my stable-boy - he afterward told me he had taken some things away - in consequence of information I went with Westcoatt to the prisoner's shop; he deals in marine-stores, in Gee's-court, Oxford-street; it is a paved court, with flat stones - I saw the prisoner, and said we had come to look for pipe-moulds and other brass which I had lost, to a considerable amount; he said he had no such things<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060075"/>in his possession; I said, "If you have not, you had them, for the boy has acknowledged it;" he said, "I don't object to your searching; I know nothing of it;" we searched, and found nothing of mine - I said, "Mr. Barker, you you must know something of these moulds, for my boy states he sold them to you and your man, Jackson, and as you deny it, I will send for the boy;" he said I might send for who I pleased - Dixon was fetched - I said to him, in the prisoner's presence, "Do you know this gentleman?" he said, "Yes;" I said, "What did you sell him?" he said he sold him three pairs of brass moulds, and he got 8s. for the first, and 6s. a pair for the others, at the rate of 4d. a lb; we are allowed 2s. 4d. or 2s. 8d. a lb. for them as old brass, in exchange - old broken brass is worth 7 1/2d. a lb. - the prisoner said he knew nothing about it, he never saw him before - I told the boy to look about and see if there was any thing of mine; he went out and looked in at the window, and pointed out these five bells; I directly claimed them - I knew them, by having mounted them for my little boys; they were marked with ink - I had twenty-four, twelve in each parcel - here is the writing on some of them, it is my hand-writing - but it is very faint and nearly rubbed off, but they are a particular sort of bells - I can swear to this, No. 4, being my own writing - I said I could swear to them - the prisoner said, "When am I to go to the office?" the officer said, "Directly;" I saw several other things there, which I think were mine, but would not swear to them - we took him to the watch-house; Dixon said it was false for the prisoner to say he did not know him, for he had seen him many a time - the prisoner still said he had never seen him: Dixon said,"Did not I sell you one pair of moulds at 4d. a lb.?" he said, "Never - how could you sell them? I never saw you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long has Dixon lived with you? A. Nearly eighteen months - the bells are not worth more than 1s. 6d. as old metal; I searched the prisoner's premises the day after I discovered my loss; I never suspected Dixon before - he denied the robbery, but confessed it in about three hours, voluntarily - I had said I would send for an officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you missed these bells? A. No; I had seen them about two months before - there are twenty-four gone.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The boy went outside the window to point out the bells? A. Yes; any one passing could see them - the prisoner afforded us every facility to search - I had been about an bour in the shop before Dixon came.</p>

On the evening of the 30th of October Couche, my shopman, spoke to me; the prisoner was then in my shop, looking at some striped twilled cotton - I observed her; she made a purchase, and paid for it: she was then going towards the door; I stopped her, and stated that I suspected she had more about her person than belonged to her - she remonstrated, and said her name was Polland or Pollock; I stated more particularly then what I suspected, and offered to search her - she did not appear at all inclined to submit to it: she said it was impossible she could have done such a thing; I then sent for my housekeeper to search her; I talked of sending for an officer - she said, "You need not do that - I will give you what you want;" she then put her hand under her dress, and drew out this piece of cotton; she put her hand through what I suppose was her pocket-hole, but I cannot say whether she put her hand into her pocket - she drew out this cotton - it was rather loose; she had a shawl on: it is an article of the same description and colour as what she bought, but it is finer; she had the piece she had bought in a paper in her hand - she had got about six feet from the counter before I spoke to her. I saw a number of pieces of calico on the counter while she was bargaining, but I cannot say I saw this piece in particular - I am sure I had seen it a few days before; here is our shop mark on it, made by Price, my partner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Where is what she bought? A. Here it is. She has been bailed before Sir John Bailey; the piece she bought is of more value than this; there were twelve or fourteen people in the shop - none of them are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not tell you that if she had it, it must be quite a mistake - she was incapable of such an act? A. She said she was incapable of such an act; I do not know that she said it was a mistake; she said she had bought things of me before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she not the week before laid out 13l. or 14l. at your shop, and your porter taken the goods home? A. I cannot speak to that; I am out of the shop half my time - a Mrs. Poland laid out as much.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When she said she was incapable of such an act, did you know she had this cotton about her? A. No.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors'. - The prisoner came and asked me for red twilled cotton; I showed her a wrapper, containing a great many pieces - she was a considerable time at the counter, and I noticed her unpin her shawl, which was pinned high up, and pin it down low; she then asked the price of another piece, which was at a distance, and I noticed something drawn off, and the heap shrunk; she then paid me 4s. 4 1/2d. for the piece she bought. I told Mr. Petherbridge what I saw - he spoke to her; she had then arisen to go, and had got about six yards from the counter. Mr. Petherbridge took her into the back warehouse; I heard him before that say he had reason to suspect she had got more than she had paid for; she said, "Oh! I am incapable of such an act - I am Mrs. Polland (or) Pollock," or some such a name; Mr. Petherbridge said he would have her searched by a female, and send for an officer - she then put her hand into her pocket-hole, drew out this piece of cotton, and said, "Do not send for an officer - I will make you any recompense you please."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you know her? A. No; I have not been there more than two months - I cannot say whether she has bought things before: she gave the name of Poland at the office. She did not say our porter had carried goods home. She produced the cotton from her pocket-hole: the cotton is worth 2s. 11d. - it is much finer than what she bought.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was she sitting or standing when she altered her shawl? A. Sitting close to the counter.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol. On the 24th of November a watchman gave me information; I saw the prisoner in Well-street, Hackney, at night; when I got within one hundred yards of him, he called Watch! and when I got up to him I said, "Who called Watch?" he said, "I did;" I said, "Why?" he said, "Because some one called me." The watchman came up, and said, "This is the man I saw carrying the board;" he said he knew nothing about it. I went and searched his house, which is just by, and in his bed-room I found this piece of mahogany.</p>

On the 11th of November, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was returning home, having supped at Islington; the prisoner overtook me in the City-road, near the wall of the Vinegar-yard - he caught hold of my arm; I was rather startled, and told him to be off - he was quite a stranger. I kept walking on - he kept close to me, and said, "Will you stand something to drink?" I made no reply; he still followed me, and asked me again - he pretended to be quite drunk, but certainly was not so; he asked me if I would toss up for something to drink; I still walked on, and said, "No, Sir, I am not in the habit of tossing, or drinking with strangers;" and that I considered he had had enough; he then crossed Old-street-road, and again laid hold of me - he staggered; he asked me for something to drink - I told him to be off, and not insult me, and pushed him away; he said he did not intend to insult me, he knew I was a gentleman, and had plenty of money, I told him it was of no consequence, and told him to be off; he came up and tapped my trousers pocket, and again asked me to toss him to drink - he repeated the same question several times; I walked a little way further - he came and tapped my pocket again, said he knew I had plenty of money, and caught hold of my arm again - I pushed him away; he turned round, struck me in the eye and breast, and knocked me down - I called Watch! the watchman ran and caught him - he did not appear drunk; when he was taken, he said "It is all right watchman, come along Bob," meaning me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where had you been at Islington? A. Nearly opposite the new chapel, at Miss Plumbers. I considered myself sober - I had taken brandy and water. I had passed Fountain-place; I was sleeping at a coffee-house in Finsbury-market, as my mother's house was under repair; there are a great many bad women about the Vinegar-yard - I do not think he intended to rob me at all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you know any body in London? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you undertake to swear you did not drop your watch by accident at the tobacconist's? A. I do not recollect that I did; I swear it was in my pocket previous to missing it; I cannot say I did not put it inside my trousers instead of my fob; I took the other woman into custody; she was discharged after three examinations - I did not feel it taken; the tobacconist's is in Artillery-lane - I will not swear either of the girls took it; I have no mark on the watch - I know its appearance and the name; I swear positively it is mine - I put it into my fob, to the best of my belief - I find the prisoner bears an excellent character, and supports his father and mother.</p>

            . I sold this watch to Hoppe - I bought it of the prisoner, on Thursday, the 15th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening; he came to my house and asked four guineas for it - I gave three guineas and a half - I lived at No. 8, Goulston-square - I did not ask where he got it, nor did he tell me - I am certain he said nothing about it; I had bought watches of him before - he dealt in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give no reason for selling it? A. He said he would not sell it for that if he had not wanted money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where do you live now? A. At No. 95, Long-alley, Sun-street; I had lived in Goulston-square about twelve months - I am in the watch line - I often buy second-hand watches, without asking questions of people; I know I sold it for 4l. 15s. a day or two after; the officer desired me to attend at the office - I said there that I bought it of the prisoner - I can prove it by a gentleman, who is not here - his name is Emanuel Josephs - he is constantly in Wales, but comes to town once or twice a year; I told the officer directly that I bought it of the prisoner; he deals in jewellery, and sells at a stand; Josephs left town last Sunday week - I told the Alderman he could prove it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Levi.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he say Josephs was present when he bought the watch? A. Yes, and that he was in Wales; I believe I mentioned this before the Magistrate myself - he said he got 3l. 15s. in money, and 1l. in segars, for it; I afterwards went and took the prisoner - I asked if he knew anything of a watch which he had sold Levi - he said, "What Levi?" I believe I said,"Of Goulston-street;" he said, "Yes, I know - it is Levi the cloberer;" I asked if he had sold him a watch; he said No; but as I was taking him from Harrow-alley, where I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060085"/>found him, he said he had sold Levi several watches; and after the examination, he said he could not tell whether he sold that watch or not; he said at first that he recollected nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Thursday after the robbery a gentleman, named Smith, sold me a watch for 3l. 5s. and I sold it to Levi for 3l. 6s.; I had sold him several in a fair way of trade, but the watch produced is not the one I sold him: I would not sell one for 3l. 6s. which he could sell for 4l. 15s.</p>

I said Yes; they were on the bed - I went out and got an officer - we then went and took her and them.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor applied to me - I went with him to the house where I found the prisoner in the room; these trous were on the bed, very wet; the prisoner said she did know how they came there.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How came I to be acquitted from Bow-street for a whole week, and then taken again?</p>
               <p>DAVID GEORGE ALDERSON re-examined. There was sufficient evidence at first, and she was discharged; the prosecutor came again, and said the prisoner and her friends been abusing him very much, and Mrs. Earl would con forward; I then went and took the prisoner again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Blythe said he would take 12s. for the del but my husband could not get it, so I was taken again - my husband signed a paper at Bow-street - it was to be settled for 12s.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was any payment of 12s. to be made? There was no payment no promise, except that the office should not lose his expenses.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you to have the money? A. The officer to have it, and he did not part with the trousers till be g his pay.</p>
               <p>DAVID GEORGE ALDERSON re-examined. Q. What were you to have 12s.? A. No, my Lord; I did refuse give up the trousers - I said I had lost two days in looking after another girl, and I asked 7s. for the two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you a salary as an officer? A. I have only 2s. 6d. a night - I am a night officer - I am paid by people for what I do in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Halls aware of that? A. Yes, he is, my Lord - I took the other girl by the prosecutor's description- she was taken before the Magistrate, and denied knowledge of it, and went away about her business - Mr. Earl came and gave her evidence, and then the prisoner was taken again.</p>
               <p>Q. How comes it that 12s. was to be paid? A. That know nothing about; but after the prisoner was discharged I looked to the prosecutor for 7s.</p>
               <p>JURY to T. BLYTHE. Q. How came the sum to be 12s. A. Why, I did not know what the expenses might be; I said it might be 1l., I did not know - the prisoner's husband said, I must be as favourable as I could; and I said,"Bring what you can, only show yourself a man;" I did not then know what the officer's charge would be.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner pass my box in Plumbtree-street, with this saw under her shawl; I asked where she got it - she said it belonged to her husband, who was at the public-house - I found the prosecutor, who owned it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, she did not intend to steal the saw, but to return it to the prosecutor, expecting to get some liquor for it.</p>

I took two sovereigns and a half-sovereign from my fob, and 3s. or 4s. I handed her 3s.; I stooped to do something to my shoe, and then missed the money off the counter; I turned round, opened my pantaloons, and gave myself a shake, thinking I had not put it down, and it might be about me. I said to Hart,"It is very odd, my money is gone;" she said, "That is the man who took it;" she went to the door, and called a man, who called a constable, and he took the prisoner in charge; I laid my hand on his shoulder, and said "Kelly, give me my money, and go about your business;" he put his hand down to his shoe, took up a sovereign, and gave it to me; I said, "This won't do, I must have my money, or give you in charge;" he would not return it, and I gave him in charge; the constable found a sovereign, 2s. 6d. and 1s. in his pocket - he was intoxicated; and next morning, at the watch-house, when he came to himself, he confessed that the money was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you known him? A. I believe nearly two years; he is my countryman, and often went about with me - he could often have robbed me if he had chosen; he has sometimes taken care of my money for me; if he had not drank too much, he would not have deined taking it - I really think he would have returned it, when he came to himself - I do not think he intended to steal it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate so? A. I cannot say, but I told the whole truth; he said, that as he was putting it into his fob, it fell into his shoe, which was very likely the case.</p>

My sister asked him for it - he called us a very bad name, and knocked us down; they then all ran away; there were several persons there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know the other man's name is Adams? A. I think that is the name he gave at the watch-house - I am not sure. He was taken to the watch-house, and the officer let him go - I told the officer he took it off my neck, and I stated so at Worship-street, but he ran away just before he got there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not come next day and give up a shawl which you had lost? A. No, it was my sister who had lost that. The prisoner himself knocked me down, and called me a very bad name - my sister had gone up to him, and said, "Young man, give me that handkerchief - that is all I want;" he then called us a very bad name, and knocked us down - the other had beat my brother, but my brother never lifted his hand against him; he said it was of no use, there were so many of them; I was frightened - I said to the young man,"Pray don't beat my brother," and then he took the handkerchief from my neck; I had him in sight about ten minutes. I had a Jew and another person taken on the charge - I have heard the name of Reuben, but do not recollect whether that was the Jew's name.</p>
               <p>Q. And young Duff, who escaped? A. Yes - I had three taken altogether; I only swore to Duff at the office; I did not swear to Reuben. The Magistrate was not going to commit my brother to prison that I know of; he said something to my brother about it; he was never threatened to be committed before, that I know of; I know nothing of 4l. being left with any publican, nor did I go to any public-house about it. Duff was the one who beat my brother in the mouth - I swore positively to him, as positive as I do to the prisoner: it was not proved that he was a mile and a half from the spot.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose property was this? A. It belonged to my father. My husband is a bricklayer. I charged nobody with it but Early and the prisoner. I was at Worship-street; two other men were charged with assaulting us - they were a Jew, named Reuben, and a boy, whose name, I believe, was Duff; I said at first I thought Duff was the young man; the Magistrate said, thoughts would not do; I did not hear my sister-in-law swear against Duff - I was out of the room. I did not see Duff do any thing; I was senseless with the blow - I did not go to a public-house - I heard nothing about 4l. The prisoner knocked me down; my husband did not strike them, there were so many; the prisoner struck him before he struck me - they were round my husband about half an hour; there was no mob when I came to myself: he was ill-used about ten minutes before I was struck - I saw the blood come from him; my sister was knocked down first. The last blow I had was from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you besides a bricklayer? A. I have been taken up on suspicion of being what they call a resurrection man - the last time was about a year ago, and about a year before that - it was only twice, to my recollection; I will not swear I was not taken up four times; I will swear it was not five: I do not know what I was taken for the last time - I will not swear that; I am on my oath; it was for taking out some windows; the first time was for going through Bethnal-green church-yard - on suspicion of a robbery of a place being broken open, where I was at work. I do not recollect being taken up three times before - I have only been three times before a Magistrate - I once was under bail. I took up a man named Duff, but his father said his two sons were much alike, and the Magistrac did not commit him. The Magistrate said he had a great mind to commit me, because I did not swear to the two prisoners the third time. I would not swear to Duff after what his father said.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street day patrol. On the 6th of November I went with Russell to King-street. Spitalfields: he pointed out the prisoner to me, looking out of window; I made towards the house, and the prisoner put his head in; I went up to the room, and the door was fastened. I got a poker to open it, but seeing a loft over my head, I got up there, and saw the prisoner near the chimney.</p>

The prisoner came about half-past seven o'clock in the evening of the 30th of October, with this harness to sell: I was engaged, and told him to call next morning, at half-past eight or nine o'clock, which he did - I questioned him about it; he said he brought it from a stable in Gun-square; he said, "Will you buy it?" I said No, I should detain him - he begged to be let go, and while my wife was expostulating with me about keeping him, he escaped. I gave information at Worship-street; he said he had not stolen it, but another person stole it, and asked him to sell it for him.</p>

I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's shop, in St. John's-street, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, and take this parcel off the counter; I had seen three others with him before - he went on to Wilderness-row; I told a young man, who went and took him.</p>

I seized him, and said, "You are the man I want - you have robbed that house;" he said, "I have been buying pork." I turned to look for an officer, who was to have been there, but he was not come; I called Watch! several hackney-coachmen came up, and hustled and pushed me about; I was obliged to let Mountain go with his bag; they said he was no thief, and I should not hold him; he got away.</p>

I said, "Why, you have not left the door open?" he said, "No: I have been down stairs, and I put the chain up." Gook came in soon after; I said, "People say somebody has been out with some pork;" he said to French, "Do you know any thing of this?" he said No - he had not let any one in, and knew nothing about it; Gook said, "Do you know the ostler at the Black Horse" he said No; Gook said, "Henry Mountain I mean;" he replied, "I don't know any such person." Gook then took him into the parlour, and when my brother came home he attempted to take him away; French put himself into a fighting attitude, but Gook took him.</p>

            . I went to the house by appointment, but was rather too late; I asked French if he knew any thing about it; he said he did not, and that he did not know the ostler of the Black Horse, nor Henry Mountain; when Mr. Raper arrived he gave charge of him; he put up his hands,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060094"/>and said he would knock my bl - y head about; I presented the wrong end of my staff to him, and he thought it was a pistol; I took him to the office.

Between four and five o'clock on the 6th of December, I saw the prisoners driving this sow in Tower-street - I knew it to be the prosecutor's; I went up and asked Baron if it was for sale - he said it was, and asked 2l. 10s. for it: Crudgington was close by, and must have heard this; I offered 2l. - he hesitated, and then said I should have her, and asked where I lived; I said, in the Hackney-road - that I could not take her home then, but would call for her that evening or in the morning, and asked where I should find her; he said at Blakeway's, a pig-dealer, at Ratcliff-highway. I lodge with the prosecutor, and when I went home I told him; he and I went to Blakeway's next morning, and found it; we then went to the prisoners' premises, and they were not there - we left word that we had come to pay for the sow, and in a few minutes they came running down to Blakeway's, for the money, and were taken.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Luke's. On the morning of the 8th of November, about half-past ten o'clock, Harrison called and told me there had been a robbery; we went together to Cowheel-alley, Golden-lane, into a house, and while I was in the lower part, Harrison, who was up stairs, called me up; I went up, and saw the two prisoners on the top of the stairs; Harrison said, "Do you know any thing of these two men?" I said, "I do, open that door" - I put the prisoners into the room, and there we found all this property; I said, "This will do," and we went to take the prisoners into custody; they resisted, and Kilminster said, "We are only us four here together, take the things, and let us go" - I threatened to fire on them, if they resisted any more, but made them no promise - I said No,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060096"/>and handcuffed them together - Kilminster then undid his clothes, and pulled from round him this black silk gown - Kilminster then said to the other prisoner, "Turn out," and a shirt then dropped from one of them, but which, I cannot say - I thought, by his saying "Turn out," that there was some other things about him, but I only saw the shirt drop - I found in Stanley's hand a padlock and key - Harrison took the property, and I took the prisoners to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Reid. I was in the shop; the prisoner came in between two and three o'clock, and bought a pair of gloves; she came again about five, and asked for a pair of gloves out of the window, marked 7 1/2d.; she said, "I want another pair of gloves like what I had before;" they were the same sort as she had bought before. I got a packet of gloves out of the window - she was looking at them; I turned my head to the window, and in a moment, I saw her draw a pair from the pack, and put them under her shawl, quite tight under her arm. I said nothing to her till she had bought a pair and paid for them; I then charged her with it; she said they were what she had bought before - I took them from her; Mr. Reid heard the noise, and came into the shop - I do not know how many pair were missing from the pack; she did not deny having them, but said they were her's, before she produced them.</p>
               <p>MR. REID. She could not have left the shop, as there was another young man there; the gloves were tacked together.</p>

I live with Mr. Syren, a refiner; the prisoner came to the shop, on the 16th of November - I had seen him before; he brought some silver-cuttings to sell; I suspected him, and told him to call again, which he did. I had informed my master of it, and when he called, I asked his address; he said "Smith, No. 17, Mary-le-bone-street," and said he was a silver spoon maker; I detained the silver, and said I should inquire - he wished to take it away; he never came for it again. I inquired through the trade, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Are you certain he is the man? A. Yes; it was in the evening, but we had a gas-light.</p>

On the evening of the 25th of October, I was passing Mr. Savory's house, and saw the prisoner go off the curb, with his hat under his left arm - he pushed his hand through the window, and seized a bowl of gold coin; he ran across the road, and I after him; I saw him knock Finch down; Bradley caught hold of him - we took him into the shop - I went out, and picked up seven gold coins, and some pieces of gold - I found this bowl and a ribbon, and the prisoner's hat in the street; I was not then aware that any thing was in his hat. but one hundered and eighty-one coins were found in it, and nine in all were found in the street.</p>

               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - Were my own feelings my guide on this melancholy occasion, I should intrude a sentiment that would trespass upon your valuable time; but, being advised by my most anxious friends, I beg your attention to my present unhappy feelings. I assure you, Gentlemen, that to account a reason for my conduct is not in my power; but from having very recently been deprived of a very affectionate wife, and of having met with many misfortunes since in circumstances; and that, together with the cares of a family of five young children, being in most wretehedly distressed circumstances; my mind was overcome in a moment, when to guard against the temptation was not thought of by me, or its more unhappy consequences to my family anticipated. - My Lord and Gentlemen, I will beg your commisseration in my present situation, and hope that as this is the first act of crime I ever committed, and of my being at the time I did so misconduct myself in a way of total absence of thought, never contemplating such a crime, that you will in your compassion once more afford me my means of earning an honest and industrious livelihood; and of working for the support of my unhappy family.</p>

James Morrison and Co.; the prisoner came to our shop on the 16th of November; he had been served by another person, but I saw him put a piece of ribbon under the cuff of his coat; I spoke to Smith, who came and stood by me, while the prisoner paid for what he had bought; he then requested him to turn his cuff up, which he did, and this ribbon fell on the counter.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where had you spent the evening? A. I had dined with a friend between five and six o'clock - I had not been drinking from then till one o'clock; I was tipsy; I did not accuse any one else of this; I recollect I did stop with other females - I cannot say how many, perhaps, two or three - matters might occur that I cannot bring to my recollection - I did not go into any house; the purse was a crimson figured one - I never described it as a long green purse - it was said by the officer, at the watch-house, that I described it so; he was sober; if I did describe it so, it must have been from my state of confusion at the time; but I do not see how I could describe it so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you also accused of having said there were 5s. in the purse? A. I do not recollect; I did not afterwards say there were 10s. in it, to my knowledge; I said there was some small change- I did not say any thing about the loss of my watch - it was a gold watch; I felt Bracker's hand about my person- Newby was away from me at that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time can you swear you had your purse, and knew what was in it? A. About ten o'clock; I was then at my friend's house, and paid a bill; there were then two sovereigns, a 30s. note, and some small change in it - it was a crimson purse; I was not up a court with any body but the prisoners; I had been to an auctionshop, and left it about twelve o'clock.</p>

On the 14th of November Campbell came to my warehouse, and said he was going into the country, and wanted an assortment of fancy articles - he said he would pay me cash on delivery of the goods, and I must serve him as low as I could - he gave me this card - "Mr. Spillers, wine-merchant, Leicester-fields," as where he lodged, and on the back of one of my cards he wrote, "Mr. Campbell, Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane;" the goods were to be sent there the next day - I told him I would serve him as low as I could, and he said I should have the cash for them - he looked at a quantity of reticules, snaps, and other articles, and selected the articles stated in the indictment - I made him out this invoice, which he saw (the list of the articles stated in the invoice being compared with the indictment, correspond with the same, and amounted to 171l. 15s. 9d.) - I was to take them to the Swan with Two Necks the following day - and I did take them, at five o'clock in the evening, and found Campbell there - he said, "I am surprised that my friend is not come; he promised to be in this coffee-room by five o'clock - he is not come yet;" after waiting a quarter of an hour, there came a twopenny-post letter to him, upon reading which, he said, "This is my very good friend, who will give me 200l. at half-past seven o'clock, at Toms' coffee-house;" I said."Certainly this must be a very good friend."</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the goods at this time? A. In a packing-case in the coach-office - I had left it there - we were talking in the coffee-room - I had not seen Lewis then - Campbell desired me to meet him at half-past seven o'clock, at Toms' coffee-house - he saw the case in the coach-office - he told the book-keeper, as he passed through the office, to keep him a place to go to Manchester on the day following - he went out, and so did I - I went to Toms' coffee-house exactly at half-past seven, but he was not there; I waited till eight o'clock; my suspicions were then excited - I sent my partner to the book-keeper at the office; he returned, and I went myself to the Swan with Two Necks - my case was not there - I then went to look for him and my property; I sent for an officer, but went out myself before he came, and found my case in about an hour and half, at a house in a small street over Blackfriars'-bridge; the officer was then with me; I found both the prisoners there, very busy, unpacking my case - all my goods were strewed about - they were much surprised to see me, and were secured - I got all my goods again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. At what time did Campbell come to you? A. At ten o'clock in the morning, and gave me these orders; I did not inquire for his lodgings - I had nothing to do with them, because I was to have my money on delivery of the goods - I left the goods in the coach-office.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered up the possession of it entirely? A. I left my case to receive the money - I found Campbell in the coffee-room; I went in there to be paid - I had left the case in the office - I said, "Take care of my case - I am to meet a gentleman here to pay me my money."</p>
               <p>Q. If he had paid you, you would have considered the property as sold? A. I should consider they were not sold, till I had my cash for them; we staid in the coffee-room a quarter of an hour, and had, I think, only a glass and a half of rum and water, as he had to wait for his friend.</p>
               <p>Q. The letter was satisfactory to you, was it not? A. No; my best satisfaction would be to receive the money for my goods; I went in consequence of what he said, and of the letter, to Toms' coffee-house to receive the cash.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any directions to the book-keeper about your goods, when you left to go to Tom's coffee-house? A. I said they should take care, and Campbell said, "Secure me a place to Manchester to-morrow;" the book-keeper said, "I will."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you say? A. I said, "He shall take care of my goods - by eight o'clock I shall be back again."</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did Campbell give any direction about the case? A. He said, "I shall go to-morrow - keep me a place by the first coach."</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the book-keeper say the case was too large? A. I do not know - he said, "We will see what we can arrange;" I think he did say it was too large, but I do not know, for I went very fast through the office, and cannot say whether Campbell gave any directions about the case; something was said about the case - I said nothing about the size of it, nor whether it could go by the coach or not. When I first brought the case, the book-keeper said, perhaps it would be too large to go by the coach, and he thought he should be obliged to send it by the van (Campbell was then in the coffee-room) - I said, "I have nothing to do as to how you send it - I have to receive the money of the gentleman." All I heard in the office, when Campbell was present, was, his desiring a place to be kept for him - I heard nothing else.</p>

            . I am a book-keeper at the Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane. On the day in question I saw Mr. Berens; he brought a large case to the office, about five o'clock, and in about half an hour I saw Campbell come through the office with Mr. Berens; Campbell said, "That is my case - I am going to Manchester to-morrow, by one of your coaches;" the prosecutor said, "I am going to meet him at half-past seven o'clock, at Toms' coffee-house, to receive his cash."</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hear that? A. They were there both together; I went to Campbell, and just informed him I was afraid I should not be able to send that case by the coach; he said, "Do what you can for me - send it tomorrow;" they then both went out of the office. Campbell returned in a great hurry, in about a quarter of an hour, and stated that he had made other arrangements, and should send that case by waggon, and wished me to procure him a porter to take it away; I sent for Hull, who, took it, and went away with Campbell up the lane - Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060103"/>Berens returned about eight o'clock - he wished to know what had become of the case; I told him it was gone. - When Campbell came for it, he asked if there was anything to pay, and said he would give me a sovereign if I wished it- I said No, as he was a passenger I would not take any thing; he still said he should go by one of the coaches tomorrow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he paid for his place? A. No; he offered the sovereign as warehouse-room - it surprised me; I made a remark about it after he was gone. I took it for granted that it was his case - the prosecutor gave me no direction to stop it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say any thing about the case? A. He only said he had brought the case - that he was to be paid for it at our coffee-house, and when he left to go to Toms' he said, "Take care of it."</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. And did not the prisoner say,"Take care of the case?" A. Yes, and I told him I was afraid it could not go; I did not know whether the goods were paid for or not.</p>

            . I am a ticket-porter. I was sent for on the 16th of November, to the Swan with Two Necks, to take a large packing-case - the prisoners were both there, standing near the case; Campbell asked if I would carry it- he said it was large and bulky, but not heavy, as it was only French toys; I lifted it, and said, "It is heavy - how far do you want it carried?" he said, over Blackfriars'-bridge - I do not know whether the book-keeper heard that - they were very busy; I said I would not attempt it, as the streets were very greasy; he then asked if I would carry it over London-bridge - I said No; he then asked if I would take it to a cart - I said the carts were off the stand, I did not know where to get one; Lewis said, "It is not far - come take it as far as you can;" I went with them up the lane, on to St. Ann's-lane, and at the corner of that lane Campbell turned round, and asked if I had not had enough of it - I said I had; a lusty man came along, and I got him to help me down with it; I suppose it weighed a cwt. and three quarters. Campbell then asked me to go and get him a cart; I said there were no cart-stands about there, but we might see one passing by; one came by, which was going to the Old Bailey, and it was put into it; the two prisoners, the two carmen, and another man helped it in; the prisoners went in the cart with it. They paid me 1s. 6d., and I left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the conversation in the coach-office pass in a whisper? A. No; I carried the case on my shoulder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LEWIS to MR. BERENS. Q. Were the goods concealed in the room, or were they not in the chest? A. They had opened it, and the things were all tumbled, but put into the box again - they were unpacking when we entered.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL to THOMAS FELIGATE. Q. If Mr. Berens had come to you for the box, should you have given it to him? A. I should have requested some memorandum for it; I knew him before, by his coming to the office, but should not have given it to him without an indemnification, but I should to Campbell.</p>

Campbell and another person, who I did not notice, got into the cart with it.

Campbell said he considered it his property; Lewis said nothing. I took Campbell into custody with the case; Lewis followed to the watch-house; Keyse was at the house: we found the prosecutor, the carmen, and the porter at the watch-house; Tidder recognised both the prisoners; and after they were locked up, I heard them in conversation together; one said he was not brought there for a paltry wipe - I think that was Lewis, but am not certain; the other said, "It would have been a good hundred for us;" Keyse searched them, and Campbell said, "I suppose you are hunting for letters - they tell tales, and I keep none about me."</p>

Campbell did not live there.</p>
               <p>MR. BERENS. The whole of these articles are mine, and were part of what were in the case; this is the invoice which I made out, and sent with them. I found out Hall, and got further information, by which means I found the property.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060104"/>MR. CHURCHILL contended this was not a felony, but only an obtaining of the goods by false pretences.</p>
               <p>CAMPBELL's Defence. If I have committed myself in the purchase of these goods, I must bow to your decision; but I am in duty bound to say Lewis did not know what I had purchased, or any thing about them; he had been acquainted with me some time - I met him in Cheapside, and asked him to walk with me - in consequence of my not meeting some friends, and the parcel being large, I determined to take it and divide it, that I might send it next day. Mr. Berens was to see me next morning, and if I had paid him that evening, I should have paid him for some goods which I had not received, as I was to have a parcel from him in the morning, and as I had to meet him in the afternoon it would do: for if I called on my friend who was to lend me the 200l. he would have lent it; I have not seen that gentleman in Court - I was not informed till last night that I was to be tried this afternoon, and the person who was to have lent me the money may not be here - I only called to select a few goods - Mr. Berens pressed me to buy these - I should have called on him in the morning, and paid the money; my friend, who was to lend me the money, was here last night.</p>
               <p>CAMPBELL - GUILTY. Aged 25.</p>

On the 19th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I heard a disturbance of several persons, as I thought, running down the place, where I live; I opened the door to see who it might be, as there is no thoroughfare. I saw the prisoner at the bar, pursuing his wife; he at that time lived in the court, on the opposite side of the way. I did not at that time see that he had any thing in his hand - I only saw him and his wife; when I opened my door, he turned, came to me, and said "You bl-y rogue, I will murder you," and shoved a knife as I suppose it to be into my left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first word you heard uttered? A. Yes; I found I was stabbed; I put my hand to my arm, and the blood was gushing out; he attempted several times forward with the instrument which he had in his hand to stab me again. I stepped back into the house, and put my hand a little behind me, where I knew there was a yard measure, and took that in my own defence; he did not come in - he was at the door; I struck him with the yard, and drove him back into the court; he still continued thrusting at me, till I broke the yard measure into short pieces, in my hand; he then ran away into his own house. I heard him say he would stab his wife also - he would murder she also. I sent for an officer, who took him, and a surgeon, who dressed my wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060105"/>here to prosecute this man for his life? A. I am come to prosecute him according to law, as he deserves.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known his wife? A. Which way do you mean? I have known her as a woman, apparently for about a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not this man forbid you his house? A. I forgot to state that, upon the 6th of October, in a public-house, he threatened to stab me with a dagger; and on the Sunday night previous to this, I heard him threaten my life in his own house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he say? A. He said in the public-house, that he had bought a dagger on purpose to run through my heart.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Before the day he struck you with a knife, had he not forbid you his house? A. Yes; on the 8th of October - he struck me on the 19th of November; I had been to his house frequently in his absence, and in his presence, for my washing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not frequently drank tea, and breakfasted with his wife in his absence? A. Yes; and dined there too; she dressed it for me and my family - I have no wife, I have some boys. I dined there in person - the dinner was sent to my house for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, did you ever introduce this man's wife as Mrs. Williams, to any one? A. I never did I never called her Mrs. Williams in any body's presence, I swear that. I know Kearsley and his wife; I was at the Red Lion public-house, Shoe-lane, in their company, in the Bartholomew fair week. I did not introduce the prisoner's wife to them as my wife, nor call her Mrs. Williams in their presence. I know Renshaw, she is a married woman; I never called the prisoner's wife Mrs. Williams in her company, nor introduce her as Mrs. Williams. I know a woman named Bosley; I never introduced the prisoner's wife to her as Mrs. Williams - they were all in company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any public-house, in the presence of each and all these people, call her Mrs. Williams; in the Bartholomew fair week? A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How late did you stay at the prisoner's house in his absence? A. Perhaps till ten or eleven o'clock at night, for little odd things I might want. I am not a follower of Mr. Carlile. I believe the book I have been sworn on. I have been to the prisoner's house since he has forbidden me; in hisabsence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not forbid you the house, in consequence of the gross improprieties he had detected, between you and his wife? A. He said he was jealous of me, and his wife - I have known him about a year and a half.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you at Bartholomew fair with the prisoner's wife? A. Yes; the prisoner was not there - I was there about three hours the first day, and about four hours the second - I do not recollect being there more than two days; we went afterwards to a large gin-shop, at the top of Shoe-lane - I do not know the sign; the prisoner did not know we were going there; his wife told him that week, or the next week, when she went to see him, where he was in possession for a Sheriff's officer; she told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say he took it very much amiss? A. No; he was very satisfied.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you know whether you went more than twice? A. I cannot swear - I might have gone three times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you did go the third day, how long were you with her? A. I cannot say that I did go that day; if I knew the truth, I would tell you.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, Mark's-place. On the 19th of November I heard a scuffle outside my door - I took a candle to see what was the matter, and saw Grover stabbing at Mr. Williams, and heard him say, "D-n you, I will kill you, I will, by G-d" - I then shut my door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not appear to be in a violent rage? A. He did not appear so to me; he did not seem in the least passion - I have known Grover and his wife four years; Williams has lived in the court about half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Until he came into the court, did they not live very comfortable together? A. I have heard his wife say, she could not live with him - I never quarrelled with Grover.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You understood they did not live very happily before he came? A. She told me they did not, I cannot say further; they have not lived worse together since, that I know of - I heard a great quarrelling between them, on the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that the wife told you they did not live well together? A. When she was in the court one day - I cannot say how long before; it was repeatedly, and before Bartholomew fair.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to take up the prisoner, who lived on the other side of the court; he was in an agitated state; he said Williams had destroyed his peace of mind, and his wife was taking away her clothes, and was going to live with Mr. Williams; he pulled out the drawers, and showed me that they were empty - I asked if he was aware he had wounded him in that dreadful manner; he said No, he was so agitated he was not aware that he had wounded him, if he had, he could have made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. What, you thought Williams' life in danger? A. Yes - I saw the wound; it appeared to me to be a dreadful one; the prisoner went with me without any resistance.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - Overwhelmed as I am at the deplorable situation in which I now stand before you, will, I am fearful, preclude the possibility of my revealing to you what I have suffered, both in body and mind, in consequence of the treatment I have experienced from the prosecutor, whose conduct towards me, I trust I shall be able to convince you, has been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060106"/>most infamous. Gentlemen, I have invariably had the most ardent affection for my wife, to whom I have been married twelve years and upwards; we have always lived most happily together, until the month of September last, when the prosecutor, by some means or other, began to cultivate her acquaintance; of which I received, from time to time, the most decisive and undoubted proofs; when, of course, that happiness which I had so many years enjoyed in her society, I was deprived of, which affected my spirits to that degree, that I have at times been in a state of distraction; I have, on many occasions, remonstrated with the prosecutor, in consequence of the improper behaviour towards me - indeed, I even found him with my wife, in my own house, which confirmed the reports of my neighbours, as to the criminal intercourse which had been going on for three months between them, - and I feel assured there are several persons in Court who will hear testimony to what I have asserted, and, above all, satisfy you that I have always been considered an honest, sober, diligent, and humane man. I am aware, Gentlemen, I cautioned the prosecutor on one occasion, never to presume to make any overtures to my wife, as he had done before, for the purpose of inducing her to elope with him - otherwise, I held out threats of inflicting that punishment upon him which he richly deserved; but I most solemnly deny that I had any other object in view at the time than that of intimidating or deterring him from visiting my house, and thereby preventing him taking the advantage of my absence from home. At the time, or a few minutes before I was accused of having struck at the prosecutor, I had been taking some refreshment, and the knife I used on the occasion, I could not have been aware I had in my hand, owing to the aggravating conduct of the prosecutor, which so much irritated my feelings as to cause me to strike him, when I must have been in a state of irritation, which was caused by the prosecutor placing himself in my way, laughing and jeering at me, or I could not have committed such a henious offence as that for which I now stand at this bar to answer, and which, should the prosecutor's expectations be realized, will banish me from my native country, or consign me to an ignominious death. Gentlemen, I can only add, that, upon your taking all the previous circumstances to which I have adverted, into your serious consideration, coupled with the evidence which you will hear in support of it, I feel confident that you will say that the injury which the prosecutor has received was not premeditated.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did you make any remark? A. Yes; I said what a shocking thing it was for her to look at such a thing; when she did not know how soon her husband might be in the same situation - I did not speak to her - my husband would not allow me.</p>

On the 25th of May I gave him a 10l. note, fourteen sovereigns, a shilling, a sixpence, and 4d. to go to Smithfield to pay to Mr. Hill, for eighteen sheep and four lambs - he was to take them to Mr. George Warner, in Bermondsey-street, who is my employer; the prisoner was to have met me at Romford fair on the following Wednesday, but I did not see him again till the 1st of September, when he was in Mile-end-road; I ran after him, but he escaped - he was taken again on the 5th of November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Where did you give him the money? A. At the corner of Dean-street. Tooley-street, but I opened it again at the corner of Thames-street, to see that it was all right - he was to pay it for two different salesmen - it is entered in a book, which is not here; I went immediately to Romford, and staid there till Wednesday - whether he went to my house or not I cannot tell.</p>

About one o'clock yesterday, I left my wife in the shop, and went to dinner; my wife called me up - I came, found the prisoner in the shop, and said to him, "How came you to come into a shop at this time of day, you seem not to want victuals, and have a good coat on your back;" he said, "I did it through distress" - I said, "Why don't you apply to the parish?" he made no answer - I had left this cloth on the counter, about three yards from the window, when I went down; I found it laying nearer to the window, but on the counter - I had not been absent five minutes; it might be about a yard from where it was before: after I told him about applying to the parish, he said he was an orphan, and in distress; the cloth contains twenty-five yards, and the lowest value is 10l.</p>

I was in the shop, but had not noticed the cloth, before I saw it in the prisoner's hands - I was sitting reading the newspaper, and the first thing I saw, was the prisoner turning from the counter, with the cloth in his arms; it was off the counter; he was turning from the counter with it; I did not speak for a moment, and he got to the door - I then said, Halloo! and he turned to the counter, and said, "I have brought this from Mr. Hume, for sale" - I paused for a moment, and said, "From who?" he said, "From Mr. Hume" - I said, "No, you have taken it off this counter;" he said, "Me! No, I have a young man outside, who saw me bring it" - I said, "You have not, for here is our mark on it" - I then knocked for my husband - I think I have seen the prisoner before, but not to know him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long before had you seen the cloth? A. I had not noticed it, till it was in your arms - I did not get to the door to look for the young man; you put the cloth on the counter yourself.</p>

On the Friday night she came home very much in liquor, between ten and eleven o'clock - she asked me for a light, which I gave her; and at three in the morning, I was taken very ill, and called out,"Maria Smith, are you in bed?" she said Yes, and asked if she should get up; I said No: I laid awake till seven, when my husband went out, and she asked me what time it was - I went into her room at nine, and she asked me to lend her a few halfpence, to get a breakfast. This was last Friday three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived there? A. She had lived there about a fortnight before the robbery; a young man used to come backwards and forwards to her; he was there that Friday night; they occupied a ready furnished room, up one pair of stairs - I remember the officer searching that room; the young man had slept there the night before the officer came.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get in? A. I think he drew the staple of the door. The prisoner keeps good hours - I do not know how she gets her living; she comes home about eleven or ten o'clock; I do not know whether the young man is her husband - I do not know what he is called. I go to bed about half-past nine or ten o'clock; my husband is a cabinet-maker, and has worked for Mr. Wright nearly four years, and I work when I can get any.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you so particularly remember the night in question? A. Because she came to my door for a light - she has done so before. I get up about half-past eight o'clock - I did not get up that morning till near nine; the prisoner was not up when I went into her room; I spoke to her about three o'clock, about seven, and again at nine; I have been taken ill before, and called to her. There is no lock to our street door, only a small latch. I do not know how she or the young man get their bread.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 6th of November, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to Mr. Imeson's premises. I saw the hole in the wall - I could have got through it easily. On the 8th of November I went, with Waters and Brown, to a house in a small court, in Austin-street - there are but two houses in the court; I placed Waters in the yard, and I knocked at the door; no one came, and I sent Brown in at the window; he opened the door - he and I went up stairs, and found the prisoner in bed with a woman; I called Waters in, and, in a box, close by the bed, I found this tobacco, tied in an apron and this other parcel in a woman's cap; I then found a small portion of snuff in a paper, which I gave to Brown; I then saw Brown find these two crow-bars, near the fire-place; I found two dark lanterns. I then told the prisoner that I took him on suspicion of a robbery at Mr. Imeson's, in High-street, Shoreditch, of some tobacco and half-pence. I took him and the woman to the office. I then went, with Brown and Waters, to Mr. Imeson's, and examined the desk and cupboard, which were broken open, in the shop; I found the marks on the desk exactly fitted this bar, and some lime was on the desk - there is also some on the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You never saw the prisoner near the prosecutor's premises? A. No; this was two days after - nobody else lives in the prosecutor's house - the bill was not found against the woman.</p>

            .

               <p>THOMAS GARTON re-examined. Esther Smith is the woman against whom the bill was thrown out, and who was before the Magistrate when Harvy was there.</p>
               <p>MR. IMESON. The paper this snuff is in, is an invoice of my writing, dated the 5th of November - I had not sent it out - it was in a parcel of tobacco and snuff, for a person named Potter, whose name is on it; the parcel was gone from the shop when I got up in the morning - this string was round the parcel, and from the peculiar manner in which we tie it, and having had occasion to use two strings of different descriptions, I would not swear, but have no doubt, these are the same strings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was this bill produced on the first examination? A. It was not looked at, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the value of the tobacco and snuff missing? A. Between 30l. and 40l.; but I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you sure Potter's parcel had not been sent out? A. It had not - I saw it in the night of the 5th, at nine o'clock, when I went to supper.</p>

At my first examination that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060114"/>paper was opened, and both the Magistrate and Mr. Imeson took a pinch of it - it is very strange Mr. Imeson should not have looked at the paper - it was never observed, and Mr. Imeson said there was nothing by which it could be identified.</p>
               <p>MR. IMESON. I did take a pinch of it, but never looked at the paper.</p>

On the evening of the 4th of December, between five and six o'clock, he came to the bar and asked for a light, to go up stairs; I thought it was to go and clean himself, as usual; he took the light, went up stairs, and I never saw him afterwards; in about an hour I went up stairs to clean myself, and found my bed-room door open - I went in - my wife followed me, to give me some clean linen - she opened the drawer, and missed her gowns; I then looked with her, and we missed the sheets and some damask table-cloths - she then missed some shifts; the prisoner never came back; next day we got most of our things back; I think no one of them is worth 5l. - the pelisse cost six guineas, when new, but is not worth that now.</p>

I went out about half-past eleven o'clock at night, to do some nightwork, and saw the two prisoners and Lock standing close against the gate; I had heard no noise or breaking then - I opened the outer door, went out, and pulled it too, close;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060115"/>I returned at four in the morning, went in to go to bed, and directly I shoved the outer door open, I found Whitaker's room door open - I then went up stairs, and found mine all safe; I called to a woman who lived in the right-hand room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know that Hough and the prosecutor are very intimate friends? A. I have seen them drink together, and I have seen Hough about there; I have never seen him working in the yard.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Friday morning, the 9th of November, about half-past twelve o'clock, I saw the two prisoners and Lock come out of the King's Head-yard; Hough had a bag under his arm, I had not the least idea of it being stolen; I thought they had been at work down there, as Abdell, the nightman, lives down there. In the morning, I received information from Whitaker, went to his room, and saw the pannels broken, and the lock off the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been a watchman? A. About a year and a half. I had no suspicion of them; I was in search of them for four days before I could find them - they were all three absent.</p>

            . I was taken up for this felony, on Saturday night, the 10th of November. I went up to the King's Head, public-house, to get a pint of beer, on Thursday night, the 8th November, and Whitaker offered me a glass of rum and shrub; when I had drank it, I was going home; but Longman said "Don't go yet, I will put 1l. into your pocket;" when the house was shut up, we all went out, and stopped against the gate; Longman and Hough then went down the yard; the outer door of the house, where Whitaker lives, was open; Longman and Hough put their feet against Whitaker's room door, and broke it open; Longman went in, and brought out a hat, a coat, several waistcoats, trousers, handkerchiefs, and some harness; he gave them to Hough, who put them into a sack; we all went out of the yard - it was about twelve o'clock, or half-past; we went to Constable-alley, and Longman put the property under a house; we then went to Darkhouse-lane, near London-bridge, and staid their till four o'clock; we then returned to Constable-alley for the parcel, and I took it to a man named James Pagett, who brought a sovereign to the Golden Heart public-house, in Phoenix-street, kept by Van, that morning; I got it changed, and we had some steaks, and beer - the landlord took the reckoning out of it; in the course of the day, Pagett paid some more, which was put on the table and divided. I fetched the steaks myself from a butcher's in Brick-lane, and the landlord dressed them; the property was sold to Pagett.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you come here in custody? A. Yes, from the House of Correction; this is the second time I have been in a Court - I was here before, but only as a witness. I was in trouble myself last Session, on suspicion of carrying a parcel - I was not tried; the gentleman did not come against me - I was at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that parcel contain? A. Harness; I was never in custody on any other occasion. I did not break the door, nor carry the goods - I swear I did not break the door.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you sell this property? A. No; I saw Pagett about selling it; he gave 2l. for it all; he asked Longman how much he wanted - he told him 2l.; he lives at No. 2, Hope-street, Spitalfields. I had 5s. out of the sovereign, and we had 5s. each afterwards, and the beef steaks and drink among us.

             re-examined. I took Hough into custody; he came into a public-house where I was sitting, and I charged him with this robbery - he said he had not done it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say, "You had better come before a Magistrate, and clear yourself?" A. Yes- he said, "I am agreeable," and went. The witnesses stated what they have now, but Hough gave no account of himself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you hire these rooms of your master? A. Yes, to take care of some property, and I intend to live in them; I had been living in the public-house, and continued there till this house was fitted up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the key of the outer door? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Had not Mr. Milledge a room or two in the house, for his own use? A. No - he let it all in seperate tenements. There are four rooms - I have two, Abdell one, and a widow has one; the street door was open when I went out; I had closed my own door, and am positive that I locked it.</p>

On the evening of the 2d of August, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner take three large flags out of the street, when the men were gone home; he put them into the yard, under my bed-room window - next morning I heard a noise, and saw him take seven others, and put them with the other three. I gave information at the office, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And was he not bailed? A. I believe he was - I had lodged six or seven months with him; he never gave me notice to quit his premises; he employed a broker to distrain on me after this charge, and he held his fist up at me at the door, and said, he would send his fist through me, because I told about these stones; he did not distrain before this business - I told the gentlemen of it directly it was done, and they told me to go to Mr. Johnson's - I swear he did not distrain before I made the charge - I went and told the gentlemen about this, and then he put the broker in - I did not owe him a farthing; he never employed a broker but once, and that was after I gave the information.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not obliged to employ a constable to protect himself? A. I do not know - I never saw a constable; my six children were turned into the street - I was outside in the street - I did not break his window-shutters down, or any thing of the sort; my husband is not here; my daughter is here, who saw the stones taken - I went to make the complaint to an officer in the course of the same day, as he took them - I met the officer in the street, and he told me to go to Mr. Winkfield's - I know Ann Byrne - I never told her the poor Irishman would suffer for the stones which were brought into his yard, nor any body else - nor did I ever say to her, "What a nice lot of stones there is in that yard - the poor Irishmen will suffer for this."</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you any dispute with the prisoner about rent, or any thing else, till after you told about the stones? A. No - I went to Johnson that day, and by his direction, went to Marlborough-street, and was taken over the way to Mr. Winkfield's office.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the paving of St. James', Westminster. Mr. Joseph Stevenson is one of the paving committee - Queen-street was being paved in August last, and many loose stones were there - I saw Kinsley, and in consequence of what she said, I went to the prisoner's house, and in his back-yard, found eight Yorkshire, and two Berwick stones - I did not see the prisoner there - I saw him at the office - I could not swear to the stones; what passed at the office, was not taken down, I am certain; the prisoner stated there, that the workmen had given him these stones; they had no right to do so; they were of the same quantity and description as those in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. About what value are they? A. Nine shillings; it is not an open yard; there are several lodgers there - I believe many of them are Irish.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner gone personally to the office to object to something about the paving rate? A. Yes, and there this charge was made; it was the latter end of July I saw Kinsley, and on the 2d of August I saw the stones.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had he been summoned for the rate? A. Yes, by the collector, and attended, to show cause against it; he is a slater.</p>

            . I know Kinsley well; she told me there was a nice lot of stones in the yard, and the poor Irishman would be a sufferer for it - I will be on my oath to that - I live in the house; there are six or eight families there: this was the morning after the stones were brought in - I saw a labouring man bring some in, and there were some there before.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were stones often brought there? A. There were some before - I cannot say when they were brought in - the stones were brought in three weeks or a month before the words occurred between the prisoner and Kinsley - I have lived there above twelve months - these stones were brought from his other house, at Westminster - I cannot say where the last were brought from - it was not the prisoner who brought them in - he was taken up three weeks or a month afterwards - the man who brought them never called for them - the broker came in before the last stones were brought - I live in the kitchen - a knock came to the door, and I answered it when the stones came.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She made no complaint for three weeks after they were brought? A. No; they quarrelled on Tuesday - the broker came in on Wednesday - and next day she went to the office.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Hinxman. I saw this property hanging at their laundry at Hendon, to dry, on the 1st of December, and at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, it was taken in, and put into baskets - the laundry is not a part of the dwelling-house - it is at some distance in the yard; the yard is between the dwelling-house and the laundry; I slept that night in a room over the laundry - I went to bed at half-past eight o'clock; there is a double sash window to the laundry, which draws back - it fastens with a small nail. I came down at half-past eight o'clock the next morning; the things were then gone from the baskets, and the window was a little way open, but not enough to let a person in; the basket had not been near enough to the window to be reached without a stick; the window would open wide enough to let a person in; the nail was quite out of the window.</p>

            . I and Coleman were desired by Rayner to watch in this house, on the 1st of December; and about half-past eight o'clock at night, there was a ring at the bell and a knock at the door, which we did not answer, and in about ten minutes there was a violent ringing and knocking; I then left the dining-room, and stood by the street door, with the poker in my hand; I had not been there more than a minute, when the door opened, and the prisoner put one foot over the sill of the door; I seized him by the collar, and he said, "What are you going to do with me?" or words to that effect - he tried to make his escape, and pulled me into the street, as far as the curb - he got from my grasp twice, but I secured him in the carriage-way, by the help of Coleman - I could not see whether any body else was outside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not tell you he was going to give information that he had seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060118"/>three men trying to get in? A. I believe he did - he did tell me so - he was searched in my presence; nothing suspicious was found on him except a knife.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he say when you seized him? - A."What are you going to do with me?" he said nothing about giving information, till I gave him in charge of the watchman; and then he said he saw three persons trying to break in, and saw one get over the area - he said there was a key left in the door. I saw no trace of any body else - he did not throw the door wide open, only just to get in; the first ringing was about half-past eight o'clock, and the other about ten minutes after.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And did he not say one of those men got into the area? A. I believe he did; he said he saw the key shining in the door - nothing but a large knife was found on him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen, I beg your attention to the following statement: - I am a painter by trade, and found it very prejudicial to me, and I found I must get another employ; I then opened a shed in the coal and green-grocery line, which my wife is carrying on. On the night in question, I had occasion to go to Oxford-street to purchase some coals; I went to Lower Berkeley-street, and saw two men, whom I knew well, on the steps of the door; I passed on, and they came down and passed me, and met a third person coming towards me, and I heard the two men say to the third, that it would be of no use, they could not get the door open; I went on to the corner of the street, and stood there eight or ten minutes; that might be twenty minutes after eight o'clock; the men came to the corner, went back, and walked the street two or three times; one of them got over the area-gate, and went down the kitchen steps; he came up in a minute, and I should not then have had time to get to the house; a woman came past, and asked what I was waiting for - I said, "Watching three men;" she said she saw, while she was there, a man come out of the area, and that she was going by them, and hoped they would not touch her; we walked by them, and she, as well as I, saw two of their faces, and could swear to them; we walked on to the corner of the square - she said her husband was in the country, and had a six months' job, and she was going down to him, which is the reason I cannot bring her - if I could have got bail I could have gone to the shop her husband works for, and heard where she was - the persons then came from the door and walked entirely away - I watched a few minutes, and then the watchman came up - I waited still, and found they did not return - I then went on to Duke-street, met the three men coming round again, and going towards the house - I followed them, and when they got to the house, two of them ran up the steps - they had not been up three minutes before they came down, walked a few steps, and then ran off - I crossed and rang the bell to tell what I had seen - I then saw the handle of a bright key in the door - I ran up the steps, rang the bell hard, and put my hand on the key - whether I opened it or not I do not know, but I found the door going from me - whether it was open, or I was the occasion of opening it, I do not know, but I thought the persons inside might have pulled the lock back; but I appeal to that Judge, who alone can judge the heart, that my foot was not in the house - the witnesses rushed out - one had a poker - there were repeated blows levelled at me - they broke my hat, and the poker fell - I then told Irish it was of no use, and to desist - the watchman was called, and I given in charge, and at the office made the same defence I have now, and said I had a friend who would give bail for 200l. or 300l. - that I knew the two men, and could leave their description there, and if an officer was granted me, I could find them - the Magistrate said he thought it a fit case to go before a Jury, but if I had friends who would do what I had said, surely they would come forward on my trial, and prove my innocence - I said if I had bail I could produce the woman who knew the two men - I afterwards sent the officer to ask the Magistrate, to grant me bail, which was denied me.</p>
               <p>ROBERT IRISH re-examined. He did state that he knew the men by sight; he did not give any description of them, or state their names.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When did he tell you he was watching the men? A. After I gave him into the watchman's hands - I did not assist in opening the door - he opened it himself, I can swear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Directly the door was open about eight inches, I felt it suddenly pulled away from me - I had no time to speak to him - I showed no resistance, but to protect myself from his attack - the house had been attempted three Saturdays before; I could have proved I was at home on those occasions.</p>

            . We have a warrant against Weedon respecting this sheep - we searched his house, at Finchley, but found nothing particular there; the prisoner said he had been drinking at a public-house, and got very tipsy - I have known him five or six years, and never knew him in trouble - I have known Weedon in trouble.</p>
