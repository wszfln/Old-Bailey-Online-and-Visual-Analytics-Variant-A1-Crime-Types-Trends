On the 31st of March, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I missed a sheep - it was safe at six o'clock at night, with others, in Mr. Corbett's marsh, about a mile from my house. I found the skin and head in a ditch in the marsh, and can swear it is mine. I have the skin now. I made enquiry, and offered a reward of 10 l., but heard nothing for six weeks after. Day then gave me information (he is a labourer and worked for me, but not at that time), he lived about a mile and a half off; the prisoners were in custody on another charge, when he accused them - they have all three worked for me, and knew my premises.

               <p>COURT. Q. Were you going the same way as them - A. Yes, my Lord. They went into Corbett's marsh, drove the sheep up in one corner next to the large river, near the ditch. They caught one and all knelt down, and stabbed it; then took the skin off and threw it into the ditch - all three put the carcase into a sack, and took it away.

               <p>Q. What distance were you from them when they slaughtered the sheep - A. About one hundred yards. I do not think they saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a reward was offered - Yes. I was afraid to tell Mr. Boards, because Harvey threatened to murder me if I mentioned any thing of the kind - that was about a fortnight afterwards. And they all threatened me when they were in the cage for stealing potatoes. They said they would murder me if they got free from this. I was behind a tree when I saw them kill the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of their getting any thing else - A. I lodged in the house before this happened; they were always being brought in, and so I left.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any quarrel with them - A. No; but my wife is separated from me, and lives in the house with Harvey.</p>

            , by the potatoe-house, and two of Mr. Southgate's men came for some tar out of the potatoe-house. Harvey said to me</p>
               <p>"D - n me if I don't have a good ton of potatoes out of here, for the women to take away tomorrow morning." He went to the back of the potatoe-house, and pulled off the thatch from between the two rafters - it was about five o'clock on a Monday evening. He got in, took out about a sack of potatoes, and took them home. I saw him sell two pecks of them that evening - his house is about a mile from the barn. I went home with him the back-way across the fields; he carried it all the way himself. The sack held about five bushels, and he returned a good many times. I went to work with him next day, and that evening, about nine o'clock, all the prisoners and Boreham, went in and got three sacks out between them, and brought them home to Harvey's house. I met them about a quarter of a mile from the barn with them. They said they had been to Mr. Southgate's barn and got a quantity of potatoes. I did not go home with them, as I did not live with them then. On Wednesday night, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170004"/>them all again about eleven o'clock, just by the potatoe house. They had each got nearly a sack.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you out so late that night - A. I was coming from Enfield, the road goes close by the barn. Harvey said they had twenty-one bushels out that evening, but they had not got them all with them. On Thursday evening, I saw them with a quantity more about half-past ten o'clock, in a lane coming down by the Bell at Edmonton - they each had a load. And in the morning, when I went to work, I saw Harvey cover up the hole in the thatch. There is a foot-path across the field, but the hedge hides the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you inform Southgate of this - A. About two days ago.</p>

My apprentice, Haynes, came up to me, and said the prisoner had taken a piece of sarsnet; I looked at them, and saw a piece of the sarsnet hanging out of the prisoner's coat. I had laid it on the counter myself not two minutes before. He had it inside his great coat. I saw a little bit of it hanging out under his great coat, which was on his arm - I laid hold of him, he laid it down, and the other ran out of the shop directly. The prisoner said he wanted to go after his brother, and made towards the door; I pulled him back, and sent for a constable, who took him to Bow-street. The sarsnet measured upwards of thirty yards, and is worth 6 l. - it cost me 5 s. a yard. His great coat was on his arm, he was not wearing it.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor. On the 12th of May the prisoner came to the shop with another person; the other said,</p>
               <p>"I want half a yard of green persian, the same as I had before" - they had both been in the shop before - I do not know what they bought. I did not serve them, but I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get him the persian - A. Yes, and served him. He then asked for some black ribbon, and I cut him a yard - he also bought a bootlace, and gave me the money. I then saw the prisoner take the sarsnet off the counter - it was about ten yards from me; he took it as privately as he could, and was watching Mr. Balaam at the time. I immediately went up to Mr. Balaam, called him into the back room before I gave the other man the change, and told him what I had seen. He directly went round the counter, and seized the prisoner, upon which the other immediately walked out without the change. The things, I believe, came to 6 d., and he paid me 6 d., therefore I had no change to give him. He had nothing to detain him in the shop, and took away what he had bought.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you away from them when you went to speak to your master - A. About a minute - there was time enough for them to go away if they thought fit. When my master seized him he wanted to go after his brother. He immediately put the sarsnet down on the counter, and said,</p>
               <p>"Is not this the persian you wanted?" - this was before he wanted to go after his brother; the sarsnet was near Mr. Balaam before the prisoner took it.</p>

During that time I have not been able to work, in consequence of a rupture produced by over-exertion. On the day mentioned, I had been to Paddington, and had just left the stage, when I, by accident, met the person who was in company with me. I had very little previous acquaintance with him, merely knowing him by the name of Wilson, a boot-closer. He said he was going to purchase a piece of green silk to make a shade for his eyes. I accompanied him, and while he was settling for what he had purchased, I took from the counter a piece of silk for the purpose of looking at the shade of it. I turned towards the light, and having a great coat on my arm I laid the silk upon it - having satisfied myself I returned it to the place from whence I took it. In a moment after, the person who served in the shop, came round the counter, seized me, and said I had robbed him. The person who was with me, fearing, perhaps, that I had actually committed a theft, left the shop.</p>

             re-examined. I am sure he said he wanted to go after his brother. He laid the silk on the counter as Mr. Balaam was going to seize him, and before he seized him. Mr. Balaam was in the act of seizing him when he said,</p>
               <p>"This is the persian you want."</p>
               <p>Q. What had Mr. Balaam done to make him think he was going to seize him - A. I had called Mr. Balaam into the back room, upon which he rose up the flap of the counter, and went straight up to him.</p>
               <p>MR. BALAAM re-examined. I am sure he said he wanted to go after his brother - I cannot say whether he produced the silk before I seized him, but I saw him lay it down - it was under his coat, apparently concealed.

            . I am a labourer, and live at Harrow on the Hill. I bought two mattocks of the prisoner and another man, on Saturday, the 22d of April, about twelve o'clock at noon. I was at work in the road, and they asked me if I wanted to buy them? I said No. I went in and told the headborough that I thought they had stolen the goods, he told me to go and buy them - I went after them, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"You shall have this mattock for 1 s.," I bought it - he came up again, and said I should have the other for the same money, the others said I should not have it for that - the headborough was afraid to interrupt them.</p>

On the 27th of April, about half-past five in the morning, I went to the shop and found the staple of the lock drawn, and a bill and spade stolen. I saw them safe about eleven o'clock the morning before. I got a search-warrant, went about ten o'clock to the prisoner's house, which is about twenty yards from my house, and found the spade and axe. I had not missed the axe till I found it. I do not know when I had seen that last. I had not sold it. Nobody but my son and myself serve in the shop.</p>

            . I am constable of Enfield. I went with a search-warrant to the prisoner's house, and found the spade in his back room - he said he found it. I said he must give a better account, and went up stairs and found the axe under his bed. He said he bought that of an old-iron man for 3 s. or 3 s. 6 d., but he did not know the man. He said it was without a handle when he bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before did he say he bought it - A. About three months. I heard him examined before the Magistrate. What he said was taken down and read to him, he admitted that it was correct, and was asked to sign it. I think he said he could not write. The Magistrate put his name to it - (looking at it) - this is it. Nothing whatever was said to induce him to confess.</p>

            . I am son of the last witness. On the 26th, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I made every thing fast, and I knew the spade was there then, because I had it in my hand. I knew it by the handle, there was Bishopsgate-street written on it - it is now scratched out. I know it by the make and shape. Part of the axe is my own work. I saw it safe within two months of the robbery, and never sold it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say it belonged to another man - A. Yes, it did; we new laid it - (Examination read).</p>
               <p>"The prisoner says he found the spade about fifty yards from the said shop, between nine and ten o'clock last night, and took it home and put it where it was found; and that he bought the axe six months since of an old-iron-cart man - gave him 3 s. for it, and put the handle to it."</p>

I told the girl to shew him to the room adjoining the prosecutor's. About half-past one o'clock I went up stairs, heard a noise above, and found the prisoner had locked himself in another room - he was dressed in Talbot's clothes.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live at Battle-bridge. I was coming up Holborn, and saw the prisoner in company with a little lad very genteelly dressed, and about thirteen years old. I watched them. The prosecutor went into a shop in Holborn, and they waited about twenty minutes at the shop till he came out - (they sat on a cart at the door), they then followed him to Skinner-street, and I saw the prisoner several times put the lad before him, and point to the pocket. When they came nearly to the top of the street he pushed the lad towards the prosecutor, and I rather think he struck the lad; the prisoner went up, took the handkerchief out himself, and put it under his coat - I was watching them on the other side. The prisoner crossed the road, and ran towards me; I stopped him, took it from under his coat, and sent a gentleman to inform Mr. Bogue, who claimed it.</p>

I opened my door, and asked if it was a person belonging to the house? the answer was Yes, but Mrs. Dimmock opened her door, and said it was nobody belonging to the house. I followed the person, who was a female, down stairs - she had got out and turned the corner into the market. I then caught sight of her, and overtook her in Rose-street - she must have been the person. I found a large bundle in her lap containing the articles stated in the indictment. She begged for mercy, and said her friends were respectable - she had an infant with her.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Long-alley, Moorfields. I saw a mob, and heard that the prosecutor had been robbed. I went along St. Paul's Church-yard, and was informed that two men were gone along with a basket. When I got as far as Cripplegate I saw a basket on a man's head in Fore-street, ran as hard as I could, and saw the prisoners with it in Moorfields; Finch had it on his head, and Johnson was by his side. I went by them, and they put it down - I stood by the London Institution, and watched them; one of them took the basket up, but I do not know which. I saw Stone who went after them. I took Finch with the basket on his head, and Stone took Johnson. I told them they had taken the basket out of the cart, but they said they had done nothing - we took them to the Mansion House. I went and found Edwards, who claimed the property. I first saw them about ten minutes after I had heard of the robbery.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Ray-street, Clerkenwell. I have known the prisoner for years, he came to me on Thursday, the 4th of May, and was with me half an hour. He dined with me, and asked me if I would let him kill some sheep at my house? I said I would, and I could help him. He said a friend was going to send him some from the country to make the best of them, and he was going down to see about them. Next morning, at three o'clock, before day-light, he came to my house again and knocked me up. I found him standing at the door with nine sheep, and helped him to get them in - he then went home to bed, and I went to bed. He returned about nine o'clock, and then we killed the whole nine sheep - seven were sent to Newgate-market, and two I had myself, the carcases fetched 18 l. 7 s. I sold them at the market and paid it to the prisoner. I gave him a 5 l. and thirteen 1 l. notes. The sheep were marked with a cross on the rump (a black mark), I should think it was a pitch mark, and a little stroke underneath. We sent the skins to Mr. Griffin, the salesman. The prisoner bore a good character.</p>

             re-examined. My sheep were marked with a pitched cross on the rump, and a little stroke underneath. I had had them in my field for a week, and observed the mark. The prisoner was in the habit of coming to my house to see my maid-servant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday, the 1st of May, a person came to the Twelve Bells, and asked for a person named Cumber, I said I was the person. He asked if I knew Stiles, I said</p>
               <p>"what Stiles?"</p>
               <p>"Why your father-in-law that is to be, said he." I said I knew there was such a person, he then said he was recommended by him to me to kill a few sheep, and dispose of them as I thought best, as he was embarrassed, and he must not be seen to do them away himself. Having been out of employ sometime, I said I had no objection, and asked what day they would be sent - he said about Thursday next. I did not see him again till Thursday morning, when he came to me at the end of Bride-lane, and said the sheep would come on the following morning, and if I met him at Kensington turnpike, or Hyde-park, I should see him there, and settle whether I should go all the way, or meet him. I met him by Hyde-park-gate, walked on towards Hamersmith, and he agreed I should meet his son with the sheep about Kensington - we went to a public-house, and had some rum and water, went to Astley's theatre, and after leaving there we went on to Kensington, and met the sheep and his son, whom he called George, with them. After he got through the gate I had stopped behind for an occasion, and when I came up, he said his son had sold three at Brentford, or there would be twelve for me to kill. When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170011"/>we got to Piccadilly we found an obstruction, and then they drove them round; and his son met me and a person named Williams at Hatton-garden - there he parted. His son and I went down nearly to Cox's, then his son left, and I took the sheep into Cox's. I went home, returned at nine o'clock and killed the sheep. The skins were placed out in the street, and after some time, I went home to Bride-lane, and met him. He asked when I should take the money, I said I did not exactly know then when I should be paid for the skins, but the fat would be paid for in the afternoon. I went to Cox and told him what passed. We took the fat, I got 1 l. 11 s. for it, and I met him afterwards and gave it to him. He said he should call round and sell the sheep. I remained at Cox's all the afternoon, expecting him to call; and as he did not come, Cox and me, went down to my lodgings and waited there a few minutes - as he did not come Cox went home. A few minutes, after he came to the door to me, I gave him the money for the fat. He said he had not time to call round to see the sheep, this was Friday night. On Saturday morning, I received a note from him, to know when he could have the money, saying, he expected I should get it ready by Tuesday. I told Cox, and shewed him the note. Cox said, if he had known it he could have had it before. After my going home, and coming from Bride-lane, I met the man again and told him he would have the money on Tuesday. On Saturday, I received another note, saying, that instead of Tuesday, he should send his son to meet me at the Rodney public-house to take the money. I received the money, went and put it into my landlord's hands; having lost 48 l. three weeks before - I was afraid to keep it myself. About four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to meet the man at the Rodney, and he was not there. I met him at Westminster-bridge, returned with him to the Rodney, and waited there an hour. I wanted to leave the money with the landlady till he came, she said she did not wish to have any thing to do with it. I met him on Westminster-bridge and gave him the money, he asked for the letters I received, and I gave them to him. I am unprepared for trial or I could have got the landlady of the Rodney to prove I offered to leave the notes with her.</p>

I was going along stooping my head, three or four young men were coming along High-street, and when they came up to me one of them struck me under my chin, and my watch was taken by one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the blow knock you down - A. Not that blow; they hit me on the back of my neck and then I slipped down, that was after my watch was taken. I recovered myself, and as soon as I could get up, I looked round, and saw the prisoner running across the road. I ran after him, calling Stop thief! I lost sight of him hardly a minute in turning the corner of Little Woodstock-street - the watchman stopped him in Weymouth-street. My watch was found next morning down an area, at the corner of Weymouth and Wimpole-street. I am sure the prisoner is one of the four persons that met me. I did not notice him more than the rest till I saw him running. I have seen him many times before. The others ran in different directions, none of them ran to Little Woodstock-street. The watch was found in the area of No. 43. I saw him pass that house, and saw him stopped a very little way from it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was you not in Little Marylebone-street, when I was stopped - A. He was stopped as I turned the corner, I did not see the watchman actually stop him. I said at the office that I did not know him to be the man that took my watch, but he was the man I pursued - I know him by seeing him about the street. Some person pointed him out to me, saying that is the one who has got your watch, and I pursued. I did not say I did not know what time I lost it. I had been with some friends and was rather in liquor, but knew what I was about; and with the blow that I had at the back of my neck I fell against the curb and it stunned me. I recovered myself as soon as I could get up, it was getting dusk - part of my ribbon was in sight.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner running, sprang my rattle, and saw him stopped by Gage. About four o'clock in the morning I took the watch out of an area, within a yard or two of where he was stopped - it was then light. I looked for it at eleven o'clock at night, but could not see it because it was so deep - it was general suspicion which induced me to look there. I did not see him throw it down.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you spring your rattle - A. I heard the cry of Stop him! in Little Marylebone-street. I was then in Weymouth-street, and saw the prisoner run up Little Woodstock-street as hard as he could, and three or four more running after him, crying out Stop thief! I sprang my rattle, and saw Gage stop him - I brought him into Little Marylebone-street. Sanderson came up, and said he was the man who had taken his watch - he was stopped in Weymouth-street, and ran through Little Woodstock-street. I suppose Sanderson was about two or three hundred yards behind him, and he must have lost sight of him. Nobody was running before him.</p>

I rent the house, the prisoner had been four years in my service. On Monday, the 10th of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, about an hour after the men had left work, the prisoner returned to the house, and rang the bell, my son went down to ask him what he wanted - I was sitting at the parlour window, and my son asked me if he might let him in? I gave him leave; he went into the warehouse, remained there about two minutes, and was then let out. On the following morning, the 11th of April, my man gave me information, in consequence of which I went to the upper floor of the house, and missed a quantity of annatto - I was there the day before, and saw it there then. I made a calculation, and missed about 1 1/4 cwt., more or less. It was worth 14 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had access to the floor where it was kept - A. Four of my men. I have not seen it since; the prisoner did not come to work on the Tuesday or afterwards - he was apprehended on the 14th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORRIS. Q. were you present when he confessed it - A. No. I made him no threat or promise. I believe I said I would be as lenient towards him as I could. I had no reason to suspect his dishonesty before.</p>

            . I was foreman to Mr. Fulwood. On Monday, the 10th of April, the annatto was spread on the floor to dry; I left the warehouse about six o'clock, and made it secure - we all went out together, and left nobody there. I went about seven o'clock in the morning to the warehouse, but was the first person that was there - the prisoner was not there. I went up to the floor of the warehouse, and directly missed some annatto. I went down, saw the door open, and traces of the feet of persons having conveyed something through - it being a rainy night there were marks of wet feet. I informed Mr. Fulwood, who went up and examined it, it appeared that about 1 1/4 cwt. was missing - some was taken off the floor, and more from the cask. We expected the prisoner on Tuesday, but he did not come - he was apprehended on the 14th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Other men had access to the place - A. Yes, but not after the warehouse was locked up.</p>

On Easter Monday, about five minutes after one o'clock, when the workmen had left, I was looking out of the window, and saw the prisoner throw a bag out of the hay-loft on to a man's shoulder.

He could get to the hay-loft door.</p>

I go from my house into the yard, then a door opens into the warehouse. The men go from the street into the warehouse without going through the private house - no person can go to it from the street without going through the yard. Down to this time I always found the prisoner to be an industrious, civil, and well-behaved young man.</p>

            . I keep the Ship tavern, Charing-cross. Knowing the prosecutrix had lost this property, when the prisoner was in custody I questioned him how he disposed of it - I neither threatened nor promised him. He said he was afraid other persons would be led into trouble if he gave any account of it, and as for himself, he wished to go out of the country.</p>
               <p>MRS. TRIGG re-examined. I do not know who I took the notes of. The watch cost me fifty-five guineas thirty years ago. The outside case was very heavy fine gold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am very sorry that I have done it.</p>

On the 30th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I searched the prisoner at the watch-house, and found three duplicates on him in a pocket-book. After his second examination he said he found them in the Holloway road, he would say nothing about them before. I found 3 l. 9 s. on him. He said he had no lodging.</p>

            . I live with Lady Lambert, in Manchester-square. On the 16th of April, about eight o'clock, or a little after, I was in Welbeck-street, and saw a carriage and four horses drive along, two persons were on the box. I observed two men going along behind, and in an instant I saw a man go away with a portmanteau, and another followed with a trunk - one of them was covered, I think it was the largest; the men rested them on the steps of a door for a moment. A man passed me - I said,</p>
               <p>"Those men have cut these trunks from behind that carriage;" he said it was not the trunks but that it was a coat. He ran over to them directly, and all three went together from the door along Welbeck-street, turned round the corner of Great Marylebone-street, and while I was speaking to two coachmen at the stand, the man I spoke to before came and abused me; he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes! who are you, and what do you want?" - he went away directly, and I mentioned it to the landlord of the public-house, and in consequence of what was said to me, I looked at a coach and saw the coachman was on the box with the man who had abused me. The prisoners have every appearance of being the men who cut the trunks away.</p>

            . I drive the coach No. 690. On the 16th of April, about eight o'clock in the evening, my coach was fourth on the stand in Marylebone-street. I had just got out of the house, and before I got to the horses' heads, two trunks or portmanteaus were thrown into my coach - I found three men putting them in as I came out - they were both covered with white cloth. The prisoners are the men I am sure. One of them told me to drive to the corner of Hopkins-street, Carnaby-market - one of the prisoners got behind the coach, another inside, and the other on the box with me, who took the reins out of my hand. They hurried me along, and would not let me wait for my great-coat. I drove by the end of Marylebone-street to the corner of Hopkins-street, Broad-street. Smith gave me 5 s., he was inside - he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, if you tell it shall be worse for you!"</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ask your fare - A. No, the fare was 18 d. The trunks were taken out of the coach almost before I could get off the box; they went up Hopkins-street with them. I am sure the prisoners are two of the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you drove the coach - A. Four years. I was never charged with any offence - I was put in the watch-house about this. I have seen Bohan in the street before, driving for his father. The man drove all the way.</p>

I found him in bed with a woman of the town. I found this neckcloth in a trunk in the room - the woman said it was the skirt of her child's frock and that she had the body. There is a mark on it, part of which is picked out. I apprehended Boham the same morning.</p>

I have another in my pocket, I compare them - they appear of the same quality and size, and are marked with red silk. I had a great deal of wearing apparel and papers of consequence in my trunk.

            'S Defence. On Saturday evening, about eleven o'clock. I rode to Hampstead, which I always do at night to clear the turnpikes. When I got to Pickersteed Mill I stopped till Monday evening at ten o'clock, and then set off to Round Head. I wrapped myself in a sack, and did not see a soul till I got to Kingsland; then four or five men passed me, called me, and said they had something for me to take to town. I asked what it was? they did not exactly give me an answer, but said it was very heavy. I said I would have 10 s., and they said we should not fall out about that. When I got to Golder's-green my horse was very tired, and I hired one of a poor man at North End.</p>
               <p>FOOT'S Defence. I met some men who appeared to be plumbers; they said they wanted to get some lead to the Adam and Eve, Tottenham-court-road. I met this man, and asked him to buy it. We took up Thomas Hoar on the road as he was lame.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and live in Golden-lane. The prisoner brought the bowl to me for sale; he said it was his own, and that he lived in Hartshorn-court, close by. I went with him to see if he did live there. He went up stairs, and called out some name, but nobody answered; he came down, and said they were not at home, but all was right. I called out Prince, the officer, who lived close by, and the prisoner immediately ran away. I pursued him, and never lost sight of him till Miller stopped him.</p>

            . I am a labourer by the water-side. I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Miller's house, about ten minutes before eight o'clock. He was a stranger to me. He went to two other persons close by the door, and said he could only open one lock with the key; he then returned back, and said there was a room up stairs with the door open, and a box on the table - they desired him to go and fetch it, and he did so. I let them go off the premises; they weighed the box in their hand to see how heavy it was. I stopped him before I lost sight of him, and the others went off. I took him to Mr. Miller's house, and delivered him to a constable. I did not see the box opened, I am quite sure he is the man that went into the house.</p>

I saw Woodroffe try a gentleman's pocket in <placeName id="t18200517-38-crimeloc230">Bunhill-row</placeName>

Then Walkingham joined them and made the fourth. Jacobs was following a gentleman who had two ladies with him, and the other three joined him. I saw the handkerchief taken from the gentleman's pocket by one of them, I do not know which, they were close together - he had a lady on each arm. I stopped him and told him his pocket was picked. I went after the prisoners and met with them going into Bridgewater-square, I took Jacobs and Sayers, Walkingham got away and threw down the handkerchief. Johnson followed Walkingham and brought him back. Woodroffe was taken on the Monday, I knew him, he was one of the party - my apprentice was not with me when the pocket was picked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The gentleman did not give you his card or his name - A. No. I did not stop, I went after the prisoners. There is two letters on the handkerchief, and I saw it taken from the pocket.</p>

            . I am an headborough. I was in the City-road on business between four and five o'clock, and was accosted by Mr. Colton, in consequence of which I watched three persons following a gentleman. I only recollect the persons of two, Jacobs and Sayers, I cannot recollect the features of the others, and was induced to follow them. They turned round and went into the City-road, I followed them - they were playing about some time on and near the Bridge. They then went towards Bunhill-row, I followed them, it was then dusk. They tried a gentleman's pocket in Bunhill-row, one tried first, then a second, and a third tried, but without success, he was taller than the other two. They then went to the lower end of Bunhill-row (there was a mob there), they staid there some time, and afterwards went down Chiswell-street, they were joined by Walkingham. They went down one side of the way, crossed over, and followed very close to a gentleman with two ladies. I did not perceive them take the handkerchief. Colton said they had got it, and three of them instantly crossed the way. I did not see Woodroffe, I could not swear to him. Colton spoke to the gentleman, and then went after the prisoners, I followed him, and we tried to secure them all. Walkingham threw down a handkerchief and ran away, I pursued him and brought him back, and never lost sight of him. I went to Colton, he had got the other two, and the handkerchief. We went on Monday into the City-road and apprehended Woodroffe. I do not know who the gentleman was, I never heard his name.</p>

            . In consequence of information I watched Mr. Farncomb's house, I was six or seven yards off - the prosecutor's house is up a court. About ten minutes before eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came out of the court, I followed him to Fenchurch-street, and took him into a grocers'-shop, near the corner of Mincing-lane. I took from his pockets five bottles of wine, and asked him where he got them from? he said the cellarman had spoken to his master about them, and he was to pay for them on Saturday night; I took him to the Mansion House, and then to the Compter. I went and took the cellarman, but he was afterwards discharged.</p>

I asked him what he had got - he said they were fowls which he had received from a gentleman at Hampstead, to carry to Mr. Cook, of Somers'-town - they were dead, but warm. I took him to the watch-house; he then said he found them under a hedge, and afterwards that he took them from a house in Kentish-town. I found they belonged to Mr. Scott.</p>

He denied taking it, and said it was some other person. He began to resist and strike me - I was obliged to return his blows, and when I let go to strike him, he escaped from my left hand, and ran into Brook-street - he was stopped there. I never lost sight of him till he was apprehended. I positively swear he is the man; nobody was near enough to take it but him, and I saw him drop it.</p>

They were finished, and kept in a drawer under the counter in the front shop - he worked in the back shop and did not serve. I missed four pair of pistols on the 10th, went to Tates, the pawnbroker, on the 11th, and found six pair. I had seen them safe about two days before. I afterwards found more at Harrison's and Leighton's. I went to the prisoner's apartments, but found none there.</p>

She asked for Mrs. Smith, a charwoman, but no such a person lived there. Mrs. Britten came out, and said she was the person who went down with the pail. She wanted us to let her go.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You missed your property on the 18th of March? Was the first step you took to recover it to go to a fortune-teller - A. Yes. I took the prisoner up on the Monday after on suspicion, but she was set at liberty, and has been so ever since. After that a gentleman served me a process from the King's Bench, and I was obliged to pay her 5 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not this morning, at the door of this Court, tell Littlefold to be sure, and swear positively that Poll Pearce gave him the note - A. I did not. I told him if he was concerned in it to say so.</p>

            . I live at Hounslow. As I was going home the prisoner called me to her gate, and asked me if I was going down to Hounslow town? I said not then, but should after I got home, to sell a few radishes. She asked me to bring her a purple purse, two red spotted handkerchiefs, and a pair of silk gloves. She gave me a 10 l. Uxbridge note and 4 s. - this was on the 27th of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon; she told me to go to Mr. Wood's shop, but to no other, and the articles hung in the corner of the window, and that if I did not see her when I came home I was to hide them till I did see her - she told me to say I had lived at Mr. Wild's four years, and to deny my name. I went there and bought the things, Mr. Wood asked me who I came from, and I said from Mr. Wild's - when I returned I did not see her, and hid them in a heap of turf. I did not see her till the morning, then asked her to go with me, and I would give her the articles? she said No, she could not stop, for she was going to Isleworth for greens, but when she came back she would. I watched her back, and asked her again, but she said,</p>
               <p>"You are not going to bring me into any scrawl," and did not go with me. I fetched them, and gave them to her before a witness, Mr. Field.</p>
               <p>Q. They went on purpose to see what passed - A. Yes. When I put them into her hands she said it was a fine present, and then my father and the constable took her. She held them in her hands all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Never threw them down - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say,</p>
               <p>"It is a fine present, but I know nothing about it." - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been questioned about the note before - A. Yes, directly I came home Mr. Wood came to me, and I denied it. I did not give the prisoner the change.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you - A. Nearly fifteen. I never had a sovereign in my possession - I did not tell Mr. Wood that I found the handkerchiefs and the gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never offer to give Sarah Weven a purse - A. No. I am sure I never had a sovereign.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you had the note, you had heard of the prisoner's being taken up for the robbery - A. Yes. I gave Mr. Wood 4 s. 6 d., besides the note, because she told me.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Wood charged you with it you told him you knew nothing about it, and that you was never in his shop in your life - A. Yes, and next morning I told this story.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know in March that the Uxbridge note was stolen - A. Yes, and I heard that a young woman of a fair complexion was suspected.</p>

On the 21st of April, about ten minutes before five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming out of my yard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170021"/>with two pieces of mahogany on his shoulder; I was dressing myself at the time, and called to my boy, who slept in the adjoining room. I dressed myself, and followed him down the City-road; he went to a house in Smith's-buildings, and was in the act of putting it down the cellar, when I seized him, and charged him with taking it out of my yard. He begged to be let go - I knew it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. Is not your yard open - A. No. I found some more of my property in the cellar.</p>

I was knocked down by a fist - I was hurt in more places than one; I received a blow in my face, my arm and breast were also bruised - I was rendered insensible at the time. When I came to myself I found a crowd collected round me, and requested that I might have assistance home. I got home to Wellington-street, Goswell-street, about eleven o'clock, but was detained sometime at the watch-house for a coach. I was quite alone, and had given offence to no person. When I got to the watch-house I found I had lost my hat and a pocket-book containing a check on Messrs. Barclay and Co., drawn by Messrs. Wyatt and Son for 4 l. 4 s. 6 d. I caused notice to be sent to the bankers' before the house was open in the morning, and saw the check next day at the Mansion House. I cannot say I was perfectly sober, but could go home very well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Were you not very drunk - A. I was not - I knew what I was about as well as I do now. M'Combie went home with me - I got to bed myself without any person's assistance. The check was dated in February, I do not remember what day. My own name was endorsed on it; it was in my pocket-book when I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>DAVID M'COMBIE. I am street-keeper of Houndsditch. On the 18th of April, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was nearly opposite Aldgate church, a boy said some person had been robbed; I ran down, and found the prosecutor most dreadfully cut and all over blood - he was standing up without his hat, and a mob round him. I conceive this to have been about twenty-five minutes before nine. I took him to the watch-house, and found 22 l. in his breeches-pocket. He was rather fresh, but still sensible - he remained there till ten o'clock, I then took him home in a coach. He spoke quite reasonable; and complained of losing his pocket-book, with a check for 4 l. 4 s. 6 d. on Messrs. Barclay and Co., and gave orders to his wife to stop payment of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask if he was robbed, or did he tell you - A. Immediately as I came up he said he had been robbed, but did not describe the parties. I asked him if he had been seen by any girls? as he was near where girls walk. I found him opposite St. Mary Axe. I took him to the watch-house for protection.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said that you went home with him because he was so drunk - A. No doubt I have, and I said on account of the state he was in I doubted whether he had lost a pocket-book at all. The place he was robbed at is farther down than where the women frequent.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How do you know where he was robbed - A. I saw him coming up for a good way farther down. He was quite sensible to know what he was about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could the bruises on his face have arisen from the fall - A. No, it must have been from personal violence.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Barclay and Co. On the morning of the 19th of April orders were given to stop payment of a particular check, and about eleven o'clock, or ten minutes after, the prisoner brought the check and presented it to me. I asked him of whom he received it? he said he received it of a person, whom he would fetch. Wishing him not to suspect there was any reason for questioning him, I told him it was a good one. I said to the person next to me,</p>
               <p>"This is the check which is stopped" - the prisoner might have heard it. He was requested to walk to the back of the house, he did so, and I remained at my station. We sent to the prosecutor - Mr. Higgins, of the firm of Messrs. Hale and Co. came - an officer afterwards came. I marked the check before it left my hand, and delivered it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not his first question,</p>
               <p>"I want to know whether this is a good check" - A. It was not. After saying he would fetch the person, he said,</p>
               <p>"I hope it is not forged;" I said it was good.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I was sent for to Messrs. Barclays'. I received the check and produce it; it is dated the 15th of February - I took the prisoner into custody there; he told me he took it of a man whom he had dealings with for some goods; that he did not know his name, nor where he lived, but if I would go with him he would be at his house by twelve o'clock. I took him to the Mansion House, and sent an extra constable, named Esketh, to his house - according to the direction he gave it was No. 2 or 8, at the bottom of Lemon-row, Lemon-street, Goodman's-fields; this was about eleven o'clock in the morning - Esketh returned to me at the Mansion House about one. I went there myself about four o'clock - it is a small private house with two rooms; the lower window was shut up, and a girl was going out - no business whatever appeared to be going on. He produced a publican from Rosemary-lane at his examination, and at his request he was examined.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went to the house some hours after he was apprehended - A. Yes; no name was on the door.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you find any goods in the house - A. None packed up - I found a piece of calico and some waistcoating, and binding for bed furniture; also a pair of womens' shoes, in different drawers. He said they were the goods he sold for the check, and that he had sold several of the waistcoat-pieces before to some other people, and had been taken in with them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the evening of the robbery, from four o'clock in the afternoon till eleven o'clock at night, with the exception of a few minutes, I was at one house. I got up on the following morning at-half-past seven o'clock. Having quarrelled with my wife we were separated, and I had a girl to mind the house. I went into Brick-lane for my father, who I do business for. I have been in the habit of purchasing rope from the ships in the docks, and on this morning I received the check from a man whom I frequently sold rope to before. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170023"/>came to my house - my father is very ill, and does not attend to business. I returned that morning to breakfast, the girl told me the man had been, and while I was at breakfast he came and asked if I had any rope? and said he had bought some a day or two before - he said he wanted half a hundred weight. I had the linen, waistcoat-pieces, and shoes on the sideboard; he bought them of me for 2 l. 4 s., and asked if I could give him the difference of a check? I said I would ask my father if he would take it. I went and saw my father at breakfast, he said he would not take it. Being anxious to sell the rope I asked my sister to lend me a pound or two; she could not, but advised me to go to Mr. Wright, the baker - he was not at home, but his wife advised me to go to the banking-house to enquire about it. I left the man whom I took it of at the corner of the Minories, and went to the banking-house - it was the first check I ever presented, and went to the wrong counter. I laid it on the counter, the gentleman said,</p>
               <p>"Who presented this check?" I said</p>
               <p>"I did, I will thank you to inform me if that person keeps cash at your house." He said it was a good check, and I was asked to walk backwards. When at the Mansion House I asked Mr. Wolley to state the exact time he was robbed, he said ten o'clock, and M'Combie corrected him. I proved I was at a different place.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Barclays, and was at the counter when the prisoner presented the check. I did not hear the conversation between him and Mr. Dunford; the conversation I heard was between him and Mr. Barnes, another clerk. He presented the check to Dunford, who spoke to Barnes, and desired him to introduce the prisoner to one of the principals. I went into the inner room soon after, and asked him how he came by the check? he said he received it of a man who came to the house that morning to purchase some articles in which he dealt, that he called a second time, and he not being conversant with checks, was not willing to part with the goods till he ascertained that it was a good one, and that he had desired the man to come again in about two hours for the goods. The prisoner said he hoped the check was not forged, I said it was not, and he expressed himself much relieved. I told him a person had been robbed the preceding evening, and it would be necessary that he should assist in tracing the delinquent, which he expressed himself ready to do. I kept him in conversation till Brown came. He said he was unwilling to take any check, and particularly one that was dated so far back.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he tell you the man came with him to the corner of the Minories - A. No. I think he said something about having shewn it to his father.

            . I live at No. 2, Dock-street, Rosemary-lane, and am the prisoner's sister. On the morning he was taken up he came about nine o'clock to my father's house, and asked him to cash the check - my father looked at it, and noticed the date; it was the 15th of April, and this was on the 19th.</p>
               <p>Q. Take time to recollect yourself; what was the date of the check - A. It was the 15th of April - I do not positively say so. My father said he would not take a check of anybody, unless he knew them. It was for 4 l. 4 s. 6 d. I could swear to the check if I saw it. He then asked me to lend him some money, as he had sold goods and wanted the change. I advised him to go to Wright's. He went away. (Looks at the check) - this is it, I am sure. I was mistaken in the date.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You are positive that is the check - A. Yes, I noticed it. My father is not here - he is ill - he is scarcely out of bed two days together. He was in bed this morning.</p>
               <p>Q.He can get up early - A. He is obliged, as he cannot afford to lay abed.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he out last - A. On Monday. He deals in coals, and buys rope at the Docks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mother at home when he brought the check - A. Yes, she was in the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your mother knew of his bringing the check - A. Not till after he was taken. My father was at breakfast in the parlour behind the shop. My mother was busy, and saw nothing of it. My brother said he had sold the rope to this man. He kept a little servant girl about twelve years of age, she left the day after he was taken, as his wife came from the country. He only kept a servant when his wife was out.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know where he was on the night of the 18th of April - A. I do, it was Friday; I first saw him between three and four o'clock in my skittle-ground, with a great many more people - I was in and out serving them. I did not lose sight of him, to the best of my knowledge, till a quarter before nine o'clock, and then he came into the taproom, and staid there till half-past eleven. He was out a few minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. You have sworn you did not lose sight of him - A. I did not to my knowledge. My reason for remembering it is because I had a precept served on me between nine and ten o'clock to attend at Hicks's Hall, and he was in the taproom then. The people played for porter, and I took it to them. The prisoner payed for three or four pints. I went to the Mansion House at the first and second examination, which was three days after the 18th I believe.

            . I am a carman, and generally use Gavill's house - I live within two doors of him. I did not hear of the prisoner's being apprehended for eight or ten days afterwards; Gavill was the first person that spoke to me about it. I then remembered having been in company with the prisoner in the skittle-ground on the 18th. I am quite sure it was the 18th, for I earned 3 s. 4 d. that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that an uncommon thing - A. Yes. I had to give three months credit for the money; I went to Gavill's about half-past five o'clock; a man named Davis, and Green, Lloyd and the prisoner were there - the prisoner was not out of my sight till I left the ground, which was about a quarter before nine o'clock. I then went into the house, and he also went into the house with Green and Lloyd. I staid there a short time, and then went to look at my horses - it was neither dark or light.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the prisoner committed when Gavill spoke to you - A. I cannot say - it was between light and dark when we went into the house, but I am sure there was daylight enough to see a man's face. I left the house in about ten minutes, it was hardly light then. It was as light as when I came into Court now - (quarter-past nine o'clock.)</p>
               <p>Q. If anybody told you that you were playing two hours after sunset, you would say that was false - A. I do not say I should. It wanted about ten minutes to nine by the taproom clock when I went in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there any light in the taproom - A. Two candles.</p>
               <p>Q. How much does it cost to keep a horse and cart - A. About one guinea a week. I keep four carts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think 3 s. 4 d. a great deal to earn - A. Sometimes I earn nothing - I remarked in the skittle-ground that I had earned 3 s. 4 d. I frequently saw the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Gavill tell you - A. He said Davis was apprehended for robbing a gentleman, that was all he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to know it was on Tuesday the 18th, when he mentioned no day - A. He said no more. It was mentioned at Gavill's house four days after that it was Tuesday, the 18th - Green and two or three others mentioned it, they said they believed the man was there at the time, and I said I knew he was; Green said he could not tell what he was taken up for. I remember I had carted a puncheon of rum that day, looked at my book, and saw it was the 18th; Green said he had seen it in the paper, but he did not know what it was for - he did not know what he had robbed him of. I could not walk from Gavill's to the bottom of Houndsditch in five minutes. I should think it would take fifteen.</p>

            . I am a carman; I have often seen the prisoner at Gavill's. Gavill told me of his being taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gavill himself tell you - A. Yes, some men were talking about it in his house, he was one, and asked me if I remembered playing at skittles with him? I did not at first recollect the day, but I remembered having loaded cork that day, went to my book, and found it was the 18th of April. I had carried six bundles of work for Pickford's in Fore-street, and I had carried none there for two years before. I went to Gavill's about half-past five o'clock that day, and played at skittles; I played three rubs with the prisoner, and left the ground at dark, I should think it was very little after eight o'clock - we could not see to play. I believe I left the prisoner on the ground - I went out at the side door, and stood at the front door which leads into the house. I stood there about twenty minutes, then went in, and sat talking to the prisoner and others in the house - he was smoking his pipe, and sat on my left hand, four others sat on my right. I remained there till near ten o'clock; the prisoner was not out of my sight long enough to have gone to Houndsditch - I should think it would take him twenty minutes or half an hour.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was he in the ground when you went - A. He was. I did not see him leave the ground, for it was so dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have gone to Houndsditch during the twenty minutes you was at the door - A. He must have passed me to have gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the 18th was it that Gavill talked about this - A. About a fortnight after. Lloyd and I were present when he spoke of it, but Press was not; I think he said he was taken up for a check - he did not tell me that he had been to the Mansion House about it. I never read about it in the newspaper, nor never told any one that I had.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. You frequent the house, and do not particularly notice the company in the room - A. No. Press never read the newspaper to me. Nobody ever told me they read it in the newspaper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You frequent the house - A. Yes, most every evening. I heard nothing of this for a fortnight after. When Gavill told me of it, he said it was on the 18th of April.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170025"/>Q. What did you get for carrying the cork - A.6 s. 8 d. - it was a bad day's work. I saw Lloyd there, but heard nothing about what he had earned. Press did not say what he had earned, I am sure of that - he said nothing about 3 s. 4 d. I went to the house almost every evening. I left the skittle-ground a little past eight o'clock.</p>

On the 6th of May, about ten o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner with another man who walked away - the prisoner had three pieces of lead tied in an apron.

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On the 13th of May, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was at Blackwall, and saw the prisoners coming from where Mr. Brocklebank's rafters lay; Haggerty had a bag on her head, containing 23 lbs. of raft-rope - Mahoney was six or seven yards behind her. Haggerty had a case-knife in her hand, which she endeavoured to throw away as soon as I took her, I asked her where she got the rope from? she said she picked it up in the mud, but directly after she said she cut it from the rafters - it appeared fresh cut. I examined the knife, and found it had fresh tar on the edge, as if it had been used in cutting rope. Mahoney said she was to receive part of the profit on it.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutor's service up to the time the prisoners were apprehended, and saw them come from the raft with the bag. I saw the rope safe between six and seven o'clock, and when I saw them coming I found it cut in three different places. They had been cut the week before, and I replaced them.</p>

I saw the prisoner in the farm-yard there, he brought another young man with him. The farming man went into the stable, and while he was putting the saddle on the colt, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Who takes the money?" Skinner, the farming man, said,</p>
               <p>"the gardener will." The price of the colt was 15 l., the prisoner immediately pulled a 10 l. and a 5 l. Bank note out of his pocket, I asked him to put his name on them, he said he was no scholar. I told him to come round to the garden-shed and I would mark them.

            , Holloway," which I wrote on both the notes, and the date - (looks at two) - these are them. He said he bought it for his brother, who lived at Hampstead. While I was writing his name on the notes I said there were many bad notes about; he said,</p>
               <p>"Is there? I have all my notes from the Bank." He took away the colt, and I took the money. He said he paid away a deal of money both in town and country, and that he was well known at Holloway. I put the notes into my pocket, went into the stable, and kept them nearly two months; I then gave them to Mrs. Clark - I kept them till she came to town.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you gave them to her did you learn anything respecting them - A. A few days after I heard they were bad; I then made diligent enquiry for the prisoner, but could get no intelligence of him. I enquired at Hampstead, but did not find that his brother lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, in conversation with you, say he had agreed with any one in town about the colt - A. I asked him if he had agreed with anybody? he said he had agreed with a tall young man in Shoreditch. Mrs. Clark's son is grown up, but is not very tall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The prisoner was a stranger - A. Yes. I first saw him in the farmyard; he had spoken to Skinner about the colt before he spoke to me. He gave the notes into my hand, and I immediately wrote on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your question,</p>
               <p>"What name shall I put on the notes" - A. Yes. I am sure I put down the address he gave me. I enquired at Hampstead for a person named Mills. I asked at one public-house, and enquired of several people passing by. I had no other 5 l. or 10 l. note in my possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was the prisoner with you - A. Between five and ten minutes. I saw him again when he was in custody. We had very little conversation. He told me he had sold Mr. Clark a horse about two years ago. I am quite sure he is the person. I think he had a blue coat on.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mrs. Clark, as farming-man. The prisoner came to me in the early part of January and saw the colt, he took her away next day.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came the first day what did he say - A. He came into the yard, and said</p>
               <p>"You have got a colt to sell?" I said Yes. He asked to see it; I said it was out in the field just by. I went with him, he liked the colt very well, said it was a pretty colt, and asked the price? I told him 15 l.; he said he could not give that money, but would give 13 l. I said I would not sell it for less, as that was the price, and told him he must go to town to Mr. Clark, and see if he would take less. As he was going out of the yard he said to me,</p>
               <p>"I will give you 10 s. more." I said I could not take less. He came next day about twelve o'clock, he had a porter with him; he said,</p>
               <p>"I am come for the colt." I said,</p>
               <p>"You have bought it, have you?" he said Yes. I said</p>
               <p>"What did you give?" he said 15 l. I said,</p>
               <p>"Did you see Mr. Clark?" he said, Yes. I said the colt was out in the field. He asked me for a halter, and said my master told him I had halters to put on the colt - I said I would fetch one. He then said,</p>
               <p>"Shall I and the man go and fetch the colt out of the field into the yard?" I said Yes, and they did so. He asked who was to take the money? I said the gardener, and fetched him - I did not see him pay him. I put the halter and bridle on the colt while he went to pay the money, and delivered it to his man, they then went away - the prisoner followed behind with a whip.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was it before you saw him again - A. Last Wednesday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you a good deal of conversation with him - A. Yes. I have no doubt at all of his being the man - I know him as well as I know my own brother. He had a blue coat and blue apron on.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the Crown and Sceptre, public-house, in Golden-lane, on the 14th of April, and saw the prisoner standing in the entry, talking to another man. As soon as we came in, and got towards the prisoner and the other, the prisoner went out at the side door - I went out after him, fetched him back, and asked his name? he said it was Miller. I asked him where he lived? he said in Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell. I asked him what trade he was? he said he was a dealer. I then unbuttoned his coat, put my hand into his waistcoat pocket, and found 13 s. in silver. I asked him if he had any more money? he said No. I put my hand into his fob, and there found two notes, one good and the other bad. I then said,</p>
               <p>"Vann, lay hold of him, he has some bad notes." I gave these notes to the landlady, Mrs. Potter, and made her mark them in his presence - I also marked them myself. I then saw Vann take out of the prisoner's left-hand breast coat pocket four other notes. I gave them to Mrs. Potter also - she marked them in our presence - (looks at them) - these are them. I asked him of whom he got them? he said he was a dealer, and took them in trade, but he did not know of whom. I went with him to Aylesbury-street, but could find no such person there.

            . I have been an inspector of the Bank for twenty-five years. The 10 l. note is forged in every respect, paper, plate, and signature. It bears the name of C. Watts, but is not his writing; he is not a cashier, and is not authorized to sign 10 l. notes - there is no other clerk of his name. The 5 l. note is also forged in every respect, and bears the name of J. Vantine, we have no such person; we have a Vautin, it is not his signature - he only signs 1 l. notes. The five 1 l. notes are all forged in every respect, are off one plate, and bear the same kind of water-mark - they are not the signatures of the clerks whose names they purport to bear. All the notes have the same water-mark - the paper is of the same fabric.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live at No. 18, Suffolk-street, West, St. Pancras. On the 13th of March I became acquainted with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. In any after-dealings with them had you directions from the Bank - A. Yes, my first connection with them was not by the direction of the Bank, I did afterwards communicate with them by direction of the Bank, and all future transactions were by that direction.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday, the 16th of March, was anything given you by Mr. Fish - A. A 1 l. note - he is one of the inspectors of the Bank - it was for the purpose of purchasing forged 1 l. notes of the prisoner, Gardiner, who lived at No. 13 or 15, Rose-street, Covent-garden; the female prisoner lived in the same house with him. I went, gave the 1 l. note to Gardiner, and told him I wanted two of the best, or three of the common, if he had not got the best.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by the common or best - A. Forged notes. There are two sorts, as he had informed me; that the best was 8 s. a piece and the common 5 s. I was to have 1 l. notes. Harrison was present at the time I spoke of the notes. He said he could supply me with three of the common at 5 s. each, but he had none of the best. He told me I should mark or blot them with ink, and be very cautious how I passed them, for nineteen out of twenty went to the Bank. I gave him the 1 l. note I received of Fish. We were to meet again that evening between six and seven o'clock. I was to have three notes - he gave me 5 s. change. It was in the afternoon when I paid him for them. I think I went with him to Burn's, the Sun, public-house, Windmill-street. I saw him again the same evening - I think it was at the Sun; we met there for me to have the three notes. After we had sat drinking there sometime, he told me to put my hand down; I put my hand down on the seat by the side of us, and he put some paper into my hand; I put it into my breeches-pocket, and shortly after we parted. I am not certain that this was on the 16th, but it was the same evening that I gave him the note. I went home, and in my bed-room I took the notes out of my pocket, put them into a small box on my mantle-shelf, got up in the morning, and took them to the Crown tavern, Clerkenwell-green, and delivered them to Foy in the presence of Mr. Christmas, having first marked them myself - (looks at three) - these are them. I first marked them with the number of the note, and then the letter S.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see either of them again - A. I went again next day, the 17th, early in the day; Wales, an officer of Bow-street, went with me to Rose-street; he parted with me, and saw me enter Gardiner's house. I saw Harrison; she said Gardiner was not in, but I might find him at the Sun, in Windmill-street. I went and enquired there for him; he was not there. I saw him that day at his own house, and purchased three notes of him for 15 s. I paid him 10 s. in silver, and 5 s. in copper. I delivered the copper to Harrison. Gardiner was not by at the time. I was to have the notes at the usual time, which was between six and seven o'clock. I was to apply at Rose-street to see Gardiner; I saw him at the time appointed, and had the three notes of him, in his own room; he took them from the cuff of his coat, and marked them with a pin, at the end of the word</p>
               <p>"England;" he said they would then appear to have been filed from the Bank, for all notes had a hole in that place. I took these notes to the Crown, and delivered them to Christmas and Foy - (looks at three) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see him - A. On the Saturday afternoon. I am not sure whether Wales was with me that day. I went to his house and saw Harrison, and asked her when Gardiner would be in; she said she did not know; and, after having some conversation together, she asked if I wanted to do anything that evening? I said Yes: I wanted to go to work. She asked how many I wanted? I replied, two. I paid her 10 s.; she took a piece of whitey-brown paper out of her pocket, containing a great number of notes; after looking them over on the table, she picked out two for me, and said</p>
               <p>"these are two very good one's;" wrote on the front of each, and then delivered them to me. I went to the Crown tavern, Clerkenwell-green, and delivered them to Foy; these are them - (looks at three) - there is</p>
               <p>"Hilman, Brownlow-street," written on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with her respecting another person - A. I said I had a companion that was helping me to pass these notes, and I wished to introduce him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170028"/>into the company the next time I came. I cannot rightly remember what she said then; the next dealing I had with her was on the 21st.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on the 21st, did you go alone - A. I was accompanied by

                  Thomas

            ; I went into the house in Rose-street, leaving Liberter in the street; he was introduced to me by Foy, Wales, and Christmas, for the purpose of seeing the transaction between me and Gardiner. I went in; Harrison was at home. I asked for Gardiner; she said he was not in, but would be home between one and two o'clock. I left, and found Liberter in the street, where I left him. I went at the time appointed, accompanied by Liberter. I went alone into the house, and saw both the prisoners; after some short discourse, Gardiner said, he would take me to the man he got them from; he took me through a passage, by his own house, to the Red Lion public-house. I do not know the street; he went out two or three times, returned, and said he could not introduce me into the man's company to deal with instead of himself, but I had better have half a score. He had two in his hand, which I had paid him for before, he looked at them, said these are prime one's and he asked if I knew what to do respecting the wire-mark. I said, No. He then took a silver tooth-pick from his pocket, made a hole in each note, and said they then appeared to have been filed, as all Bank-notes were filed in that place. I took them to the Crown tavern, and delivered them to Foy, in the presence of Christmas, after first marking them - (looks at them) - these are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. On Wednesday, the 22d of March, were you at the Crown tavern - A. Yes - Wales, Christmas, Foy, and Liberter, were there. I was searched by Wales - I had nothing but a 6 d. in my possession; a 1 l. note, and, I think, 2 l. in silver, was given to me, but I am not positive. I went to Gardiner's house with Liberter and Wales. I went into the house, and left them in Rose-street. Liberter followed me, and passed as I went in at the door; and Wales was at the end of the street. I cannot remember whether I had any transactions there then, or who were there. Gardiner, I now remember, accompanied me from his house to the Sun. He asked how many I wanted; I told him seven or eight, or half a score. He asked if I had got the blunt, meaning the money. I belive I said I had. He said,</p>
               <p>"Have you two ten?" I understood this to mean 2 l. 10 s.; and at the door of the Sun I gave him a 1 l. note that I had received of Mr. Christmas. I gave him 10 s. in silver, and was about giving him the remainder, when he said,</p>
               <p>"I have enough." We then went into the Sun; and after being in company some time, he went out, returned again, and shortly after said,</p>
               <p>"Put your hand down, here are three and your own back."</p>
               <p>Q. What was that - A. Three forged notes, and the Bank-note I paid him, as he had not got half a score. I put the paper into my breeches-pocket, returned to the Crown immediately, opened it, and found the 1 l. note I paid him and three forged notes. I marked each note - (looks at three) - these are them. He said, If I would come next day, he would complete the half score. I am not sure whether I did not ask him if I could not get them from him at home. I think he said No, it was dangerous, and he never kept any in his house. I saw him again the following day, accompanied by Liberter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any dealing with him on the 23d of March - A. I bought one note of him; I think it was at the Sun. I gave it to Foy, after marking it - (looks at one) - this is it. I then owed him 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Liberter between the 23d of March and the 10th of April - A. I had not, nor had I seen the prisoners. On the 10th of April, I went with Liberter to Gardiner's house; he was at home; and after waiting sometime, I said,</p>
               <p>"I owe you some silver." He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, you owe me 10 s." I paid him the 10 s., gave him 10 s. more, and told him I wanted two notes; and, at the same time, Liberter gave him 6 s. and said he wanted one. He returned Liberter 1 s. and said,</p>
               <p>"You have given me a shilling too much." We all three went to a public house in Rose-street; left that and went to another house, next door to his own; and after being there sometime, he called me out, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here is ten I will complete the order to-morrow." I put them into my breeches-pocket. I gave them to Foy and Christmas, at the Crown; I never opened them till I got there; and then found there were fifteen - (looks at them) - these are them. Before I went to the Crown, I went to his house, and told 
               <persName id="t18200517-57-person619">Harrison</persName>
             I had got ten from Gardiner, and to tell him to get the other half score, as I was to complete the score by to-morrow; we were to meet the following day.</p>

               <p>Q. On the following day, before you went, was any thing given you by Christmas - A. Yes; I had two 1 l. notes, and 2 l. in silver; and Liberter had 5 s. in copper. I and Liberter went to Gardiner's house together, and saw both the prisoners. I got in conversation with Gardiner, and asked how many he gave me last night; he said,</p>
               <p>"I gave you fifteen." I said,</p>
               <p>"You said there were only ten, but, when I opened them, I found fifteen." I gave him the two 1 l. notes and 2 l. in silver I received from Christmas, and Liberter gave him the 5 s. in copper which was left on the table. Shortly after he received the money from me, Wales and Jefferson came in, followed by Christmas and Foy.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you pay him 4 l. 5 s. - A. It was for the score of notes; nothing was mentioned about the other five, because the officer came in.</p>

            . I live in Captain's-walk, Vine-street, Narrow-wall, Lambeth. I am a labourer, and deal in coal and corn, or any thing that comes up the River. I was requested by Wales, the police-officer, to employ myself in detecting the prisoner. He directed me to Christmas, Foy, and Saul. On the 20th of March, I went with Saul to the end of Rose-street. Saul returned to me at the end of Rose-street. I went to the prisoner's house with him again that evening; he left me at the corner of the street; remained in the house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, or little longer, then joined me again. I do not know where he joined me; we went to Clerkenwell, and saw Christmas and Foy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany Saul next day, the 21st - A. Yes, we went to the prisoner's house again, and waited at the corner of Rose-street. I saw him go into the prisoner's house and come out again; he joined me in about half an hour. I do not recollect whether we went again this day or not. I think I and Saul went to the Rising Sun, in Windmill-street. I do not remember seeing Gardiner on this day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any of your visits to Rose-street see Gardiner - A. The first time I saw him was on the 28th, at his own house - that was the first day that I went into the house. I took a letter which Christmas and Foy wrote. I saw Harrison when I first went in, but Gardiner was not there, and I gave her the letter, said I had got a letter from Mr. Saul, and I was to take what he had written for; she said</p>
               <p>"Gardiner is not within, if you step in in half an hour, he will be in to his tea." I left the letter and money with her. I saw a 1 l. note and 10 s. put in it. I went again in half an hour, he was then at tea - he said,</p>
               <p>"Stop a bit, I will take a walk with you;" he asked me where Saul was, and what had happened. I told him he had sprained his ankle at the Black Horse, Tottenham-court-road. He went out, and I followed him - he said he was going to see about the things. We went together to near St. Giles's church; as we went along he said,</p>
               <p>"I must call in at a friend's house, just wait a bit, and I will come to you." He returned me the money I gave him, and the letter. I asked him if the things were in there which he had written for - he said No. He left me by St. Giles's church, to call at his friend's. I saw no more of him that evening. I saw him again next day at his own house; he said I missed you last night, and did not fall in with you again. I went up to St. Martin's-lane with him, and then we parted. I asked him if he had got anything yet; he said No, he had not, they were not come out of the country, and that he had got orders then for fifty fives, besides others; we appointed to meet next evening, as he said he expected them to come by the six o'clock coach. I called next evening - I saw 
               <persName id="t18200517-57-person622">Harrison</persName>
             every time I called. I saw her that evening, she said she expected he was at Brown's, the Rising Sun, Windmill-street. I do not recollect that I found him that night. I went next day or the day after, but do not recollect that I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any dealings with him for notes - A. I had, on the 4th of April I went to his house between six and seven o'clock in the evening, Harrison opened the door; she said,</p>
               <p>"Do you want anything to-night?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I was to have half a score, but I can't take more than five to-night." She went to the table drawer, took a paper parcel, which contained a great many notes, and said I will pick you out five good ones; which she did, and told me they were good ones. I asked her how much they were - she said 1 l. 5 s. I gave her a 1 l. note and 5 s. in silver, which I had received from Foy and Christmas (I had returned them the money that was in the letter when I came back). I had not put the notes into my pocket when Gardiner came in himself. I said</p>
               <p>"What sort are these?" I gave them out of my hand. He said,</p>
               <p>"They are very good ones - they are all of the 10th." He turned them over, and looked at each. Harrison still remained in the room. He gave them into my hand, and I put them into my pocket. He said to me,</p>
               <p>"Mind, and be cautious in passing them - don't offer two in one shop;" and then said,</p>
               <p>"Jane, has he given you any money?" She said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, 1 l. 5 s." He said that was all right, and nothing more passed. I took the notes that evening to Christmas and Foy, and marked them T. L. before I delivered them - (looks at the notes) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. On the 6th, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I went to his house, he was not at home. Harrison said I should find him at the Rising Sun, in Windmill-street. I went there, found him, and stopped sometime with him; we then returned back to his own house, and there I got four notes from him. I gave him 20 s. in silver for them - (looks at four) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find at the house - A. When I went indoors he shewed me a piece of brown paper, and said</p>
               <p>"Here are these things." When we got in a strange man was there; Gardiner then went to the window-shutter, took out a paper, then went into the passage, putting his hands behind him, and gave me the notes. I went to the Crown, neither Christmas nor Foy were there. I took them home, they remained in my breeches-pocket unopened, and next morning I went to the Crown, and delivered them up to Foy and Christmas, having first marked them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. On the 8th, at ten o'clock in the morning, at his own house; Harrison was in bed in the same room. I said I was come for some more; he said,</p>
               <p>"Jane, where are these things?" she said,</p>
               <p>"They are under the floorcloth, near the fire-place in the front parlour." He stooped down, and picked up something wrapped in paper; he opened it, shewed me the notes, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here are three prime ones, give me 15 s." I did so - there were only three in the paper. He and I then went to Long-acre together, he was going to Covent-garden-market. We wished each other good-by after having a glass of liquor. He said,</p>
               <p>"Did Saul tell you he owed me any silver?" I said</p>
               <p>"Yes, he told me of it; you need not be afraid of the money, you will have it on Monday. He said Saul owed him 10 s.; that he was not afraid, but he did not know whether he had mentioned it or not. I marked the three notes, and gave them to Christmas and Foy at the Bank - (looks at three) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you meet again - A. On the 10th of March; Saul was with me. We went to Gardiner's house between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170030"/>not at home; we went to the Sun, he was not there; we returned to his house, and he was then at home. I lent Saul 4 s. to make up enough for two. Saul asked for a score. I do not know what passed. We then went out. He wanted us to go to another house, which we objected to. He then called Saul out - I had seen Saul give him the money, and I gave him 6 s. for one - he said,</p>
               <p>"You have given me 1 s. too much." Saul said,</p>
               <p>"I owe you some silver" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, you owe me 10 s.," and Saul paid him. We were to have the notes next night; we returned to the Crown, Clerkenwell. We went next night, and took 2 l. 5 s. in silver and two 1 l. notes; we saw both the prisoners at the house; Saul said,</p>
               <p>"Do you know what notes you gave me last night?" Gardiner said</p>
               <p>"Fifteen." Saul said,</p>
               <p>"You told me there was only half a score, and when I opened them I found fifteen." Saul said he had come to pay him for the remainder of the score, and had brought 4 l. 5 s. - he had 4 l., and I had 5 s. in halfpence in my pocket. I gave him the 5 s. in copper, and Saul gave him 4 l. Gardiner said,</p>
               <p>"I will go and get them presently." Harrison was present, and heard what passed. Before he got them the officers came in.</p>

            . I am a police officer. Saul and Liberter were employed by me to assist in detecting the prisoners. On the 17th of March Saul brought me three notes to the Crown, Clerkenwell-green, at eleven o'clock in the morning - I took them in the presence of Christmas. He brought me three more in the evening. He brought two more on the 18th of March, two on the 21st, three on the 22d, at ten at night, and one on the 23d, at ten at night. On the 4th of April Liberter brought me five, and on the morning of the 7th he brought me six. On the 8th he brought me three to the Bank, at twelve o'clock in the day, and on the 10th of April Saul brought me fifteen at twelve o'clock at night; I marked them all. (The witness examined and identified the several notes as he mentioned them.)</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was present on the 11th of April, when the prisoner were apprehended - A. Yes, I went into the house with Wales, Jefferson, and Christmas; the prisoners were there, Saul and Liberter were there also - the prisoners were sitting by the fire. Wales went up to Gardiner, took something off the floor, held it in his hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" Gardiner said,</p>
               <p>"I do not know, it belongs to these men (pointing to Saul and Liberter), if they are doing anything wrong it is more than I know." Saul and Liberter were sitting by him in a chair. I said,</p>
               <p>"Who are these men?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I do not know who they are." I asked Harrison if she knew who they were? she said No. We searched the prisoners, found nothing material on them, and took them to Marlborough-street. I left Wales and Jefferson to search the house. On taking them to the office I asked Gardiner what he knew of the two men we found there? he said he did not know either of them; that they came in just before we did, and the short man (Saul) asked him to look at two Bank notes for him, and to give him two notes for 2 l. worth of silver. I asked him if he had any money from either of them before? he said he never had. I asked him if he had given them change at any time before? he said he had not. I said,</p>
               <p>"Did not you think it extremely imprudent that a total stranger to you should come into your house and request you to give him notes for silver?" He said that Jane had seen the short man before, when he used to come to the house with girls - (it is used for such purposes). Harrison was present when he made this communication. He said they were both strangers to him, but corrected himself instantly and said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I think I saw them last night at a public-house near my house." Harrison was close to him. After taking this statement in my book, I read it loud enough for her to hear. Gardiner said it was correct, and she did not contradict it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I know Saul and Liberter; I accompanied them to the prisoner's house in Rose-street on the 17th, 18th, 22d, 26th, and 27th of March, and on the 11th of April. I was present when Christmas delivered Liberter some money, at the Crown, on the 28th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this note, and see if you know it - (looks at one) - this is it. I marked it - it was given in my presence (No. 47844, dated 10th of Feb. 1819) - Christmas gave this note in a letter to Liberter. On the 11th of April I accompanied Foy - Saul and Liberter had gone into Gardiner's house about a quarter before eight o'clock. I waited some distance from the house for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, then joined Christmas, Foy, and Jefferson, and went to the house; I went in first, and was followed by Jefferson. On my entering the house I saw Gardiner sitting by the fire, and immediately made up to him. I saw him draw his left hand back from towards his thigh, and while I was in the act of taking hold of his hand, something dropped from his hand on the floor, I picked it up, and asked him what he had got there? he said it was what those men had brought - (looking round at Saul and Liberter) - and that if they were doing anything wrong he did not know it. I examined the paper. and found it contained the money that had been marked by me that day, and which I had given to Saul at the Crown - it contained two 1 l. notes and 2 l. in silver; a 5 s. paper of halfpence laid on the table.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Except on the day you took them into custody you was not in the house - A. I was not.</p>

            . I am in partnership with Mr. Lovel; we are grocers, and live in New-street, Covent-garden - the prisoner, Gardiner, was a customer of ours, he also paid us the rent of his house, which we receive for a gentleman in the country. On the 6th of April I received 17 l. 9 s. of him - 15 l. for rent and 2 l. 9 s. for grocery; it was paid by a woman, but I cannot say whether it was Harrison or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these 1 l. notes, Nos. 51633 and 47844, and say if they form part of that payment - A. They do both. I marked them</p>

            's business, and that he wanted twenty-four head-stall collars, six pair of overall chains, twelve cavalry feathers and cases, twelve pair of spurs and twelve pair of spur-leathers; he said he wanted them for Captain 
               <persName id="t18200517-58-person636">Lacon</persName>
            's troops - they were to be sent to the Yarmouth Arms, Thames-street, and he was to receive them there to take to Yarmouth. We have served Captain

             ever since 1817. He was very urgent to get them off, and said the troop could not go on duty without them. I have authority to execute all orders, in consequence of which I sent them off on the 17th - I have never seen them since. I then believed them to be for the troop, as I knew the prisoner belonged to it. I saw him the latter end of April, when he was apprehended - they were worth 10 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. At the time you say the things were ordered, to whom did I say they were to be directed - A. To Captain

            , ESQ. I am Captain in the Yarmouth Yeomanry Cavalry, the prisoner had been a sergeant in my corps. He had no authority to order any things for me, he had left the troop. I discharged him the latter end of 1818, or beginning of 1819. I never received the goods - he was perfectly unknown to me at the time. The troop was not in want of them. He was discharged by being struck off the rolls, and sending for his accoutrements. He never was on duty after that, neither would he be permitted.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the prisoner was discharged - A. Certainly.</p>

            , I was authorized by him to order what things might be wanted, but I have never ordered anything since. I never did receive any things at the Yarmouth Arms.</p>

            . I am in the Town Clerk's Office. I had been to Somerset House; and in returning through Temple-Bar with a friend, I saw Mr. Webb and a young woman with him; it was on the Strand side. In going through the arch, I saw a handkerchief partly out of his pocket. There were only two persons between Mr. Webb and us. Suspecting them, I watched them, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from Mr. Webb's pocket; he was then through the arch. Mr. Webb turned shortly round, and I said to him,</p>
               <p>"There is the thief that has got your handkerchief." I did not know what became of his companion, he disappeared. Mr. Webb laid hold of him before he got to Shire-lane, on this side of the Bar. We went as far as Chancery-lane, and delivered him into custody.</p>

On the 29th of April, he had two geese stolen from him; I saw them about twelve o'clock; they were dead, and on the shop-board; they were missed about half an hour afterwards. The prisoner came into the shop and set down; he was known before; he goes about selling poultry. About two minutes after I missed the geese, I went after him; I saw him in Newgate-street and came up with him. I told him he had stolen my master's geese; he threw the basket off his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170032"/>head, and told me to take them back. I told him to take them back, which he did, and I sent for a constable; they were worth 10 s.</p>

While we were below at supper, he saw me wind my watch up and put it in the hammock; he sat with his back against the hammock. When supper was over, all hands were called to put a rope off deck; I went up first, the rest followed; the prisoner came up last. When the rope was put off deck, I put him ashore at King James's Stairs; and directly after landing him, I missed the watch from my hammock. I got Brown, an officer, and found the prisoner, about half past ten o'clock, in Parson's-street, and asked him for my watch; he said he had not got it. Brown collared him, and he instantly pulled it from his pocket, and gave it me.</p>

On the 8th of May, about one o'clock in the day, three men came to the area, looked in the kitchen-passage, and asked if I wanted any wood; only one came down; I said I wanted none; he immediately went up the steps, took the coat from the window on the ground-floor, and ran away. I ran up and called out that somebody had stolen a coat; and as he ran out of the court into the square, he dropped it. Pybus pursued and took the same man who took the coat, and I picked it up.</p>

On the 5th of February, about a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and said he wished to see a hat. I showed him one, and after trying it on, he said he would have another; when he tried that on, he desired me to make out a bill of the two. I went to the desk and made out a bill without a name, and presented it to him, with a receipt; he gave me a 10 l. note; I then asked his name; he said Captain 
               <persName id="t18200517-65-person684">Close</persName>

               <p>"it is the first house you come to on the left hand after you get into the wide part of the street." He gave me a 10 l. Bank note; I took it to the counting-house and wrote Close in front, with my name and the date - (looks at one) - this is it; it has</p>
               <p>"Close, 5-2-20, C. W. B." written on it. I knew there was a Captain

            . I keep a hatter's-shop in New Bond-street. About eight o'clock on the evening of the 9th of February, the prisoner came and bought two hats, which came to 2 l. 19 s. He gave me a 10 l. note; I marked it - (looks at one) - this is it. I marked it before Mr. Freeman, at Bow-street, the following day. He gave me the name of</p>

            , Joy's, Grand Hotel, Covent-garden." There were two or three names on the note when he brought it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mix it with any other note before you marked it - A. No; I laid it on the desk on a 10 l. note, and compared it, which was signed by the same name,</p>
               <p>"Kelsal;" my suspicions arose. In three quarters of an hour I sent the hats according to his direction, and the person who went with them brought them back, saying, there was no such person there. Somebody else afterwards called for them; I delivered them to that person, then let him go, and followed him; he first took them to Richardson's coffee-house; I told him it was Joy's. He then took them to Joy's. We found, by the waiter, he had desired them to be taken in, if they were brought there. I have no doubt of the prisoner's person. I left the note in my money-chest, and kept the key; nobody has access to it but myself; I have no doubt but the note is the same.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Copson, a hatter, in New Bond-street. The prisoner came to my master's shop on the 10th of February, a few minutes before nine o'clock in the evening, and bought two hats, with crape-bands, which came to 3 l. 1 s.; he tendered me a 10 l. Bank note. I asked his name and address, he gave me</p>
               <p>"Lieut. Crow, Golden-cross;" they were to be packed in boxes, and sent there. I wrote on the note, in his presence,</p>
               <p>"Lieut. Crow, 10-2-20" - (looks at one) - this is it; and gave him change. He said, if the hats could be got ready in three quarters of an hour he would call for them in a coach, which he did, and I gave them to him. I saw him again about the 16th of April, and am perfectly clear of his person.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have merely to say that I am quite unprotected, and have not the means of employing Counsel. I have used every means to be allowed to plead Guilty to the minor offence, as others have done; but I must throw myself on the mercy of your Lordship and the Jury, and hope I shall be recommended to mercy by the prosecutors and witnesses. My friends all live in Ireland.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH SIBLEY. I live in White Hart-yard, Drury-lane. On the 27th of April, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my house, and enquired for a person named Cameron, who formerly kept the house. I said I did not know her, but heard such a person had lived there. He said he did not want her, but wanted a person who formerly lodged with her. I called Jordan, my servant, down, who had lived with Cameron, and she called a person who also lodged there with Cameron; she came down, told the prisoner one was dead and other was married, and asked him to give her something to drink? he said he never gave anything away to drink, but he would toss up for half a pint - they tossed, and he lost; he then asked me to change him a 1 l. note, which he produced. I said I had no silver, he went behind the street door, and pulled out a 1 l. note. I heard paper rustle, as if he took it from others; he asked me for a pen and ink, which my servant gave him, he stood by the drawers, wrote his name on it, and gave it to my servant, she went out for change, returned in about three minutes, told him it was a bad one, and that Mr. Poore had kept it. He said he took it at Dover, in change for a 5 l. note. He went with Jordan to the public-house, I followed in about three minutes, and found him detained there. I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Your's is a house where both sexes resort - A. I understand it was so before I came, but it has not been so in my time.</p>
               <p>ERMIN JORDAN. I live with Mrs. Sibley. I remember the prisoner coming to the house a little before six o'clock in the evening on the 27th of April, he gave me a 1 l. note to pay for some gin - he wrote on the right-hand corner of it in my sight, on the drawers; when I got it from him I saw he had written</p>
               <p>"B. Meredith," on it. I went to went to fetch half a pint of gin from Poore's, the young woman said it was bad note, and took it to Mr. Poore, he came and asked me where I took it - I said of a young man. I went back and the prisoner returned with me to Poore's, who asked him where he took the note - he said in Kent, at Dover.</p>

            . I keep the Barley Mow, wine vaults, Drury-lane. I received a note from the last witness, perceived it was bad, and objected to it. The prisoner came in in a few minutes, with two women and Jordan, they said, in his presence, that he wanted to go, but they would not let him, and they brought him to the bar. I asked him where he got the note - I do not recollect what place he first mentioned - he said it was in Kent; some person said, that place is not in Kent. I then asked him what part of Kent - he said Dover; but that was not the first place he mentioned. He said he took it in change. I said I was confident it was a bad one, and could not think of letting the note go.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he said anything to you about it - A.He said he was confident he could bring proof where he got it, and wanted to get it into his possession. I said I could not let it go, and asked him if he had any other note - he said he had no other, nor any money. Two men were outside the bar, I sent one for an officer, and told the other to prevent his going out. I marked the note - (looks at one) - this is it. He said the writing on it was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anything said in his hearing about other notes - A. girl said, in his hearing, that he had other notes about him. This was after he had said he had no other notes or money - he made no answer to that. The officer took him into the back room, searched him, and found 5 l. 6 s. 6 d. in silver, in a bag, and other small articles, on him. About ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after he was taken, my servant,

            , Bow-street, that night. I formerly knew a woman who kept this house, and called to know where Betsey Powell was; they informed me she was married. A female called me in, and asked me to give her some gin - I said I never gave things away. We tossed for some, and I lost. I took the note, wrote B. Meredith on it, and gave it to her. She returned, and I immediately went with her to the house and was detained. I solemnly declare I knew nothing of the five notes found in the tap-room. Is it to be supposed, if I had forged notes, I would have accompanied a woman so far, and not attempt to escape. Upwards of twenty persons, of all characters, were in the house, and might not some of them have dropped them.</p>

            . I am a labourer, in the employ of Mr. Wabbleton, timber-merchant, near Waterloo Bridge. I was first introduced to the prisoner, Gardiner, on the 28th of March, by Saul; he lived at No. 13, Rose-street, Covent-garden. I took a letter to him that day, but did not find him at home - I saw him at home afterwards on that day, and told him I had a letter which Saul had sent me with, and I was to receive what he had written for. He said</p>
               <p>"Where is Saul?" I said he had sprained his ancle, and was not able to get out. He then said,</p>
               <p>"I am going to see about the things, if you will stop a moment I will go with you." I went with him towards St. Giles's church. I got nothing that day, but in going along he returned me the money which I had taken in the letter, screwed up in a piece of the letter. I saw him again next day at his own house; he asked me where I had missed him last night? I said I had missed him. He said it was of no consequence, as he could not get any; he also said</p>
               <p>"There is a man come out of the country for fifty fives, besides other notes, and it is very expensive for him to wait in town, but I cannot get them out of the country." - I got nothing from him that day. On the 4th of April I received five 1 l. forged notes from Harrison, and before I put them into my pocket I shewed them to Gardiner - he said,</p>
               <p>"These are good ones, they are all the 10th" (meaning the date.) He said,</p>
               <p>"Jane, have you got any money?" she said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, 1 l. 5 s." - I had paid her that for the five notes, I had received it from Christmas - (looks at five) - these are them. He said,</p>
               <p>"You must be very cautious how you pass them; do not offer two in one shop whatever you do." On the 6th of April I saw him at the Sun, in Windmill-street. I stopped there sometime, and came out with him, and just before he got to his own door he said</p>
               <p>"Here are the things," and shewed me a brown paper parcel. I went into his room, there was a stranger there, he took a paper from the window, came round, and slipped them into my hands, turning his back to me. I received four from him, and gave him 20 s. in silver for them - (looks at four) - these are them. I then came away. On the 18th, about ten o'clock, I saw him at his house; I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got any more?" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes. Jane, what did you do with those things?" she said,</p>
               <p>"They are under the floor-cloth, near the fire-place in the front parlour." He and I went out of that door, he went into the front parlour, and picked something up from under the floor-cloth wrapped in brown paper - he opened it, and there were three 1 l. notes. He said,</p>
               <p>"They are all prime ones - give me 15 s." which I did; he wrapped them in brown paper, and gave them into my hands. I went with him into Long-acre, had a glass of liquor, and there we parted. (Looks at them) - these are them, they are in the same paper. He asked me if Saul ever told me he owed him any silver? I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, he did; you need not be afraid of the money, you will have it on Monday." He said he was not afraid, but he did not know whether he had told me or not. This was on Saturday. I saw him again on Monday evening, about half-past seven o'clock; Wales and Saul were with me. Saul and I went into the house together; Wales stopped at the end of Rose-street. We sat down; Saul said,</p>
               <p>"We are come to complete the score and pay the 10 s. I owe you," which he did, and paid him 10 s. for two more notes, and I gave him 6 s. in silver for one; he returned me 1 s., saying,</p>
               <p>"You have given me 1 s. too much."</p>
               <p>Q. Was this for notes you were to receive - A. Yes; we did not get them that night. We had fifteen that night, left his house, and went to a public-house over the way. Gardiner came in, after we had been there half an hour, and wanted us to go into another public-house, which we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170037"/>did, and in a few minutes he called Saul out - we parted. I saw him again next night at eleven o'clock - Wales accompanied us to Rose-street. After sitting down Saul said to Gardiner,</p>
               <p>"Do you know what you gave me last night?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, fifteen." Saul said,</p>
               <p>"You told me there were but ten - when I opened the parcel I found fifteen." Then Saul paid him 2 l. in silver and 2 l. in notes, and I gave him 5 s. - (we had received the money from Foy and Christmas.) Gardiner said,</p>
               <p>"I will go and get the others presently." The officers immediately came in and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long have you been employed by the Bank - A. Since the 20th of March. I have been paid for my loss of time. Nobody accompanied me to the house on the 8th.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. Liberter was introduced by Wales to Saul. On the 4th of April Liberter gave me five 1 l. notes in the presence of Christmas. On the 7th of April he brought four 1 l. notes, and on the 11th of April he brought three 1 l. notes to the Bank. On the 10th of April, at twelve o'clock at night, Saul brought fifteen. On the 11th of April I accompanied Wales and Jefferson to Rose-street; Saul and Liberter went in first - I did not see them go in. We went in in about twenty minutes, and found the prisoners and their servant, and Saul and Liberter sitting in the parlour - Gardiner was nearer to the fire; Wales went up to him, and took something off the ground, which laid between Gardiner and the fire. Wales held it in his hand and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" Gardiner said he did not know, that it belonged to those men, and if they were doing anything wrong it was more than he knew. I asked him who the men were? he said he did not know, they were strangers to him. After searching them I took them to Marlborough-street, and left Wales and Jefferson to search the house. Gardiner said at the office that the two men came in just before we did, and that the short man (Saul), asked him to look at two notes for him, and to give him two notes for 2 l. in silver. I asked if he had ever given him change, or had any money from either of them before? he said he had not. I then said,</p>
               <p>"Did not you think it a very impudent thing for a person to come in and ask you to give him notes for silver, if you did not know him?" He said Jane had seen him before when he had come to their house with girls, but that they were both strangers to him. He said afterwards,</p>
               <p>"Yet I think I saw them at the public-house near my house the night before." I found two papers in a drawer or desk close to where they were sitting.</p>

            . I am an officer. I employed Liberter by direction of the Bank, introduced him to Saul, and accompanied him several times to Gardiner's house. I accompanied Liberter on the 17th and 18th and on the 20th, 26th, and 27th - I went with both. I saw nobody have any communication with them. I marked a 1 l. note which was delivered to Liberter - (looks at one) - this is it. On the 11th of April I went into the house, and saw Gardiner sitting by the fire; I saw him draw his left hand towards his thigh, I attempted to seize his hand, and at that moment something fell from his hand on the floor; I picked it up, and asked him what he had got there? he said it was what those men had dropped (looking round at Liberter and Saul, who sat there) - and if they were doing anything wrong he did not know it, or it was unknown to him. On examining the paper I found it contained the money I had marked that day and given to Saul - there were two 1 l. notes, 40 s. in silver, and a 5 s. paper in copper laid on the table, which had been delivered to Liberter - we furnished them that evening, before they went to pay him for the notes. They were secured.</p>

               <p>GARDINER'S Defence. On the night of the 10th, when the men state I was with them, I can prove I was playing the violin for a musical club, and that they were not in my company. They have been employed by the Bank, have been in training together day by day, and were to have 80 l. for my conviction. My brother went and asked them how they could deal in blood? Saul told him if I would give him 100 l. he would get out of the way and go to Scotland. I cannot bring my brother to prove this - I have other friends.</p>

            . I am an upholder, and lived in Great Windmill-street, but not now; I have been moved this day by an Habeas from the King's Bench. I have known the prisoner some time. On Monday, the 10th of April, I saw him at the Sun, next door to my own house, at six o'clock in the evening. I met him there, and was with him till, I should think, ten minutes past eight o'clock; it was past eight o'clock, I am certain. He left me in the street; we were to meet again, which we did, at half-past nine o'clock, and continued with him till half-past eleven o'clock. He then left me at the public-house in Rose-street, near Covent-garden - Harker was with us.</p>

               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. How far is Rose-street from the Sun - A. I should think, half a mile. He went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170038"/>out with me and Harker a little after eight o'clock. I parted with him in St. Martin's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to meet him again by appointment - A. He said, some years ago he was a musician, and invited me and Harker to go and hear him and his two friends play the violin and flute. When we got to St. Martin's-court, he said he should go and seek for his friend Salmon; that is about half-way to the Sun. We went to a public-house in Rose-street, kept by Honeyball; I do not know the sign; it is in the same street as his house. I have never seen him since till now.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew this on Saturday - A. Certainly; I was here on Saturday, but was not examined.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see Harker - A. He came to my house in Windmill-street, and asked me to go to Burn's; the prisoner was there; I cannot say what part of the room he was in; he had some gin and water before him; I will not say whether any one was in his company or not; it is a small room; there might be other persons there; nobody took him out, or had any conversation with him but what I could hear. Harker called on me, and we went together; and we all three left together. The prisoner left us to look for two friends, who would entertain us with music, and we went into Hobb's; we parted at the door of the King's Arms, in the middle of the court. He might have gone either to the right or left. I should think it was twenty minutes or a quarter past nine o'clock, when we saw him at the public house, in Rose-street. We waited there a quarter of an hour for him, and took some supper before he came in; it was a hot knuckle of ham, which we bought opposite an oyster-shop in New-street; we finished it before he came in, which was about half-past nine o'clock. I observed the clock at the ham-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this first called to your recollection - A. About two days after somebody came and told me Gardiner was in trouble. I thought that strange, when he had been in my company, and began to recollect what time he was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know it was for anything on the 10th - A. I heard nothing of the 10th, I only heard he was in confinement. I never heard anything about the 10th at all. He said he was very tired, for he had been out to play the week before, which was Easter week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time was you here on Saturday - A. At half-past nine o'clock in the morning, and remained till the Judges left the Court.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Queen-street, Golden-square. I use the Sun in Windmill-street. I was in the prisoner's company there on the Monday before he was apprehended. I went in about six o'clock in the evening, and he was there. I remained there two hours, and went away with him and Hall. The prisoner left us at the door of the King's Arms, St. Martin's-court. He appeared to go towards St. Martin's-lane, on the way to Rose-street. We met him about half past nine o'clock, or rather later, at a public-house in Rose-street, kept by Honeyball; I do not know the sign. We left him there about half-past eleven o'clock; there was music and singing there.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What reason have you for remembering this was the night - A. The gentleman who played the violin mentioned that he had been playing there three or four nights the week before, being Easter, and that he was tired. I heard he was apprehended on the Wednesday, but did not hear any particular time given to the offence he was charged with. He could not have left Burn's so as to go to Rose-street, if he did, he was back directly; it was about ten minutes' walk. After he came into the public-house in Rose-street I do not think he went out; he might, but I never missed him. I think it was about half past eleven o'clock when I left him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to the Sun alone, or did you take anybody there - A. I went alone. The prisoner, Hall, and several others, were there when I went in; it is a common sitting-room, and is divided into boxes. Hall sat next the prisoner, drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. You found Hall and the prisoner there - A. I cannot exactly recollect whether I went in with Hall, or alone; to the best of my recollection I went in alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go from your own house to the Sun - A. Yes, and walked alone. I am quite sure I called on nobody. I had seen Hall in his shop in the course of the day, by daylight.</p>
               <p>Q. If any one has said you called on Hall, and went with him to the Sun, it is not true - A. I do not think it is. I cannot say whether I saw him at the door or not. I am quite sure I did not go to his house. I supped with Hall, in Rose-street, before the prisoner joined us; we had a knuckle of ham.</p>

I recollect seeing the prisoner there, and the last witness, but I did not know them. There is one house between the prisoner's and mine.</p>

I said he should not go - he said Not go! I said No, unless I go with you. He ran from me a few yards, and I collared him, he collared me, and threatened to charge me with false imprisonment if I gave him in charge; we struggled from one end of the street to the other. I gave him in charge to the patrol - it was a rainy night. The prisoner was quite sober. We were proceeding from my house towards James-street.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 11th of April I heard the cry of Patrol! in Langdon-street, and found Snow and the prisoner struggling together; Snow said he thought Dudfield was concerned with Brown in passing the notes. I said you may depend upon it he has brought no notes here, it is of little use taking him. He collared Snow, drew him towards the house, and said they would have something to drink. I took him to the watch-house - seven-half-crowns and about sixpence in copper, was found on him. I then returned to the spot where I first saw them struggling, and there found a piece of brown paper rolled up corner ways - it was very wet, and contained two 5 l. notes - (looks at two) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Brown was taken at the Roebuck - A. Yes, Brown would go by Langdon-street to the watch-house.</p>

On the 11th of April I saw the prisoner and Snow, they had hold of each other, struggling; I caught hold of the prisoner, and asked Snow if he would give charge of him - he said No; the prisoner said if he did he would punish him for false imprisonment. We were going to let him go, and he asked me the nearest way to Whitechapel. As we went along the other patrol called to me to bring him back. I did so.</p>

The coat, waistcoat, and breeches were in a bundle - they had been left at my house by a drover. I found nobody about the premises.

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 25th of April, about one o'clock in the day, a person called on me, and said there were two persons in the fields near Bayswater. I went out, and saw two men in John-street, Edgeware-road. I went to the end of John-street, and saw one man with a bag, and the other apparently looking round to observe if they were watched. I have no doubt of their being in company together. I went down John-street and followed them, but before I got to the end of Cato-street the man with the bag turned into Cato-street - the prisoner looked about, turned himself round, and followed him. I followed them into Cato-street as fast as I could, and the man with the bag went into a passage a little way, so that the bag remained partly outside the door. The prisoner turned round again, and saw me coming after him - he was then very near the man with the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time you first saw them they kept close together - A. Yes, seeing me coming after them the prisoner passed very quickly by the house where the man with the bag was, and before I could get up the man rebounded backwards from the passage, threw the bag down, and ran off. I called out Stop thief! I could not run myself having slippers on; not being on duty I was at work as a shoemaker. The man with the bag escaped through a house in Mitcham-street, five or six hundred yards from Cato-street - the prisoner went out at the Queen-street end; I was then informed he lived in the house where the man was going in with the bag. I took the bag to my house, which was just by, then returned to the same house in Cato-street, in the passage of which I had seen the other man. The landlady of the house unlocked the door of the front room on the first floor. The first things I saw were two centre-bits, one larger than the other, two pistol flints, and a powder-can, but no powder in it. I tried to open the table drawer, but it was locked; I afterwards opened it, and found eight or nine picklock keys, two common keys, a phosphorus bottle, two duplicates, and a pair of spurs.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner - A. On the Saturday week after, at Bow-street - the 25th of April was Tuesday. I have no doubt of his being the person who was in company with the other man. The bag contained the articles stated in the indictment, except the money.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Cato-street, Edgeware-road; the prisoner lived at my house six weeks. I remember Woodberry coming to the house - the prisoner had lived with me six weeks on the Saturday before the bag was dropped, which was on Tuesday; it was dropped in my passage about one o'clock in the day. I shewed Woodberry the prisoner's room, and unlocked the door for him. He came to me as a married man, and brought a woman as his wife - she only stopped a week. He lived alone in the room for five weeks before the officer came. I saw Woodberry find the skeleton keys - the account he has given is correct. The prisoner did not return to his lodgings afterwards. He had not intimated any intention to leave, but said he was very comfortable and should stop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you I was going into the country that day to live, and say I expected two men to call - A. No; he said he was going out a little while, but should be back at half-past twelve o'clock. He went out between ten and eleven o'clock, and a woman called and enquired for him. I told her he would be home by half-past twelve o'clock. I did not show her into the room. When the room was taken, two young women came and engaged it, subject to his approval. One of them spoke as his wife, and said, if her husband liked it she would take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not persons frequently call on me - A. Not to my knowledge. I gave him the key of the front door, and did not trouble myself about it. He never left the key of the room with me before, and then he expected his brother to call to breakfast. I offered several times to make his bed, but he said he could do it himself. I do not think there was any key to the table-drawer. I cleaned the room out before he took it, and moved the table about; and if the keys had been there, I must have heard them rattle. I cleared the room out for him once, and I believe he once<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170041"/>left it open for my son to go in and clean his boots. I have a lodger in the back room on the same floor. The keys of the rooms are different; I do not know whether one opens the other.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 5th of May I was apprehended. I hope you will take my case into your serious consideration, and not find me guilty, as I can positively assert I know nothing of the affair.</p>

The window was down, but not fastened. About eight o'clock in the evening (I had left the parlour about ten minutes), I heard a loud knocking at the door - it might be daylight in the street. I came down, and the people said there was a thief in the house. I perceived the prisoner in the parlour, and he was secured. I found a handkerchief hanging over the cupboard-door, and missed about 18 s. off the mantle-piece. I had left the handkerchief on a chair.</p>

            . I am a boot and shoemaker. On Sunday, the 14th of May, about a quarter past eight o'clock, I was informed a man had been seen lurking about. I live opposite the prosecutrix, and saw her window open; the man then moved a step or two from the window. I asked who was there; I received no answer. A man passed by, and whistled twice. I then suspected he had accomplices inside. I shut the window, closed the shutters, and then knocked at the door. I found the prisoner in the parlour, and he was secured. The man outside walked off. There might be light enough to distinguish a man's features.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of April, about a quarter past one o'clock, I was in Broad-street, Carnaby-market, and saw the prisoner cross and go up Hopkins-street, with the great-coat under his arm. I followed and saw him putting it on over his own coat. A lad went up and spoke to him. He then pulled it off and put it under his arm again. I called for Dawes and we secured him. He said he had it to mend for a man, and would take us to the place. He took us to a Jew's, who is a dealer in marine-stores, in Crown-court. The man denied giving him the coat. I advertized it, and Mr. James claimed it. (Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I asked his name and address, and he gave me</p>
               <p>"Cox, Joiner-street, Tooley-street, just at foot of the Bridge." I immediately wrote that address on it. I then looked at it and suspected it was bad - (looks at one) - this is it. I then told him I suspected it was a bad one; and I asked my fellow shopman's (Rogers) opinion on it. He said I had better take it to the Bank, and see if it was good or not. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"If you don't like it, here is another for it;" and he tendered another which I refused, and said,</p>
               <p>"I shall take it to the Bank." I left him in care of Rogers, took it to the Bank, showed it to Mr. Christmas, an inspector, and he and Foy returned with me.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Chaffers, and remember the prisoner coming to the shop. Hewitt showed me a note, and I said it was bad. He took it to the Bank, and left the prisoner with me. While he was gone, the prisoner asked me several times if I would not take the other note and give him change, and he would call again for the other. I said No, I was convinced it was a bad one, and he should prove how he got it. He said he took it of his master for wages; and that his master lived at No. 16, Joiner-street, and he lived at No. 15. He did not mention his master's name. Hewitt returned in about ten minutes with Christmas and Foy.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 21st of April I apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Chaffers's shop. Christmas asked him where he lived; he said No. 14, Joiner-street, and that his was name Chear. I said we would have a coach and take him there, to see if his address was correct. He then said he did not live in Joiner-street, but at No. 7, Bett-street, Ratcliff-highway. I then asked where he got the note that he had paid, he said he received it on the Wednesday preceding, at Billingsgate, for some oyster-barrels, from Mr. Roberts, fishmonger, of No. 180, Oxford-street, and that he had sold him barrels two or three times before. I found a 6 d. on him, and a good 1 l. note, which I gave him silver for. I took him to Marlborough-street, went to No. 180, Oxford-street, but found no such person as Roberts there. It is not a fishmonger's, it is a house under repair, and has been so for some months. I made diligent enquiry in the street, and could find no Roberts, a fishmonger. I did not enquire at Billingsgate.</p>

I asked him to take me there, he said he could not, as he was in a hurry to go into the Borough. I said I would not pay him unless he went with me to Worship-street Office - he went willingly.

My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury - I have been completely brought into his most serious charge by my inexperience and ignorance; I was bred in Layton, in Bedfordshire, and at the age of fifteen was with my uncle, working at his business, until he was obliged to give it up. I was determined to come to London for work, and when I was within ten miles of town I saw the horse standing at the door of a public-house, and whilst I was looking at him the owner, as I supposed, came out and asked if I would purchase him? I enquired the price, and was informed it was 5 l. Thinking that it would not only help me on the road, but likewise I should make something by him on my arrival in London, I bought it. In Church-street, Bishops-gate, a person asked me if it was for sale, I answered it was, and then agreed about price, &amp;c.; he then questioned me, and asked me to go to Worship-street to receive the money, which I did, without any hesitation, believing he was actually going to pay me the money in lieu of which I found he had brought me to the office, under the consideration of my having stolen the horse.</p>

On the 29th of April, about a quarter past one o'clock in the morning, I and my wife were a bed; she alarmed me, I got out, listened, and heard somebody in the house. I knocked at the door, and called my man. I then heard a noise, as if some person was making his way out of the house. I went and looked through my back-room window, and saw the prisoner go over the wall. I went to the front window, and told the watchman some person had been in the house, and was coming out of the next passage. He was at last stopped by another watchman, brought back, and taken to the watch-house. My property was not found on him. I am sure he is the man - I remember him particularly; he had a red waistcoat. I noticed his handkerchief and face as he got over the wall; he would then come into the yard of another house, which is let out in lodgings, and the passage door is open continually - that yard belongs to two houses. He came out of the second house; both of them are lodging-houses - it was moon-light; I saw no one else. When the watchman came back I found he had entered at the back door, which I saw Godfrey fasten when I went to bed (he is not here). It was fastened with two bolts, one of which was broken off and laid on the ground, the other was wrenched off and hung on a nail; there were marks of a crow-bar on the door. I lost a watch, which hung on the mantle-piece in the kitchen - I wound it up at half-past ten o'clock at night; I have not seen it since. Next day I saw the watchman compare the marks with a crow-bar which Passoway had.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I know Eustace's house is in St. Andrew's, Holborn, Middlesex. I heard him call out that somebody was at his back door. I ran under his window, and heard him call out,</p>
               <p>"Tom! Tom! somebody has broken into the house!" I immediately heard some person jump apparently off the wall - I also heard tiles rattle and glass break. Eustace called out of the first-floor window, and said</p>
               <p>"Watch! watch! somebody is getting over the wall, go into the next-yard!" I ran immediately to the next door to the prosecutor's, thinking he would come out there, but instead of that the prisoner came out of the next door. I struck at him with my stick, and saw him with the crow-bar in his hand. I pursued as fast as I could, and called out,</p>
               <p>"Clark, stop him!" He ran towards Fleet-market on the right-hand; Clark came out of his box and the prisoner knocked him down. He turned down White's-yard, and down a court, I immediately followed him; he ran into a house, and I found him in the passage up two pair of stairs in White's-yard - he could not get into any room - I saw him run in at the door; I secured him. He said,</p>
               <p>"What the b - dy h - ll do you want of me?" I said I would let him know, and brought him away. I sent Karl up stairs, he brought the crow-bar down. I took him to the watch-house. He was searched in my presence, and a dark lanthorn, a phosphorus box, and a candle were found on him I did not compare the crow-bar with the marks on the door-way - Nailor, the constable of the night, took care of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Eustace first called out to you for help - A. Yes. I heard his wife call to him three or four times. He said at the watch-house he was certain of the prisoner being the man, by his waistcoat, and that he saw the side of his face and his handkerchief. The house is in the liberty of Saffron-hill, in the parish of St. Andrew Holborn.</p>

On the 23d of April, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner on the forecastle of the ship, and asked him what he wanted? he said he wanted to see a shipmate. I said there was no shipmate there, and he must go ashore. The cook of the ship was eating something on deck - he said the prisoner had come up the forecastle - he left the ship; Reader went after him, he said he had nothing about him. We found a quantity of tobacco tied round his waist in hands as it is packed - I found more in his hat; he said he had it from a person belonging to the ship. I found the bulk-head partly broken down, and planks removed to get at the hogsheads - part of one was broken and tobacco gone. I asked him several times to describe the man who gave it to him, he refused.</p>

            . I slept in the house by the prosecutrix's desire. I fastened all the doors between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and heard Mrs. Hughes lock the parlour door; every thing was safe then. I saw the clock. I have lived with my master six years, and have seen the clock in his house. I do not know when it was taken to the prosecutrix's. I got up about five o'clock in the morning, and found the kitchen-door open, which I had shut. I went to bed again, finding it was only five o'clock. The watchman rang the bell soon after to know if all was safe. I went up and found the inner-door on the top of the stairs forced open, and a square of glass was taken quite out. Between this and the yard-door is a water-closet - the sash-frame was entirely forced out of the brick-work into the yard; it looked into the yard, and I saw it safe the day before. I missed the clock.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 5th of May, about three minutes past three in the morning, I was in Rochester-row. About the middle of the row is a small bridge, which leads to Vincent-square. I saw three men coming towards me in a direction from the prosecutrix's in the square, about eighty yards from her house; the prisoner was one, and he got behind the wall of an adjoining garden; they were in company together. I have seen them in company many times before, and one of them asked me what o'clock it was - I said you know better than me; they passed me and went into Rochester-row. The moon shone, and it was getting light. I then went towards the wall, and saw the prisoner go from the wall under the railings of the square - he pretended to be looking through the railing. I told Cox and Shields - Cox lifted up his lantern, and by the light of it we found the clock among the bushes, on the very spot where he was looking through. The prisoner was then gone through a little street into Rochester-row - I went into Rochester-row and saw he had joined the other two again. They went through a passage into the fields. I met another with him, and followed them. I went to get some person to prevent them escaping, and on my return I found a watchman in pursuit of the prisoner. Kidd and Evans secured him, the others escaped - he was searched at the watch-house and two small bags found on him, which the prosecutrix claimed. I am certain he is the man who hid himself behind the wall, and went to the spot where the clock was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was quite daylight - A. It was getting daylight. The clock was within the palisades opposite another house.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Vincent-square, on the opposite side to Hughes's house. On the 5th of May, as I was calling three o'clock, Wilton came and asked me if I had seen three men? I said No. He said there had been robbery near my beat. I went to the corner by the shrubbery, I threw my lanthorn in to hide it, and saw the face of the clock inside the shrubbery paling - it struck three as I took it into my hand - I got it over the railing. I left it at the watch-house after the prisoner was taken. I went round to the house, and found it belonged to Hughes. I alarmed the apprentice - I found a desk was gone, and saw it laying on a flower-bed in the next garden. Some writings, a medal, and about twelve keys were on the flower-bed - the desk was open. The garden was very much trampled - more persons than one had been there. A person must pass through this garden to get to the prosecutrix's water-closet.</p>

            , Jun. was brought to the watch-house, I asked him how he came by the pelisse? he said it belonged to his sister, and he came out to pledge it. I said it was an odd time to pledge things. His mother came to see him at the watch-house on Sunday, and in his presence said it was his sister's, and told me the colour of it. I asked her how it was made? she would not tell me.</p>

            . I took Johnson, Sen. in charge at St. George's watch-house, about twelve o'clock at night. I then went in search of the other prisoners, and found Robert at his father's house, about two o'clock in the morning - I knew they all lived together there. I told him what I took him for, he denied it, and the father said the things were brought into the house unknown to him.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Wise, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Broad-street, Bloomsbury. On the 28th of April, between two and five o'clock, the property was pledged by the prisoner - she asked particularly for 1 l. 14 s. on the clothes and 12 s. on the counterpanes, which she received; I made them in separate duplicates by her desire. I asked her if they were her own? she said No, that they belonged to Mrs. Wilson, No. 25, Red Lion-street, and that she knew them to be her property. The prosecutrix redeemed them afterwards, and shortly after an Irish girl called with the duplicates of the counter-panes - I detained her. I afterwards saw the prisoner in Newgate, and asked her, by the Magistrate's desire, if she gave the duplicate to a man? she said she did, but still insisted that she pledged them for Mrs. Wilson. I went to No. 25, Red Lion-street, but found no such person there.</p>

All at once I felt myself hustled by three or four men. I felt much alarmed, having above 150 l. about me. I extricated myself and threw them all from me. As soon as they left, I saw one of them with my watch in his hand, hanging by the seals. I felt and missed it - I knew it to be mine when I saw it - he was not two yards from me. I immediately called out Stop thief! attempted to run after him, and fell. Lock came up and I pointed the man out to him. He ran down Castle-court. I saw Lock pursuing him at the bottom of the court, they then turned to the left, and I myself lost sight of them and was too much alarmed to follow. I returned to wash myself, having lost blood by my fall. I saw the prisoner at the watch-house in about an hour, and, to the best of my belief, he is the man.

            . I am a City officer. I was in Whitechapel between three and four o'clock, within two doors of Castle-street, and saw Mr. Dixon on his hands and knees, crying out stop thief. He said he had lost his watch, and pointed out the prisoner, who was running down the gateway, between forty and fifty yards down - nobody but him was running then. I pursued him immediately to the back way of the Cross Keys public-house, and he got from me there. In about twenty minutes or half an hour I returned and found the prisoner coming out of the passage leading to that house. I pointed him out to Stone. I did not know him before; but noticed his features as I pursued him. I found him within a door or two of the Cross Keys. The passage is a thoroughfare. I am sure he is the person I pursued into the Cross Keys; he had changed his dress then - when I pursued him he had on a blue coat and trowsers; on seeing him the second time, his neck-handkerchief was off, and he had a brown great coat on and no stockings, which he had before. When I laid hold of him, he said, he was waiting at home while his stockings were washed, and denied being the person. Stone took him to the watch-house, and I fetched the prosecutor, who said he could not swear positively to him, as he had not got his spectacles on. I can swear he positively he is the person he pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not know him before - A. No - he turned his head round several times. I could have picked him out from a crowd.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 28th of April, a little after seven o'clock in the evening, I was on duty, and went on board the Edward, which laid at the Orchard house plying place, near Blackwall, Austin and Langley were then on board - she was made fast by a rope, waiting for the tide. I asked Langley what his cargo was - he said block tin. I said I suspected there was camphor on board, as there was a strong smell? He said there was none in his boat, but it was in the lugboat, which was astern. Cotton's lugboat was astern then. I went on board the lugboat, but found nobody in it. Two of the tubs of camphor appeared to have been very recently broken open, and a small portion of camphor littered about at the end of the lugboat. I went into the Edward - they were still both on board; and in the locker, or bed-cabin, I found a canvas bag, containing 17 lbs. of camphor, covered over with a great coat, which Langley said belonged to him. They said they did not know how the camphor came there. Langley then said he saw me coming, and had he known it was there, he would have thrown it overboard. I said I should take them into custody, and asked who belonged to the lug-boat; they pointed to Cotton, who was in another boat, as the man - he had just come out of the cabin of a sailing lighter, which was near shore. I asked if he knew his lugboat had been robbed; he said No, and immediately came on board. He said he had been ashore to get refreshment. I secured them all. I believe Austin said he knew nothing of it.</p>

I also had occasion to go to Bartlett's in Ray-street, on business, I had not been in the parlour five minutes, when Mrs. Bartlett said a number of people at the door wished to speak to me - I went to the door, and in about five minutes the boy said</p>

            . I live at Hammersmith. I took the scarf - the prisoner, who is my brother, just shewed it to me, and I took it off Mr. Baker's counter. A great many people were in the shop - it was about five o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th of May. My brother was two or three yards from the shop; he pointed it out to me, and asked me to take it. I went in and took it, came out again, found him in the same place, and gave it to him. I do not know where he took it to. Downs lives in King-street - I believe it is not far from the shop. I never had any conversation with her about it. I was taken up on the Saturday after, and told what I knew about it. My parents live at Hammersmith.</p>

               <p>Q. You took the scarf, put it in a basket, and went off with it - A. Yes, and gave it to him.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hammersmith. About four o'clock on Friday afternoon, the 12th of May, I was sent for to Mr. Carter's shop, and took the prisoner, Johnson, into custody, who was charged with stealing a pair of breeches. He said, of his own accord, that if I would go with him to his mother he would tell me where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170050"/>he sold them and other things which he had taken. He said he sold the scarf to Mrs. Downs for 6 s. - she keeps a clothes-shop about two hundred yards from Mr. Baker's shop - I took him there about six o'clock that evening, and enquired about a pair of breeches. I afterwards put him in the cage, returned alone to Downs, and asked her if she had not bought a scarf of that boy? she paused, and then said it was sold, and if I would give her her liberty she would go and see after it. I called again, she was not returned. I called between nine and ten o'clock, and observed she had got it laid on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the boy shew it to you on the counter when you took him there - A. I do not think he did. The Magistrate blamed me for not taking it away. She said the boy told her he brought it from his mother. I did not take her into custody - she came herself to the office.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>DOWNS'S Defence. I believed the prisoner's friends to be in distress, and bought it without knowing it to have been stolen. I gave it up the moment they came for it.</p>

Johnson's father is a tall man, about six feet high; he is well known about Hammersmith. She produced them immediately, and said he told her he brought them from his mother.</p>

            . I work for a brickmaker. About half-past eleven o'clock on Thursday night I was sitting in the market close to Graham's stand, waiting till the play was was over to open the coaches. I saw the prisoner come with a bag, cut the string of the bushel baskets, put his arm in, and pull out as many as he could; he then pulled out the basket, emptied it into his bag, and went away.

I saw it all safe about nine o'clock on Sunday evening, the 7th of May. The watchman called me up about one o'clock in the morning - I found part of the roof stripped - he fetched the lead, which we compared with the roof at daylight - it fitted two nail-holes which were left and corresponded with the next sheet - here is about 50 lbs. in all.

            . I am a watchman of Stepney. On the 8th of May, about a quarter past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner, and three more, about twelve yards from Brice's skittle-ground. I heard them whispering, held up my light, and saw the prisoner by the side of two bundles of lead. I was going to take them, and the stoutest man said,</p>
               <p>"If you come near us, you old b - g - r, I will knock you down." I sprung my rattle and two watchmen came to my assistance. As soon as they heard footsteps, they made off, and I after them - all three escaped. I alarmed Brice and took the lead to him. I traced them by footmarks,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170052"/>and took the prisoner about half-past two o'clock that morning, about twenty yards from where I first saw him. When they escaped, he got over a fence into some rains. I suppose he must have returned. I am certain he is one of the men. I saw his face and viewed his dress. He was the only remarkable man among them. The moment I took him, he whistled twice. I was concealed. I told him what I took him for, and asked him where the other two were - he made no reply.</p>

Abel brought the pipe - it matched exactly - it was fixed to the wall, and run through the brick-work of the house.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HAINES. I am a watchman. About five minutes past five o'clock in the morning, I saw a man at the end of Craven-street, behind the prosecutor's premises, with a bag under his arm - he saw me and went away. I looked over the wall and saw the prisoner in the garden of No. 9. I asked what he did there, and what he had got. He said he had got nothing. He used bad language when he came out of the gate, and offered me a crown to let him go - I still kept my hold. He said,</p>
               <p>"It is a d - d hard thing you can't let a man get his living." I took him to the watch-house with assistance - he still persisted that he had nothing; but when he got there, he pulled the pipe and cock from his bosom, said that was all he had, and he found it in the garden, where he had been easing himself. We went to the garden of No. 9, found no pipe gone from there, traced his footsteps into the prosecutor's garden, and there found the pipe cut off.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I received the lead and prisoner in charge. I have no doubt but it is the same pipe; it appears to be partly cut, and then twisted off. I found a knife on him with some appearance of lead on it. After I told him where he got it from, he said he did it through distress.</p>

            . I am foreman at Mr. Brown's pot-ash manufactory, Bromley. On the 9th of May, about half past four o'clock, I was called up, and was informed somebody was robbing my garden. I live in North-street, Poplar, about 300 yards from the manufactory. I got up and went to my garden at Limehouse, about a quarter of mile off. When I got to the bridge, which crosses the water, I saw Daws going away with a bundle of wood on his shoulder. I immediately ran towards him - he did not see me - and he put his load down to rest. I asked what he had got there; he said, what was that to me. The place where he was is private property, and belonged to Mr. Gunn. It has an open footpath with a board up, stating that the grass is not to be trod upon. I told him he was trespassing, and then saw the load was staves and not my property. He had come out of a ditch which parts my premises from Gunn's. I said he must go with me - he was very impudent, and was going to make a start. I took hold of him, and he caught hold of me and tried to throttle me. I threw him down and secured him. I took him back to the bridge, and sent one of Brown's men for the staves he had left in the field. I had them in sight all the time. I was looking at the man who was bringing the staves to me, and saw Hill come out of the same ditch, and from exactly the same part - he was also carrying some staves on his shoulder - he was about fifty yards off. I sent the men to secure him, and saw them take him. We took them both to the watch-house with the staves, and about ten o'clock found they belonged to the prosecutors. Daws told me, that as soon as he got out of custody he would give me a pill, by day or by night, and when he came to the Bar, he hoped they would send him out of the country, for there were more Thistlewoods than one. He had five staves, Hill had three, and seven were left in the field - three of those Daws had were marked.</p>
               <p>THOMAS NEWPORT. I am a carpenter, and live at Poplar. At half past five o'clock I was going to work, and saw six or eight people in the road. I perceived Poulter had Daws, and he said there was an old man in the field. I then saw Hill come out of a ditch in Mr. Gunn's field with three staves on his shoulder - I secured him with them, and said,</p>
               <p>"You must come with me." He said he would not, a scuffle ensued, and he threw them down. We took the prisoners to the watch-house with them.</p>

I sleep on the second floor, and the prisoner used to call me in the morning. I was determined to mark my money, which I did, on the edge. On the 14th, I went to an officer, and shewed him the money I had marked; and, on the 15th, on going to bed, I had fourteen shillings and four sixpences, all marked, in my breeches-pocket. Next morning he called me, as usual, about half-past three o'clock. I did not examine my pocket then, but went up to clean myself about eight o'clock, and three shillings were gone. The officer came about half-past nine. When the prisoner came in, I told him to go into the parlour, which he did. I said I suspected he had taken money out of my pocket. He said directly, that I must be mistaken. I had paid none of the money away. The officer said he must search him. He said,</p>
               <p>"I will show you all the money I have." He pulled 4 s. 6 d. from his pocket, and three of my marked shillings were among them. I can swear it was safe when I went to bed.</p>

               <p>JOHN JONES. I am a carpenter. I had the care of Mr. Gilbert's two houses. On Wednesday, the 10th of May, I was informed some pipe had been taken - I went and found it so - I was told the prisoner, who had taken it, was gone up the Commercial-road; I went that way, and met Clements; in consequence of what she said I went into Plumber's-row, and found the prisoner going into the passage of a painter's shop, with the lead pipe and two brass cocks. I took him to the watch-house. They appeared freshly torn off, and exactly matched the pipe on the building - it is nearly new pipe.</p>

I saw the prisoner within four yards of the house, and followed him, with the pipe on his shoulder, into Greenfield-street, to a dark place, where he stopped, and twisted the pipe up. I kept him in sight till he got to Plumber's-row, and then informed Jones.</p>

               <p>"What does that bl - dy b - g - r want?" I took the glass, and secured the prisoner; he said he found it in Russell-street. I advertized it, and the prosecutor claimed it.</p>

When I came within a yard of them the two prisoners came out against me - it was just under a very strong gas-light; I am positive as to their two persons. Newman laid hold of the bottom of my waistcoat, and a the same instant. I felt my watch violently pulled, I put my hand down and laid hold of it - another pull was given, they broke the chain, and got part of it and the seals; they both ran away together. I immediately pursued, and got a head of Newman; he turned back. I rose a cry, and just as I came up with him Phenix passed before us - they were both taken immediately. When Newman was secured I heard something fall, and my chain and seals were picked up.</p>

I turned my eye, and saw Gardiner and Lovitt advancing, they were eighteen or twenty yards from the watch, running in a direction from it - several people were pursuing them; Webb came round the corner with the people. I gave the watch to Hudson.</p>

A gentleman came past my door, which is about thirty yards from the prosecutor's, and gave me information; I went out immediately, and saw Webb and Gardiner, one on each side of Cabbell's door. Before I came up to them Lovitt came out of the house - I saw him put something into his pocket; they all ran together, as soon as he came out, through Bromley. I lost sight of them for ten minutes - they turned a corner which would take them to where the watch was found.</p>

He said he was a gentleman, and would always pay before-hand. He mentioned the names of Lord Castlereagh and other respectable persons. I let him the room - the articles stated in the indictment were let with it. On the 15th of April he came down, I asked him to pay what he owed me, and he said he would leave the house directly. I got a constable and went into his room - he was sitting at the table writing. I told him I was come up to see that all my property was safe. I pulled the press-bedstead down and missed this property. I asked him where they were. He said he did not know, but that they were stolen, and, if I would let the constable go away, he would buy more. The constable took him - this was on Monday night, the blankets were brought home the same evening. I saw the bed next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not object to Mr. Hunter's coming into my room - A. No; he had a deal of company.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember my saying,</p>
               <p>"If anything was lost I would pay for it" - A. He never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not show you a 50 l. bill - A. He showed me a twopenny-stamp and said it was a 50 l. bill; and said it came in a letter from Lord Castlereagh, and that he had money at Drummonds', the bankers.</p>
               <p>HENRY CROCKER. I am an officer. On the 15th of May, the prosecutrix sent for me, and I searched the room. The prisoner was sitting at breakfast and writting a letter when she missed the property. I asked what had become of it - he hesitated, and said he would make it good. I found the bed at Davis's, tied up in the quilt.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you by the duplicate - A. The prisoner applied to my father. I was present, and heard him say he wished to sell the duplicate, and asked one guinea and a half for it. I said I would take the bed out of pledge, and if it was worth the money, I would give it him, which I did. They were pledged for 2 l. and were scarcely worth that. I told him I would not give more than they were pledged for, but would keep them a week for him, and, in the mean time, they were claimed. He said, if I liked, I might pledge them again.</p>

               <p>"If I could have half an hour's rest, it would do me good." She proposed that I should go to her room, and then I should be safe and not disturbed - it was ten o'clock in the morning. I went with her and left my shipmate behind. She shut the door and went out. I laid on the bed and put my handkerchief over my forehead and eyes. In a few minutes she came in and put her hand over my side into my trowsers-pocket, and took one 5 l. and six 1 l. Bank notes out in a roll together. I laid on my left side. I immediately felt her hand in my pocket and attempted to catch hold of it as it came out. I saw the notes in her hand and asked where she was going with that money. She ran down stairs immediately, and I followed - she got outside the door and shut it. I secured her in a quarter of an hour at a public-house door. I caught hold of her and she called for assistance. I was abused by the people, who surrounded and knocked me down. She escaped, leaving part of her gown in my hand. Next morning, about five o'clock, I was called up by the landlady of the house where she lived. I got a constable, went to the house, and found her door padlocked outside. We came down, and the woman sent us to another house in New-court, Duck-lane, where we found her under the bed. My 5 l. note was produced before the magistrate. I am certain it was the same - she gave it to the officer - I have since changed it. I knew it by the number, having just received it at the India House.</p>

I observed Hutchins standing half in front of me, with his hand near my ribbon; I felt that he had hold of the seals ready to pull, and felt his hand tremble as he cut off the seals. I kept looking at them both in order to identify them - a young man was with them. All at once they moved away; I put my hand down, keeping my eye on them, and felt my seals gone - I followed and collared them both before they were out of my sight. I have not recovered my seals.</p>

I was at the back of Hutchins, he pulled a sharp instrument out of his pocket, I saw him cut the seals off, they dropped into Grimsdale's hand, and another man went off with them directly - I should know him again. I secured Hutchins, and assisted in taking both to he watch-house.</p>

            . I lived in Portland-place; I was waiting till the French Ambassador returned - I had been in his service. On the 4th of April, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was returning home from the City, and went into a public-house in Cheapside; I saw Judd there, he asked me where I was going to? I said to the west end of the town. He said he was going to Covent-garden, and if I liked to ride he would take me there. I accepted his offer, and called for a pot of ale to treat him. He wanted me to get inside his coach, but I got on the box, and drove myself as far as Catherine-street, my watch was then safe. He then said the people were coming from the play, and I had better give him the reins; he drove to Charles-street, and stopped just before we came to the <placeName id="t18200517-122-crimeloc716">Marquis of Granby</placeName>

I went into the house, and at that time another coachman came in, he asked me to treat himself and his friend. I treated them with a glass of rum each, and I had a glass of gin and peppermint. I did not stop long, as I came outside, and stopped on the cill of the door. I was surrounded by a parcel of people; Taylor, who was convicted, drew the watch from my fob and ran away with it - I went after him, and they held me to prevent my running.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether they had hold of you while your watch was taken - A. No, I did not. I turned round directly and saw Judd behind me; I said,</p>
               <p>"Now, you let go of me, or it will be worse for you." I tried to get away again - I turned round and saw three more, they were Randal, Allger, and another, whom I should know if I saw him. I knocked them back clean from me, ran after Taylor, and saw him throw the watch into a hackney-coach. I described him to Bethell, who followed me outside the watch-house. I saw him at the public-house about three-quarters of an hour after, Randall and Allger were then there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What countryman are you - A. Wiltshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the gentleman who sat by me just now - A. I do not remember seeing him till Allger's father brought him to ask me questions. The night before the robbery I slept in the Compter as I was drunk. I did not know Judd before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have pipes of tobacco at the Granby - A. I did not, that I recollect - we drank at the bar. I did not see Allger or Judd before they robbed me. I am sure I did not smoke there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was going away had you paid your reckoning - A. I had four half-crowns and a 1 l. note in my pocket - I will not swear that I paid, but I know by the money I had in my pocket I must have paid, or it would have been impossible for me to have given the boy a shilling, which he said I did. I will be upon my oath that I put a half-crown down on the bar before I attempted to go away. It appeared to me that the person who snatched my watch came from the street. I was at the door when they held me behind, and prevented my following him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge any one else with robbing you - A. Yes, two men. They came up the first time that I took Taylor, and got him from me. Taylor had a light snuff-coloured coat. I did not see that he left his coat behind when he escaped.</p>

            . I am beadle of Covent-garden. On the 4th of April, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, Hughes came to the watch-house and said he had been robbed, and after we went out he described the features of the person. He appeared to have his senses about him -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170059"/>he walked very steadily. I went to Charles-street with him. The first public-house we came to was the Coach and Horses, he said the house was further down; we went into the Granby, four or five houses further down; I told him to go in and take no notice of me - he fixed on Taylor; he had told me the man had a rise on his nose, which Taylor had; he gave him in charge, and I took him to the watch-house. When we got outside the door we were surrounded by coachmen, who obstructed us. I called the watchmen to assist me - we were interrupted once or twice in going to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was Bartlett at the watch-house - A. He was. Hughes said he had had the man in custody and had a full view of his face, and he had a rise on his nose. Mrs. Weedon keeps the public-house, she was in the bar. I could see what Hughes did.</p>
               <p>Q. A person in the bar can see distinctly what passes in the taproom - A. I do not think they can. There is a wainscot between her and the taproom. I cannot say that I saw either of the prisoners there - I do not say they were not there. The first attempt to rescue Taylor was by the Hummums, and then by Tavistock-row; Fitzgerald and Sullivan were with me then, they might have seen the interruption. There were no blows given. I told them that if they came near me again I would knock them down. Hughes had charged two men with rescuing Taylor before this; I heard they were discharged for want of prosecution. He told me his watch was worth 7 l. or seven guineas.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Charles-street. I was standing at the end of Charles-street, near Russell-street, and heard the cry of Watch! a little after twelve o'clock - the voice came from the lower part of Charles-street. I ran up, and saw Hughes standing with a crowd about him - he had hold of a man. I rushed in among the crowd, and he gave charge of the man - he was rescued from me, and got away. Hughes went towards a coach, and said his watch was thrown into it. I afterwards assisted in conveying Taylor to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Hughes sober - A. He was capable of walking and speaking well - he had taken liquor, but was quite sensible; two men were quarrelling with him, and he gave charge of them. I had to hinder him several times from making a noise in the street. He went to the watch-house, and then he and Bethell went to the public-house; they brought Taylor out, and called me to assist - I took hold of his right side and Sullivan was on his left; Bethell was pushing him behind to make him go forward. I did not notice any attempt to rescue him - I heard some talk behind, but took no notice. Just as we had passed the Hummums I heard him talk about people tripping him up, or coming too close to him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Great Russell-street. I assisted in taking Taylor to the watch-house from the door of the public-house. Bethell pushed him behind, as he did not wish to go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. There was no attempt to rescue him - A. A quantity of people followed us, I do not know that any attempt was made to rescue him.</p>
               <p>RANDALL'S Defence. Every word the man has said is false. When he came into the house he said Taylor had a light-coloured coat on, and he thought he was the man. I said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, if you know yourself innocent, go into the parlour and be searched." They shoved him out of the door; I did not follow him out directly. I was going to the watch-house, but they said they would not allow any one to speak. He has sworn to five men besides me.</p>
               <p>ALLGER's Defence. I was at the house when Hughes came in. He put his hand on Taylor's head, and said,</p>
               <p>"I think you are the man who took my watch." He said he had not been out of the house; nor was I out of the house until Taylor was taken out.</p>
               <p>JUDD'S Defence. He drove my coach as far as Catherine-street. We went into a wine-vaults, he had some peppermint, and I had some rum. I then drove to the Granby, we had sixpenny worth of rum and water, and some tobacco. We all three had a pipe each.</p>

            . I keep the Marquis of Granby, public-house; my bar is on the left of the lobby, and the taproom on the right. I can see through the bar window into the taproom. I know the prisoners very well. I remember Hughes coming to the house about twelve o'clock, with two coachmen - he called for a glass of rum and water, and three pipes of tobacco; I served him, then a man named Nicholls came in, and asked Hughes if he might not have a pipe too - Hughes said he was one of the party, and he should have one. All four had a pipe of tobacco each in the lobby. Hughes asked me to let him go into another room; I said I could not, as it was a late hour, and it is for the accommodation of the coachmen - he was very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your reason - A. Yes; we are not allowed to let them in, but I do not say I never do. He then went out at the door - all three went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all three go out without going into the taproom - A. They did; I had observed Taylor, Randall, and Allger in the tap-room, before eleven o'clock; Hughes did not pay his reckoning before he went out. I am perfectly sure he did not lay a half-crown on the bar; I sent the boy after him for his money, and he brought me a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Hughes left your house with the three coachmen, did you hear the cry of Watch! - A. I heard no cry at all, nor any alarm. I know when the boy came back Taylor, Randall, and Allger were all three in the taproom - Taylor was asleep with his head on the table. Bethell and the prosecutor came in in about three-quarters of an hour. I am certain Taylor, Randall, and Allger, had not quitted the house all that time. They took poor Taylor out - it is my firm opinion that Taylor is innocent. I then went into the taproom, Hughes looked round for a moment or two, then went up and touched Taylor on the shoulder - he had just awoke, and was rubbing his eyes - he asked him if he had not had a drab-coloured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170060"/>coat on that evening? Taylor said</p>
               <p>"No, I had no other coat on than that I have on now." Hughes then said,</p>
               <p>"I think, by your side-face, you are the man who robbed me of my watch." Taylor said,</p>
               <p>"You think very wrong, for I have never been out of this place." Hughes said to the beadle,</p>
               <p>"Take him away, be it as it may."</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was Bethell a little distance from you - A. He was. I did not think he was come in with Hughes. I thought he was come in to order me to shut up. Randall and Allger said, take him into the parlour and search him, if you think he has got anything. I cannot say who said so. Taylor went away very willingly, and was not searched. He said he was sure he should not be kept.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you appear on Taylor's trial - A. No; I was not subpoened - they said they knew he was innocent, and it would not be necessary for me to attend.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send your boy here - A. He was subpoened, and I gave him leave to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you never heard the least alarm of robbery, till your boy came back with the shilling - A. I do; I heard no rattle sprung. Hughes was smoking in my lobby for a quarter of an hour. Neither Randall, Taylor, nor Allger, came out of the taproom while Hughes was there. I think I had seen Taylor once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have known him if you met him in the street - A. I think I should, for he had assisted me to get a drunken man out that night, between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the potboy help - A. Yes; we all persuaded him to go, and put him into a coach. His name was Titness.</p>
               <p>GEO. WATSON. I am waiter to the last witness. Hughes came into the lobby with Cole and Judd. He ordered six-penny-worth of rum and water, and they had four pipes of tobacco - one each. Nicholl's came in and asked Hughes if he would like to hear a song, and said,</p>

               <p>"I dare say Mrs. Weedon will not be against our going into the taproom." I was drawing a pint of porter in the bar at the time. I took the beer into the taproom to Randall, and heard no more.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took the beer into the taproom to Randall, who was there - A. Taylor was asleep, Allger sat by him, and Randall sat at the end of the box. I stopped there till my mistress came in, and said,</p>
               <p>"Is not that gentleman come in here."</p>
               <p>Q. Meaning into the taproom - A. Yes; at that time nobody had moved from their places. My mistress said,</p>
               <p>"He has not paid his reckoning." She said it was 10 d. I went out over against the York Hotel, and asked him for it. He said,</p>
               <p>"Do you dispute my word?" The watchman staid by the side of him. Mr. Stannard was at his door. He said,</p>
               <p>"My name is

            , of Portland-place." I said,</p>
               <p>"Let you be what you will, you must not go without paying your reckoning." He pulled four shillings out of his pocket, and gave me one. At that time he was giving charge of two young men. I was by the taproom fire when he returned with Bethell. The three men I mentioned were still there. My mistress stood at the bar-door. Taylor was just rising himself up, and wiping his eyes. He directly looked at him, and said,</p>
               <p>"I think you are the man that had a drab coat on a little while ago."</p>
               <p>Q. Was Titness there then - A. He was just gone home with his coach. He was tipsy. My mistress advised him to go. Hughes said nothing about his face, as I heard. Randall said,</p>
               <p>"If you think he has got your watch, take him into the parlour and search him;" but they took him out. Allger sat next to Taylor, and Randall on the other side of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hughes say,</p>
               <p>"Why, you are one of the men that held me" - A. No; he said nothing of the kind. I did not hear the rattle sprung.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Pray, what song was it that was sung - A. I heard no song. My mistress stood at the bar when Nicholls proposed to sing a song, close by, and must have heard the proposal. It is a small house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to come here last Sessions - A. A gentleman brought me a written order to attend, and said I must come. She knew I came to say, Taylor was in our house; and she knew he was in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistress asked you whether they had come into the taproom - A. Yes; and said he had not paid his reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard no noise or bustle about the door - A. No; I took no notice. I heard no rattle sprung; if one had sprung, I should have heard it.</p>

            . I am a coachman. I was at Mrs. Weedon's when Hughes came in, in company with Randall and Allger. Taylor was there. I got there about half-past eleven o'clock. Taylor laid with his head on the table, asleep. I did not see Hughes till he came in with the beadle. He asked Taylor what he had done with his light-coloured coat. He said,</p>
               <p>"What makes you ask that question?" Hughes said,</p>
               <p>"I think you are the man that looked me in the face, and took my watch."</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he said,</p>
               <p>"I think" - A. I am. Randall advised him to go into the parlour and be searched. They went out at the door. Randall, Allger, and Taylor, were not out of the house from the time I went in till Taylor was taken away. I did not expect he would be detained. I had heard the cry of</p>
               <p>"Thief!" very distinctly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you, or any one, go out to see what was the matter - A. No. Mrs. Weedon was in the bar at the time. I cannot say whether she heard it - they might be heard as well at the bar as the taproom.</p>

            . I am a coachman. I saw Hughes in the street. He had hold of a coachman with a drab coat on - he got away. I know Taylor, it was not him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the man like Taylor - A. I do not think he was. I went directly to Weedon's, and saw Taylor there, sitting by Allger; he had a brown great-coat on. I had seen him there that night before. I never saw him in a drab coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he struggling with the man about - A. He said he had lost his watch. I was led to the spot by a very great noise - I was sitting in the taproom in Weedon's house and ran out.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170061"/>Q. Do you think any one in the taproom or lobby must have heard it - A. I should think they must. Hughes was struggling with the man close to the York hotel, nearly opposite the house.</p>
               <p>CAMPBELL. I am a watchman of Tavistock-street. About twenty minutes past twelve o'clock I saw Hughes by the coach-stand, with his hand on the coach-door; he said he had been robbed of his watch, and would insist on the coach being taken to the watch-house. I said</p>
               <p>"What can you do with the coach or the horses? you had better take the number, and summons the coachman tomorrow." He was rather obstinate. I said I must not have a disturbance. Weedon's waiter came and asked him for the money for his liquor; he said he had paid it, the waiter said he had not. He pulled out 4 s. and gave him 1 s. He stood talking to the people, and said he would charge somebody.</p>
               <p>Q. Charge somebody with what - A. Robbing him, I suppose. I said,</p>
               <p>"What use is that, unless you pitch on the right man? let me see him, and I will take him." He looked about, saw nobody he could charge, and I returned to my beat. I am confident he was quite intoxicated - he certainly was not sober enough to know a man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He could not speak plain, I suppose - A. No; he could walk, but he staggered about. I took the number of the coach, it was 1127.</p>

            . I keep the York hotel, Covent-garden. On the night of the robbery I heard a noise, went to my door, and saw Hughes give the waiter some money. Before that he had charged two or three people with robbing him, and seemed so intoxicated that the watchman did not know how to act. I considered him a drunken Irishman. He said he would have the coach taken to the watch-house - then two young men came up and said something about the Greenyard; he challenged one of them to fight, and told the watchman to take one to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean that he charged any one with robbing him, or with rescuing a man from him - A. That I cannot say.</p>

            . I live with my father in Flying Horse-yard. I was out of employ, and now work with my brother in the leather-trade. I was in Charles-street between eleven and twelve o'clock on the night of the robbery, and saw Hughes in York-street, at the corner of Charles-street - a crowd was opposite the York hotel. Hughes had hold of a coach-door, and insisted on the coach and horses going to the watch-house. I thought it a curious thing, and my friend said,</p>
               <p>"You had better send it to the Greenyard" - he was going to strike my friend. He gave charge of us, we went half-way to the watch-house, he turned back - the watchman said,</p>
               <p>"Unless you go we will not take them;" he did not go, and we were liberated. I came back, and stood at the corner of Charles-street, by the York hotel, for five minutes; Hughes came, and said to Fitzgerald,</p>
               <p>"Take these men, they shall go to the watch-house" - I said,</p>
               <p>"We are innocent, and will go." When we got there he said we had rescued a person from him, and that 50 l. would not fetch his watch, chain and seals. We were sent to Tothil-fields, and discharged without any indictment. The prosecutor came to me at the Sessions House, Clerkenwell, and said he was sorry I was sent to Tothil-fields, and said,</p>
               <p>"You ought to have let me know you was there." I said that it was not my place. He said,</p>
               <p>"If I had known it you should not have been kept there," and that the beadle had told him it was not necessary to bring an indictment against any but the man who committed the robbery. After that he asked me to drink; I went to the Crown - he said he was sorry I had been in confinement, and wished to know where my brother lived. He told me to bring him to No. 54, Portland-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything about your coming on this trial - A. He asked me if I could not keep out of the way during the trial? I said I could not.</p>

On the morning of the 15th of May we missed this lead off the privy in the back garden - I saw it safe two days before. I was awoke about a quarter past four o'clock in the morning by a female servant, who said somebody was stealing it - it was daybreak. I got up; we searched the garden, and found three pieces of lead - one piece in the garden, one on the parapet, and another in the next garden, they were rolled up. I left the watchman in the garden and went up stairs for my stockings. I looked out of window, and saw a man going over three garden walls into Mrs. Hoffman's garden, he had a long coat and a hat on. I saw him in custody before five o'clock that morning. The watchman brought him out of Southampton-mews. By getting over the walls he might drop into that mews. He had the same kind of a coat on as the man I saw get over the walls.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Hoffman, of No. 57, Russell-square. About three o'clock in the morning I got up, went to the window, and saw a man at the corner of Mrs. Fraile's garden, he was stooping. I opened the window, he tried to conceal himself behind the trees. In a few minutes I heard a noise like a hinge or something knocking, which alarmed me. I called the watchman, he sprang his rattle, and another came. I saw him get over Mrs. Fraile's wall and seven other walls, the last of which led into the back of Bedford-place and Bloomsbury-square, he could then get into the mews. He had a bottle-green loose great-coat on. I saw a man jump from a house at the corner of the mews, and run along the mews about three-quarters of an hour after. I watched him getting over the walls till that time.</p>

            . I am footman at No. 59, Russell-square. I was awoke a little before four o'clock by the watchman's rattle. I looked out of the window, and the watchman asked me if any man was in the gardens? I then saw a man going out of the gardens over several walls; he had a dark loose great coat on. I had a side view of his face, and can swear the prisoner is the man. It was quite light. I and the watchman went into every garden in Bedford-place till we came to Bloomsbury-square, I then saw him at the top of the stables in Southampton-mews, sitting behind a chimney. I called to him, he came towards me, and said,</p>
               <p>"It is no use making a resistance." As soon as he came to the parapet wall, which is twenty feet high, he jumped down and the watchman took him at the end of the mews. I am quite sure he is the man - I had a full view of his face.</p>

On Monday evening, the 10th of May, I was passing through Burr-street, and met the prisoner, with another person, not in custody; I watched them a few minutes, saw the prisoner go up to the truck, and draw it away from the cellar - he passed by me, and drew it down Burr-street to Nighingale-lane. I followed, and had him in sight until a cart prevented me, then the other had got it. I turned up Well-street, the prisoner was walking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170063"/>behind the truck; when he got to the Theatre he saw me, and said.</p>
               <p>"To the right." The other person went to the left.

I immediately collared the prisoner. Alder claimed the truck.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man, named Smedley, about eleven o'clock, he said he knew a man who had some old iron to sell, and as we went by Burr-street he said,</p>
               <p>"I have seen this truck several times in the street, and I mean to take it to the Greenyard." I said I would have nothing to do with it. I met him again about four o'clock, he said he would take it to the Greenyard. I said,</p>

            . I am an officer of Whitechapel. On Saturday morning I stopped Johnson in a passage by Whitechapel Church with the saddle and part of the harness on his back. He said they were his master's, a Mr. Goodwin, of Whitechapel-market. I went to his lodgings, and found Smith in bed there - they lived together. I found the bridle and two whips by the bed-side. He said he knew nothing of them. I found about twenty pick-lock keys concealed in the chimney, with files for making them.</p>

            . I am servant to a stationer, and live in Chapel-court, Swallow-street. On the 21st of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner near Exeter Change, Strand, in company with two other lads, following a gentleman; one of the three took hold of a gentleman's pocket and felt it; they left that gentleman, and went on, through Charing-cross, into Cockspur-street, then all three followed a lady and gentleman to the <placeName id="t18200517-135-crimeloc788">Colonade</placeName>

He put it into his pocket, and went on. I secured him, but nobody would assist me to find the gentleman. A gentleman on horse-back told me where he was gone. I came up to him in Waterloo-place - he felt, missed his handkerchief, and asked me to give it him. I refused. I had found it in the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HONE. Q. Are you sure he is man - A. I am. I did not ask the gentleman his name, and do not know it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the handkerchief by the Opera House, and asked several people if they had lost an handkerchief.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 21st of May, I missed these things from our lodgings; about an hour after I took the officer to the prisoner's lodgings, and found them all there. I knew her before. She had been to my house about half-past ten o'clock, with a man named Thunnell, and went up stairs - I saw all the things safe after they left. She is a girl of the town. I went out for about half an hour, and when I returned I missed them.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Gray's Inn-lane. Between twelve and one o'clock on Monday morning, the prosecutrix said she had been robbed - the prisoner stood at the end of the court - the prosecutrix said nobody but her and Thunnell had been in the house; we asked the prisoner where Thunnell lodged - she said he was an honest man, and refused to tell us. She advised the prosecutrix to have every house in the court searched; the prisoner was going away, I detained her; she afterwards shut herself in her mother's house, where she lived, in the same court. I got an officer, and found the things on the first floor there, and found the prisoner on the second floor, lying on the bed - she pretended to be asleep. We were obliged to carry her down stairs.</p>
