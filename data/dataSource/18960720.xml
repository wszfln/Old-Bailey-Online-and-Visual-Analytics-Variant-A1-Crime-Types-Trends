               <p>the evening of Monday, July 6th, I went into a urinal in Morley Road—after a minute or so the two prisoners came in; Connelly stood on my right, Knight followed him in close behind—he turned and faced me, put his back to the door, and said, "You are not going out of here unless you give me something"—I said, "For what?"—he said, "Something for beer"—I made an attempt to get out, and he repeated, "You will not go out of here unless you give us something "—then Connelly turned round and said, "You are not going out unless you give us something for beer'—I had a good look at them; I thought they were very vicious men, and I put my hand in my pocket, and gave them 2d. to get out—there was only one entrance to the place—they were both strangers to me; I had seen them about before, and knew them by sight, but never spoke to them—after giving them the money Knight cleared away, and let me go out at once—I went straight to the Archway Tavern, and fetched a policeman, and gave them both into custody—they were then going down the street—I followed Knight to the station; I don't know what became of Connelly; I only, charged Knight, because he was the one that kept me back—I did not take notice which way Connelly went.</p>

He fought me, and gave me a black eye, and a lump on the nose, and one of his friends made a running kick at me. I got up, and said, 'Oh, you cowards!' and struck him and his friend with my stick, and left them both on the ground. I ran the other side of the road. Fitzgerald was fighting another man and one of his friends at the same time. His motive in doing this is because I am a friend of this man, Fitzgerald; and his wife has had a child by Fitzgerald. It was him who struck me first. If it was not for my stick, I should have been murdered." <hi rend="italic">Fitzgerald says:</hi> "I was in the West<lb/>minster Arms when the prosecutor and seven or eight others came out of the public-house, turned round to me, and said, 'Come on, Fitzy; I have got it in for you.' I said, 'All right,' and with that he made a running kick at me, and caught me on the leg. I said, 'See what he is doing, Ryan; he is kicking me.' Ryan asked him to fight fair. The prosecutor struck him. He pushed one of his pals on to me. I fought with him in the middle of the road in Praed Street;, and we had to run away on account of the mob he had with him. This is the third attempt he has attempted to set about me. He denies knowing me, but he has drunk in my company. The woman he is living with, or is married to, had a child by me. This is hatched up out of spite."</p>

                  </hi>. At, the beginning of June this year I took a coffee-shop at 8, Chapel Street, Marylebone; previous to that I had always lived at Bideford with my son—on Monday, June 22nd, the prisoner came to the house—I had never seen him before—he had some papers in his hands—he said he wanted to see me privately—I told him to come into the room behind the kitchen—he came—he said he had heard this was a bad house, and that some woman was seen to come there last Christmas—I said I had only been there a fortnight—he said, "You have been here a month "—he said his price was £50, but he would take £10 for putting down the house—he did not tell me what he was going to do; I thought it was to keep it quiet; that was what I gathered from what he said—I told him I had only been there a fortnight, and I had kept the house respectable, and I should apply to the railway company that I had taken the house from—he said he was going to the Police-station to take the law, and I should hear from him again—he asked if I had a husband—I said, "Yes"—he asked what he was—I said, "Afarmer"—he went away, and came back about ten or half-past—he rang the bell; I opened the door—he said, "Have you made up your mind what you are going to do?"—I said, "What do you mean? I am going to apply to the rail-way company," and I shut the door, and went straight home to my husband and son—in the meantime I received this letter: "18<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, Mona Terrace. Dear Madam,—As you do not wish me to say anything about your shop, this is to say, I will say nothing for £5—£2 10s. down, the balance when the trial comes off "—when my son arrived, I handed the letter to him, and he saw the prisoner.</p>

I live at Bideford—I am the son of the last witness—after receiving a communication from my mother, I came to London on Saturday, June 26th, I caused a little girl to write a letter to the prisoner, and he came to see me on Saturday afternoon—I showed him the letter to my mother, and asked him if he was the man who wrote it—he said, "Yes, I am the man"—he was carrying papers and a pocket-book; he began to flourish the papers about—I told him he was a rogue and a London sharper, and said, "Come outside; I am going to give you in charge "—he commenced to shuffle the papers about, and said, "I will show you who I am, and will give you in charge "—I gave him the length of my stick across his back—he did not say much—I had hold of him by the collar of his coat—he pretended to show fight for a while—he partly took off his coat, but he put it on again; I had given him enough before—he said the house was a bad house, and he would make it hot for me if I did not let him go—I held him till an officer came up, and then I gave him into custody—he heard me send for a policeman—he said, "I will make it hot for you, you cur!"</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Charles Virgo, as foreign bankers, at Leadenhall Buildings—we have correspondents in Valencia, J. F. Carles and Co.—on June 23rd we received the letter and envelope by post; it enclosed this bill of exchange for 30,000 francs. (<hi rend="italic">This was on paper, stamped with the name of Carles, of Valencia</hi>.) It is accepted and endorsed, "J. B. Carles"—I know their signature; this is a very good imitation of it—they use a stamp like this, and the number would be approximately correct—the letter enclosed another, apparently written by Antonio Morales to his father; this is it—these letters are in Spanish; I did not translate them, but I have sufficient knowledge of Spanish to make myself acquainted with the contents—I cabled to Carles, and after that the prisoner Coll called that day—a person who styled him<lb/>self an interpreter came into my office with him—these two documents "D." and "E," were sent in first as an introduction—I am under the impress<lb/>sion that the envelope was open—I glanced at the letters, and went out to the outer office to Coll; there was a conversation through the inter<lb/>preter, as I do not speak Spanish—I spoke to him as Don Antonio Morales, and he assented to that—I told him it was not convenient to carry the business through that day, and he had better come next morn<lb/>ing—he seemed very much put out, and asked if it could not be settled later in the day—I said that he could come back at 3.30 if he liked, and it was possible we might do it; and if he would leave the bond with me, I would give him a receipt for it—he then handed me this French bond, numbered 11007, and I wrote this receipt for it—having seen, the reference in letter "C" from A. Morales to his father, and the reference to Lincoln, we telegraphed to Lincoln—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189607200024"/>
               <p>Coll then left, and a few minutes later my clerk made a communication to me—Coll returned shortly before four o'clock, and in consequence of what my clerk said, I returned the bond and got the receipt back, and a few minutes afterwards I got the bond back and handed back the receipt—I told him I was unable to carry out the affair that day, and asked him to call at eleven next morning—before he called I had received a reply to my telegram from Valencia, in consequence of which I communicated with the police on the morning of the 24th—I had a friend, Mr. Negroto, there that morning, who understands Spanish—Coll came about eleven o'clock, and Mr. Negroto translated what was said—I said, "Have you come for the money?"—Coll said, "Yea"—he was asked, "Are you Antonio Morales?"—he said, "No"—he was asked, "Where is Antoniq Morales?"—he said, "In Paris"—I understood him to say that he had been employed by Morales as a clerk to come to England—he said, "Is there any difficulty?"—I said, "The difficulty is that the letters you bring are false; this is a police officer, and I am going to give you in custody," and the policeman took him in charge—the letter is a fair imita<lb/>tion of the signature of Carles and Co.</p>

Joseph and Vergo—he said that the papers and money found on him were handed to him by Coll to take care of, but he knew nothing whatever about them; he also told me he met a man in Paris, and asked him to come to London with him.</p>

Marsden, Morrell, Gateshill, Davis, and Jones, Son and Co., on his behalf, in August and September, 1894, buying from those firms on the de<lb/>fendant's account, and on the usual Liverpool market terms, including, on August 24th, from Morrell, 150 pails of North's lard (a pail in about 28 lbs., and the present value about 10s.), of the value of about £75; on August 25th, 250 pails, £125; on August 30th, 250 pails, £125; making £325; on September 3rd, seven boxes of Morrell hams. £103 4s. 9d.; August 30th, invoiced September 5th, 250 pails Morrell's lard, £134 17s. 6d.—I saw Weir at Liverpool on September 5th—my previous transactions had been by letter and telegram—I went round with him to various places—I had no knowledge of his financial position—he gave me no reason why he wanted the goods—he did not say where they were to go—I produced the contract notes at the Police-courts.</p>

Dotteridge, of 13, Duke Street, Tooley Street—he is a provision merchant and commis<lb/>sion agent—the defendant, in August and September, 1894, deposited documents of title on goods for cash advances made to him from time to time by our firm—we took delivery, and sold to customers of our own, charging the defendant a commission of 5 per cent.—he paid the carriage—I think we advanced to him up to the full market value—if we made a loss we should get the balance off—we work several accounts together, and there is a division of the credit—the advance is made before the goods are disposed of—if there is a profit we put it to the defendant's credit, or remit to him, deducting freight, commission, and other expenses—on Sep<lb/>tember</p>

               <p>6th, 1894, the defendant deposited with us fifty kegs of Ham<lb/>mond's lard, seven boxes of Morrell's hams, four boxes of picnic hams—we advanced £100 against the lard and one lot of hams—I have the extract from the ledger—at that time the defendant owed us £1,300—we set the proceeds of the goods to his credit—we disposed of, by September 18th, goods which realised £97—I did not know the price invoiced to him—it was not our business to inquire—we realised for the goods deposited on September 6th £232—we placed that to the defendant's credit, less the £100 advanced—Mr. Berry, the trustee, got to know of that, and called it a fraudulent preference—we repaid that amount with costs to the estate—our profit was 3 per cent.—the four boxes of picnic hams (the shoulder part) realised £38.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler at Hemel Hempstead—in 1891 I was coachman to Lord Leconsfield, of Petworth House—I knew the defendant as a solicitor at Petworth—he has acted for me as a solicitor—out of my wages and other means I saved sums of money from time to time, which I handed to the defendant—in April, 1890, I handed to him £150, another sum of £50 in October, 1890, another sum of £50 in April, 1891, and another £50 in September, 1891—by that time he had about £300 of mine in his hands—I had previously entrusted him with other moneys, for which I had a mortgage, and upon which I was receiving interest—I handed him the £300 for investment—he told me that he had a capital investment at Littlehampton, and the money was placed there—some time after that some deeds were brought to me by Mr. Pulling, one of the defendant's clerks; amongst them was this letter of March 2nd, 1892, enclosing the deeds of the Littlehampton property—next day, March 3rd, I took those deeds back to the defendant's office, and gave them to one of the head clerks, Mr. Granger—the day after I got this letter from the defendant, stating that the Littlehampton deeds were in his hands for safe custody—later on, in 1892, I saw the defendant, and spoke to him about my money and deeds—I asked him, if I wanted the money in three months' time, would he withdraw the invest<lb/>ment, and hand it over—he said he would do so; I could have the money at the end of three months—I went to the office several times in the course of the year—I saw the clerks a great many times; I did not see the defendant himself more than once after I had applied for the money—I definitely requested him to get the money for me; to the best of my knowledge, that would be about September, 1892—I asked to have the money in three months' time; that would be about the end of the year; I did not get the money, the interest, or the deeds—I got this letter of January 4th, 1893, dated from Petworth, stating that he would bring the deeds the next time he came to Petworth—I believe he was then at Horsham—I then went to see Messrs. D. Rydone and Co., solicitors, of Petworth; I could not say whether it was the same day or the next; I consulted them, and gave them this authority on January 6th, 1893, but did not get the deeds, and they then commenced legal proceedings on my behalf; I have never received the deeds, or the £300—I gave the defendant no authority to deal with them in any way—these four receipts were given to me by the defendant on my handing him the four sams making the £300.</p>

               <p>you were going wrong—you sent Mr. Granger to me, from time to time, to ask if I had any more money to invest—you held the £300 to invest on the Littlehampton property, and £200 of Mr. Browitt's—I could not say when I first heard of the Littlehampton security, because I had given over all the papers to you from the time you forwarded me the deeds to look over; I handed them to you at your office, and I have never seen them since—I saw you first about the investment in the Littlehampton property; I don't remember whether Granger and I talked it over before I saw you—I have been in your office several times with Granger—I don't remember whether it was said that the property belonged to Mr. Blagden; you sent me the deeds by Pulling—it was a largish bundle; I looked them over; I did not count them; I thought they were safe in your hands when I returned them—they were papers; I don't know about parchments—I did not know much about deeds at that time, not so much as I do now—I certainly expected that a proper security would be drawn up, the same as in Browitt's case—everything was properly done until you took the deeds away, and stopped everything—I was not great friends with Granger, not towards the last—he never told me that Briggs was the clerk that did all my business—I did not ask Granger where the mortgage was, or when it would be ready—I remember coming to the office, and asking, and it was not ready—I don't know whether I saw you then or Granger—I asked for the deeds a great many times, but never got them; I did not ask you for them after March, 1892; I never had a chance, because you were never there; you were gone—I do not remember your sending me in any bill; I had no bill—I did not give you any direc<lb/>tion in writing to hold these deeds; I simply asked you if you would take care of them for me, because I was travelling about the country; you paid me the interest up to 1892; until then I had made no sort of request for security—I never, to my knowledge, saw a deed passing the property from Mr. Blagden to you—I do not remember giving you my commission or percentage—I became very uneasy about the securities when I heard that you had gone abroad—I don't know that I spoke to Granger about it; I don't know what was said—I had been to the office several times—I did not go to Rydone and Co. at once; I waited a day or two, not long—Granger did not tell me there was something wrong to my knowledge—I did not hear from Petworth that there was a mis<lb/>take about these deeds; Granger had not got them; he could not get at them, because you had the key of the safe; Granger told me so—I did not see Granger at all times, sometimes I saw him, and sometimes someone else—I was very angry with Granger after I found that everything had gone wrong—he did not offer me any deeds as a substitute for these; I never heard of them—I left everything in Rydone's hands—I am not aware that you asked Mr. Ashby not to sell the property—Granger never told me that the deeds had been sent to Mr. Ashby.</p>

                  </hi>. In 1892 I was deed clerk to the defendant at Petworth—there was a strong room in which deeds and securities were kept—a securities book was kept; this is it—at page 166 I find an entry of a list of deeds relating to 27, Surrey Street, Littlehampton—among others, there is entered a deed of August 6th, 1883, one of December 17th, 1887, another of September 8th, 1888, and another of January 27th, 1891, the last being a conveyance by Blagden to the defendant of the property at 27, Surrey Street—I find here the four deeds entered in the securities book—there is a pencil-mark on the back in my writing: "Documents handed to Mr. Chennel, March 2nd, 1892 "; that is in Spooner's writing—that entry is struck through in pencil, and under it is, "Returned for safe custody"—there is also a third entry, "Sent to Messrs. Ashby, May 23rd, 1892 "; there is a x on that entry, showing that those ticked were sent to Messfs. Ashby—this paper is a list of some of the deeds entered in the securities book; that is in the defendant's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no recollection of taking a bundle of deeds to Mr. Chennel on March 2nd, 1892; there is no such entry—the strong room is a new room—I don't know why I made these entries in pencil—the instruction on the security-sheet is when deeds are handed out—there should be a pencil entry for the time being, to be rubbed out when they are returned—they should be sorted when returned—we sort three times a week; at busy times that cannot be done at once—Mr. Granger had a key of the strong room—I have no recollection of telling Spooner to make these entries; probably he made them from the draft sheet—Mr. Chennel saw Granger sometimes when he called—Granger lived at the office—I have no recollection of your seeing Chennel personally after March 2nd; I think, as a rule, he saw Granger—f think the Littlehamp<lb/>ton property was in his department, probably in Briggs at that time; I could not say, because they were altered—there were a good many clerks in the office, and a good many clients; it would be very possible for mis<lb/>takes sometimes to occur—you were away from the office a good deal latterly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Thomas Ashby and Co., bankers, at Staines—the prisoner banked with us for many years—on and off, for the last fifteen or sixteen years, he deposited with us the title-deeds of properties—he had two accounts; one an ordinary account, and another described as a clients' account—that was only entered in our books as a "C" account; that was for his own convenience—in our pass-book I see it is called "Clients' account"; the other was a drawing account—we always understood that the securities he deposited were his own property—in 1887 I asked him definitely on the subject, and he satisfied us that he was dealing with his own property—in February, 1892, I received from him this letter, dated 5th: "Pet-worth. Dear Sir,—When I saw you the other day you said I was to think over how best to keep the clients' property separate from my own. It seems to me to be impracticable. I wish to take the Littlehampton deeds and substitute others, on the same arrangement as before. Can you do this?"—he had at that time deposited with us the deeds of the Littlthampton property, and he had deposited other deeds to enable him to have an overdraft—on February 21st I received from him these letters, of February 20th, February 25th, and February 27th, and one May 19th—we wrote to him this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Unless you can arrange to conduct your business with us in a way satisfactory, different from what you are doing, we must close the account; unless provided for, your cheque will be returned; distinctly understand we cannot have this constant and daily trouble with your account"). On May 19th I received from him this letter, stating that he proposed to mortgage the Littlehampton property, which he valued at from £300 to £400—I replied to that on the 20th, enclosing a list of the deeds; and on the 23rd I wrote, telling him the amount due from him must be sent, as his account could not be over<lb/>drawn—that represents the condition of things on May 23rd—at that time the clients' account was overdrawn £333, and the current account £1,152—on May 26th I got an equitable charge upon them, which was forwarded to me; we took a separate charge upon each—on January 5th, 1893, I received from him this letter, asking for the return of the Littte<lb/>hampton deeds at once, as he could do something with them—we did not part with them—we subsequently got a mortgage executed by him—this is it—we subsequently realised our security among the property sold—we sold the Littlehampton property—those deeds were handed to the purchaser—this is the document sent in the letter of May 23rd, the assignment from Knight to Leggatt, the conveyance from Leggatt to Daintry, and the conveyance from Blagden to Daintry of Jan. 22nd, 1891."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Haslemere Terrace, Acton—on June 24th. I went to No. 8, Bangor Street, with a woman for a purpose—I was sober—while there I took off my coat—I lay on the bed outside, and fell asleep—I was asleep about half an hour—I was awakened by the prisoner feeling in my pockets—he took my tobacco-box and about nine shillings in money—I don't know him—I had seen him once before in company with the woman—I struggled with him, and he stabbed me with a large knife over the eye—he then ran downstairs, and I followed—he rushed at me and knocked me down, and kicked me when I got up; he knocked my head against the iron railings—I then became insensible—I identify this tobacco-box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective of the C Division—I was in company with Cunningham, a police officer, on July 4th, at ten p.m., in Sher<lb/>wood. Street, near Piccadilly Circus—I saw the two prisoners there, loitering up and down—they were walking together for about twenty minutes—Thomas looked round, and saw us, and immediately loft Mark<lb/>ham—I followed Markham into Golden Square—Markham was carrying a parcel—I told him we were police officers, and asked what were the contents of the parcel—he said, "It is mine, have a look for yourself"—I opened the parcel—it contained a dark lantern, two wooden wedges, and a sack—I took him into custody—at Vine street I asked him had he anything else about him—from his inside pocket he produced a jemmy—a box of matches and a key were found on him—I returned to try and find Thomas, but failed—the following day I went with Cunningham into Broad Street, Golden Square, and Saw Thomas.</p>

I said, "Certainly; you are not going to meddle with me?"—he came in and went into the back-yard—I went and got a can to get him some water—he came again into the kitchen and said, "I hardly know what to do with you. Are you my friend, or my enemy?" I said, "Your friend, of course"—he repeated the remark about twice—he was standing by the kitchen door—his hand was in his right-hand pocket—I was near him, with the can in my left hand—my little boy called out, "Hullo, mother, run"—nothing happened to me; only, as the prisoner fired, I held up the can—I did not see the pistol; I saw the reflection in the kitchen door; the powder scratched my hand—he was about two or three feet from me; I ran out into the street, and he ran after me, and fired at me again—I heard the report; I was struck on the hip on the right-hand side—after that there was another report—I ran into the house of Mr. Goad, a neighbour—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the station, and charged him—I could not say whether he was sober or not on this night—he drank sometimes—he has been very strange, very delirious, very much wandering about for nearly twelve months.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Selbourne Road, Forest Gate, and I am chief preventive officer of Customs—I went with Kitchen to the Liliput Arms and saw the prisoner—T told him I was an officer of Customs, and had reason to believe he had contraband goods on his pre<lb/>mises—he said he had nothing that he knew of—I said I should search the house—he then said that he bought five cases of brandy some time previously—T asked him if he had an Excise permit—he said he had none—I asked if he had entered the spirits in his stock book—he said, "No"—I called for his stock-book, examined it, and found no entry relating to this—I asked where the cases of spirits were—he said, "Upstairs "—I followed him to a room on the same floor with the spirit room, with a room between them, where the spirits were under a settee—I said I should charge him with harbouring the goods with the intention of defrauding the Customs—he said he bought them of a publican named McGilp, who stated he had given up his public-house and was rather hard-up, and he gave him £6 for it out of charity—the value of it, plus duty, is £10 16s. 8d.—the duty is £5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not aware that three or four of us were asking questions at the same time—Kitchen was present the whole time—I did not specially inquire into it; I went on searching the house—I went into the spirit room; there were, perhaps, the contents of four or five cases there—there were spirits in cask in the cellar, but not in the room; about £300 worth—the spirits were not all in the spirit room—he pointed, me out these five cases of brandy—it is not a public room; I saw a young lady undergoing a French lesson there—I heard the name McGilp—there was no necessity to give a false name—he did not describe both men to me—the description went no further than the name—it was not said that he was lame and stout, and wore spectacles—he said he was introduced by Norton, having a house.</p>
