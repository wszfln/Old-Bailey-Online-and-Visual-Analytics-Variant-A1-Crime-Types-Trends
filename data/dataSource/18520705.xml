                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Otto Alexander Berens, and another, of St. Paul's Churchyard, it is a large establishment, and they employ a great number of people—among other things they deal in clocks—the prisoner, Pope, was in their service—my attention was called to his conduct on 30th April—I went with him to a house where he lived, at Dalston, and there found a good deal of property belonging to my em<lb/>ployers—the next day Pope made a statement to me, in consequence of which, on 3rd May, I went to the house of the prisoner Hirschfield, in Bishopsgate-street Within—Pope remained outside—he gave me the number of the shop—it is in the public street; it is a shop for the sale of clocks, watches, jewellery, and miscellaneous articles of that sort—I saw four or five clocks in the window before I went in—I found his wife in the shop—she called him, and he came forward—I asked him to let me look at one of the clocks in the window—he did so, and I recognised it as one of Mr. Beren's—I asked him the price—he said either 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 65<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I do not exactly recollect which—I then asked for another, and so went through five (<hi rend="italic">looking at five clocks</hi>)—I believe this marble one is the first one I looked at, and these are the others—I only asked the price of one—they were all on the counter at the time—four of them were in the window and one in the shop—both the marble clocks were in the window—after examining the clocks, I told Hirschfield they were stolen, and inquired where he bought them—he said he bought them of some young man living at Kingsland, that his wife purchased the first for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the black one he gave either 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for,</p>

               <p>himself, and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each of the marble ones—I asked him whether he bought anything else—he said, "Yes, I have bought ten duplicates, for which I gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, on the understanding that if they turned out well I would give a trifle more"—he said the duplicates were for clocks—he pro<lb/>duced nine duplicates—I do not recollect whether he mentioned the tenth—I sent Mr. Tucker, who was with me, for a policeman, to be present while I directed Mr. Tucker to take an account of the duplicates which he had—the policeman came in, and I believe the prisoner Pope with him—I directed Tucker to bring him in, and Hirschfield immediately identified him as the person of whom he bought the clocks—Pope was not in custody—I had not spoken to the policeman before, it was only a casual policeman that I spoke to—an altercation took place between the prisoners—Hirschfield said to Pope, "You have deceived me, in representing you were in business in Dalston, and that you were in difficulties"—Pope said, "You have held out every inducement to me to bring property"—Tucker had commenced making a list of the duplicates, and had taken down two, I believe, or he might have commenced the third, and Hirschfield said, "I will not allow it to be taken down, if you like to pay me for them you may have them"—the policeman reminded him that if he did not permit me to take them down, I could give him in charge as well as Pope, and after some little hesitation on Hirschfield's part, the list was proceeded with—Heischfield said that he had taken one of the clocks out of pledge—I believe that clock was in the shop—it was one of the rosewood ones—Pope was given into custody the following morning—I left Hirschfield in the shop—these goods are not in my department, but in Mr. Taylor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor for this prosecution. I attended at Guildhall when this matter was inquired into as to Pope before Sir Robert Carden—Hirschfield was summoned there with a number of other witnesses—he made a statement before Sir Robert Carden, which was taken down in writing—he was sworn and examined—I have a copy of his statement—it was read over to him afterwards in my presence, and signed by the Alderman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185207050004"/>
               <p>—he corrected some portions of it as it went on, and those corrections were made in this copy—after hearing him examined, Sir Robert Carden thought it proper that he should be placed by the side of Pope, and wished to know whether Mr. Wood would give him into custody—Mr. Wood said he thought it his duty to do so, and he was thereupon given into custody—his statement was read over to him, and he refused to sign it—his solicitor advised him not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There were two examinations, were there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at one of which Hirschfield was examined as a witness—Mr. Wood, the clerk, took down the examination, he will be here in a moment—on the next occasion a copy of the rough notes was read over to him, and he made some alterations—he said he was deaf, and I therefore spoke very loud to him—he did not desire to make any alteration which was refused to be made—he did not refuse to sign it because of his not being able to alter some part of it—he would have signed it, only his solicitor advised him not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the service of the St. Katherine's Dock Company, and was occupied as such on 8th May—the Prisoner was employed there by the Customs—on that day I was engaged in examin<lb/>ing some baggage in the examining shed B—my duty is to unpack and repack the baggage—I had opened a trunk belonging to Colonel Armytage, for the purpose of having it examined by the proper officers—the prisoner was on duty at shed B—his duty was to take charge of the goods that came into the shed, and then to write them out again when they were outside.</p>

               <p>he is not here—he had assisted me in examining the trunk—it was not the prisoner's duty to enter the contents of any of the trunks, only to enter the cases as they come into the shed into a large hook, the marks and numbers of all the packages—he has got a kind of desk there—he had nothing to do with examining the contents of any of the packages, that was my duty—his duty was only to examine the outsides of them, and to enter them in the book—I do not know that he was in the habit of afterwards examining them and comparing them with his book to see whether he had entered them correctly—I believe it was his duty to do so, but I have nothing to do with his book—it was certainly his duty to make his entry as correct as possible—I saw him take his handkerchief out and put it up to his face—I clearly saw him put something white into his pocket—he did not put it into his handkerchief, but into his pocket—he had his handkerchief in the same hand—he did not cover it with his handkerchief, or I could not have seen that it was white—I have never said that he put it into his handkerchief—it was not covered, I could see it—it was about a quarter past 11 in the day, it might be a few minutes more or less—Mr. Simpson was near me at the time I saw him do this—I drew his attention to it immediately—it was about twenty minutes or half past 3 that I saw him the second time—my course of duty led me into the shed at that time, and the prisoner also—I have been in the employment of the Dock Company about thirteen years—I have never been charged with any offence, nor ever discharged and taken back again—I cannot tell how long the prisoner has been in the employ of the Customs, I think he was in this shed about eight days—they change every month.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that a common thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, if the surveyor has got much to do he cannot get round till late in the afternoon; sometimes, when they are rather slack, he would be in three or four times in the course of the day, and it would be done up directly, but we must leave it till he comes in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then who is responsible for the property during this long interval? who is there to look after it, and see that nobody takes it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a foreman of labourers there, and clerks—Mr. Shult was the foreman—the charges did not remain at his desk all this day—it was his duty to do so.</p>

               <p>Cambridge. On Monday, 10th May last, I came to London on business—about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, having transacted my business, I went to the Shoreditch railway station to inquire what time the train left and as I had half an hour to spare, I thought I would take a walk towards Shoreditch Church—as I was going along I met the prisoner Shaw—he put his hand on my shoulder to draw my attention, and asked me if I wished to buy any cigars—I refused at first, but he kept talking to me, and at last I consented to go with him and see these cigars—he took me into a beer shop, in Boundary-street, I believe it is called—I had walked with him about twenty yards, but to the beer-shop would be about 100 yards—I believe it is at the corner of Boundary-street—I had a gold watch and chain—the chain was a very thick one, and likely to attract attention—any one who saw me in the street might see that I had a gold watch and chain—when we got into the beer-shop Shaw asked me if I would have anything to drink—I refused, and said I did not care about anything, I wished to see the cigars—he said, "Don't be afraid, I am not going to hurt you; you had better have something to drink," and he took me by the hand—I said, "No, thank you" I knew it was a beer-shop when I went in—I did not see any sign over the door, but I could see there was a taproom, so I concluded it was a beer-shop—he went out of the room, saying he was going to get the cigars, and when he went out I heard the door shut, and as if it was locked—I heard a lock turn in the door—he said something about fetching some handkerchiefs and gloves as well as cigars, and I said, "I don't care about any of those things"—I distinctly heard the door shut and locked—after the lapse of about three minutes four other persons came into the room by another door, a back door—that door communicates with the tap—there is a yard behind which I believe leads into another parlour, and communicates with the front door, so you may go round in a regular circle—there was a very small table in the room I was in, with a few forms, I believe; I did not take any particular notice—it is not divided like a coffee house, it is only a small room, about ten feet in length—the persons that came in sat down at the table, and one of them had three cards in his hand; that man had also two books in his hand, with brass clasps, and he wished to sell them for sixpence, but as none of the people wished to buy them, he offered to play for them, and they should have them if they happened to win them, or for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they played, and he won 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they went on playing for a few minutes, until he won a few pounds—I saw some money handed over to him by some of the persons who were with him—it was an old man who handed him the money—the prisoner Ricketts was one of the men—he was not the man that had the cards—I was sitting down towards the door I came in at, at the end of the table, waiting for Shaw to bring the cigars—after the old man appeared to have lost the money, Ricketts staked a gold chain, at least one that looked like gold, against some money, and lost it—I saw the man with the cards take it up—after that Ricketts won, and I saw about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to him, but I did not take particular notice of what passed, I was waiting for the cigars more than paying attention to them—I saw some gold paid to Ricketts by the man with the cards, I cannot say how much—the old man staked a silver watch and chain, and lost it, and he seemed very much annoyed that he should be so unfortunate, and stamped his feet—Ricketts said to me, "Shall I play for you, or will you try yourself?"—I said, "No, I would rather not, thank you; I don't care about it just now," but he said, "Oh, I will win some money for the gentleman," and went on playing—he won some money at first—he did not offer it to me, but I said nothing to him, because I of course</p>

               <p>understood that he was not playing for me, and I had given him to under<lb/>stand that he was not to play for me—after that he began to lose, and lost some money, and when I looked at my watch and thought it was time to be going by the train, they gave me to understand that I must pay about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was Ricketts who spoke to me—when I moved towards the door and said I must be going, he said, "You must pay before you go"—I said, "Pay what?" he said, "Oh, I have been losing about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for you, and you must pay"—I said, "I shall not pay, I have not played, or requested you to play"—they all came round me and said, "You must pay"—I said, "I shall do nothing of the kind"—they came round me and immediately took the watch from my pocket, and the chain, and the rings from my fingers—the old man took off the rings, Ricketts took the watch and chain, and a fourth man, who I did not exactly know by sight, took the purse out of my pocket, and emptied the money into the hands of the man with the cards—there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, a sovereign, a half sovereign, and a few shillings in silver—the value of the watch and chain was about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—it was an Albert chain—Ricketts gave the watch to the man with the cards—I did not consent to their taking these things from me, I gave them up because I feared personal violence—I did not resist them, they took them from me with their hands—the empty purse was placed at the corner of the table—I took it up and put it in my pocket—this is it (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—after they had all gone, Ricketts remained behind—he said he was very sorry indeed that he should have been so unfortunate, and appeared very sorry that anything of the kind should have occurred, and gave me to understand that he knew where these people had gone to, but as I tried to follow them he held me by the arms and would not let me—that was directly they had left, before I had got out of the room—they went out at the door I came in at—I did not observe it unlocked, in fact they were all round me, and I was rather confused, so that I did not take particular notice of what occurred—I at last got out of the place, in about three or five minutes after the men had left—I did not see anything of them when I got out—Ricketts was with me—he held me by the arm all the time, promising to show me where they had gone if I would go with him—he walked with me through some alley into Shoreditch—I then said, "Where are these men that have robbed me?" or "taken my money," and he let go of my arm, and appeared quite innocent, and wished to know what I was talking about—I then left him to go after a policeman, and I went to the railway station—I gave the police a description of the persons, and afterwards, in consequence of information, I went to the Hampton races.</p>

I know these two coats—this one belonged to a neighbour in the street, and this other to a young man, a clerk—they were in my custody—I lost three other coats, which have not been found—one pair of trowsers has been found—the value of all I lost was about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these two coats I can identify, as being in my custody—I missed them on the same day I went before the Magistrate, on 24th June, about half past 4 o'clock in the morning—they had been safe about half past 12 the night before—they were then in my front parlour, which I use as a shop; the work had been done on them—they were ready to go home—one of the officers rang the bell, and called me up—I went down, and found the street door all correct—one of the windows in the parlour was wide open—the blind was still there—that window was not open on the night before—I was the last person up—I cannot say that the window was fastened, but it was shut down flush, that I am quite sure of—it is a window I hardly ever open—I stand against it when I cut out—the last time I saw it down was, perhaps, about half past 10—I am sure it was after 9—somebody had opened it between half past 10 and half past 4, and I missed these things—I found a pair of trowsers in the area—they had been on a brass rail in the front parlour, facing the window, when I went to bed—I never saw the prisoners, to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a writer and grainer, and live in Granby-street, Hampstead-road. On Monday morning, 14th June, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was going towards home—two females accosted me at the corner of Brook-street—I passed them by, and they muttered something—the pri<lb/>soners ran out—M'Carthy pinioned my arms while Coleman put his hands into my waistcoat pocket—I called "Police!" and received a violent blow from Coleman on the right side of my head with some blunt instrument—I cried "Murder!"—it knocked me down; my clothes were completely deluged in blood—I immediately got on my legs, seized M'Carthy, and called "Murder!" and "Police!" as fast as I could, and held him till a policeman came up—I lost a half crown and my hat—I had drank nothing but my supper beer, and knew perfectly well what I was about; I had been at a friend's house, not at a public house—next day I went to the police office to give my evidence, and saw Coleman there—he was disguised (he wore a dark jacket on the Sunday night)—he came up to me, and said, "About that affair of that young M'Car<lb/>thy: he is a young hardworking man, and I hope you will make it up"—I said, "Make it up?" and instantly recognized him and went for an officer—I have not the least doubt that Coleman is the man that struck me.</p>

I came up on this morning, and found Dunn and the prisoner struggling together—Dunn's mouth was bleeding very much, and one of his fingers—I took the prisoner into custody—he got away from me, and got into a muck pond—we got a rope round his body, dragged him out, and took him to the station—he was there about an hour and a half, when a fit came on—the medical man advised me to take him to the workhouse—he was there nine days—I picked up this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the field.</p>

I saw the prisoner when he was brought to the workhouse—in the course of the night he had two epileptic fits—he was not suffering from fits when he came, but he was most posi<lb/>tively insane—in the course of seven or eight days he became rational—he continued in a state of insanity at least seven or eight days—he had had a fit, I believe, in the station-house.</p>

               <p>2, I had been walking about with friends—one of their names is White-house—I merely met him in the street and passed him, that was all—I walked a few steps with him—I turned up Primrose-street to ease myself—I was going towards home before I turned up there—I went between thirty and forty yards up Primrose-street—I did not do what I wanted to do, because the young woman came alongside of me, and did not leave me till the prisoner got hold of me—I walked with the female about thirty yards, and then some one came behind me, hut I did not see it was the prisoner till he let go of me—I never saw the woman after the prisoner caught hold of me—I recovered my breath, and hallooed "Murder!" directly the roan ran away—I was not long recovering ray breath—I cannot say which way the other man went; I kept sight of the prisoner—they both ran towards Bishopsgate-street; the prisoner went to the right—I should not know the other man again, or the woman—I never lost sight of the prisoner—I had had a glass or two of bitter ale, and a small glass of gin-and-water; I had that in Fleet-street, at a public-house—I was in two public-houses; the other was in East-cheap—I had not taken anything at ray friend's—it was Saturday night, and a busy night, and I was out more on business than anything—I wanted a walk—I was not incapable of taking care of myself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-'policeman</hi> 623). On Sunday morning, 20th June, I was on duty in Bishopsgate-street—about 2 o'clock I heard cries of "Murder!" and shortly after I saw the prisoner running, closely pursued by the pro<lb/>secutor—he was not above four or five yards from him—I ran and took the prisoner into custody; the prosecutor came up immediately, I may say as soon as myself—he said, "That is the man that seized me by the neck, and held me while another man attempted to take ray watch"—the prisoner said, "I think you are quite mistaken"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on his person 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and two small keys—the prosecutor was not quite sober, but he had all his faculties about him.</p>

Q.</hi> Would a person coming into Bishopsgate-street out of Primrose-street have found you on the right or left hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the right; I had not been there above two or three minutes, before I heard the cries of "Murder!"—I did not observe any one running out of Primrose-street except the prisoner and prosecutor—there were others running after them in Bishopsgate-street—I could see that the prosecutor had been drinking; I think he said something about not being so drunk as anybody might imagine, that he knew what he was about—some prostitutes came up about a minute or two after I had got the prisoner in custody; I noticed one woman in particular, they told me she was a prostitute, and that she had been fre<lb/>quently convicted of felony—the women did not say there were some men and women running across Bishopsgate-street, and that the prisoner was not the party—they said there were some people running down Shoreditch—they did not say the prisoner was not the party—I paid no attention to what they said—I had got the prisoner in custody then—I had previously seen the prisoner in their company on several occasions—the prisoner turned to the right upon coming out of Primrose-street—the prosecutor was two or three paces after him, close behind him—there were no persons near them.</p>

               <p>Harris went into the back yard, and I followed him, and Lewis went into the yard nearly at the same time—I then went up stairs to the top back room—when I got to the door, I heard something thrown into a tin saucepan—I went into the room, and saw Jones turn from a cupboard—I went to the cupboard and took the lid off a saucepan, and in it I found this pair of scissors—I had heard that a pair had been lost—I asked Jones how she accounted for the possession of these scissors—she said, "Doherty brought them here last Tuesday morning"—I told her she must consider herself in custody for receiving those scissors, knowing them to be stolen—I left her in charge of another officer, and I went down and took Harris into custody in the back yard, where I had left him—I told him he must consider himself in custody for receiving this property, well knowing it to be stolen, and I showed him some tobacco and the scissors—he said, "All that I know is that Doherty brought the tobacco and scissors here on Tuesday morning," and on the road to the station he said, "I will tell you all I know about it;" but he did not tell any more—when I was in the top room I saw a small mark on the table, as if some tobacco had recently been removed from the table—when at the station Harris said that he and the female were going to give up the room that night, and he said they were both in the room when Doherty brought these things and asked them to let him leave them for an hour or two.</p>

On Wednesday, 23rd June, I sent for Willis, and, asked him if he conveyed in his van a quantity of boxes to Pentonville the previous day, and whether any one rode with him—he said he had delivered forty-five packages there, and that a man named Jones asked him, when he was in the South Wharf-road (which is just outside the station gates) to allow him to ride with him, and that he rode with him to Mr. Fletcher's, in Buckingham-street, where he delivered the forty-five packages, and that Jones assisted him to unload, for which he gave him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some beer, that they stopped nowhere on the road between Paddington and Buckingham-street, and after delivering the goods there they proceeded to Covent-garden, to collect the empty hampers and boxes, to bring them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185207050052"/>
               <p>back to the station, that Jones left him in St. John-street, Clerkenwell, and he went on to Covent-garden—St. John-street would not be in the road from Buckingham-street to Covent-garden, the direct road would be by King's-cross and Judd-street—I asked him whether there were not forty-six packages in his van—he said he would swear there were not—on the second examina<lb/>tion, at Guildhall, Willis requested to see me in the cell, and by the permission of the sitting Alderman I went to him, and he told me he was anxious to tell me all about it—I told him he must be careful if he did so, because whatever he told me I should have to repeat again before the Magistrate—he then told me that he took Jones up into his van in South Wharf-road, proceeded to Buckingham-street, delivered the goods there, and then they discovered that they had a forty-sixth box, which he was not aware was there—I asked him whether anybody saw it, and he told me Mr. Fletcher saw it, that they then left and rode together to Aldersgate-street, where they had some conversation about the box, and it was arranged that Jones should take it, as it had been previously directed to the Royal Hotel, Bridge-street, Black friars; and for the sake of allowing him to earn 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he consented that Jones should do so, and believing he would deliver it, he let him take it—on the first occasion Willis had positively denied the box being there at all, he said he knew nothing about the box—Aldersgate-street would not be in the way from Buckingham-street to Covent-garden—I have seen Jones about the station, employed by Younghusband and Son—he had no business to be at the goods' shed—no one could have taken the box out without a pass—it is impossible for Jones to have taken it out.</p>

On Wednesday morning, 30th June, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was near the Black friars-road—I was under the influence of liquor, but knew perfectly what I was about—I was accosted by two females—some little conversation passed, and drink was proposed—I told them that the first house we came to that was open I would treat them, as I was merely taking a walk to refresh myself, and did not intend to go to bed so early in the morn<lb/>ing; I thought it would injure me, as I had to attend to business at 9—we pro<lb/>ceeded over Blackfriars-bridge, and on the east side of Blackfriars-road there were seven or eight men, and, I believe, a woman, together—I made way for them, and Michael Ryan, who was one of the number, made a sudden rush at me with his head into my privates, which staggered me, and hurt me very much—I got into the road, and called out," Policeman!" as loud as I could, and at this time he seized me by my waistcoat pocket, which contained a purse with two sovereigns and a half, and in the act of taking it away he tore the waistcoat pocket down—the women who were with me also called "Police 1"—a policeman instantly came to my assistance, and I gave Michael Ryan into his custody—I have no recollection of John Ryan having done anything to me; one of the other parties struck me a violent blow on the right arm, but it was not him; he was there, but did not do anything—I gave Michael into custody, the others went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a married woman; my husband is a carriage lamp maker—I reside at 8, Cross-lane, Holborn. On Wednesday morning, 30th June, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was with Mrs. Gorman, in Blackfriars-road—we met Mr. Whelan—Mrs. Gorman had been having a few friends, and we did not feel inclined to go to bed, so we took a walk over the bridge—we had had a little drop of drink—we said to Mr. Whelan, "Will you stand anything to drink?"—he said provided we could find a house open he would—I had never seen him before—as we were going along we met six or seven men and a woman, and the prisoner, Michael Ryan, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> his head against Mr. Whelan, and took the purse out of his pocket—I saw that, and some woman rushed upon me and knocked me down in the kennel, and I saw no more—I saw no one but Michael Ryan do anything—Mrs. Gorman hallooed out, "Police!"</p>

                  </hi>. I did live in Westminster Bridge-road. I have been in the employ of the prisoner Simpson as shopman—he introduced King to me about three years ago—I kept the iron shop—King has been in the habit of coming to the shop—he brought nails to sell in brown paper parcels—the first time he brought me some to sell, I took him into Mr. Simpson—I told him I did not buy them myself, I did not know the price—Simpson came back with him to the shop, and told me to buy the I nails, and any other things that he brought, and told me the prices to pay I tor them—the prices varied from 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after that I bought I them of King—I have sometimes bought of him once a day, sometimes twice, or three or four times a day—the parcels he brought were small ones, and varied from 2 to 4 lbs.—there have been 42 lbs. in a day—they were all new nails and done up in packages—I recollect Mr. Green coming to our premises to search—about six weeks previous to 29th March, I had made a communication to Blewitt, and I had made a communication to the police—at the time Mr. Green came, I thought we had about 8 cwt. of these nails left—I remember Mr. Green coming with the police, and some nails being found in two casks—I had those nails from King, they were mixed on the Monday night, 29th March—I went home to tea about 4 o'clock that after<lb/>noon, and I saw the officer Hayes, and Mr. Green, and King standing at the corner of Marsh-gate—Hayes stopped me, and told me he had taken King into custody, and he should take me—he asked me if there were any</p>

               <p>nails in Simpson's shop—I said, "Yes"—(King must have heard this)—after I had turned away from Hayes, Mr. Simpson told me to go and mix the nails—I did it with three others, the boy Harry, the man from the marine store shop, and the servant girl Isabella Ward—on that night some papers were burnt in the marine store shop, I cannot say how many—Mrs. Simpson was there, she came in and blew the candle out—it was not usual to have a fire in that shop—there had not been a fire there for years, the papers that were burnt were brown papers similar to these before me—I am sure I cannot say how many were burnt, it continued about 20 minutes—Mr. Simpson told me after emptying the nails to make a fire in the back place, and burn the papers—the first time the policeman came, Mr. Simpson told me to go and empty the nails out of the papers, and he told me to go Lambeth-square way—he did not say that in such a tone that the police<lb/>man could hear—he turned round to me and said, "Go through Lambeth<lb/>square"—I went round to Mr. Palmer's, a plumber, in Lambeth-square—Mrs. Palmer opened the door, and Mr. Palmer came—I asked him to allow me to go through his place, as we could not get in any other way—we got in, and Mr. Palmer drew up the ladder—I began directly to empty out the nails, Mr. Simpson came in and called the boy Henry and the girl, and sent the man from the other shop to help me—the nails had before been on the shelves, and this was the place where they were found—Simpson came in while they were being emptied, but he did not do anything—I was taken up by Hayes on this charge—I was put in the dock, at Lambeth police-court—King I believe was present, Simpson was not there—I did not tell the policeman on that occasion, that I never bought nails of King—I said, "I know nothing about it"—the policeman said he had taken King, and should take me—I told him he had no occasion to take me, I had given him every information he required—King was present when I spoke to Hayes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you tell me no witness was examined against you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Green was called forward about the nails—these papers might have been produced; I do not know, I cannot say really—I was given into custody because it was said I was the only male person on the premises; one of the officers said that—when I left Mr. Hayes I understood I should be given into custody—he said, "I must take you into custody when I come down"—I said, "If you do, I will give you every information in my power"—I had told him where the nails were previous to that—Blewitt and I had had no conversation about my being given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came Blewitt to be instructing an attorney to appear for yon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He found I was given into custody; it was through Mr. Downey that he interfered for me—I have been to Holland since this matter—I have been dealing in leeches—I have not given nails for them—I did not sell any nails, nor take any nails there—when I was there I stayed at Mr. Sherman's, in Amsterdam, and at the London Hotel, in Rotterdam—Simpson has not been ill for the last two years; he has been on business every day, or nearly every I day—he was not laid up—I should say he has been in business nearly every day, I cannot say every day—he has not been where I have been perhaps every day for two years—I do not believe that a medical man has been attending him for two years—I do not know that he has attended him on and off—the ironmongery shop is separate from the other shop—I was only shop-man there—of course, I had the principal management when I was there by myself—I should think he managed the other business when he was well enough.</p>
