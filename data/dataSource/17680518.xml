That afternoon I saw the prisoner and another lad makes several attempts at the prosecutor's pocket; I followed them a good way down Cheapside; when by the Poultry Compter I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief out of his pocket; the gentleman turned about, the boy dropped the handkerchief and ran away; I stopped him, the gentleman came and laid hold of him.</p>

               <p>I did not pick the gentleman's pocket, I picked the handkerchief up from the ground; I get my living by going about with my mother selling hymns and spiritual songs, and am but eleven years of age.</p>

            . I went along with the prisoner to this pawnbroker, he denied he had ever seen her before; she said she brought four of the spoons; and would take her oath of it, and said also she was in the passage at the time the coffee-pot was pawned; he was very loth to produce four of the spoons, but at last he did lay them down on his counter, but did not deliver them up to me; he mentioned the name of Worsley, who he said pawned them; she told him she came with her, and stood in the passage while she pawned the other things; I have seen the coffee-pot before, and do believe it to be the prosecutrix's property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dixon. Did you hear the prisoner say she brought four of the spoons.</p>

            . On the 15th of April, going to the post office between eight and nine at night, walking arm in arm with Mr. Bovill, I felt something at my pocket; I clapped my hand upon it and turned, and saw the prisoner close by me, there was an accomplice with him; in the prisoner's handing my pocket-book to him, it dropped between them; I did not see it drop, but I found it on the ground; in taking the prisoner to the Compter, in 'Change-alley he made a great deal of resistance.</p>

            . I was walking by the prosecutor; he felt something at his pocket, he turned about and cried, Halloo, who's there? I looked over my shoulder and saw the prisoner and another man, I suppose he was handing the book to him; it fell to the ground and opened, and several papers sell out of it; the other man made a pretence to help gather them up; I laid hold of the prisoner while the prosecutor gathered up the papers and book, the other man made off; the prisoner made a great deal of resistance when in 'Change-alley; the book dropped directly between the prisoner and the other man that made off.</p>

I carried them and left them there, and had half a quartern of brandy, and left it to him to pay when he came for the things; I went home, and was asked if Buck had given me any money; I said, no; I said, I had got some things which he should not have till he gave me my money; this woman and I went there, Buck never came; I asked the landlord to let the things be there; he said it would be more convenient for him that we take them away, so I gave her one bundle and I carried the other; we took them home and kept them several days; he not coming, we opened them and took some of the things out; I believe Mr. Russel can give me no bad character for all the time I lived with him, please to ask him my character.</p>

M. S. or M. R. a white cotton counterpane, a woman's cotton night-gown, printed red and blue, a cotton bed-gown, red and white, a flowered muslin toilet cloth, two bordered damask napkins, with flower baskets in the middle, a dimity waistcoat, a green silk bonnet; all these I advertised May the 6th: the following, which were taken out of the same chest, were not then recollected, a blue and white cheque-apron, a small table-cloth, a damask napkin, a silk handkerchief, and a linen ditto, and some pillowbears; I went up into the servants room, there I discocovered the thief had broke in by the help of some ladder thro' a back window of six squares of glass; it is about twenty-four feet from the ground: when in the garret they had free liberty of the whole house, consisting of five apartments; the chambers, closets, and cupboard doors were all left open, to admit of free air; the rooms I found were all over with tallow, candle droppings, and bits of candles, and pieces of matches scattered about; I found a candle had been stuck upon the bottom of a sash in the hall, it had burnt one of the bottom rails; there were candles, tinder, matches, steel, and flint in the house; whether they used them, or whether they brought candle with them, I cannot tell; I hired a man at Hampstead to be in the house, and then returned to town about seven in the evening; my house was robbed also a second night of a pair of sheets, a bag, and a pair of scissars; I know none of the prisoners.</p>

            . I live in White's-ground near Barnaby-street, Surry. On the 20th of April the prisoner picked me up upon Tower-hill, and asked me to give her a pint of beer, as I was going to Whitechapel to see an acquaintance; I took her to the Ship and Horseshoe in Nightingale-lane, and gave her a pint of beer; then she desired me to go with her to her lodging; I went with her, there she asked me to lie with her; she said I should not, except I give her three shillings; I said I should not; at last I gave her half a crown, out of that she fetched a quartern of gin; she gave the watchman some, we drank it, I had seen no body else; I undressed myself, and we went to bed; I put my breeches under my pillow, and laid my clothes upon the bed; the other prisoner came in, and put her hand over my head, and took my breeches, and put the candle out, and took out my watch and money; I saw her take them; I went to follow her, and Smith held me; after that I went down stairs, and found my breeches and watch upon the stairs; I came up stairs again, and put my clothes on; after that

               <p>Q. What money did you lose?</p>
               <p>Ringrose. I lost twenty-six guineas, four half guineas, a twenty-seven shilling piece, a 5 s. 3 d. piece, and half a crown in silver; my money was in a brown paper; I was intending to put it out to use with my master, we had been talking about it two or three days before; I know I had my money in my pocket when I pulled my breeches off, the gold in one pocket, and silver in the other.</p>

               <p>Ringrose. No, I never saw either of them before.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to let her take your breeches, you say you saw her take them?</p>
               <p>Ringrose. I was startled, and the other held me; I followed her as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this lodging?</p>
               <p>Ringrose. It is in Redcross-street, No 19, near East Smithfield, a private house, up two pair of stairs, a fore room.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go into a place you knew nothing of, with a woman you knew nothing of, with so much money in your pocket?</p>

I said, what was it in; he said, a piece of paper; he called for a light, and Davis brought him in one; he catched hold of her hand, and said, you are the woman, where is my money; I never was out of his presence from the time I came from Tower-hill with him till he charged the constable with me; he cried and said it was his master's money; there was only 2 s. 2 d. halfpenny found upon me, that he said he gave me.</p>

            . On the 28th of March I went about eleven in the night to Mr. Heath's, a fishmonger's at Temple-bar, hearing there was a great disturbance (it was the day of the election at Brentford;) while I was there Mr. Stevenson came; Mr. Manlove, who is partner with Mr. Heath, came and said he was just come from the Mansion-house, and there was a great mob there, and they had done a great deal of mischief; Mr. Stevenson and I proposed to take a walk there, to see if it was so; we went and found the report true; there was a vast number of people, some thousands; I saw several of them throw stones, and break the Mansion-house windows; among them I saw the prisoner at the bar, they were shouting, and crying out, Wilkes for ever! and such like language as that.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get to the Mansion-house?</p>
               <p>Pain. A very little after eleven; the lamps were most of them broke before I got there, and a great many windows, particularly below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of stones?</p>
               <p>Pain. Such stones as they could pick up in the streets, being after the new paving was made; and there were a great number of little stones lying about; I saw stones flying may be the bigness of an egg, bigger or lesser, and pieces of brick-bats; I took particular notice of the prisoner, because I looked upon him to be a pickpocket, he had very much the appearance of one, and I think still I am not mistaken in that, from the behaviour which I saw that night; I thought it was my duty, as well as every Englishman, to endeavour to suppress it; I could not attempt to do any thing in the midst of a mob; I showed Stevenson the prisoner, and said, there is that villain, I suspect him to be a pickpocket, you see he is throwing stones; I believe we watched him near half an hour, he threw all the stones he had with him; then he went from the Mansion-house up a passage by the side of a church at the bottom of the Poultry below the Compter, there was a heap of stones, and such things lay; he loaded himself there, we followed him, and saw him come back again to the Mansion-house; he threw and broke several panes of glass on the west side the Mansion-house; I was determined never to leave him till I had taken him, I had hardly patience to forbear taking him in the midst of the mob; my neighbour Stevenson believing I should seize him, said, for God's sake, do not take him, we shall be murdered; I said, if you are afraid go home, for I will never leave him till I take him: the soldiers came, the mob stopped them; there was one more active than the rest, he threw his bayonee about, and made way; they drawed round in a ring, I and the prisoner were in the midst of them; while the soldiers were in that posture, the prisoner threw several stones, and broke several windows in the Mansion-house; my neighbour, according to my advice, and I suppose agreeable to his own inclination, left me: after the prisoner had throwed all the stones he had, then he came out, and went down the west side the Mansion-house, and picked up more stones, and throwed them up to the two pair of stairs windows, and I believe he broke most of the two pair of stairs windows that were broke on that side; I was going to take hold of him several times, but I considered the consequence of the mob, so I waited till about half an hour after twelve; he met with a young man that he knew, they talked together; I took that young man to be one of the same sort; they agreed to go home, they came from the mob a little way; I determined to take him when they got a little way from the mob: to save my own brains, I concluded to take hold of him as a pickpocket; I said, you villain, how dare you come here to pick pockets; I thought in this the mob would rather be on my side than against me; there were no body very near, nor no body assisted me; his companion made off immediately; I got the prisoner into the Poultry Compter, then he was very ready to be searched; I then said no, I do not take you up as a pickpocket, I take you up for breaking the Mansion-house windows.</p>
               <p>Q. How long from first to last might you have kept your eye upon him?</p>
               <p>Pain. I may say a full hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When the lamps were broke how could you see?</p>
               <p>Pain. They did not break the other peoples lamps, and there were candles in every window in all the houses, some out of fear, and some perhaps out of respect, the mob shouting, Wilkes for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176805180015"/> ever! then a stone went, a number of the mob were throwing and shouting Wilkes: but I believe the prisoner broke more windows after I was there than any ten men, he was remarkable for throwing; when I got him into the inward part of the Compter, we examined his hands, and they were both of them very much soiled, as if handling dirty stones: I should not have mentioned this, had I not heard there are some women would give evidence that his hands were clean.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you put him in the Compter?</p>
               <p>Pain. The watch went half an hour past twelve when I came out of the Compter coming up Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after you came from the Mansion-house?</p>
               <p>Pain. I suppose it was about a quarter of an hour, that must be the most.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dressed?</p>
               <p>Pain. He had his own dark hair, a coloured handkerchief about his neck, and a ragged coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you directly followed him?</p>
               <p>Pain. I did, and took him between the mob and the Poultry Compter; I watched him out of the mob, and just before we got to the Poultry-gate, I went before them to see if there was any body there to assist me; I saw nobody, so I took him myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not stop at the Poultry-gate to watch for his coming?</p>
               <p>Pain. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you had not been there five or six minutes watching for him, and then jumped upon him?</p>
               <p>Pain. No, I had not been there half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the Compter-gate did you seize him?</p>
               <p>Pain. Not ten yards from it I suppose; the mob reached half way up to the gate; they were both walking together a good middling pace, I suppose at the rate of three miles and a half an hour; I was obliged to run to get before them, he was directly fronting the gate when I seized him.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to it?</p>
               <p>Pain. I suppose about twenty feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he abide in one place?</p>
               <p>Pain. He shifted about, he was on both sides the Mansion-house and front and all; I was sometimes on one side him, and sometimes behind him; I told my Lord Mayor's porter at the gate, I had got my eye upon a particular person, I meant the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the man at the Compter the prisoner was a pickpocket?</p>
               <p>Pain. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, look at his hands and see they are muddy?</p>
               <p>Pain. I said they were dirty; his hands were both soiled, as if he had been handling dirty stones.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body look at his hands?</p>
               <p>Pain. Nobody but the turnkey looked at them while I was there.</p>

            . I am a neighbour to Mr. Pain. On the 28th of March I stood at Temple-bar, there was a great mob of people; I said, what will all this come to; said Mr. Pain, will you take a walk with me into the city, they are breaking the Mansion-house windows; we went; when we came there, there was scarcely a whole window; he and I walked round the Mansion-house; he said, look sharp, I know -; I said, I shall not look about it; he followed some person or other, (the lamps were all broke as I saw,) people were throwing stones, I don't know any one person upon earth that threw a stone; I walked round the Mansion-house with Mr. Pain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he single out any one particular person?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. He followed a person.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. He turned round and said, I know a person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the person he mentioned throw a stone?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. I can't remember no person that was there; there were pieces of tiles lying there; said Pain, you'll see if he picks them up; I went off directly, and went over to the left-hand side; there were a great many people walking up and down; said Pain, I shall not go home with you, if you are afraid you may go home, for I will not leave the person; he followed a person that went down on the left-hand side; I went home directly and left him there. He came to me the next morning and said, I have taken him; I said, how can you swear to a person among so many people, I suppose you are going to get 50 l. he said there was no reward offered.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not see the person Mr. Pain alluded to throw a stone?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any stones thrown while Mr. Pain was with you?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176805180016"/>Stevenson. Yes, three or four,</p>
               <p>Q. Were the persons that throwed them near Mr. Pain?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the prisoner was one of the men?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. I cannot tell that, I never saw the prisoner in my life till I saw him here in the court; I took no notice of Mr. Pain after he desired me to look.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing to Mr. Pain?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. I said, if I had been one of my Lord Mayor's servants at that time, I should certainly have fired at the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you was there?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. It was about 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. All the time I was there was not above 15 minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Pain say the man was when he came to you next morning?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. He called him a pickpocket, if I remember; he said he followed him till he came to the Compter-gate, and he pushed him in; I said, how could you take him out of the mob; he said, O, I knew him of old.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you and Pain in such a situation in the mob so as to converse together?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. He walked before and I near him behind; we could converse occasionally.</p>
               <p>Council. You say he did take notice of a man?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he point to him as throwing stones?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is not the man that Pain pointed to as throwing stones?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. I will not say he is not the young man that Pain pointed at.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. Upon my oath I never saw the prisoner in my life before I saw him now in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that man that Pain pointed throw stones?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. Yes, I did; there were three or four throwing stones together.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time apprehend Pain had some nation of a reward?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. No, I had none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you arrive at the Mansion-house?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. About 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner brought into the Compter that night, my husband is a prisoner there for debt, I live there; I did not see him when he was first laid hold of; when Mr. Pain brought him up the court I was about the middle of it; he said the boy was a pickpocket; then he brought him into the lodge, he asked me where the turnkey was; I rang the bell on the master's side; when he came, Mr. Pain said, he has been throwing stones at the Mansion-house windows, look at his hands; I looked at the m, I saw no dirt; Pain said his hands are all over mud and dirt with flinging stones; Mr. Woolard took the candle and looked at his hands; I looked and said, you cannot say his hands are dirty.</p>
               <p>Pain. If Mr. Woolard was here he would say his hands were dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. to A. Waite. What time did Pain bring him in?</p>

            . I saw Mr. Pain stand at the Compter-gate that Monday night; he came up to the gate and opened it, and I believe he might stay there between five and six minutes between the gates, he stood as if he waited for somebody; I remember the prisoner was brought in; I stood looking over the rail close by Mr. Pain; I was there when Mr. Pain came up first; I saw some people walking along the street; Mr. Pain went out and seized the young man by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner running or walking?</p>
               <p>H. Lawrence. He was walking a common pace as if going home, he was not making any noise; he was going from the Mansion-house, the windows were breaking at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>H. Lawrence. I fancy this might be about 11 or after, it may be before eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not past twelve?</p>
               <p>H. Lawrence. I am very sure it was not, because I was going to bed when the clock struck twelve; he seized the young man in the street, and said, I have catched you now, he is a pickpocket; he said to me, shut to the gate, and I did, but I did not follow him up into the Compter.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be there?</p>
               <p>H. Lawrence. My father has the care of the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether Mr. Pain did not address himself to you, and you made some answer to him?</p>
               <p>H. Lawrence. I did not hear him speak a word to any body; he ran up in a great hurry to the gate; and opened the hatch and there he stood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he there a single minute?</p>
               <p>H. Lawrence. I think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to swear he was there two minutes?</p>

In the night of the 11th of March one of the fans was broke, and they had put their hand through and drawn out 23 papers of starch; this window looks out into the court, there is no shutter to it, there are only irons; we could trace the starch from our house to a house in St. Giles's; I went and got a search-warrant from Justice Welch, and went to the house; we wanted to go into a room, nobody would open it; the constable broke it open, there we found 23 papers of starch, with an apron thrown over it; the prisoner Johnson and Marsh were taken before they came to the house, we brought them and the woman of the house to Justice Welch; the men were discharged, and I was brought over to prosecute the woman last sessions for receiving the goods; she said the starch was brought in unknown to her; that bill has not been tried.</p>

               <p>Mr. Slaytre.

The window was safe about a quarter past ten over night, and we found it broken about a quarter past six the next morning.</p>

This day fortnight, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner came to my house (the Carlisle public-house) in Shoreditch, and called for a pint of beer; she asked me where my little boy was, saying, she should be very glad to see him, that he was just like a little boy she had that died, and said she had something to give him; she asked where he went to school, I told her; after she had drank her beer; she went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176805180020"/> to the school-mistress, who can inform the court farther.</p>

The little boy comes to school to me; the prisoner came to my house on the 5th of May, and asked if there was not a little boy came there, whose father lived at the Carlisle, and described his dress; I said, yes; she said, his father has sent me for him; she took him in her arms, and carried him out of the yard, I thought very tenderly; he then had a pair of silver buckles in his shoes, which had been his mother's that is dead.</p>

On the 5th of May I saw the prisoner sitting drinking a pint of beer there; she asked for the child, saying she had a child died much like it; the child was called in; she gave him two or three crabs; the father told the child he must go to school, he went; the prisoner asked him where the child went to school; he told her; she said she wondered he let him go alone.</p>

            . I lodge at the school-mistress's. Between two and three in the afternoon that day, the prisoner came down the yard part of the way, and returned back again; then, she came again and asked for the child; she took and carried him out of the yard, that is all I saw of it.</p>
               <p>Crowthers. The child came home without his silver buckles in his shoes, or sleeve buttons in his shirt; he had them both on when he went out to school; I asked him where they were; he told me the woman that gave him the crabs had taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the child?</p>
               <p>Crowthers. He is five years and a half old; the prisoner has been at my house once or twice, but I never knew where she came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the buckles or buttons again?</p>
               <p>Crowthers. No, I never did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see her take it?</p>
               <p>Innis. She tore all my pocket, and I lost my money by that; it was by her means that I lost it.</p>
               <p>Court. It does not follow from that that she took it; there was another woman with her, did you observe either of the two women stoop to pick the money up?</p>
               <p>Innis. Not that I saw, I had hold of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Innis. I had sixteen guineas and a half, a 36 s. piece, a 5 s. 3 d. and a 4 s. 6 d. I only saved four guineas in my pocket, and one I picked up, and two were brought me.</p>

               <p>Innis. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let the other woman go without searching her?</p>
               <p>Innis. The watchman searched her, but found nothing at all upon her?</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the other woman to the prisoner at the time you lost your money?</p>
               <p>Innis. She was close by her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else near you?</p>
               <p>Innis. No, nobody was when they stopped me first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the ground carefully?</p>
               <p>Innis. The two boys went back to search, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Perhaps all your money would have been found if you had searched there.</p>
               <p>Innis. I was a great deal surprized, and thought they had had the money?</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had reason since to believe they had your money?</p>
               <p>Innis. No, this woman at the bar was the occasion of my losing my money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bland. I was coming from Bishopsgate-street at eleven o'clock that night, I was just entering into Leadenhall-market, that part that is the leather market; a gentleman who lodges with me was with me; there were a few people gathered together, curiosity prompted me to go and see what was the matter; there were two women in custody of the constable; I went with them to the watch-house, the young man showed me his breeches, and said he had been robbed of his money; there was charge given of the woman at the bar, and the other; the prisoner did not give any account of herself, she gave charge for charge; they were searched, but no money found; afterwards there was some money brought in, but I know nothing about that; I was very much surprized to find myself bound over on so strange an affair as this, because I knew I was like a chip in porridge, doing neither good nor harm.</p>
               <p>The constable gave an account of his searching the prisoner and other woman, but found no money upon neither.</p>

               <p>Q. What was his name?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see or hear any mob?</p>
               <p>A. Davis. There was mob about half an hour before that; there were people running about calling out Wilkes for ever.</p>

               <p>A. Davis. There might be a dozen for what I know; they called out for candles to be put in the windows; I heard no other cry but Wilkes for ever.</p>

I was within three or four doors of it when the man was shot; there were stones thrown up at his windows to storm his house, and very bad language going forward; I saw brickbats and something of a light cast thrown up at his windows; the woman was putting up lights out at the time in his house, that was before the cobler was killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cobler fall?</p>
               <p>Overstall. No, I heard him, but I did not go to look at him, I heard him groan.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you think the shot was delivered from?</p>
               <p>Overstall. I do actually think the shot was delivered in the street, I heard the gun go off; the flash of the powder seemed very low, and I saw a man jirk something under his jacket, either a truncheon or somewhat, I could not tell; I suspected it was him that shot?</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the word low?</p>
               <p>Overstall. It seemed to be near the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it could be from a two pair of stairs room in Green's house?</p>
               <p>Overstall. No, I think it could not; I saw that man that jirked something under his jacket the next morning firing at Mr. Green's house many times.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Overstall. I don't know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. How near Mr. Green's house was you, when you saw that firing which shot the cobler?</p>
               <p>Overstall. I was about fifty yards from it; I never heard any other gun fire that night till between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe where that man stood at the time of the flash?</p>
               <p>Overstall. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on the same side the way Green's house is, or the other side?</p>
               <p>Overstall. It was on the same side, about four or five yards from his door-way, just in the alley that comes round the back part of his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the cobler's name?</p>
               <p>Overstall. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been there before that gun was fired?</p>
               <p>Overstall. I believe about six or eight minutes; there were numbers of people in the streets passing and repassing, but who they were I do not know; I did not see it, but I was told there had been rioting before.</p>

            . I am a shipwright. On the 20th of April in the evening I was in this place, it was nearer nine than eight o'clock; when I came almost opposite Mr. Green's house, I met Mr. Overstall; he asked me to go back and drink a pint of beer to Mr. Wallis's; I stopped some time; there came some men, six or eight of them, from New Gravel lane, in a riotous manner, some with sticks; they said to one another, who are are you for; one said for Wilkes, another said for Bute; we parted; I had not gone the distance of ten yards, I heard some stones throwed, one of them fell near me; I looked round, and instantly a gun was fired; I ran round the corner and stood there, then I thought. myself safe; I recollected my friend, I heard somebody squall; then I went back and found a man breathing very hard, leaning towards the houses; I cannot say I saw the flash, nor can I form any judgement from whence the piece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176805180028"/> was fired; my back was towards them when the stones were thrown; the man that was killed was a stranger to me.</p>

            . On the 20th of April I was in my own shop at the time the cobler was shot, that is about twenty paces from opposite Mr. Green's door; I heard the gun go off, I said to my wife, that is exactly at my door, my shop was shut up; I heard somebody shriek out; I looked upon it, it was to throw an aspersion on Mr. Green, that they might have the more reason to fall upon his house, there was a great deal of noise in the street. After the man was shot, I went up and looked out at my chamber window; there was a great deal of mobbing in the street before the gun went off, of shaking their cutlaces together, and striking them against the wall, I could hear them ring, calling out Wilkes and coal-heavers for ever; I saw the man from my window lying, and the blood running about him; this might be about three or four minutes after the gun went off; I could see this by the candles, they were lighted up at the windows; I did not know the man, by report he was a shoemaker or a cobler.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Club. I am wife to the last witness. About eight o'clock that night I was in the highway, I met some young men running along; I had a young woman along with me that was not capable of walking fast; they desired me to go into some house; when I was got about half a quarter of a mile, we saw about eighteen or twenty coal-heavers, some with sticks, some with cutlaces, a little below Shadwell; the person with me being big with child, I told her I could call out Wilkes and liberty too for us both, and bid her not be afraid; some young men in leather aprons, I believe they were shoemakers, they desired me to get into some safe place; I made for home; when we got home, I said to my husband, why do not you shut the door, they are coming; immediately Mr. Green's windows smacked with stones, or something which they throwed; I heard the people say, they would have Green's life that night; I went to light candles, I heard a firing; I said to my husband, that is not at Mr. Green's house; he said, no, my dear, that is at our door, it seemed as if directly at our door; I saw a person pick up stones and break Mr. Green's windows, before our windows were shut in; I saw the shoemaker out at our window lying before he was dead; he was a stranger, I do not know his name; I remember one day about the beginning of that week, the coal-heavers took Mr. Green by the collar, and said they would have him ducked among the rest, this was at his own door.</p>

            . I live in Gravel-lane facing Mr. Green's. On the Saturday before the 20th of April about nine in the forenoon, there was a whole mob of coal-heavers assembled together at Mr. Green's door, the street was full; they said they would have his life; one of them got upon the steps and took him by the collar, and said, you villain, we shall have your life; they continued there in that riotous manner about a quarter of an hour, then went away; they returned again on the Sunday morning, I heard them break his windows; I got up and looked out at my window, this was about one or two o'clock, they were breaking the lower shutters; there were more of them I believe than there was on the Saturday; several of them said they would have Green's life, and throwed stones up at his windows; they said they would have his heart out and broil it; they tried to break the door; they might be there till about four o'clock, when it was day-light; they threatened his life all the time, from the Saturday till the Wednesday. On the Wednesday night between seven and eight at night, there was a large mob of coal-heavers at the top of New Gravel-lane broke several windows, and pulled the frames out at a public-house called the Sheep and Shears, and let all his liquors out, and destroyed the goods in the house; every body were shutting up their shutters as fast as they could; several of the mob went down Wapping-wall with drawn cutlaces in their hands; when they came to the sign of the Queen landing, they ran their cutlaces through the windows; then they came back again to Mr. Green's, he was then shutting up his shutters; he had not time enough to bolt them; he called out, for God's sake, for somebody to hold them while he bolted them with inside; I went and stood upon a post, and held the bolt till he fastened it within; they soon came and throwed stones up to his windows, and called Green, you bougre, why don't you fire, Jack Green, why don't you fire; after they had broke his windows they ran away; presently after I was looking out of my own door, I saw a flash of fire, but where it came from I do not know, it seemed to be half a dozen doors from me; the flash came from a distance from Mr. Green's house; it was then that the cobler was killed; there were a great many people in the streets at that time; after the cobler was wounded, the mob surrounded the house with throwing of stones. Last Saturday night I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176805180029"/> said I would be a witness here for Mr. Green; Mr. Maplan came into my house and swore I should not come; he and his daughter used me ill; he lives next door to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there a mob at that time?</p>
               <p>Axford. There was; they reported several scandalous words against Mr. Green, but who shot Wake I do not know; I will tell the whole from the beginning. There happened to be a disturbance in Ratcliffe-highway on that Wednesday; about eight at night there was a report came to shut our windows up, there was a mob coming; I and all my neighbours round got our windows up; soon after that they came running by, calling out Wilkes and liberty, and coal-heavers for ever; I believe in about two minutes after that, two men came running, d - n you, light up your candles for Wilkes; upon which I went and pulled down one end shutter and a young fellow the other, and light up one candle below stairs in the front, and illuminated my house above; I went to the door and saw every house round me was illuminated; Wake came into my house with a servant maid that lives not five hundred yards from me, they had a glass of gin and bitters; I asked him what they had done with Mr. Wilkes; he said he is cleared till the parliament sits, then he is to be tried by the House of Lords; I said, I am very glad to hear it; the girl that treated him desired him not to go among the mob; he followed her out and went cross the kennel, what he did after that I know not.</p>

             dead; I was within the space of three or four yards of Wake.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a mob there?</p>
               <p>Harrington. From the end of Wapping-wall to New Crane as I could see in the street, to the best of my knowledge there were not above a dozen people.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Harrington. There may be more, for I could not see them; there may be three or four in a place, and two or three in another, there may be more in another.</p>

               <p>Harrington. They were doing nothing at all as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Wake in his hand?</p>
               <p>Harrington. His left hand hung down as low as his hip, and may be lower, his right arm as if it was in his bosom; he had nothing at all in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was he from Green's house when he was killed.</p>
               <p>Harrington. He was about four or five yards, I don't know the distance, I have not measured the place; I will not do any thing to hurt my soul; I take it to be the common distance as between a house and a post.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the foot-way?</p>

               <p>Q. As you are a Roman catholick, will you swear there were no more but a dozen people there at that time?</p>
               <p>Harrington. No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there were less than fifty before Green's door?</p>
               <p>Harrington. I could swear there were but a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there were less than twenty?</p>

               <p>Harrington. They were passing by, or standing; they were such as I saw in the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think these men had not threatened Green that were bef ore his door?</p>

               <p>Harrington. No.</p>

               <p>Harrington. I am upon my oath, I do not know whether they broke them or not, I did not see them break them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think they did?</p>
               <p>Harrington. How can I tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think they did not?</p>
               <p>Harrington. I do not know whether they did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think these people were met together to do not harm?</p>
               <p>Harrington. I do not know that, I do really think what brought people about the house first was, as a murder was done they came as spectators; I saw no mischief done at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, if any damage was done to the house, the mob did it?</p>
               <p>Harrington. I do think so, I did not see it done, so I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be there?</p>
               <p>Harrington. I think, as nigh as I can guess, about five minutes; I got away when I saw the murder committed.</p>

            . When Wake was killed I was on the other side the way; he came up to Green's house (this was nigh ten o'clock;) I was standing close to Green's house; Wake said Green must be a vile man for shooting people going along the street; then he walked towards Green's door; I saw Green stretch himself out and fire, I do not know whether it was a blunderbuss or a musket, the man dropped down dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there at that time?</p>
               <p>Matthews. There were a great crowd, a very great crowd about the place.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they doing?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I did not see them doing any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the windows broke?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I saw none broke at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been there?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I had been there the space of half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Wake doing at the time he was killed?</p>
               <p>Matthews. He was doing nothing, he had his hand in his breast, and the other down.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was he from Green's door?</p>
               <p>Matthews. He was about a yard from the step of the door.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I get my living by ballast-heaving.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not a coal-heaver?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I never heaved a coal in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Wake?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I do not know but that he might follow coal-heaving.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when he was killed?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I was about twelve yards from Green's door on one side, not in the foot-path.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you stand there so long?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I was amusing myself, and when I heard the man was killed I walked off; I thought they were going to kill a great many more.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time between the killing the cobler and killing Wake?</p>
               <p>Matthews. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned you to stand still?</p>
               <p>Matthews. To see what was going on.</p>

               <p>Matthews. I saw no body at that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see the windows had been broke?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I know they had been broke before, I saw no windows breaking at that time, I could not see because the shutters were up.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the shutters broke?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I cannot tell that.</p>

               <p>Matthews. I cannot say whether they were or not; I did not go nigh the place, there was a crowd before I came there, of men, women, and children.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any coal-heavers there?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you upon your oath say there was not a mob of coal-heavers there?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I cannot tell what they were.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there not a noise?</p>
               <p>Matthews. There was not, only asking Green to surrender himself.</p>

            . I am a shipwright by trade, but have worked at coal-heaving some time; I was at the King's Head in King-street, drinking with some friends; I heard a report there was a man and woman killed by Mr. Green, opposite his house; I started up, and said, I shall go and see how it was; the landlady said, I shall not, (there was neither dial or clock, I do not know the time;) she said she would go and see, she returned in about eight minutes, and said there was a man shot by John Green.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the King's Head from Green's house?</p>
               <p>Doyle. It is something better than half a quarter of a mile distant; I sat some time, and heard two muskets go off; I got up, and we all went down the street, and he that could run the quickest got there first; when I got there I saw sixteen or a dozen people, every window was illuminated.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no more do you think?</p>
               <p>Doyle. There was a score at most, to the best of my knowledge; I saw the soldier,

I heard Mr. Green had killed some people; I went to my father's, Mr. Maplan, just facing Mr. Green's, and up to the chamber-window (this might be night ten o'clock;) I saw Wake coming along between a post and Mr. Green's door; Mr. Green put his body and hands out at a window, and waved a musket about, and fired, and killed Wake; I ran down, and said, Mr. Green has killed a soldier; Wake was between a post and his bar-window.</p>

            , nor no body else; but about the time they said a soldier fell, I was then desperately attacked; I had just let the constable in; the mob were crying, bring him down, that we may have him; all the arguments he could use, as long as he was able to stand in the front of my chamber-window, could not do to keep them peaceable; when that soldier fell, it was sometime after Mr. Carr the constable left me, I desired the magistrates might be sent for, in order that I might get relief; Mr. Carr staid as long as he dared; he said he wished he was out of my house with his life; I said to him, I hoped he would stay in my house, and vindicate my conduct; they were threatening my life, and attempting to force into my house best part of the night; Mr. Carr can best give an account when he came in the manner I was attacked, and the danger I was in, when he left my house, it was with the greatest reluctancy that I did fire,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176805180033"/> I was obliged to act in the manner I did, to preserve my life and property; I will call some witnesses, and leave my case to the honourable court.</p>

            . I am a constable; on Wednesday the 20th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, there were about five or six of these men came to my house, and told me there was a man shot by Mr. Green, and desired me to go with them to take him in custody; they went to Justice Hodgson, and related the same story; he told them it was very odd he should be guilty of such a thing; if you have been guilty of rioting, he would have served you right if he had killed you all; the Justice desired me to go; I went with them; they said they would go, and aid, and assist me; I told them I desired no assistance, I desired them all to keep back; just as they got to the corner, they said, there he is; Mr. Green I imagine listed up the sash, and hallooed out Carr; I said I am come to see you, you have no antipathy against me; said I, I am come from Justice Hodgson, to know whether you will surrender yourself; he said, yes, but not to me only, without I had another officer; I was then in the street, going to fetch another officer; he called me back, and said, he would surrender to me; I went and staid a little time at the door; he shoved up the sash, and put out either a blunderbuss or a musket, and said, gentlemen, I desire you all to desist, for the first man that attempts to come into my house besides Mr. Carr, is a dead man; accordingly they did desist, and drawed about a dozen yards each way from the door; then he came down and unchained the door, with the fire-lock in his hand; I got in, and he fastened the door again.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might be there then?</p>
               <p>Carr. I look upon it there were about fifty; when I was in I went up stairs; he took hold of my hand, now Carr, said he, I am happy (clapping his hand upon his breast,) that you are here to see into my conduct; I said, Mr. Green, I heard there has been a man killed by you, or through your means; his answer was, I am sorry for it, God rest his soul; there were a couple of panes of glass broke before I got in; I said, Green, have you any beer, let us have a draught, we were both thirsty; we drank, while we were drinking a pot of beer the riot began again; they desired me to bring him out, it was not in my power to bring him out, neither did I imagine he was safe in coming out with me; I begged of them, saying, gentlemen, for God's sake go away, and put three parts of my body out at the window, and said, go tell Justice Hodgson I am got into the house, and desire him to come here, and to go to the beadle, and bring the rest of the officers; accordingly they went for Justice Hodgson, but before he could come the mob got trying at the door with iron tools, and crawling up the iron at the door to get in at the window, and had their hands up at the penthouse, which is just over the door; I begged of them, for God's sake to des for I saw there would be some mischief; I said, stay a little, and I will give you all satisfaction to your own desire; Mr. Green happened at the same time to come and look over my shoulder; I saw some of their hands, he took a piece and fired it, and I suppose the soldier was killed by that firing; he put the piece quite perpendicular; I was affrighted myself, and would have given a million of money to have been out of the house, I thought my own life would have gone, there were brickbats and stones came in after the firing.</p>
               <p>Q. What words did you hear at any time?</p>
               <p>Carr. What words I heard were towards me, calling me thief, blackguard, and the like; when I looked out of the window I saw something in red clothes lie upon the left hand side the window; I heard a noise of instruments trying at the window, and I begged of them several times to desist; I only whipped out my head, and in again; Justice Hodgson came as fast as he could, he could not get within a dozen doors, for then there was a continual fire when they attempted him; he kept firing; I remember a large stone and a brickbat thrown at Green before the soldier was killed; the whole house was in great consternation.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in the house?</p>
               <p>Carr. I imagine I was in the house about three quarters of an hour; the mob continued in this manner; Mr. Green put a musket into my hand, and said, now Carr defend yourself and me; said I, do you mean to kill me; no, said he; I then crept down stairs, and opened the back door, and went out among them.</p>
               <p>Q. What would have been the consequence, do you believe, if Mr. Green had not defended himself thus?</p>
               <p>Carr. They swore, d - n them, if they would not have both him and me, and if they had me and him they would sacrifice us both.</p>
               <p>Q. What would have been the consequence, if the door had been broke open, and the people come in?</p>
               <p>Carr. I imagine, if that had been the case, I should not have been here now.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, I lodge in a room in Mr. Green's house; about eight o'clock the doors and windows were shut up; I was in my neighbour's room when the bell was going eight; I heard a noise, I went down stairs and asked Mr. Green if there was any disturbance; I was told there was, (the mob had been there on the Sunday morning before, they had broke the window shutters, and they were mended again,) the mob were striving at the windows and doors so break in, this was on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done on the Wednesday after?</p>
               <p>Dunderdale. I cannot tell the time of the day exactly; there were some stones more or less came into the room; Mr . Green went to the window and said, I would advise my neighbours to get away, for I am determined to defend my house, I was then in the fore room; he called the maid, and said, let me have some candies, don't let me have my windows broke on the account of Mr. Wilkes or any one else? there were three of them lighting candles, Mr. Green was in the middle of the room; several stones came in while the candles were lighting up; there was some glass came against the girl's face: I heard the report of a piece, from whence it came I cannot tell, I was in the fore room, Mr. Green was about three or four paces from me along side me; I got out at a window on the top of the house and got away, and was out of the house at the time Wake was killed; the house was surrounded, and on the account of the concourse of people I could get out no other way; I heard a great noise from the people both before and behind; I heard them calling to the next neighbours to shut their windows and take in their lights; I went to the next door and staid about half an hour; then I went into the street among the people, I imagine I might be at New Crane corner when Wake was killed; I heard several pieces go off while I was there; a sailor climbed up to force the frame of the window, to get in, to get at Mr. Green, where the glass was broke; while I was in the house there were several pieces went off from the opposite window.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Green's house when the riot began on the 20th of April; I had been out, and came home about five o'clock; I found the street door had been broke, and a piece of board had been nailed over it; I was told it had been done by the mob on the Sunday; I went up stairs, then we heard a noise below; I found several people were assembled about the house, I did not look out, but judged of the number by the noise they made; Mr. Green desired I would assist in putting up lights; he called out and said, my dear neighbours, I desire you will keep away, for I determine to defend my house all that is in my power; while I was putting up lights, I saw several stones thrown to the windows; I saw a flash of a pan which did not go off, from somebody in the street, it was intended against the dining-room window, then it was Mr. Green called out to the neighbours; I am sure I saw it, I believe it was the flash of a pistol; we stuck up several lights, but the clay was so hard which made it difficult to put them up; after that another piece was fired, but I could not tell from whence, whether from within or without, that I imagine was when the cobler was killed; after that I went up into a two pair of stairs room, there were stones throwing up all round the house; I went out of one room into another to avoid them; there was a great noise at the shutter and door of the house, they intending to get into the house; this might continue about three hours while I was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there when Mr. Carr came in?</p>
               <p>M. Pugh. I was, he came in the time the riot was; I heard the mob say they would be the death of all in the house, not one should be saved alive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after Mr. Green fired out of the window?</p>
               <p>M. Pugh. That was before he fired, that seemed to be the voices of divers people; I apprehended myself to be in danger, and I dare say every one in the house; did I began to be so frightened, I cannot give a particular account; after this firing of Mr. Green, the mob got to be more outrageous; I heard firing almost the whole night, I made my escape out at the top of the house, and got into an empty house at pretty near twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to Maplan. Was there firing from your house?</p>
               <p>Maplan. I saw no fire-arms in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any?</p>
               <p>Maplan. I heard firing all the night over.</p>
               <p>Q. to Axford. How near do you live to Mr. Green?</p>
               <p>Axford. I live about fifty yards from his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there fire-arms in your house?</p>
               <p>Axford. There were fire-arms brought into my house on the Thursday morning, but I do not know who brought them in; there was a man came to me as I was standing, and clapped a pistol to me, and swore he would blow my brains out if I would not let him go up into my garret to fire upon Mr. Green's leads.</p>

               <p>Axford. I believe they were brought in between five and six in the morning; there was not one fired in my house, there was one fired at my door.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were brought in?</p>
               <p>Axford. There were two muskets brought in, I took notice of no more.</p>

               <p>Axford. There was not one.</p>
               <p>Dunderdale. At seven in the morning on Thursday when I came in, I saw several pieces fired from the opposite side into Mr. Green's house, they were firing out of Maplan's house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Maplan. What do you say to this?</p>
               <p>Maplan. I never saw no firing out of my house; I heard firing, but did not know from where it was.</p>

            , I live in Green-street, Grosvenor-square; on Sunday morning, the 17th of April, the prisoner brought half an ounce of green tea and half an ounce of bohea, and three pennyworth of crumpets, and breakfasted with my wife and I; after that I went out to carry my Lady, the Countess of Thanet, to whom I am chairman; I did not come home till about six in the evening; I asked my wife where Joe was; she said Molly (meaning the prisoner) has just carried him out to buy him a cheesecake; she thought I should be angry if she told me how long she had been gone with him; I went out again to fetch her from where she had dined; I was angry with my wife for letting the prisoner take him out: I came home again I believe about ten at night, the child was not come home; I and my wife, and another, went about to see after the prisoner and child, but could hear nothing of them; we went to St. George's workhouse, the prisoner then belonged to it; she was not come in; the next morning I went there again about seven, she was not there; I went to several alehouses, the landlord at the White Horse in South Audley-street said there was a woman there with a child, but could not say it was the prisoner; about nine the next morning I heard a child was drowned in Hyde-park, whose child I did not know; I went there, and found it was my child; it was lying by the side of the water of the Serpentine-river in the Park, between the two bridges in the road to Kensington; there were no marks of violence upon it, and it had all its clothes on as when it went out; then I sent word to the coroner, we took it away at almost five that afternoon; I found the prisoner in St. James's workhouse the Tuesday se'nnight following; I went to her, and said, you are a fine woman, what have you done to me; she said, I do not know, my life must pay for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for finding fault with your wife for letting the prisoner take the child out?</p>
               <p>Smith. Because she is apt to get in liquor, that was the only reason.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with be prisoner?</p>
               <p>Smith. Almost three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she used to come often to your house?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes, often on Sundays, and sometimes on a week day; my wife once helped her to a place, and from that time they got acquainted.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she use to behave when she came to you?</p>
               <p>Smith. Always extremely well and civil to me and my wife; she was apt to get in liquor sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you look upon her as to her mind?</p>
               <p>Smith. I always took her to be in her senses, as I am at this time; she would rattle and chatter when in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your wife or you ever any quarrel with her?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, never, except once, she said she would come and nurse my wife, and I would not let her; whether my wife told her of that I do not know, she never expressed any resentment to me; she has dined and supped with us, and always used to be fond of this child, but the child was not fond of her; she sometimes would bring it a cake.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He used to call me Mad Moll.</p>
               <p>Smith. That was when she got in liquor, but I never observed any marks of madness; she is a woman I thought I could have trusted my life in her hands.</p>

            . I am clerk to Justice Spinnage; on Tuesday the 26th of April, about nine at night, the prosecutor applied for a warrant to take up the prisoner, whom he said he had found in St. James's workhouse; she was brought about a quarter of an hour before ten; she acknowledged being at Mr. Smith's house to breakfast, and agreeing to dine together upon bacon and greens; that she took the child in her arms, in order to go and and buy it a cheesecake; that she called with it at two public-house, and in the evening went with it into Hyde-park, and carried it to the water, rather after dusk; that she watched an opportunity of doing it, when no person should be passing, and then she throwed it in, and left it; she was asked if her heart did not relent, and she go back to give it assistance; she said, no; she was asked how she could do so inhuman an act, or whether she had any resentment or anger against the parents; she said, no, she had not, she loved the father and mother as if they were her brother and sister; it was said to her, sure she could have no resentment against an infant of that age; she said she had none, but the child would struggle against her, and would never come to her arms; she was asked what could induce her to do such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176805180037"/> an act; she said she was wearied of life, she had had a great many disquietudes with her husband, that he was gone to sea, or was dead, and he had taken a couple of children from her, and put them into the Foundling-hospital, which had given her a great deal of anxiety; she concluded with saying, she was desirous of dying, and that led her to do that sort of an act, for which she said she knew she should receive no mercy of the jury, or something of that sort: an observation was then made by the Justice, then if you was determined to die, why did you not drown yourself; she made this remarkable answer, I know the difference betwixt that and self-murder; hearing her say she was desirous of dying, the Justice asked her if she was apt to be afflicted with frenzies, or was ever disordered in her mind; she said, no, she was not; he asked her, whether the moon had any effect upon her at the change; she said, no; she said she often thought of her husband, and as often as she thought of her disquietudes with him it awakened her grief: it being late that night, she was committed for a re-examination the next day; then she did mention something of having been disordered in her mind, she said she had been beside herself sometime.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her to be out of her mind on these two examinations?</p>
               <p>Concanning. No, I did not, there did not appear the least mark of infanity; she was asked where and at what time she had premeditated, to do this act, whether at the time of taking the child out from home, or some time after; she said she had no immediate thought of doing it at the time she took it out from the mother's house, but at the time of going in at a public-house she saw an old acquaintance of her husband's, and that brought to her mind former uneasinesses, and then it was she formed a resolution of going and drowning the child, by the means of which she knew she should die; she then said she went to one alehouse, then to another, and then into the Park in the evening, and watched an opportunity that no person was coming, and then throwed it in. I think she said it was about the middle of the day, that she had been out to buy some bacon, and the child brought it home, and she watched an opportunity of taking it away while the mother was selling some sallad: something was then mentioned of her having done an act like this before; she said that was really an accident, that other child sprang out of her arms.</p>

               <p>Phebe Green.

I heard them plundering the room, and open my book to look for bank notes; they staid about half an hour, I could distinguish there were four in the room, besides several in the passage; they seemed to change their voices, and speak in an odd manner; I got up after they were gone, and went up into a two pair of stairs room, where the evidence
