BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give him any verbal directions when you gave him that account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; to take the account, and receive the monies as soon as he could—he should account to me for such monies the same day he received it—the amount entered in this book is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I see by the ledger (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) that he accounted to me for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 28th of October—that left a balance of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the account I gave him to collect was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but after that Mr. Allen had more goods—he had the same authority to receive that—it seems Allen produced his old account, and the prisoner has given him credit for cash received on that 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the first instance, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the second instance—2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the balance left from the first account—but there was a little arrear, or something of the kind, that would reduce it to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the account I gave him to receive in Michaelmas last was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he has never accounted to me for any other money re<lb/>ceived of Mr. Allen than the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have mentioned—a balance of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is left in this account—there is no entry at all in the collecting-book of money received for Mr. Allen—the balance of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. has never been paid over to me—my partner is here—I was the only partner in town at the time those instructions were given to him—there was no other partner attending to the business in London at that time—I also gave the prisoner directions to collect some money from Mr. Harrison, of Hackney—I think that account was delivered to the prisoner at Michaelmas—here is 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. entered in the book, in the prisoner's own hand-writing—I did not see it entered—it is entered as due—he has never accounted to me for any part of that turn—there is no entry of the receipt of any portion of it in this book—I gave him an account of that in the same way as Mr. Allen's—this is the account I delivered to him—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is in my own hand-writing—this part has been written since—it is all in the prisoner's hand-writing—I have since gone through a collecting-book with the pri<lb/>soner—not this book, but one that corresponds with it, which I have—this one he had in his own possession—I cannot state the precise day upon which I gave him this account to collect—it was at Michaelmas, it is a Michaelmas account—we settled in March this year—I asked him several times when these accounts would be paid—in January, I asked him par<lb/>ticularly, and several times subsequently; the last time was in March, or the beginning of April—I asked him when these accounts would be paid, meaning Allen's and Harrison's—he stated that he had applied for them several times, and would see the parties again respecting them—he said so in March—he did not state what answer he got, and I did not press the matter, as we have many accounts which stand over, a long time before they get paid.</p>

               <p>have said to Mr. Tucker, in Mr. England's presence, that the prisoner had received sums amounting to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I dare say I did—I have often said that, and may hare said it to Mr. Tucker—I cannot swear either way, I cannot charge my memory—I said that Jenkins had been overpaid by me 15.<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that I had lent him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that a bill had been delivered to me amounting to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for work done at Jenkins's house—I did not say that the law expenses would be 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making in the whole 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I had no doubt we were losers in the transaction, to the amount of 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not recollect saying that the law expenses amounted to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not say unless I received 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would go on—the prisoner has no demand against me whatever, that I swear—I never said, in the presence of Mr. Eng<lb/>land, that unless I had 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a full discharge of any amount the pri<lb/>soner had against me, I would not consent to an arrangement—that I swear—in order to convince Mr. England, who was a customer of ours, and who was rather obstinate in the affair, that it could not be compromised, I took him to an attorney—I do not know that I went more than once to Mr. Tucker's with Mr. England—it was on Easter Monday I went—I saw Mr. England again some time in May—I read to him this letter, which I had received from my partner, Mr. Young.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you had any communication with Mr. Young on the propriety of employing the prisoner to collect these accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, previous to entering into the agreement, but not since—I had no commu<lb/>nication with Mr. Young that I should employ the prisoner to collect these since entering into the agreement prohibiting him to receive money with out a written order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

On the 23rd of June, between seven and eight o'clock, in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for a gold watch-key, which was in the window—he came round the counter, and pointed it out—he moved the velvet, then made another move, and said he had made up his mind to have a metal key—he paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for one, and went out—I had noticed his making a move when he pointed to a gold key, near the end of the window, and then I saw his hand half in and half out of his pocket—he was looking at the window where a silver watch hung—it was the only silver one there—some hours after he had left I missed it—I had seen it safe half-an-hour before he came in—nobody but my father had been in the shop, from the time the prisoner left till I missed it—last Monday week I saw him in the street—(I had seen him frequently before this)—I went up to him—he ran away—I called "Stop thief," and he said he would kill me if I did not hold my noise—my father afterwards joined me in pursuit of him, and he was se<lb/>cured—he said he did not know our shop, and denied having been there—I am certain it was him—I did not notice the watch while he was in the shop—he looked towards where I had hung it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live with my aunt, in Adam-street, Manchester-square; the prisoner lodged in the attic, and had done so for three weeks. At five minutes before twelve o'clock on Wed<lb/>nesday the 24th of June, I went down into the kitchen, and left on the table in the parlour my bonnet, shawl, gloves, and my purse, which con<lb/>tained four sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, two half-crowns, and four shil<lb/>lings—I went up stairs in about ten minutes, and missed my purse and its contents—I do not know whether the prisoner was in the house at that time—I went up to the first-floor, to Miss Sowerby, and made inquiry of her and the other lodgers—about half-past five o'clock the prisoner came home—I was in the parlour—I asked him to come and speak to me—he said, "Very well," but he still kept going up stairs—I followed him—he got into his room two or three minutes before me—the door was ajar, and I went in—he had his hat on, and a stick in his hand—his other hand was in his portmanteau, and I heard the jinking of money—I asked him what time he went out in the morning—he hesitated some time, and then said, "When the bell rang"—I understood by that the chapel bell, which com<lb/>mences at eleven o'clock—he asked whether any thing had happened—I said, "Nothing particular"—I made no charge then—Miss Sowerby fol<lb/>lowed me to his room—I then left his room, and told Miss Sowerby not to let him go till I got a policeman—he might have heard me say that—I went out, and when I returned I found him at the street door, Miss Sowerby had hold of him by the collar, and he was struggling—he got away, and ran as fast as he could down Adam-street, into Manchester-square, and as far as Duke-street—I followed as fast as I could, and saw two young men stop him—I said there was a purse missing, and he having gone out, there was great suspicion attached to him, and I wished him to return—one of the young men asked why he ran away—he said, because he was fright<lb/>ened—he was brought back and given into custody—(he paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a</p>

               <p>was a girl, and was a fine, healthy baby—it was afterwards called Mary—the mother went out about nine days after it was born.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From that time until she left Clement's-lane what was her treatment of this child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She used to go out about six or seven o'clock in the morning, and not return till eleven or twelve at night, or sometimes one or two o'clock in the morning, and she was generally in a state of intoxication when she came home—while she was out the child was left in care of a little girl of her own, about eight or nine years old—she had five children—she supported them by her own hand labour, except 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, which she was allowed by her husband—she worked as a tailoress, and earned 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, I believe—the baby was left without food while she was out—the other children were in the habit of being out a great deal, and the neighbours used to give them food, in a great measure; and when they were out the baby was left by itself—I have told the prisoner how it was neglected, and the other neighbours likewise have told her—she has frequently wished the child was dead, and I have heard her say she would give any person a pint of gin if they would <hi rend="italic">burke</hi> it—she has said that when she was sober—she is a very violent woman—it was not said in temper, because we were com<lb/>plaining of her neglecting it—I have repeatedly suckled the child myself, fed it, and clothed it, because it was to neglected—it was left for days to<lb/>gether in a state of nakedness, and in a filthy, dirty state—I saw the child after it was sent to the workhouse, and I have suckled it in the workhouse, by the request of the guardians—it was in a very weak, low state—it rallied a little, but very trifling—the only difference I saw was in the work of the eye—it appeared more bright, and to take more notice, from the care taken of it—it appeared a little more lively and cheerful for several days—it died on the 28th of June—it had arrow-root and mutton-broth while in the work-house, and three times a day it had the breast.</p>

I knew the deceased child—I have seen it at the door with one of the little girls, about four years old—it seemed very much in want, and was crying most awfully—I have taken it out of the girl's arms, and suckled it—I saw the prisoner one evening coming down the court, a lot of neighbours got found her, and told her she ought to be ashamed of herself for neglecting her baby—she said, she did not want me or any of the neighbours to take care of her baby, for she had left plenty of food for them at home—I went into the prisoner's room next morning, no one was there but the baby lying on the bed—I saw no food there—I suckled</p>

I am a surgeon and one of the medical officers of the Strand Union—I saw the child on the 10th of June, in the work-house—it was in an extremely emaciated state, and in a state of perfect exhaustion—I attended it till it died, which was on Sunday morning the 28th—my opinion is that it was in that state from want of food—it rallied slightly, under the treatment, and afterwards sank—I gave very strict directions that it should not be overfed, and I have very great confidence in the person that administered the food—it would have been dangerous to overfeed it—it was fed cautiously with a little milk and arrow-root in small quantities—I did not see every spoonful administered, but I have no doubt my instructions were attended to—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examin<lb/>ation—I found the internal structure of the child perfectly healthy—I should refer its death to want of proper nourishment and care, previous to the time I saw it—I opened the head, there was no appearance of dis<lb/>ease there—the child was a little convulsed on the Friday and Saturday previous to its death, not before—in cases of death from exhaustion they frequently have slight convulsions—children are very subject to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at the Compter. The prisoner was given into my charge for assaulting Mr. Lloyd the banker—I observed hit man<lb/>ner while in prison, in September, 1839, and from his general demeanor, I should say he was not competent to take care of himself—he was with me for a month for the assault, and was then discharged on his own recog<lb/>nizance—he did not know who it was he had assaulted—he asked me the question, "What have I done? tell me what I have done"—he was called up on two or three occasions to try to explain the matter, but he could not tell who he had assaulted, nor where he had committed the assault—he asked me four times at least, who he had assaulted—I did not consider him accountable—he was called up into the office 'about a week after he was in custody, and saw his father—I believe he said, "What do you want here? I can go out if I like, and I shall walk out with you; I have done nothing, and if you pay any money for me, I will never pay you again; I don't want any money, I have done nothing; who have I as<lb/>saulted?—where was I brought from?"—about two days afterwards, the father came again, and he was called into the office to see him—he said, "Well, have you done what you said? what am I to do now; shall I go out, can't I go out? let me go out"—I said, "Certainly not, you cannot go out, you must stop here"—he conducted himself in such a way, that our people did not consider him safe to be left by himself—some one was kept with him—it would not be safe to let him out at present—I should not be surprised at his turning to violence to-morrow.</p>

On the morning of the 19th of June I was alarmed, about I quarter before three o'clock—on getting up I saw the prisoner Warren in the centre of my outer-room—(my house consists of two rooms)—before I could get to open the parlour door he sprung upon a table, and got through an air-hole—I had been there about half-past eleven o'clock—the air-hole was then secure, and fastened by a catch, and I then found it open—there was nothing displaced in the room but a clothes bag, which the night before I had left suspended from a cupboard-door, was placed in the centre of the room—when Warren sprung out I gave an alarm—I am sure Warren is the man I saw.</p>

I said I knew nothing of it, he might search me. The prosecutor said at the office that he was offered a watch or a sovereign if he would not come against me.

                  </hi>. I am a builder, I reside in London at the present time, and had done so one week before the 10th of June last. About six o'clock n the evening of the 10th of June I was standing by the column under the portico of the north wing of Buckingham Palace—I had gone there about half an hour before—I was standing waiting for the approach of the Queen—I saw her Majesty come out of the wooden gate of the north wing, (I believe it is called the garden-gate,) in a low open carriage, accompanied by Prince Albert—the carriage turned to the left, up Constitution-hill—there was a postilion and four horses—the top of the carriage about leached even with my forehead—I am not acquainted with the name of it—it was a low open one with four wheels—I was on the left-hand side of the carriage—there were no military in attendance on the carriage—there were four out-riders, two a little in advance, and the others a distance be<lb/>hind—there were no other attendants on the carriage, that I am aware of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a spectacle-maker—my place of business is in Copthall-court—my residence is in London-wall. I was in the Park on the evening of the 10th of June—my attention was attracted by the cortege of the Queen and the carriage her Majesty was in—I saw her Majesty sitting in the carriage on the left-side—Prince Albert was on the right—I was running by the side of the carriage on the left side, the wall side, the side on which the Queen sat. and heard the report of fire-arms—I was then about three yards from the carriage I should think.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in advance of it, or behind, or what? <hi rend="italic">A,</hi> At the side, exactly at the side of the carriage—the noise attracted my attention in that direction, and I saw the smoke ascend—the carriage passed on a short</p>

               <p>distance, and then I saw the prisoner with a pistol in his right hand—his right arm dropped—he turned round as if to see if any body was at his elbow, and to me it appeared that he pointed the second pistol across his right hand—he fired it towards the carriage.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About what distance do you judge the prisoner to have stood from the carriage at the time you saw the smoke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three yards—the carriage was quite open, and was going at a slow pace—that three yards would be shortened I think about three quarters of a yard by stretching out his arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the muzzle of the pistol would be within little more than two yards of the carriage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say so—he appeared to take a deli<lb/>berate aim—when I saw him fire he was about a yard from the railing which encloses the Green Park—the nearest gate by which any one could enter the' Green Park was about one hundred and fifty yards from where this happened—the railing is quite open.</p>

               <p>the pathway up against the railing—I had hold of him before he said, "It is I"—he appeared desirous that it should be known he was the person who did it—we had got a short distance from where this occurred, when I told my nephew to be cautious, for probably he had friends.</p>

About six o'clock I was sent on an errand to the south wing—I saw the Queen's carriage going up Constituation-hill—I was in front of the steps at the south wing—shortly after I saw the Queen's carriage I heard a shot fired—I immediately ran towards where the sound proceeded from—it appeared to me to proceed from Constitution-hill—as I went towards the spot I met a gentleman on horseback, who spoke to me—my attention was attracted by a mob of peo<lb/>ple, who had hold of a person—before that a second shot had been fired—it was after I heard the second shot that the gentleman on horseback spoke to me—I was going towards the carriage when I heard the second shot—I ob of people having hold of the prisoner—the two Lowes had hold of him, and several others besides—on my coming up, several voices (I do not know whether it was the Lowes) said, "This is the man, and I laid hold of him—nothing more was said by the persons present—the prisoner said, "You have no occasion to use violence, I am the person, I will go quietly "—I had merely laid hold of his collar and his left arm when he said that—I proceeded with him to the station-house—shortly afterwards some person remarked, "Perhaps there might be more of them"—the prisoner replied, "I have friends "—Smith, a policeman, came up, we went in front of the Wellington-barracks, and as we got opposite the barracks some person said, "I wonder whether there was any balls in the pistols, or no"—the prisoner made answer, "If the ball had come in contact with your head, if it was between the carriage, you would have known it"—I took him to the station-house, and he was searched by me and another constable—the other constable took from him, in my presence, a key, a knife, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I have the key—I found a piece of wadding in his trowsers' pocket—I looked at it, and saw the mark of the hammer on one side and the cap on the other—I asked him what it was for—he said, "To prevent the pistol going off," as he did not wish to hurt him<lb/>self—it would prevent the pistol going off, by putting it between the hammer and the cap—it had been so used—he also said, if I was to go up to the Park, where it occurred, I should find the other piece of wadding—while I was in the inspector's room different gentlemen came into the room—a question was put, (I cannot say whether it was to the prisoner,) whether there were any balls in the pistols—the prisoner said there were balls in the pistols—next day I made search in the garden, on the other side of the wall, but was not able to find any thing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had various persons been asking the prisoner questions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not asking the prisoner questions, but asking one another, as they came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say, that questions were not put to the prisoner himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not by the parties while I was there—I did not hear any one put questions to him except the inspector—he asked him questions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184007060060"/>
               <p>—he asked his name and where he came from—I believe he asked him something about the pistols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it the practice of the police, to whom you belong, to interrogate prisoners as to the fact of any crime with which they are charged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not—the inspector merely asked him where he came from—he was not interrogated by the inspector, in my presence, as to whether there were balls in the pistols—he asked where he got the pistols from—the question about the balls was not put to the prisoner, but the gentlemen asked whether the pistols were loaded with ball—the prisoner was not asked the question, he was in custody at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he stated there were balls in the pistols; what were his words? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As near as I can recollect, his words were, "The pistols were loaded."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The pistols were loaded,", were those his words? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not exactly—he distinctly said there were balls in the pistols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He said they were loaded, were those his words? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "The pistols were loaded with balls," those were the words, as near as I can judge—I will not swear to the exact words—I cannot tell the exact height of the wall of the garden—I should say it was eighteen or twenty feet high—I searched in the garden—I made a very minute search—not all over it—within about 100 yards in length, and about twenty-five in breadth—what I should suppose to be the range of the pistol-ball—I did not find any—I searched on the other side of the wall for a short time—about two hours after the firing—the police-sergeant and three or four men were there when I searched—I assisted in the search for a short time—I stopped there for about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What mode of searching was used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We kept moving over it with our hands, and then swept it with a broom—that search extended about twenty-five yards in length, and five or six yards in width—there was no ball found in the dust while I was there—I did not see all the dust sifted—it was taken down to the Palace, and sifted there—I saw it brought down to be sifted—I did not make any further search—there are several trees about there—I was not examined before the Privy Council, and have not stated any thing before the Privy Council as to balls in the pistols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you told any body before the examination by the Privy Coun<lb/>cil, that you had heard the prisoner state the pistols were loaded with ball? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I told Mr. Maule, the solicitor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many people were there in the room at the time he said there were balls in the pistols? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From ten to twelve persons—he said it out loud—he was in my custody at the time, in one corner of the room—I should think he said it loud enough for other people to hear as well as me—the people were talking as to whether there were balls, one said, "I wonder whether there was one," and he said, "There was."</p>

I know a public-house in Oxford-street, called the Hog in the Pound—it is at the corner of South Molton-street—I know the prisoner—he was barman to Mr. Robinson, the proprietor of that public-house, when I first knew him—it might be about February when I first knew him as barman there—on Easter Sunday I went with him and one Roach to Hyde-park, about four o'clock in the afternoon, from four to half-past five—at Hyde-park-corner I said to the prisoner, "I suppose the people are looking for the Queen"—he replied, "They will be disappointed, as she is at Windsor"—we got back to the Hog in the Pound about half-past five o'clock—Roach and Curling were in company with us—I believe the prisoner quitted the Hog in the Pound about the let of May—I have fre<lb/>quented that house for the last two years, up to the present time—one evening, after he had left the service, he was in the parlour there, and he said he had lost a half-sovereign on a bet respecting the shot at the bull's eye, at the Shooting-gallery in Leicester-square—he showed me a flattened ball—I beard a person named Roach remark that he was more fit to shoot at a hay-stack than at a target.</p>

I was on Constitution-hill on Wednesday afternoon, the 10th of June, on horseback—when the first pistol was fired the prisoner was close to me, as near as he is now, or very little further—after the report of the first shot my horse plunged up into the air, being a very high-spirited animal—I saw the prisoner put his hand into his breast, draw out a second pistol, and take a most deliberate aim, in the direction of the Queen's phaeton, which was about fifteen or twenty yards from where I was—as soon as I got any power over my horse I tried to prevent his firing the second shot—when he did fire it I was as near to him as I am now—he stood with his back to the railing, with a smile—some persons came over the Park, and down Constitution-hill, and seized him—he did not offer the slightest resistance—I immediately afterwards looked at the wall—I was the first per<lb/>son that went to the wall—I noticed a mark which I supposed to be the mark of the bullet—it was a white mark on the dark wall, as large as the palm of my hand—at that time Colonel Fox came up—I pointed it out to him, and to Lord Belfast also—the mark was about five feet from the ground, and rather in a slanting direction from where the prisoner stood.</p>

Soon after he was introduced, we were alarmed by a violent knocking at the door. In an instant our faces were covered, we cocked our pistols, and with drawn swords stood waiting to receive the enemy.

I am the widow of the prisoner's grandfather, he has been dead eleven years, he died in Greenwich Hospital—I had been married to him thirty-five yews—he was a seafaring man, and went abroad occasionally—I generally saw him when he came to England—he was generally in a very unsettled state of mind when he came to see me—he was addicted to drink—he was not so much unsettled when he had not been taking liquor as when he had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember any thing particular that happened, to show the state of mind in which he was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was soon after I was mar<lb/>ried—the very day that Edward's father was twelve months old, he came to me and made a very great disturbance—he broke the furniture and the clocks, and tore down the table-cloth—it weight be owing to liquor—he was taken up and put in Petworth-gaol—they took him on horseback to gaol—I think three men took him—nothing was done to him before he was taken—I once saw a strait-waistcoat put on him, in 1821—I really cannot recollect the waterman's name who put it on—a waterman came in and put it on—that was at Deptford—I sent for the person to put it on—I was in danger—the waterman was not an officer—the beadle of the parish came as well as the waterman, and one or two more men—I cannot say how long they were putting the waistcoat on him, for I was not pre<lb/>sent when it was done—I saw him afterwards, when it was done—I was at my own home—my husband was up stain—I did not go into the room while they were putting the waistcoat on, I did not like to see it done—no one was in the room with him before the men came—I took them up stairs—he had been very restless during the night, and told me he should get up and go to Birmingham, and I watched him—he told me to go to Woolwich—my daughter was in the house—I sent her, and he had the waistcoat put on him, and after it was put on he was very bad indeed, and so continued for several days—it was necessary to have two men with him—he was fastened down to his bed at that time—he was not fastened to his bed more than a day, but the strait-waistcoat was kept on between a week and a fortnight—a medical man was called in—I think it was Mr. Atkins, a surgeon, living at Deptford—I do not know whether he is living or dead now—the straight-waistcoat was kept on several days after the medical man had seen him—at the end of the time I have men<lb/>tioned, he got better, and went to sea again, after some time—as well as I can remember, about a couple of months elapsed between the attack and his going to sea—I never knew him in the Royal Naval Asylum—I knew him in the college—he was a pensioner, he was under the care of Sir Richard Dobson, for a complaint in his head, after he was admitted at Greenwich—I firmly believe the attack in his head affected his mind—I saw him in the hospital at the latter part of his life—his bodily health was very good, until within the last fortnight—his intellect appeared very steady the latter part of his time, the last fortnight—for the last few years of his life, I was a great deal away at Brighton—I was not with him till within the last twelve months.</p>

SOLICITOR GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you known your husband before you were married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than two months—I was living in a family at East Bookham, when he went to sea before I saw him at Petworth—I cannot exactly say how long he had been absent when he came to my father's—he had made a voyage to the East Indies, and came back—I went to my father's when he was liberated the jaol—I was living with my father when he came to me at Petworth—I had left him in London when he last went to sea, before he behaved so badly—he was not displeased at my going to my father's—he wished to give them a treat, which did not suit them, and then he turned into a great rage, and got in liquor—he was not tipsy—he was about two days at my father's house when this happened.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the treat they would not have, which made him so angry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had high notions, and he thought they ought to have paid him that homage—he thought they did not behave well to him—when be broke the things, they sent him to Bridewell—he went to sea again—it might be a few days after that, or it might be a month or two—after be came out of the Bridewell, he came to London—I went to London with him till he went away—he was about four years in Greenwich Hospital, to the best of my recollection—for the last twelve months, he was steady, and kept from liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am daughter of the last witness. My husband is a farrier, and lives in Harrison-street, Gray's Inn-lane—I remember the time of the strait waistcoat being put on my father at Deptford—I was then about twelve years old—some men were sent for, and I believe four came—it was very near four o'clock in the morning—I believe it was is the summer time—the men shut the door when they went into my father's m—he was confined to his bed about a fortnight on that occasion—he afterwards recovered, and went to sea—I and my mother then went to Brighton—I next saw my father at Greenwich College—I saw him there very often.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What appeared to you to be the state of his mind when you saw him at Greenwich Hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not altogether insane, more of an eccen<lb/>tric character at that time—he told me he was the Pope of Rome—that was when he was keeping guard at one of the college gates—he would tell me he was St. Paul, and that the Pope of Rome had made his escape—that was when he was guard at the gate—he said these things as if he seriously meant them—he was quite sober when he said them—by the term eccentric I meant strange—he was treated very kindly at the hospital, particularly by his lieutenant—I had a brother named Peter, who I believe was younger than myself—he had a complaint in his head which caused his head to be light—I believe he was put into the Naval Asylum for that—I saw him there once—his head was quite well then—I do not exactly know how long he was there.</p>

I formerly kept the Black Prince public-house at Kennington—I retired from business many years ago—I did not see Edward Oxford, the grandfather, often—I recollect his coming to me one day at Kennington—that was the tint time I saw him—he behaved in a very singular way, but I did not know him before, and did not now his manners—he acted in a very inconsistent way—I supposed he was not quite clear in his head—it is thirty years ago—I cannot exactly recollect in what way he acted, but I know he behaved in a very singular way—it was on a Sunday afternoon when he went from me—his wife was with him—he behaved very indecently in the street, and the watchman was obliged to take him to the watch-house—the last time I saw him he sat down at the table, pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket, and tied it tight round his head—I asked him if his head ached—he said, no, he was St. Paul, and he was going to be my leader—he said he would be my leader because he was his wife's leader, and he then sat down again—he then got up, went to the other side of the room, and talked to himself a considerable time—there was no one in the house but myself, and I felt very much alarmed at his conduct—he said he was going to tell his cap<lb/>tain (the gentleman he sailed with, I forget his name) that he was to be his leader also—he went home, and next morning he was obliged to have a straight-waistcoat on, and be tied down to the bed—I wished to get rid of him, and he went—I knew his son, the prisoner's father, when he was a little boy at school, but I never saw him since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's mother. I was twenty years of age when I married his father—he was also twenty—I was acquainted with him about six months before I married him—I was at that time living at Birmingham, with my father, who kept the Hope and Anchor tavern—he was an artizan—he became acquainted with me by frequent<lb/>ing the tavern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before your marriage, did any thing take place in your presence which you thought singular in his conduct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was singular alto<lb/>gether, not like any other man I was acquainted with—I did not marry him with the consent of my friends—I refused to marry him a great many times—on those occasions he would pull a razor out of his side pocket, and bare his throat, and say he would cut his throat in my presence if I refused him—I have at other times seen him with pistols and poison—he would show me the paper with oxalic acid—at the time the Princess Charlotte was lying dead, he followed me out of the house with a double barrelled pistol loaded with slugs, and said if I re<lb/>fused to have him he would blow his brains out before my face, and I promised him then—I never said I would have him before then—upon that threat I for the first time said I would marry him—we were married on the 28th of April in the following year, 1818—I had made the promise in November—a variety of circumstances took place between the time of my giving the promise and the time we were married—he would come to my father's, and when my father would not serve him with liquor, he would send out for it to other houses, and he would offer to pay other people's scores—he was then, I should say, the worse for liquor—I remember the day before we were married, a person had written to his master to inquire his character, and it was not satisfactory—it arrived that day—I then told him I would not be married to him—on my telling him that, he went into a violent rage, pulled out a roll of Bank-notes and the license, and burnt the notes—I then said I would be married—the notes were entirely consumed—on another occasion he took some Bank-notes, twisted them round his finger, lighted them, threw them on the ground, and watched them burn out—they were Bank-notes of his own—his conduct did not improve after marriage—he would promise if I would marry him he would keep it a secret, as I was married without the consent of my parents, but he quarrelled with my mother, and then disclosed the circumstance of my being married to him—it was before we were married that he burnt the Bank-notes—twice before we were married he burnt Bank-notes—the bundle he burnt the day before our marriage was in consequence of my refusing to have him—the others he burnt after I promised to have him—he wished me to have the money to purchase furniture, and said, "Will you have it?"—I would not, and he then burnt the notes—there was a very large roll of notes—I do not know precisely the number—he was earning on an average I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember at any time his making an attempt upon his own life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—frequently, before our marriage—one night he was picked up by the watchman outside the door, and there were a great number of people there—I, knowing what he had threatened, was very much alarmed—he was found by the watchman in the street with a razor in his hand—I was in my mother's house—he was brought in, and I saw him—the watchman had the razor, and gave it to my mother—he was crying at that time, and teemed very desponding—we had seven children—the prisoner was the third child—the first child is living—at the time I was pregnant of the second child, my husband's conduct was dreadful, brutal—he neglected me to that I fainted three or four times a day for want of food—he once broke a jug, and threw a piece at me—it would have cut my face, but I held up my arm and it cut my arm—I have the wound now—he annoyed me dreadfully by grimaces while I was pregnant of my second child, and by jumping about like a baboon, and imitating their grimaces—that continued during the whole period of my pregnancy of the second child—that child was barely born alive—it was a confirmed idiot, and its countenance was precisely as the father looked when he made those grimaces—it put its tongue out like he did—it lived about between two years and four months, not quite two years and a half—during all that time it had not the least appearance of reason—it never spoke or walked—it was very voracious—it showed no indication of sense or reason at all—I continued to suckle that child after the birth of the prisoner—it took to the breast two or three days after this boy was born—its cry was not human—it was a sort of moan—it was not like a child cries—I suckled that child and the prisoner together—my husband's conduct was much the same during my pregnancy of the prisoner, grimaces and so on—I was in tears one day when a lady called, she said, "What is the matter, Mrs. Oxford?"—I said, "He is commencing the same faces he always has done," and she told him it was very wrong of him—he once struck a file into my breast, and the milk flew out from the wound—there was a stream of milk on the floor—that was before the birth of the prisoner, it was whilst I was suckling my first child, and on observing the milk come from the wound, he showed the same indifference that he always did—I had not had any quarrel with him—he was always tormenting me—he delighted in annoying and teasing me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you do any thing to provoke him to these extraordinary acts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was considered too patient, and too attentive to him—I was blamed by my parents and many persons—he kept a horse at one time, and I have seen him bring the horse into the house, he led it in by the bridle, and he seemed, like a child with a toy, amused at his own folly—he brought it into the sitting-room, and led it about—I have frequently applied to him for money for the support of the family, which he has re<lb/>fused, and abused me, and he once knocked me down, and fractured my head—I had done nothing more than ask him for money to support the family—I knew he had received many pounds that night—he put 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the table—I said I could not do without money—he was perfectly sober—it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—I believe it was before the birth of the prisoner that I received the blow which fractured</p>

               <p>my head—I cannot say whether it was at the time I was pregnant—he cut my head with a quart pot, while I was pregnant with the prisoner—he threw it at me, and it cut my straw bonnet through, and cut my head—I did not know my head was cut till I felt the blood coming down—I do not remember, how far advanced in pregnancy I was then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your mind ever at all affected by any violence done to you by your husband? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When asleep I screamed, and I was obliged to be awoke up in my dreams—that was when my head was fractured—I was carried in by several persons, and when they dressed my head, I attempted to walk, but could not, my head turned round with giddiness—that was the day it was done—I was dangerously ill—I was obliged to have my head shaved and poulticed—Mr. Partridge the surgeon can tell when that was better than I—I believe he is here—I remember one day walking with my husband—he left me, saying, he had a box to go off by to-mor<lb/>row, and he must go and finish it—he left me at my mother's, on telling me that—after that I went home with the servant and child, and found the house locked up—it was not opened to me—I went back to my mother's—it was afterwards opened, and part of the goods were removed, the house in confusion, and my husband gone—he was taken by the authorities of the town next morning, in the act of leaving Birmingham, for London—I had not had any quarrel with him at that time—not a word or sentence of anger—when I saw him afterwards he did not give me any explanation of his conduct, but he came into my father's house and asked me some ques<lb/>tions, which I answered him—the persons sitting by wondered how I could speak to him—he went away again immediately—he continued in Birmingham for some weeks, and then went to Dublin, where he stopped four months, leaving me and my children with my mother—at the end of the four months he returned, and sent for me to a lodging-house; I of course put out my hand, expecting he would be glad to see me, but he pushed me from him—he said nothing particular, only be seemed annoyed at my looking better than when he left me—he said so—I have heard him rea<lb/>soned with by his friends as to his conduct, and he said, if any one per<lb/>suaded him to do any thing, be would act directly opposite—he did not appear to be capable of seeing the folly and wickedness of which he was guilty—he would laugh in the most triumphant manner; and he had I should say, an almost supernatural look with him when he had done wrong, and when I was distressed—the day I was put to bed with the first child he kicked me violently because 1 did not agree to something which he proposed to me to do—I have known him take poison twice, I believe—once he took laudanum, and he was very ill for several days afterwards—he was at my sister's house the same day that he took it in the after<lb/>noon, and she spilt half of it—he kept his bed several days in conesquence—Dr. Birt Davis was called in in consequence—my husband died on the 10th of June, 1829—I have seen my husband's father several times—I saw him on the occasion of my husband's death, and the night before he was buried, he said he was determined to lie by the side of his dear boy and he was then in a putrid state, in his coffin—I had been obliged to burn vinegar for the last two or three days—his father did not appear to be in a sound state of mind—he reproached me for having my husband opened without getting any thing in return, which was very unnatural, I think, in a father—his conduct was very eccentric on other occasions when I saw him—he had a great many peculiarities.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe any thing remarkable about him from his infancy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he would burst out crying when there was no one near him, and no one speaking to him, and he was always very troublesome—it was different to the mere waywardness of childhood—if he sat still or stood still, he would burst out crying—that was after he had learned to walk as well as before—all children cry, but this was when he was three or four years old, and he has continued to do so through life, to cry without any apparent cause—I have known that to be the case up to the time of my going to Birmingham, or just before that—that was in the present year—he had a great many other very singular habits—he would get into a violent rage without any cause; he would deliberately break any thing, and willfully destroy any thing that he took in his hand—he once pointed a pistol at me, that was the first day he brought them home—I should have told you that my husband, during my pregnancy with the prisoner, pointed a gun at my head—the prisoner was particularly fond of fire-arms and gun<lb/>powder—I have frequently taken it from him when he was young—he would sometimes play about with other children, and at other, times he would amuse himself with letting off cannons, and he was once very much burnt with gunpowder all over the face—he was very much hurt, that is eight years ago this summer—he was at play in the yard with a little boy, and the cannon exploded, and he was very much burnt—his eye<lb/>brows and eye-lashes were burnt off, hit hair was very much singed, and his face was a complete mass—I sat up two nights to wash it with a lotion—it was very much hurt—he behaved very fractious indeed, and screamed terribly, so that the doctor was angry with him, and gave him a sleeping medicine—when I first saw him, after he had burnt himself with the gunpowder, he was crying dreadfully—I was absent at the time, and when I returned I found him washing his face with water.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has he any habit of laughing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have frequently beat him for it when he was much younger—that habit has continued up to the present time—he would laugh hysterically after these gloomy fits and fits of violent passion—it is an involuntary laugh—I told Mrs. Robinson so the day he left—he was in the habit of alarming me dreadfully, by making strange noises, firing off cannons, and flourishing a great stick before his sister's face, and before the looking-glass—complaints were made to me by the customers of his laughing, and if I asked him to do any thing when I was in business, be would make such a disturbance, that it used to dis<lb/>tress my feelings dreadfully, and annoy the customers—I was at that times keeping a pastry-cook's shop in the Westminster-road, but he has annoyed them since then at a coffee-house which I afterwards took—when the gen<lb/>tlemen have been reading the newspaper, he has made such a dreadful disturbance that it was very annoying and very distressing to my feelings—the customers complained of it—I shut him in the cellar, on one occa<lb/>sion, when I kept the pastry-cook's shop—the customers came to com<lb/>plain of him—I lost a great many of them in consequence—I lost my business entirely—at times he was very affectionate, and at other times the contrary—he would break out unawares, and if he wanted any thing, and it was not reached him in a moment, lately, he would strew the room with litters, and throw every thing down that came in his way—he was sometimes very gloomy—he would sit. for a long time with his hand to</p>

               <p>his head, and not speak, and he would be impatient if I spoke to him, especially if he was reading, and we spoke to him, he would get in a violent rage—I went into a situation at Mr. Prescott's, the bankers, as con<lb/>fidential housekeeper, and was there a year and a half—I saw the prisoner occasionally during that time—I placed him with a person named Sandon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As a medical man, you are perfectly aware that a large dose of laudanum, may be taken without producing death, if a party is sti<lb/>mulated, and kept in motion by counteraction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The majority of such cases would recover, when properly treated, when treated in the usual way—he was drowsy—I am sure of that—I was not able to form any no<lb/>tion whatever of his state of mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far were those two apart from one another? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They might be two yards and a half or three yards apart.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. HODGKIN</hi>. I have been a physician about fourteen years—I have been lecturer on morbid anatomy, and have written some works: lec<lb/>tures on pathological anatomy, and lectures on the promotion of health.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon all the circumstances of hereditary insanity in the family, supposing a crime is committed without a motive, that the party commit<lb/>ting the crime is subject in consequence of that crime (if brought home to him) to lose his life, and that on the commission of that crime, instead of at<lb/>tempting to escape from justice, he delivers himself up to the law and seems reckless of the consequences, are you as a medical man prepared to say whe<lb/>ther those circumstances taken together in the commission of the crime, in<lb/>dicate a sane or unsound state of mind in the criminal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By them<lb/>selves I should consider they were circumstances of strong suspicion, but other facts should be sought before one could be warranted in giving a positive opinion—those would be facts leading to a strong suspicion that the party was insane—if it should also appear that there was a previous delusion, that would certainly strengthen the case—supposing there was inherent insanity in the family, my opinion, grounded on cases which have occurred, would be strengthened that the individual was insane—striking cases are on record.</p>

Lesion</hi> of the will, it has been called by Le Mare, insanity connected with the development of the will—I should not con<lb/>sider a headstrong person to be under such an influence—I mention <hi rend="italic">lesion</hi> of the will, as a term under which a highly reputed writer on insanity has chosen to designate a form of insanity, in which sometimes flagitious acts, sometimes only eccentric acts, are committed—it means more than a loss of control over the conduct—it means morbid propensity—moral irregu<lb/>larity is the result of that disease—I suppose in some instances there are</p>

               <p>other indications of the disease—I do not know that there are not—I should think it most likely there would be, if the individual was suffici<lb/>ently watched—that is a fair conjecture; but the case not coming under my own observation, it is impossible I can give an answer—I have had cases under my observation, in which I suppose this form of insanity existed, one case in particular, that person was in perfect health—I do not think I ever met with a case where the only apparent symptom was moral irre<lb/>gularity, where I had no medical indication of physical disease—I think that, committing a crime without any apparent motive, is an indication of insanity—doing any thing of any sort, without any motive, is not an in<lb/>dication of unsoundness of mind in every instance.</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not make a difference when a man has to suffer the penalty of death for the act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—the species of insanity which Dr. Le Mark calls <hi rend="italic">lesion</hi> of the will is a well-recognised species of insanity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you conceive that this is realty a medical question at all which has been put to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—I think medical men have more means of forming an opinion on that subject than other persons—I am supported in that opinion by writers on the subject, by Lours, and by Le Mark, who I have alluded to, who is a particularly eminent writer—my reason for thinking so is, because it is so stated by those writers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why could not any person form an opinion whether a person was sane or insane from the circumstances which have been referred to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because it seems to require a careful comparison of particular cases, more likely to be looked to by medical men, who are especially experienced in cases of unsoundness of mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you see him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The day before yesterday, for the first time—I saw him on that occasion, and I have been in Court the whole of yesterday and this morn<lb/>ing—I never saw him in private more than once—that interview lasted perhaps half an hour—a person who is unsound need not, in all cases, be under the care of some person—it depends on the character of the insanity—there may be individuals who may be at large, and associate with others, and still be of unsound mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you consider there is any danger in the unsoundness you have discovered in the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly I do—Dr. Chowne, Mr. Clark, and a gentleman who I am informed is Mr. Maule, the solicitor of the Treasury, were with me when I examined him—he did not exhibit any violence—he replied willingly to the questions I put to him, but his answers were very unsatisfactory—he seemed to have a very indistinct impression of the circumstances—he knew he was to be tried—when I spoke to him of his trial, wishing to see what impression it made upon him, on two occasions he said, "What trial, when?" and subsequently</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184007060094"/>
               <p>he seemed to know the trial was about to take place the next day, and what it was—I asked him if he was not conscious that he had committed a great offence in shooting at such a young and interesting person as the Queen—he said, "Oh, I might as well shoot at her as any body else"—I did not take notes of the conversation—it was so short an interview, and so few questions were put, it seemed to me unnecessary—I went there with the view of being a witness on the trial if required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me any answer that was unsatisfactory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Without recol<lb/>lecting the whole conversation, I cannot pretend to do so—I am unable to recollect—when I asked him if he was not attached to his mother and re<lb/>latives, and whether he did not think it would very much distress them that he should be brought to trial, and condemned, his reply was, "Yes," he was attached to them—when I asked whether he thought it would affect them or distress them, he said he did not know—when I said he might possibly be condemned, he said he did not know—he answered indifferently—I do not remember any other question, the answer to which was unsa<lb/>tisfactory, not so distinctly as to take on myself to repeat it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long before had you notice that you were going to see Ox<lb/>ford with a view to ascertain his state of mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the evening be<lb/>fore—I made some notes when I got home of my observation of him, of the general result of the impressions of my mind, not of the questions I put or the answers I received—I did not ask him to do me a sum in arith<lb/>metic.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BDKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are these the notes you refer to? (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>) <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they were not made on the same day—I examined the prisoner's head—it appeared to me that the formation of the anterior part of the head would indicate an imperfect development of a certain portion of the brain—I frequently find that form of head in insane persons—there are many persons of that form of head who are not insane—my notes were written as soon afterwards as I could possibly write them—they are very brief—they were not made with any intention of being read.—(<hi rend="italic">Reads</hi>.)—"A deficient understanding; shape of the anterior part of the head, that which is generally seen when there has been some disease of the brain in the early period of life—an occasional appearance of acute<lb/>ness, but a total inability to reason—a singular insensibility as regards the affections—an apparent incapacity to comprehend moral obligations, to distinguish right from wrong—an absolute insensibility to the heinousness of his offence, and to the peril of his situation—a total indifference to the issue of the trial; acquittal will give him no particular pleasure, and he seems unable to comprehend the alternative of his condemnation and ex<lb/>ecution; his offence, like that of other imbeciles who set fire to buildings, &amp;c, without motive, except a vague pleasure in mischief—appears unable to conceive any thing of future responsibility."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of course in that conversation you had with him you were watching his manner as well as what he said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—my judgment is formed in part by his manner, as well as by what he said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you try to ascertain whether he was acting a part with you or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I tried to ascertain it as well as I possibly could—my judg<lb/>ment is formed upon all the circumstances together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. CHOWNE</hi>. I am a physician of Charing-cross-hospital. I have been a physician twelve or thirteen years—I am lecturer in that hospital on medical jurisprudence.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you heard of a person committing a crime without the ordinary in<lb/>ducements to crime, either revenge or interest, and that crime exposes him to loss of life, and he seems reckless of consequences, and delivers himself into the hands of justice, and appears wholly exempt from any thing like consciousness of responsibility for the act, what opinion should you form of that state of mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should consider it an exceedingly strong indication of his being in an unsound state of mind—a propensity to commit acts without an apparent or adequate motive under such circumstances is recognized as a particular species of insanity, called in medical jurispru<lb/>dence, <hi rend="italic">lesion</hi> of the will—I do not know a better term—it is an old term—it has been called moral insanity; may I be allowed to give you an ex<lb/>ample? It is by no means an uncommon thing for me to have patients who complain to me that they are impelled with a strong disposition to commit suicide, of the madness of which act there can be no doubt, and yet there is no one symptom about those people indicating mental disease; there may be a slight degree of general indisposition, but no symptoms at all of any mental irregularity: these patients will say, "I have nothing to complain of, I have no unhappy news, I have no disappointment, I have no unsatisfied wish; my husband (if the case be so) is kind to me, I have nothing at all to impel me to the act but a strong impulse"—I have been asked to prescribe for such cases, not in one sex only, but both in men and women.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, in that sort of mental disease, is it quite consistent with the person performing the functions of life and the duties of life with accuracy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is no doubt of it; they can perform the duties of life with accu<lb/>racy; I do not say with the same facility—I saw the prisoner in Newgate the day before yesterday, by permission of the Secretary of State, in com<lb/>pany with Dr. Conolly, Mr. Clark, and Mr. Maule—I had some conversa<lb/>tion with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, from the conversation you had with him, and the opportunity you had of observing him, what is your opinion as to the state of his mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should consider his state of mind is essentially unsound; there seems a mixture of insanity with imbecility—I regard the incapacity of controlling laughing and crying, as proofs of imbecility, not as positive proofs in themselves, but as assisting to form my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This propensity to suicide in the patients you speak of, were they persons performing all the duties of social life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were persons proceeding with their duties of life, and in all their ordinary avocations—despondency of mind is very often connected with disorders of the stomach, but it very often happens that the physical cause has not been obvious, and has not developed itself at all; it is not at all necessary that the physical cause should be obvious—in such cases, I prescribed for disease in the stomach; I found those re<lb/>medies did operate on the mind—laughing and crying without control is connected with hysteria, and also with imbecility—generally, when con<lb/>nected with hysteria, it is associated with the sensations, there must be fainting and <hi rend="italic">globus hystericus,</hi> which arises in the throat—the ques<lb/>tions put to the prisoner were not numerous; some were put by one gentleman, and some by another; I endeavoured to impress upon him that he was labouring under error when he considered it was in<lb/>capable of being proved there were balls in the pistols; I assured him, in a manner I thought most likely to make him believe, there really were;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184007060096"/>
               <p>that the fact of there being balls in the pistols would be proved against him; that his responsibility was a terrible one, and in all likelihood it would end in capital punishment, and if he knew whether that was deca<lb/>pitation—he said he had been decapitated in fact a week before, for he had a cast taken of his head—I endeavoured to make him understand it would be proved that there were balls in the pistols—I knew he had the impres<lb/>sion that it could not be proved, from questions asked by myself—I cannot tell what he had said to induce me to form that opinion, but something was said to that effect by him—I concluded, from something he said, that he entertained that opinion—he insisted that there were no balls there—the fact did not occur to me before—I do not remember his words, but the remark was to the effect that it was impossible—the question as to whether he was not concerned about his mother he treated with indiffer<lb/>ence, and seemed to be totally destitute of feeling, apprehension, or thought on the subject—during the whole time I was struck with a very peculiar manner—he was not an instant (though I believe it is partly habit) that he was not playing with a pencil and a piece of Indian-rubber, with which I found him drawing—when we went into the room he was quietly drawing, with a pencil on a piece of paper, something like a landscape—during the whole conversation he was leaning with his head on one hand, with the other flapping about with a piece of Indian-rubber, sometimes clapping one pencil against another; in fact, a manner entirely without acute feeling or acute consciousness; and in order to ascertain how fax what I would call dullness of manner, that peculiar manner, might indicate idiotcy even, I desired him to get up and walk; and if I had supposed that he was acting when he was clapping the Indian-rubber about, that idea would en<lb/>tirely have been done away with by the manner in which he walked across the room, which he did with a great deal of lightness, liveliness, briskness, and smartness, not at all as if endeavouring to put on a peculiar manner—it occurred to me that it was perfectly natural, not as if he was acting or making the least pretence—the interview lasted, perhaps, about three quar<lb/>ters of an hour—I did not make any note of the conversation, neither at the time or after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it not have been wise to note the time of going and coming away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps it would, but I did not use that precaution—Mr. Maule was present during part of the examination, not during the whole—he came in during the latter part—I was in Court all yesterday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you form any opinion at all from the prisoner's manner during the trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I considered that manner was a continuation of the same kind of manner, but under some restraint here—I have no observation to make as to the form of the head—I also subjected the prisoner to what is called the arithmetical test—I infer nothing from it—I merely mention it because it did occur—he was pretty ready in casting up, but not ready in subtraction—I am not quite certain whether at the moment he was giving his attention to it; indeed I consider it is a fallacious test.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a practising surgeon, and have been so between three and four years. I am surgeon to the Dorcas Charity, and Honorary Secretary to the Westminster Medical Society—I have had some experience in the treatment of insane persons, such as usually falls to the lot of the general practitioner, perhaps a little more, for having been so short a time in practice—I have been in the habit of attending the family of the prisoner—I have known him nearly two years</p>

               <p>—I accompanied Dr. Conolly and Dr. Chowne, in their visit to him, the day before yesterday—I have formed an opinion as to the state of his mind; not from that alone, but from other circumstances which I had had personal opportunity of seeing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the opinion you have formed as to the state of his mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That it is decidedly that of imbecility—I consider it more imbecility than any thing—I do not like giving definitions—in my judgment he is decidedly of unsound mind—during the time I have been attending his mother and sister occasionally I have had opportunities of seeing the prisoner, and his mother has frequently mentioned to me that she thought there was something exceedingly peculiar about him, and asked what I thought—the chief thing that struck me was the laughing, which has been so much dwelt upon, the involuntary kind of laughing—with what perhaps we might call a kind of general hysterical tendency in him—he did not seem to me to have that sufficient control over the emotions which we generally find in sane individuals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you notice, at any time, any other symptom that is usually con<lb/>nected with hysteria? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My interviews with him were not prolonged, and my attention was attracted to him chiefly by the desire of his mother, who said she was afraid he was getting in the way that his father was—I did not know his father—I put one or two questions to him, when I saw him in Newgate—I heard questions put by the other medical men as well, and the answers which he gave—I watched his manner during the interview.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it appear to you to correspond with his manner on former occa<lb/>sions on which you had seen him, or to differ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Much the tame cha<lb/>racter—great insensibility to all the impressions which were attempted to be made upon him—on one occasion some time ago my attention was more particularly directed to him, from a circumstance which this occur<lb/>rence has brought very strongly to my recollection; I think it is about five months since I was on a visit at his mother's house; I called in my rounds to see her; she was very poorly at the time; if I recollect right, he was sitting at the fire reading a book; he took no notice of me when I entered, and seemed to be absorbed in what he was reading; his mother made some observation to him; such as, "How rude you are;" "Why not take notice of Mr. Clarke?" "Why sit there and behave in this kind of way?" He did not seem to notice the observation of his mother at all; he seemed still to be absorbed in the book; she put the question to him again, and there was still the same apparent reverie; and when she touched him, to put him in mind that some one was there, he jumped up in a fury; such as at the moment alarmed me, and swore that he would "stick her," I think was the expression he made use of; but certainly it was such an expression that at the moment I drew back, thinking he meditated some violence. After this transaction bad occurred, the mother called on me in great trouble, and made a communication to me, upon which I wished to see the prisoner, accompanying that with some opinion of my own, which I had formed. I did not see the prisoner until the day before yesterday, when the permission of the Secretary of State was obtained—I had made application at the Home Office on the Monday.</p>

SIR FREDERICKK POLLOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you have attended the family for some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I live in Princes-street, Leicester-square—that is perhaps a mile and a half from where Mrs. Oxford and the prisoner lived, but they did not live there during the whole time I attended them—Mrs. Oxford has lived in Commercial-road within the last month—I never prescribed for the prisoner—I did not recommend any course of treatment—I considered that the disease was mental, one of those weak minds which, under little excitement, might become overthrown—I did not alarm the mother, for she is an exceedingly nervous woman—I recommended no course of conduct, diet, or treatment whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In short, I am to understand that you never gave any advice on the subject, of any kind whatever to his mother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Simply in conversation, I gave my opinion rather as to his state than any advice, nothing further—I never gave any advice, I was never asked my advice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you meet the medical gentlemen when they went to New-gate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We came together from Dr. Chowne's, I think, but I forget at this moment—we assembled somewhere, and went together—I communicated with the medical gentlemen before they saw the prisoner, and stated what my notion was about him, to assist them in their investigation—I was pre<lb/>sent when he was brought into this Court last Sessions, and heard some affidavits read to postpone the trial—I was not asked to make any affidavit at that time—I was subpoenaed here, and was actually in Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was you asked to prescribe for him by his mother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, my visits were to her and to the sister—I am not aware of any medical treatment likely to be useful in cases of hereditary insanity—I was told he lived a regular life, no intemperance, no late hours—perhaps twelve o'clock—his bodily health appeared good.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to John Knowles and Co.—there are other persons in the firm—they are silk brokers. I went on the 4th of July to clear some bales of silk at the warehouse, No. 3, London Docks—there were fourteen bales put in a van, and the remainder in a cart—the van was to take the silk home to 26, Throgmorton-street—while I was loading the other cart with the remainder, the van that had the fourteen bales drew away—the prisoner drove it—I had ordered the van, and he came down with it—he is servant to Mary Vesters, who is a town carrier—when I had nearly loaded my cart, the prisoner was brought up to me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184007060101"/>
               <p>by a policeman, who said there was a bag of coffee found on the van, and he believed my bales had been plundered—I saw the silk taken out of his nose bag up at the gate of the dock—it was in the nose-bag of his horses belonging to the van—he was not present at that time—one of the bales had been torn open at one end, and one at the side, and they were deficient in weight—I have the dock weight, which was put down in weighing them, and I kept a strict look out after the van till we got home—I was with it all the time—I never for a moment had my eye off it, and when we got home we took the bales out, and weighed them separately—one was one pound short, and the other was two pounds short.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder. The prisoner carted bricks for me—on the 29th of June, I was at my buildings about ten o'clock in the morning—I told the prisoner to go to the field, and cart 2000 stock bricks—another carman went with him—I waited there three quarters of an hour—the prisoner came in with a lead of bats, which had nothing to do with the order I gave him—the other carman brought in 500 stock bricks—he unloaded to go to fetch the others, as I supposed—I returned about six o'clock in the evening, and while I was standing I observed the prisoner going along the Kingsland-road with a load of bricks—I had previously ascertained that he had only delivered one load of bricks on my premises—a thought struck me that something wrong was going on—I want to the field to ascertain how many bricks he had drawn—the kiln-man was gone, but I found that 2000 bricks had been had out of the field—next day I received information, and found 500 bricks at a house occupied by one of my la<lb/>bourers, 500 yards from my buildings—I went to the station-house, and gave the prisoner into custody—the bricks, I found, were part of what were booked to me—the cart was the prisoner's brother's.</p>
