It was Barnes and Beecham that done it—I sent them by a constable to the station, and also sent for an ambulance; I picked up the injured man; he was insensible, and was bleeding from the back of the head; he fell on the pavement, on the back of his head—I placed him on the ambulance, and sent him to the hospital; he was examined by the doctor—the prisoners seemed to make a laugh of it, and said I had made a mistake—I was standing about fifty yards from where this occurred—there were four or five big lamps near; there was no difficulty in seeing; the prisoners were sober—there was another one behind; I don't know what became of him; he had done nothing; he was some feet behind when this occurred.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mining agent, and carry on business at 44 and 46, Broad Street—in the early days of October, 1895, I was the holder of an Option of some mining property at Dunville in Western Australia, which had been known as "O'Neil's Surprise"—it has been re-named and called "The New Wealth of Nations"—early in October I entered into negotiation with the defendent, Mr. Tibbs, with regard to the sale of that Option—I knew he was the Chairman of the West Australian, Limited, but this transaction was carried on with him personally, not on behalf of Western Austalia—I offered the property to</p>

               <p>him personally, not to the Western Australia; there is a letter written to him personally.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. You seem to have stated before the Magistrate, "I entered into negotiation with the Western Australia Company through Mr. Tibbs"?—Yes; that wants a slight explanation: a little before that I had sold some property through Mr. Tibbs to the Western Australia Company, and he said, "I am concerned with other companies, and if you offer me any property in future, I don't know whether it is to be with me or Western Australia"—for that reason I dealt with him personally—the deposition is perfectly correct—at that time I was dealing with Western Australia through Mr. Tibbs, but I only knew Mr. Tibbs—I was in verbal communication with him about the Dunville property, prior to my correspondence—the substance of the verbal communication was that I had a certain property, called "The Surprise," consisting of two small properties—that was the Dunville claim, and that, from reports in my possession, I thought it was a good property for him to purchase—that is what I told Mr. Tibbs; he was called away and I left the whole details of the property in writing with a lady who was typewriting in his office; that was the first day; she was acting as his clerk—it was then reduced into writing; this was the first written document in connection with the matter. (<hi rend="italic">This was put in and read.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi>. That was the proposal which I wrote in my own office, and which I left in his office with the lady typewriter—this is the modified proposal—he did not then mention the name of the Auriferous Company; he never mentioned it in connection with this property—the negotiations afterwards were chiefly conducted by Mr. Kendall, not on behalf of Western Australia, on behalf of Mr. Tibbs—those negotiations were broken off on November 15th, 1895, when I received this letter from Messrs. Sutton, Ommany and Kendall, the solicitors acting for the Western Australia; at least, my solicitors received it, terminating the negotiations—about the date of that letter I had an interview with Mr. Tibbs—he told me that the report was adverse, and the negotiations en<lb/>tirely dropped as from that date—I never received £1,000, or any other sum, from Mr. Tibbs in connection with the purchase of this Option.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never expected to, after hearing that the reports were not satisfactory—Mr. Tibbs was not under any obligation to hand over £1,000, or any other sum, to me until he was satisfied with the reports—that was the bargain; that was the understanding verbally between us—I gave him permission to obtain a confirmatory reports upon the property; I had only furnished him with the report furnished to me—the question was to remain open till a satisfactory report on the pro<lb/>perty was received—in these cases the Option passes through several hands before a confirmatory report is received—in the proposal I left with the lady typewriter it is mentioned that £10,000 was to be the working capital, and £60,000 would be wanted for the working up of the property; at that period the "Wealth of Nations" was the most taking property in Australia, and was then a very successful one—the £1,000 was to be paid on signing the contract for the purchase; that means after the allotment of the shares in the new company—I gave Mr. Tibbs copies of all the reports I had, and I was perfectly satisfied with them—he told me that he was waiting for confirmatory reports—they might have had a</p>

               <p>full report by the 15th, but I only expected a cable—it is a six weeks' post—I know the firm of James Brothers, Mining Agents, at Western Australia and in London; I have met them in both places—I was in Mr. Tibbs's office once when he sent off a cable for instructions on the reports on this property—he handed it to me—it would cost about, £200 to obtain qualified reports—I was at all times anxious to carry on this business—I was from time to time pressing the defendant to complete it—my solicitors were Edwards and Cohen—through my solicitors I was worrying Mr. Tibbs to carry it out, and I pressed him personally also—I cannot exactly say that I did so after the letter of November 15th—I do not think so—I pressed him to give me the adverse reports—after November 15th I pressed him either to reopen or continue the business—I tried to get back the money I had paid—I wanted to get the adverse reports, for I did not believe in them—he simply said he had not received them—I wanted to get back the £1,000 which I had paid—I told him I did not believe in the adverse reports—the property was so good, I thought it impossible; I thought they were trifling with me—I asked him to hand over the adverse reports at the same time he told me he had received them—the reports of experts are not generally handed over until the money is placed in the bank—I think it would be about February 6th that Mr. Tibbs paid, £100 to James Brothers—that would be about the date that I got the adverse reports—I had had other dealings with Mr. Tibbs prior to this one—I always thought him a straightforward, honour<lb/>able man in every way—I had thorough confidence in him—I knew him as a director in the Western Australia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It it the custom to place the money in the bank to the expert's account before the matter is completed, unless he has a representa<lb/>tive in London; he may be an employé in the London office—before the letter of November 15th Mr. Tibbs stated that the report was totally unsatisfactory—I pressed him at that interview to let me see the report—later on my solicitors received it—that was followed by the letter of Nov<lb/>ember 15th, breaking off the negotiations—my solicitor afterwards wrote to Mr. Tibbs a quasi-private letter, telling him I had not seen the reports—that letter I have not even copied—that letter had relation to the Dun<lb/>ville claim. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was put in, and read</hi>). That letter correctly repre<lb/>sents what I describe as an attempt to reopen the negotiation—the report before the 15th Mr. Tibbs told me was a very adverse one—I had not seen it—he told me he had seen it—he simply said it had arrived by cable—he did not tell me that the negotiation must be broken off; the letter told me that—after that, the view I took of my position was repre<lb/>sented by this letter—I asked him for the report, or a copy of it—I wanted to use it to get my money back; I did not get it—I did not be<lb/>lieve in its existence—that was my view.</p>

Tibbs"—it was a crossed cheque, and it was paid into the Commercial Bank of Scotland—I don't recollect when I next saw Mr. Tibbs, unless it was at his office—I then asked for a receipt for the £1,000—I have no recollection of saying anything else, but I think I should have asked him how the Option was going on—I did not suggest to him, what name the receipt should bear—I have no recollection of having done so—I remem<lb/>her that the cheque was drawn a blank—I asked him for the acknow<lb/>ledgment of the money—I have not any distinct recollection of anything else passing; I don't remember the conversation, but I have an idea in my mind, from the circumstances of the caseé, that I should have asked him about the Option—I never heard anything about the holder of the Option—I have not any distinct recollection upon that point—I cannot recollect that anything was said about the Option-holder—my impression was that he was the Option-holder—I don't remember saying anything to him about it—I think that the acknowledgment for the money paid was written out at the time, at his office, and handed to me—on the following day, November 6th, a board meeting was held, at which Mr. Tibbs was present—I have the minute book here—the meeting was at twelve o'clock—I do not remember producing this receipt to the directors—between November 6th, 1895, and November 3rd, 1896, I saw Mr. Tibbs at the board meetings—there was not a board meeting, I think, between November 4th and February 5th—I don't remember speaking to Mr. Tibbs during that time—in consequence of instructions which came to me on January 22nd, 1896, I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">exhibit No.</hi> 7), stating that the £1,000 would be of great use to them, and enable the company to withdraw something—I received a reply to that letter on January 29th, 1896—a board meeting was held on January 5th, at which a minute was made that Mr. Tibbs would be able to pay the £1,000 on the 13th of the then present month—I have no recollection of receiving instructions from the directors on February 4th and 5th to write a letter to Mr. Tibbs—on February 13th I received this letter from him, stating that the cheque would be forthcoming on the 15th—it did not come—on the 19th I wrote this letter, stating that the cheque must be sent before three o'clock to-morrow—on February 21st the solicitors of the company were consulted by the directors, and on that day Mr. Tibbs's resignation was accepted—I never, at any time, received from Mr. Tibbs</p>

I am a solicitor, of 83, West Regent Street, Glasgow—in October, 1895, I became a director of the Auriferous Company—from that date I knew the defendant as a co-director, and as chairman of the Board—he took an active part in the affairs of the company—I knew nothing of the promotion of the company of my own knowledge—I was present at the Board meeting on the 2nd of October—Mr. Tibbs was present—I remember his bringing to the notice of the Board a property called "The New Wealth of Nations"—he suggested that the Auriferous Properties should pay £1,000 for a share in the Option of that company, to be repaid upon a confirmatory report of the affairs of the company, if the reports, which were to be got from Australia, were satisfactory—a company was to be formed to acquire that company, and our company was to have a certain profit in shares—he said there were some slight reports, I rather think he submitted them, but they were meagre at that time, and awaited confirmation—he recom<lb/>mended it to the adoption of the Board, and the Board accepted his recommendation, and passed the resolution mentioned under that date—I cannot say whether the name of the Option-holder was mentioned by Mr. Tibbs at that time—I think a name was mentioned, I think it was Henochsperg, and the cheque for £1,000 was authorised and signed by Ansel and Tibbs, and at a subsequent meeting of the Board, on the 6th of October, Mr. Tibbs reported that he had paid it over to the solicitor of the intermediate syndicate of the New Wealth of Nations Company—he said the papers were not in order, and it had not been paid over to the syndicate, but to the solicitor, pending the production of the docu<lb/>ment—I think that was all he said about the matter—the receipt was not produced on the 6th to my recollection—the next Board meeting was on the 20th, and on that day I asked for the receipt, and I was told it was in the public office; the Board-room was separate from the office of the company—we were in the Board-room—the defendant was present when I asked for the receipt; I think we just went on with the rest of the business of the meeting—I think Mr. Tibbs had left the meeting early—after the meeting was over I got the solicitor's receipt, and I at once challenged it—this (<hi rend="italic">exhibit</hi> 6) is the receipt which I then saw for the first time—I think the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189704050030"/>
               <p>defendant had then left—I objected to it on various grounds—at the next Board meeting the question of the receipt was bought up—Mr. Tibbs was present, and the secretary—there was some conversation with regard to the receipt amongst the directors—questions were put, and Mr. Tibbs gave me certain answers, and the matter stood adjourned to the next meeting on January 4th—Mr. Tibbs was then present, and in the chair—I asked Mr. Tibbs to give us the proper receipt which he had got from the third party—I told him I had stated my objections to that receipt; my first objection was that it was not stamped; secondly, that it was a personal receipt by Mr. Tibbs, and that what we wanted was the receipt from the third party, and holder of the Option, which should embody the terms—Mr. Tibbs replied that he had the receipt in his own office, and that it should be sent over—on that assurance the matter dropped—I don't think I asked him about the reports about the property on January 4th—I gave certain instructions to the secretary on that day—at a meeting of the Board, on February 5th, Mr. Tibbs was in the chair—the question of the receipt was again raised, I think—I asked for the receipt, and Mr. Tibbs said he had forgotten to send it across—I think that was really all that passed at that meeting—I pointed out that it was irregular that we should not hold a receipt for a large sum like that, which he said he had obtained previously from the holder—he said he had forgotten it, he had overlooked it, and it would be sent round—on that day, after the Board meeting was over, I and Mr. Butters went to Mr. Tibbs' office and saw him—I asked him for the receipt he was supposed to have received—he said it was among his other papers in the office; that he had left another meeting to come and see us, and it would take some time to get it—I said I was quite willing to wait for the receipt; something made me challenge him, and I said, "I don't believe you have got a receipt at all"—he did not answer that; he left the room, and soon after we left the office—I did not see him any more that day—but I and Mr. Butters addressed a letter to him, and sent it by hand, signed by me and Mr. Butters, and Mr. Crawley (<hi rend="italic">The letter was called for, but was not produced.</hi>) On or about that date there came back from the defendant, I think on the 5th February, a letter of resigna<lb/>tion, addressed to the secretary—this entry of 5th February in the minute book correctly represents what occurred at that meeting—the name of the syndicate was not disclosed, and I don't think the name of the person who had given the receipt was disclosed—it was for the purpose of seeing the receipt that we went there on the 5th February—subsequently to 5th February there was a correspondence between the secretary and Mr. Tibbs in relation to his undertaking to return the receipt; it was never returned—I consulted Mr. Mayo, our solicitor; and counsel were seen in the matter; and then civil, proceedings were taken, which were not defended, and judgment was recorded on 27th March, 1896—bankruptcy proceedings were taken under our instructions by the solicitors to the company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> I became a director subsequently to Mr. Tibbs—Mr. Ansell introduced me to the company; I had known him before; I understood that he was the promoter of the company—Mr. Tibbs was represented to me to be a director when I was asked to join—I had no reason to suppose that Mr. Tibbs was promoter of the company—at same</p>

               <p>time I heard the name of Mr. Henochsperg as the holder of the Option—I have seen Mr. Henochsperg here for the first time—I had no doubt that he was the holder of the option—I understood that £1,000 was going to be paid over to Mr. Henochsperg before the option was received—I know this kind of business, the purchase of an Option; it is usual to have a report on the property before the payment of the money; it is only a deposit, it is not a payment—it might be prudent not to pay the deposit until satisfied of the nature and value of the pro<lb/>perty—I understood that Mr. Tibbs was doing that—he mentioned to me incidentally in the Board-room that he had been cabling to Australia on the subject, to have the reports one way or the other—I never saw the written reports that were ultimately handed over to Mr. Henochs<lb/>perg. I never enquired of Henochsperg about this matter—I was present on November 6th at the meeting—it is not my recollection that the secretary produced to me a receipt dated November 5th—it was shown to me after the meeting—I do not think it is likely to have been on the 6th—I was present at the next meeting, on 20th—the minutes of the 6th were read and confirmed—I see no word of any statement that the defendant had paid over the £1,000 to the solicitor—I asked him for the receipt—he said the secretary had it—according to my recollection, after the defendant left, the secretary pro duced this receipt—I think the defendant was not present when the re<lb/>ceipt was produced—I did not look at the counterfoil of the" cheque at any time—I do not think I have seen the cheque or the counterfoil—I was never asked to look at them—when the receipt was pointed out to be irregular the defendant said he would send a proper receipt to the office, or made some answer of that kind—I did not know what the defendant was doing, but we never had reports in reply to our enquiries from Aus<lb/>tralia—I still say that he was cabling out to Australia—I did not, on February 5th, understand that the syndicate was a separate business—I did not ask what syndicate he referred to—the minute will bear the in<lb/>terprelation that it referred to other business the defendant was engaged in—my understanding was that he had already paid us the money—on February 21st, when I consulted the solicitor, I thought the £1,000 had not been paid over—I was then satisfied it was not—I consulted counsel to advise on the whole position—the whole of the facts were put before him to advise us what course should be taken—I was present with Mr. Mayo—I was first requested, on March 10th, to state what had transpired at the meeting—I have no notes of what transpired—ray only reference is the attendance book and the correspondence with the secretary—I believe the defendant received no director's fees; the other directors did—the defendant made a proposal with reference to the repayment of the money—I think that was after the action commenced—it was a proposal to transfer some of his assets, or interest, in another company—the whole of the terms are contained in the letter of March 19th, where Mr. Crawley called my attention to the terms offered—it was the North Prince Mine, of Ballarat, to which he had paid a large sum, but still owed £500—that offer, being submitted to the directors, was declined.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant to the Commercial Bank of Scotland, 52, Lombard Street—Mr. Tibbs had an account there—I produce an examined account, showing the condition of his account with the bank between October 15th, 1895, and July 8th, 1896—£1,000 was paid into his account under date of October 26th—this is the cheque, and this is the paying-in slip which accompanied it, in the handwriting of Mr. Tibbs: "Credit, Percival Tibbs, £1,000"—his credit balance then' stood at £730 15s. 6d.—on the same day two cheques were presented against the account, one for £500, and another for £100—on October 31st I other cheques were presented on the account, and his credit balance stood at £580 15s. 7d.—the account remained current until July 8th, 1896, when his credit balance was £8 2s. 6d.; on that day that sum was paid over to the Official Receiver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothier, and live at 83, Regent Street, Derby—I was a director of the board of the Auriferous Company, having been appointed on October 10th, 1895—I was present at the board meeting of November 6th, 1895—Mr. Tibbs was present—he said that he had obtained an Option for the benefit of the Auriferous Company; that it would be a very good thing for the company; that he had paid £1,000 to the solicitor of the option-holder, for which we should get, I think it was, 30,000 shares, if my memory is right—one of the board asked for the receipt—he put his hand in his side pocket, and looked over some papers, and said that he had not got it with him; that it was at his office or his room, I am not sure which—that is all I remember—the next board meeting was held on November 20th—on that occa<lb/>sion I was present, and also Mr. Tibbs—inquiry was made of Mr. Tibbs as to how the thing was proceeding—he was again asked for the receipt, and the secretary produced a receipt, I think it was at that meeting, from Mr. Tibbs; it was examined by the board, and it was not considered a satisfactory receipt; it was Mr. Tibbs's personal receipt—we asked for the receipt which he said he had from the solicitor, when he paid over to the gentleman that held the Option—I hardly remember what Mr. Tibbs said to that, but he said that the receipt would be forthcom<lb/>ing in due time, that he had honourably paid the money to the solicitor—I think he said that at the next board meeting he would produce the pro<lb/>per receipt; I think he said it was at his office—that is substantially what occurred about the £1,000—the next board meeting was on January 9th, 1896—I was present, as was Mr. Tibbs—I really do not remember</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We told Mr. Mayo all we knew about this matter, all that I have stated to-day and more—at the time I joined this company I had not even an idea of the meaning of an Option—I have some idea now; I don't know that I am right—I do not think I was present at the meeting of October 23rd; I think I was ill at home—I was present on September 6th—I heard the minutes of the previous meeting read—that was the first time I heard of the purchase of this Option—I was present at the next meeting on November 20th—the minutes of the previous meeting were read and confirmed; I took no objection to them—anything mentioned by the chairman would not be in the minutes—on November 6th the receipt that was objected to was produced by the de<lb/>fendant himself—I think I had seen the receipt before November 20th—I don't remember whether it was produced at the meeting, or before we went in—we generally had a long conversation before we went in to busi<lb/>ness; I think the receipt was shown to me by Mr. Crawley—I heard the name of Mr. Henochsperg in connection with this matter, once, I think, early in February, about the 6th, not before; I then heard the name as the holder of the Option; I never saw him before—I was examined at the Police-court—I don't think I then said that the conversation took place</p>

Pannell and Company, to make investigation into his affairs—I believe a copy of their report was sent to us by Mr. Tibbs—I know that in 1896 there were many disasters in the affairs of South Africa, following upon the Jameson Raid—it began in October, 1895.</p>

I told him, 'No'"—when iden<lb/>tified by Tillman the same evening, he said, "Nobody had anything to do with it but me; Miles knows something about it, the other man and the two women know nothing about it: I don't care; you cannot hang me"—I went to 125, Shepherdess Walk, in company with Wensley, on March 18th, at three a.m.—on the first floor in the front room I saw Wilson and West—I told them we were police officers, making inquiries respecting a quantity of blouses that had been stolen—I asked who occupied this room—Wilson replied, "Me and my sister occupy these two rooms, front and back; we have been here about a fortnight"—they produced a rent-book with the name of Mrs. Wilson—I said, "Have you any blouses here?"—Wilson replied, "We have no blouses here"—West said to me, "You have made a mistake"—I told them we were going to search the room—I searched, and found five boxes under a sheet, under the bed; one was covered with brown paper—when I found a tin box she said, "That is mine; you will find nothing in there"—I opened it, and found eight blouses—I found another blouse behind a curtain in the same room—there were two bonnets—West owned the bonnets—they said they were not aware the blouses were there—I understood West to say that—Wensley had taken Miles into custody.</p>
