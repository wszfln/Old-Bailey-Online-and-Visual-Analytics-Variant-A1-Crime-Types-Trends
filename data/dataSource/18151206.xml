Before the prisoner came, I took down the watch, which was hanging up in the room, and put it into a drawer, in the same room. The prisoner came to work at about ten o'clock in the morning, and went away at twelve; at times during that period, he was by himself; I was going backwards and forwards; but did not remain in the room the whole time he staid. At about four o'clock, I was sent up stairs by my mistress for the watch; I looked in the drawer, and the watch was gone. We did not miss the other things until the Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What other things were there in this room, or else where, that were missing on the Saturday, and which you had seen before-A. I had only seen them on the Sunday previous; there was a chain and an eye glass, that belonged to my mistress; there were two mourning rings, and a hair ring, and the other things. It was not I that missed them on the Saturday, but I was in the room when Hutt, the officer, looked in the wardrobe, and then they were missing. I have seen the things since, and know nothing more.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce two mourning rings, a hair ring, three brooches, and an eye glass and chain; also the duplicate for the watch. I apprehended the prisoner at the workshop, on Saturday,the 4th of November; I told him what I apprehended him for, on suspicion of stealing a gold watch, the property of Mr. Raynsford; he denied any knowledge of it. I asked him where he lodged? he said, in Colwille-court, and took me to his lodgings. I searched them; but without any success. He still persisted in knowing nothing of the matter. I took him and his wife to our office, on suspicion. He was committed for a re-examination, and in consequence of information which I received while he was locked up, I went with his wife to No. 2, Monmouth-court, Seven Dials; his father-in-law lodged there, and I got the property there. The prisoner did not express to me his wish in words for me to go, but I saw a letter of his; that letter is his. I had gone to Mr. Raynsford's house, and examined with the servant the bureau or wardrobe, and on her opening this little box, it was empty, and she said the things were gone.</p>

            . After the prisoner was apprehended, and examined, the first time he was locked up again in the place at the office, I heard some person cry "hoy," to me from that place, and it was the prisoner; I went to him; he said, he wanted to speak to me; he asked me if Mr. Raynsford was gone from the office; I told him he was not. He said, he wished to speak to him; he had something very particular to say to him. I told him I would tell the magistrate; I went, and did so. The magestrate then ordered him into the office. He then said to Mr. Raynsford, that he was very sorry for what had happened, but would confess the whole; he said that the watch was in pawn, over Westminster bridge. He asked, might he be allowed pen, ink, and paper; he was informed he might if he wished. He said, that the watch was in pawn, over Westminster bridge, and the rest of the things his wife knew of. (Witness producing a letter.) I saw him write this; I know it to be the same; here are my initials at the corner.</p>

               <p>THE COURT, in summing up the evidence for the consideration of the Jury, informed them, that in order to substantiate the capital part of this charge, a stealing to the amount of forty shillings in a dwelling house at one time must be established;-here, one article, the watch, was considerably above that amount, and if they were fully satisfied in all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060004"/>the other particulars, it would be their duty, however painful, capitally to convict the prisoner; but, if on the other hand, they had any doubt, it ought to be thrown into the scale in his favour.</p>

                        targets="t18151206-2-off7 t18151206-2-crimeloc10"/>, at about half past five o'clock in the evening; it was then dusk, and a fair night; I saw three men before us, on the footpath, either standing still or else walking very slowly; one of them stepped off the footpath, and made up to the horse's head; he drew a pistol, and cried stop ! I then pulled up my horse. A second came immediately to the side of the chair, and planted himself at the dashing iron; he also presented a pistol into the chair towards one of us; he came on the near side; they were both on the near side, Mr. Withey told them to take away their pistols, and one of them said, if you will deliver your money, we won't hurt a hair of your head. In a very short time, a third man stepped on the step with one foot, and put the other into the chair; that man had a pistol also, which he put to my breast; he had a black patch hanging from his hat over his face, so as to conceal it. He demanded our money. I was about to put my hand to my pocket to give it him, when he said, don't touch your pocket! sir! if you do, you are a dead man! I then dropped my arm, and then he put his hand into my right hand breeches pocket, and took from it a small note case, containing five pounds in small notes, and some memorandums. He then took my watch; last of all, he put his hand into my right hand breeches pocket, where was some silver; it had got into a corner, and he did not thurst his hand to the bottom, so that he missed it; he then ran his hand down on the outside, and missed it then also. He then proceeded to Mr. Withey, who can relate better than I can what he did to him. I believe he did not take any thing from him. He then got out of the chair, and one of them said, now drive on as fast as you can, but do not look back. I think all this happened in about two minutes; during the whole of the time. I had particularly in my command the man at the horse's head; I mean I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Mr Gurney. Look at the bar, and tell us if either of the priooners is that man - A. I have no doubt at all that the man in the black coat is he,(John Brown,) I am also satisfied that the other is the man who stood at the dashing iron; that is

               <p>Paisoner John Brown. Do you know any particular mark by which you speak to me - A. I took such particular notice of the character and person of the man, as leaves no doubt in my mind, that you are he. The prisoner John, at the time he committed the robbery, wore a drab coloured great coat. When I went to Bow-street for the purpose of seeing whether they were the persons who robbed me, on their apprehension, they were not dressed in the great coats, but as, they are now; still I was satisfied by the prisoner John Brown's face, and his person, that he was the man who stood at my horse's head. When they were taken from the bar, I went into the place of confinement to look at them again, and observing one of the officers to wear a drab coloured great coat, I requested that it might be put on the prisoner John Brown; it was accordingly put on him, and then I said, I have no doubt. He then either said, you have seen me before, or else interrogatively, have you seen me before? I said I had, and then he asked me where? I said that must be enquired into in another place.</p>

            , ESQ. I was in the chaise with Mr. Rich, going down to his house at Hendon, at the time of the robbery. I have heard the account which Mr. Rich has given of the transaction; it is correct, except that I was the first searched. I was searched by the man with the patch over his face. I am not enabled to speak positively to the persons who robbed me; only as to my belief; I think that George was the one who stood on my left side at the dashing iron. I cannot speak at all to the other, nor particularly to either.</p>

On the Saturday evening next after the robbery, the 11th of November, I was in the Green Lane road, to Hornsey, in company with others of my patrole; I went on duty at about five o'clock. At about twenty minutes after six, we met three men in the company together, walking within two or three yards of each other, We apprehended them all; they turned out to be the two prisoners at the bar, and one who has made his escape.

We brought them towards Islington? the third got away. We lodged these two in Clerkenwell watch-house, whilst we went to look for the third; but unsuccessfully. When they were fully committed, George asked me for a key of his box which I had of his, he said, I had no key at all, but one of my brother officers had taken a key from the man who made his escape, and that was the one to which he alluded. I mention this, to prove that they were all in company together.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rich, re-examined. At the time John Brown was standing at the horse's head, I took particular notice, owing to some cause which I was not aware of, but which I now perceive to be a fracture in the stock of the pistol; I could plainly distinguish the ram-rod sticking out from the stock, and am by that means enabled to swear more positively that it was a pistol.</p>
               <p>Both the prisoners made long defences, denying their guilt of the robbery in question, and setting up an alibi, but the witnesses whom they called to substantiate it, not only contradicted each other upon several leading points, but were also contradicted by the officers.</p>

He said he wanted to change a pound note, and he would give me something to drink. I told him not to change his pound note for the sake of a glass of liquor, for I would pay for one for him, and accordingly I did; I went to a wine-vaults with him, close by Duke's place; we had two glasses of gin, for which I paid.

Then the other prisoner asked him what he had got, and he said it was all prime. He was leading me by my arm, and was undoing my shawl, which was wound round that arm; the shawl was round my neck, and he threw the end of it over my shoulder, and the other prisoner ran off with it; then he held me against the wall, and rifled my pockets; I found his hand in my pocket; I called out "watch! watch! stop thief!" I had a cotton shawl, a pair of new cotton stockings, and a three shilling piece, in my pocket, but I did not miss it (the three shilling piece) until I got to the watchhouse. When I called out."watch," Moss Jacobs called out, stamp her b'oody guts out, I held the shawl that was round my neck as long as ever I could. Davis said nothing at all, all the time, only he strived to get my pocket off. He had not time to take the stockings, by the watch coming to my assistance. I never saw either of them before, only one called the other Isaac. I followed Isaac, and saw the house he went into. It was very foggy at the beginning of the night; but at this time it was light. It was under a lamp where he held me against the wall. Two watchman went to the house where Davis went into, and another watchman and I went to Spitalfields watchhouse. I told them there, what had happened to me, and came back to the house where Davis had gone into, and where the watchman were standing sentry at the door. The watchman asked me to describe Davis, and I told him he had a longish nose, and a ring in his left ear, a dark coat, a light waistcoat, and pantaloons. They took him, but let him go, as one of them knew him. I went immediately with the watchmen to his father's house, up a court, not far off the place; he was not in bed; he had his coat off; I said that is the young man who assisted in taking my shawl, and rifled my pockets. He then said he had never seen me. I gave charge of him to the watchmen, and he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Mary's, Whitechapel. I am the watchman who first came up to the last witness, on the alarm being given; between the hours of eleven and twelve, I heard "watch! watch! stop thief!" cried; upon that, I went in the direction I heard the voice; when I got up to the prosecutrix, I found her stoopping up against the wall; I took hold of her shoulder, and asked her what was the matter; she said, she had been robbed. I asked her which way they went; she said that one ran up the court, and one went into a house, which she pointed out to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060006"/>me. She was frightened, and I afterwards found she pointed out the wrong house, I told her to go to Spitaltields watchhouse, and I would stop, and watch over the door, and see that nobody came either in or out. While she was gone, I heard the door of No. I, open quite gently. I instantly went to the door; I saw the prisoner Isaac Davis, there, whom I told if he offered to come out, I would knock him down. He said, why, watchman, you ought to know me. I told him I knew nobody in the execution of my duty. At this time there was a young woman came down stairs, with a shawl thrown carelessly over her shoulder. He then came again to the threshold, upon which I gave him a shove back again, the second time. This young woman that I have mentioned, seeing me shove him back, went up stairs again, and I saw no more of her. I heard u great deal of whispering in the house, and I called an Aldgate watchman to my assistance; his name is

Then we went to the prisoner's father's house, and knocked at the door; the prisoner Davis, came down, and opened the door, and the prosecutrix said, that is the man, I will take my oath of it. Accordingly the Aldgate watchman went and saw that he put his clothes on, and then brought him down, and we took him to the watch-house.

            . I am a watchman of Aldgate parish. At a quarter before twelve o'clock, on the night in question, the last witness called me; he was talking to the woman, who was the prosecutrix, just by New court; I asked her which was the house the man went into, and she told me the first house, and pointed it out. I then persuaded her to go to Spitalfields watchhouse, to get the officers down, and I pursuaded the other watchman to stay at the door, while I went the hour of twelve. When I returned, I found Davis at the door, and the other watchman would not let him come out. He called to me by the name of Bill, and said, you know me; I said, I did know him, and then the other man let him go. I knew where to find him; after that, the woman returned from Spitalfields watchhouse; I asked her then, which was the house the man went into, and she pointed out the house that Davis had come out of. She gave me a description of him; which answered that on which I apprehended him. I took her and the watchman to the door where the prisoner lived, and knocked at it; Davis came down to open the door, with a light in his hand; he was half dressed. I put the light to his face, and asked the prosecutrix if that was the man? She replied, it was. I then took him up stairs, and made him dress himself, and afterwards took him to Aldgate watchhouse.</p>

            . I am an officer. I know that woman, who appears this day, as prosecutrix against the two prisoners. I went into Aldgate watchhouse, and saw them brought in and I thought they had been brought in as disorderly. I asked the prosecutrix what brought her there, and she said, she had been robbed. I said, robbed! who the deuce would rob you? I asked her to explain? She said, she had been into a wine-vaults with a young man to have a drop of gin. She did not tell me where she had come, whether from Greenwich or elsewhere. She said, she had asked the young fellow to shew her the way into Spitalfields. I said, she knew well enough without asking any one. I asked her what she was robbed of, and she said her shawl. I asked her if she had lost any money, and she said no, for a good reason, because she had none to lose; she had nothing but an old pocket handkerchief in her pocket. I asked her in what manner she was robbed, and she told me that they took her to a kind of puddle, and she had her shawl over her shoulder, and somebody whipped it off, and ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. The reason I had all this conversation was because I knew her well. I have had a deal of trouble with her, when she gets a hold of some person to treat her to a glass of liquor. I am a street - keeper, and am often called to remove her from different public houses. I have no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060007"/>cause to come here to-day. I never dreamed of coming here until I was subpoened.</p>

            . I am also a street-keeper, and have been so for ten years. I was examined before. I have travelled the streets up and down during that period, and never saw her drunk or disorderly in the streets in my life. I was in the watchhouse from the time the prisoners were brought in until five o'clock in the morning, and never heard any communication of the kind that the last witness has spoken of.</p>
               <p>THE COURT, in summing up the evidence for the considerstion of the Jury, informed them, that if they only believed the prisoner Jacobs snatched the shawl from her, that would not be a charge of sufficient consequence to effect his life; however, the subsequent conduct of the other prisoner, would effect his; but if the prosecutrix tried to prevent Jacobs from getting the shawl, by holding one end of it, and resisting the attempt, if he succeeded in getting it, that would be force and violence enough to constitute a highway robbery.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Grobb, Rood lane. I was coming up St. Mary's Hill on the 3rd of November between ten and eleven in the morning, I saw some persons at Mr. Brown's house. I saw them with a hamper at the door; they lifted it on the prisoner's shoulder, and he took it away. I noticed which way he turned; the others turned down little Tower street. I immediately went to give Mr. Brown information that he had been robbed. His servant was sent, and he took him with the hamper on his shoulder. There were four or five concerned in this; I fetched the officer who took charge of him.</p>

            . I know all the wine merchants; they are in the habit of employing me to carry hampers and things for them. I was standing at the corner of St. Dunstan's hill, and the prisoner came along with the hamper on his shoulder. Shaw beckoned to me, and I followed the prisoner with him. We went up to the prisoner, and Shaw said to him, "halloo my friend, you have gone quite far enough with that." I helped the hamper off the prisoner's shoulder, and then he ran away. I followed him and took him in Mincing lane; I collared him, and brought him back to Shaw, and took the property to Mr. Brown, and he took the prisoner.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Mr. Nicholson. The prisoner came in under a pretence to sell fire wood. There was nothing at the door. I understood that his cart was in the next street. He took hold of the parcel of goods, and was going out of the warehouse with it; I immediately laid hold of him, and he dropped the parcel. We sent for a constable, and had him taken into custody.</p>

The prisoners came to my shop on the 2nd of November, between three and four in the afternoon; Williams and Kent came into the shop, and asked to look at some Irish linen; some was shewn to them, which was too narrow; another piece was shewn, which was not fine enough; in the art of taking down a third, I looked round, and saw the prisoner Williams, as I supposed, tying her garter, but bad not the least suspicion. I served them with one yard of linen, at two shillings and ninepence, and took the money for it. When the prisoners were going out, I was much struck with the awkwardness of the walk of Williams. I immediately told my son to go and watch their conduct, for I feared they had got something which was not their own. My son followed them, and traced them to different places, and then came back, and then he and I went into Bishopsgate-street, where they had arrived, and where the three were arm in arm at the corner of Old Bethlehem. When I came within about three yards of them, they looked round; seeing me and my son so close to them, they parted; I immediately seized hold of two of them, and my son seized the other. I thought if they had any property, that it would be dropped. Simmonds opened her cloak, and immediately the cotton fell, and I picked it up. They have changed their dresses. The property was seventeen yards of printed cotton, and it cost me one pound fifteen shillings. Then we brought them towards my own house, and met the constable and gave them into his custody.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus. From the time the two women went out of the shop, to the time I saw three in company, and arm in arm, it might be a quarter of an hour.</p>

            ; I remember the two prisoners, Williams and Kent, coming into my father's shop on the 2nd of November. As soon as ever they were gone out, my father sent me after them in consequence of some suspicion he had. They went round Union street, and at about twenty yards from our house, they were joined by a third; they went along Union street, and into Duke street, and then into Sandy's row, leading into Petticoat lane; then I saw the two prisoners, Williams and Kent, standing with their backs against the wall Simmonds stood before them; I saw Williams drop something from underneath her clothes, and Simmonds picked it up, and put it under her cloak. They then went down Widegate alley, which leads into Bishopsgate street; Simmonds kept on the one side of the way and Williams and Kent went on the other. When they got into Bishopsgate street, I ran home and told my father. He and I came out in pursuit of them, and caught them all arm in arm, just by Old Bethlehem. My father caught hold of Kent and Simmonds, and I caught hold of Williams. Then we met Mr. Sapwell the constable, and I saw the piece of cotton lying by the side of Simmonds; but I did not see my father take it up. My father gave them in charge of Mr. Sapwell; I was not twenty yards from the house, when I saw Simmonds.</p>

               <p>THOMAS -. I am a servant to Mr. Southgate. On the 3d of August I was going to my business at five o'clock in the morning; I met the prisoner coming down a court called Well court, Fleet street. He came in to Pancrass lane, where I stopped. As soon as he came up to me I called him by his name three times. He did not stop. I crossed the way, and laid hold of the trunk which he had on him. I said to him, this is my masters' trunk. I thought it was empty. He directly replied, it is my trunk, and I will have it. I forced it from his shoulder, and as soon as it reached the ground, he made his escape. There was not any one near that I could give charge of him to. I took the trunk to the warehouse from whence he had it. I could not carry the trunk all the way to Watling street to get the key, so I put it behind a truck of ours, to fetch the key: and when I came back I found the padlock of the door was wrenched off, and the warehouse broken open.</p>

            . I keep a chandler's shop. On the 30th of October, between two and three in the morning, I saw two men driving three pigs. At first I was not sure they were pigs, it was so dark. The pigs laid themselves down in the Kennel. I stopped the prisoner, and the other man ran away. I questioned the prisoner a good deal, where he was going; and he said he was going to market at Cow Cross. I told him there was no market that morning. He said that the little pig belonged to him, and that the other two belonged to the other man. Then I said to him that he must give a better account, and when I got near enough to him I seized him. I called the watchman, and he was taken to Bishopsgate watch-house. I gave the pigs up to the officer of the night, and he kept them in his cellar.</p>

I gave him five shillings and sixpence, and he gave me one of the pairs of snuffers. I put them in my pocket, and took an opportunity of taking them to Mr. Burbridge's; in consequence of which he was apprehended.

I was minding my shop on the 17th of November, and the prisoner at the bar came and took a loin of mutton from the stall, and wrapped it up under her cloak; I immediately laid hold of her, and took the mutton from under her cloak; and told her she must go to the Compter. She then said, she only took it in a joke. I told her that would not do, for she had taken a loin of mutton on the Wednesday before, and had been let off; and she had robbed several butcher's shops in the neighbourhood. I accordingly sent for a constable, and had her taken into custody. The mutton would not keep.</p>

The people were mobbing him in the yard, saying he was an informer, and I took him to get a glass of gin, and to get him out of the row; I took him into the parlour, in which I had laid the great coat; I left him alone for about five minutes to enquire something about him; but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060011"/>on my return, he was gone, before Hine came.</p>

            . I keep the George, Foster buildings, Whitecross street; that is the house in which this club is held. I recollect Wren, the prosecutor, being in the public house on the evening in question. I know the prosecutor was up in the club room, and so were the two prisoners also; I also saw Green in the club room; Barry broke the pannel of the door in the room, and we were obliged to get four watchmen to clear the house.</p>

            . I keep the Sun Dial, in Goswell street; I can't call to mind the night that the prisoners were in my house, but the next morning I heard of the robbery, being committed. The next morning the prosecutor told me he was robbed, and about one o'clock on the same day, I saw him and the prisoner Barry, playing skittles together in my ground; it was the same day after, the prosecutor told me he was robbed. He told me that about ten o'clock in the morning that he was robbed; and he was playing at skittles with Barry at about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley and Mr. Reynolds, as counsel for the prisoners, called several witnesses, who swore that the prosecutor was a man of most infamous character, and not to be beleived upon his oath.</p>

We took Surgey away. Afterwards I went with Bligh, to Bureau's stables some distance from his house; we found the stable locked, and a woman acting as Bureau's wife opened it for us. We went into the stable, and found part of a truss of hay, quite loose, and part trampled under feet,  serving as a bed for the horse, and in a little place on the right hand, like a sort of bin, there was another truss of hay, and a great coat spread out; Mr. Bligh pulled up the great coat, and

            . I am an officer of Queen square ofice. I happened to be in the public house when Smithers brought Slate in. In consequences of what pased there, I went with Brown and him to Bureau's stables; I did not before know it was his stable, but I knew him well. When we went there, we found the stable door locked; we asked Bureau whether he had seen any hay that evening? and he said, no I looked behind the counter, and saw Surgery lying upon a kind of bed; and I took him into custody. I sent Smithers away with him, and I staid untill he came back. Bureau at that time was sitting by the fire side, and apparently very ill. When Smithers. returned, I asked Bureau for the key of the stable. Nothing wsa said while Smithers were gone, to ny knowledge. His wife went down to the stable with me. as he was lame' and when we went into the stable I discovered two horses feeding on hay; there was no racks. Looking into a kind of grain hole, which is appeared to be, I saw a whole truss, and at the other end a large dirty great coat spread out; and I suspected some person was under, and on moving it, I found

             re-examined. Q. Blye has told us of a hole which came through from another loft; was that on your master's premises - A. Yes; it was a place coming from the corn loft into the hay loft, and which I fastened up on the Sunday morning.</p>

               <p>THE COURT Then proceeded to sum up the evidence, and informed the jury, that in this case, the principle evidence to criminate the prisoners, was that of an accessary, whose testimony ought upon all occasions to be received with the greatest care and doubt, and ought not to be credited, unless bourae out by a coincidence of facts, and accompanied by corrobirative circumstances. In the first place, no evidence at all had gone so far as to criminate Surgey; and in the next place, the jury would consider whether a case of burglary was established against any of the prisoners. The accomplice Brown, who is the only person who afforded any proof upon that part, had sworn that he was talking with Surgey and Slate, when Wood came up; and then they agreed to go to get some of Mr. Willingham's hay; but when they got down the passage, the loft door was open; in his presence no violence was used, nor had it appeared at all how the partition between the corn room and hay loft had been broken down. In cases of burglary, though a man be at the end of the street watching to prevent detection, and was not at all present at the actual breaking, yet the law would consider him to be full as guilty, as the man who used the crow, or any other house breaking instrument. But in this case, in order to establish a burglary against the three it must be supposed that when they were talking together, and through not present with Wood, they were in contest with him.</p>
               <p>There had been no evidence to that fact, and that was a mere question of probability not supported by any fact.</p>
               <p>The next question would be, like the former, a question of probability, whether Wood broke into the stable!-and then, if he did, whether it was dark at the time. If upon these points, and doubts should arise, it in the duty of the jury to give that doubt to the prisoners. If however they were convinced that the hay was stolen by all or any of the first three prisoner then, and not till then would the question arise, whether Bureau had received the hay with a guilty knowledge of its being stolen.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was coming up Hounsditch, and I met my brother officer, who had the prisoner in custody, and was accompanied by the prosecutrix. We took him to where his wife was, and there was nothing in the room but the property of the prosecutrix, and his wife was just about to lie in. There was neither stove nor fire, and they appeared to be in the greatest misery and distress. He is a jew, and has been deserted by his friends, on account of his marrying a christian.</p>

When we came to the bar, there was a pane of glass broken, in a side window adjoining the door; that window looks from the bar into the tap room, and side passage. I was generally up last myself; and every night we observed the doors and windows fastened before we went to bed; I saw the door safe and fastened, and this pane of glass whole the night before.

The bar window looking into the passage, was broken, one pane. When that was broken, I think a man could very easily get through. I observed the back door and one of the pannels was broken; it was broken so that anybody could put their hand in, and draw the bolt. I examined the pannel, but can't tell whether it was broken from the inside, or from the outside. I saw another place where an attempt had been made with a sharp instrument, to cut the glass of the window out, which looks into the yard.

            . That is my coat; that coat was left in the bar on the over night, and in the morning when I came down the prisoner had it; he dropped it, and we found it under his feet. I gave it to the officer. I am perfectly sure that the prisoner was not in the house; I searched it all round.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been newly paid off, and spent all my money in the prosecutor's house; this day in particular, I stopped during the whole day in the tap room dancing, and got drunk in his house, and fell asleep in a box, which was backwards, and I was awakened by two girls, and we had some gin, and then I went to sleep again.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060015"/>Besides it is well known, that there are two dogs in the house, one of which is a mastiff, and is so fierce, that if any body went to break into the bar, as they have sworn, he would tear him to pieces.</p>

I went out between seven and eight on the night of Saturday, the 14th of October; I left my dwelling house without anybody in it, it was then dark. I fastened the yard door with two bolts, and double locked the front door, and put the key in my pocket; all the windows were fastened; the back windows were nailed down; the wall of my back yard was down, so that any body could get into the yard. I returned home at about a quarter before twelve, and went to put the key to the key hole to open the door, and found it was open, it went from me; I found the back door wide open. I immediately ran up stairs, and found drawers open, and on putting my hand I found they were empty. I suppose the value of all the property we lost was at least thirty pounds; besides the notes; there were eight one pound notes, and two two pound notes, besides a one pound note which I did not know of, and which my wife had in one of her gloves. We then got a light, and I proceeded down stairs; on the wooden cover of a water jarr I found some matches, and a pipe with some tobacco in it. On the following morning in the yard I found this piece of candle broken.</p>

I had a one pound note which my husband know nothing of, in a pair of gloves, in one of the drawers where my clothes were; I had taken it from a Dutch Jew, a young man who had sold me a Dutch tablecloth; I had had it three or four weeks; he wrote the persons name from whom he had received it in Dutch or Hebrew; I could not read the writing he put upon it; but I have seen a similar note since, and to all appearence it is the same.</p>

I then went and alarmed my master; at that time, it was just getting the break of day, it was rather better than half past six; it was light enough for me to see their faces, and I am positive as to all of them. When we came down, the prisoners were gone; we found what had been taken, five pairs of shoes, and one pair of woman's boots When I went to bed on the night before, the shutters was up, and all safe, and these shoes and boots were in the window. Smith had a blue coat on, out at the elbows; Durham had a green coat on, and Rider had a witish coloured jacket on. The same morning I gave a description of their dresses to the officers. They were taken at about twelve o'clock. It was not day-light; it was getting day-light.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Durham. What part of the shop were you standing in, when you pretend you saw the colour of the coats?</p>
               <p>Witness. I was not standing at all; I was sitting on a chair just opposite the window.</p>

I was disturbed at rather better than half past six, by the last witness; he knocked at my room door, and said that thieves were breaking in. When I came down, I found that the shutter was put on one side, and a pane of glass was broken; five pairs of shoes were gone, and one pair of woman's boots; the value was three pounds two shillings; I made them at that price, and they were worth full that. The boy described the dress, and the prisoners to me. They were taken in consequence of that description. When they were taken at about twelve o'clock, their dresses they had on,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060016"/>corresponded with that description. I had seen them for nine or ten months up and down the street and the neighbourhood in company together. When the boy alarmed me, he described that he knew them all; he said, one had a blue coat on, out at the elbows, and he said, another had a light jacket on, and the third had a green coat.</p>
               <p>JURY. You say you have been in the habit of seeing them up and down for the last nine or ten months; do you mean in the same dresses - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Durham. Could you, if you had been in the place of the boy, distinguish the different colours of persons coats, between blue and green, or any other colour - A. I believe I could distinguish the difference between blue and green.</p>

            . I was with the last witness, and was present when the prisoners were taken. The elbows of Smith's coat were out. The house is known better by the name of Black Hell than the Princess of Wales; it is a notorious house, where thieves resort.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I have got no more to say than that I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Durham's Defence. It is impossible for that lad to swear to the colour of coats, for he could not tell whether it was green, or blue, or black, or any other colour, it was so dark.</p>
               <p>Rider's Defence. The lad swore to me when I had my coat on, and then he afterwards swore to my jacket.</p>
               <p>THE COURT. In re-capitulating the evidence to the Jury, informed them, that if the shutter was removed when it was quite dark, that was a burglary, and not house-breaking in the day time, with which the present indictment charged the prisoners; one of the witnesses has said, that it was not day-light, but getting day-light; that was when they were taken the property. It must have been a very short time previous, that the shutter was removed, but still there was a doubt as to its being day-light at the time of the breaking. In all cases where a doubt existed, and more particularly in cases of life and death, the prisoner ought to have the full benifit of that doubt. -Another question would arise as to the value of the property stolen, for if they should think that the property was worth forty shillings, it would be still a capital offence.</p>

            . I saw the two prisoners, and watched them, on Thursday, about four-o'clock in the afternoon; I saw them at the end of Rathbone place, with another young man with them; Bird was looking in at a shop door; the other two were standing at the corner of Rathbone place; Holmes had a bag under his arm. They crossed over, and went to the opposite side of Oxford road; then the prisoner Bird went to a shop door that was shut; he opened the door, and walked away; a woman came to the door. They then turned back, and went to the end of Rathbone place, and went into Percy street, and thence to Tottenham-court-road, and then up Hanway street, across Oxford street, into Soho square, and then they went through a number of streets, and at last we traced them to the house of the prosecutors; Bird walked backwards and forwards before the door a number of times; he several times went to Holmes, who was standing at the corner of Boswell-street; the prisoner Holmes then came with him; they stood talking together three or four minutes at the door of Davis and Taylor, then Bird took the bag from Holmes, and Holmes laid hold of the cotton; he stood at the door, and pulled it from the shop; I did not see him in the shop. Bird then followed Holmes as he was walking away. There was a young man with me all the time; he ran forward, and seized Holmes, asking him what he had got there? he replied, what he had got, he picked up. I told him he had not, and Bird interfered, by laying hold of his collar, and saying, what he had got, he picked up. I told Bird be had better be quiet, or we would lay hold of him. We then took Holmes into Davis's shop, and Bird followed us to the door. I told the young man in the shop there was another chap in company with the prisoner at the time of his commiting the robbery, and he said, he ought to be taken also. An officer was sent for, who searchen Holmes, and I told him Bird was outside, and he went out, and took him.</p>

I did not say before the magistrate that I was not sure of Bird; it was getting dark; they were lighting the lamps. We waited until the young man in the shop said Bird should be taken, before we took him.</p>

On the night of the 20th, he was not in bed with me; I heard some silver fall from the bed to the floor; I was just got into bed; I was not asleep; it was about a quarter before eleven. I felt on the bed, and there was silver there also. I kept my clothes in a box, in this room; this box was not locked. I searched my box, and missed two coats and a pair of trowsers. I had had six shillings worth of silver in the pocket of the trowsers; the silver which I found on the bed and on the floor was that which I had in the pocket. I had seen the prisoner going up stairs at about four o'clock that afternoon. I did not see him after that. He had lodged three or four weeks in the house. I valued the two coats at two pounds ten shillings, and the trowsers at ten shillings; I had not worn them much; they stood me in ten pounds five shillings when I purchased them. I can't tell rightly how long I had worn them.</p>

Between eleven and twelve o'clock, on the 4th of December, Mrs. Walker was sitting in the parlour, and said, she heard something fall in the shop. I immediately looked, and saw a piece of flannel laying on the ground; I was in the shop; at the same time I missed a piece of bed tick; I did not see any person in the shop at all. I ran out, and turned into East street, and saw the prisoner running with something under his arm, and under his coat; I called stop thief, and ran after him; I got within two or three yards of him, and then he dropped the tick; I picked it up; he ran about twenty yards further, and was stopped by somebody else. That tick was on a stool inside the shop door, at about two feet from the shop door; the flannel which was knocked down, was on the same stool. That is all I know. The tick is here, and is worth thirty shillings; that is the buying price. (Tick produced.) That is my tick.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along the street, and heard a cry of stop thief, and I ran; I never had the tick in my possession at all.</p>
               <p>THE COURT, after summing up the evidence to the Jury, resolved the case as follows for their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060018"/>consideration. "I then asked the witness as to the situation of the ticking in the shop; he said it was inside the shop, about two feet from the door. If you are satisfied that the prisoner is the person who had the tick in his possession, and dropped it on being pursued, it is then for you to say, whether that is conclusive evidence of his having stolen it; and then, (this being a capital charge,) only one question will remain for your consideration, namely, whether the situation of the tick was such that a person coming by, could snatch it without going into the shop, for that would not be privately stealing in the shop."</p>

There a gown of mine, worth seven shillings and sixpence; also a waistcoat, worth one shilling and sixpence. When I returned to the house, I did not at first find the prisoner, but I looked about, and found him in the pigeon loft; that is over the coal or hen house; when I discovered him, he dropped down, and I went and took him; he was laying in the pigeon loft as if he was asleep, and as soon as he saw me, he dropped down into the coal house, on the coals. He did not attempt to make his escape, nor did he make any resistance whatever. I said, John, you are a very bad boy. I was acquainted with him before; he said, if I would let him go, he would go to sea, and I should never see him any more. I took him into the front kitchen, and sent for my servant man, his name is

The prisoner lodged in that house for three weeks before the 15th of October, he slept in the same room with me. My brother and I have the house between us, it is a small house which we rent from my mother; it belongs to both of us. The prisoner got up between eight and nine on the morning of the 15th, which was Sunday. He got up and went out of the house; I was very ill in bed; I had asked the prisoner to get me a letter to go into the hospital. When I got up, I missed my watch and seals; I gave seven pounds for them, and I suppose they were worth three. I did not see him for a fortnight after that. I saw him in about a fortnight at the White Horse cellar, and I asked him what he thought of himself for taking my property, he made no answer but said in a very slow voice which could scarcely be heard,he was sorry; he told me he had pledged them, and said he would take me to a place where I could get the duplicate; I got them I think in Beaufurt buildings Marylebone; she went with me there. I found the things at a pawnbroker's, I think the name is Baylis. The prisoner told me that a woman pawned them for him; he did not tell me her name then, but afterwards he did.</p>

I had occasion to go to the larder for something, and heard the cry of stop thief; and at the same time perceived a bladder of lard, a half quartern loaf, and a plate of meat on the area steps. When I had gone to the larder a few minutes previous, I had locked it, I am sure; and left the key in the door. This larder is in the area fronting the area steps, and is affixed to the house; but is not a part of it. There is no internal communication from the dwelling house to it.</p>

I observed three boys loitering about, and as they were suspicious looking characters, I determined to watch them. I live at No. 7, and rang our bell to tell my fellow servants to be careful. I saw the prisoner at the bar come twice up to the area steps of Mr. Sorr's house. The other boys were out in the street. I saw him bring first a plate, and then the lard and loaf, and lay them on the area steps. The area gate was shut. He saw me looking at him, and jumped over the area rails. stumbed at the other side of the way, and ran off. I ran after him, and the other two knocked me up against the railings at the other side of the way, whilst I hallooed stop thief. The prisoner was taken soon after. I pursued him and took him.</p>

            . I am partner of Mr. Sweeney's. I have nothing to do with the proprietorship of the house. At about twenty minutes before eleven in the night of the 15th of November, I was at work in the dye house; I heard the door bang, upon which I went forward into the street, and saw two or three men with a carpet, which they immediately, dropped, and ran away. That carpet was Mr. Sweeney's. Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney were in bed. I called Haines, who was at work with me; I did not run after these people; I waited a minute or so, and the prisoner passed me and went into the shop door way, and came out again directly; I said here is one of them, and he said, yes, certianly I am one of them; take care of me now you have got me. I did so, and delivered him to the watchman: I am not sure he was one of those who had hold of the carpet.</p>

We saw them attempting gentlemen's pockets; they hurstled a gentleman, and I saw Collins take a handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket; I was within half a yard of them; they were all three together. I then lost both them and the gentleman. The next time I saw the prisoners, was on the return of the procession; I then observed them at the corner of King street, Cheapside; they were attempting to pick pockets then. We watched them until the procession had nearly got in; they then went down Trump street, King street, into Lawrance lane, and took handkerchiefs out of their pockets, and put them round their necks; I saw Allsop in particular; I found three round his neck, and three in his pocket. I then saw Collins had one, and a pair of gloves, in his pocket. The other prisoner had nothing upon him. (Produces the handkerchiefs.)</p>

I observed them during nearly three quarters of an hour. I saw them put their hands into many pockets round the carriage. I was obliged to go after some others. I saw them again when the procession came from Westminster, between three and four; they were then altogether, and hustling. I left them, whilst I went to apprehend some others.</p>

We then followed them to the gate of Guildhall yard, and then we took Allsop at the corner of Cateaton street; he said, he had no handkerchiefs, and we found three round his neck, and three in his pocket.

I in consequence of a suspicion, marked a piece of silver wire, on the 10th of November, and gave it to a person named Davis. The prisoner was at work as usual that day; I saw him at about seven o'clock. I saw him on the 11th; I asked him whether he had any flat edges over, after the work he had been appointed to do was completed;(that was some which we had marked;) he said, no; he had had a piece of Mr. Davis, which was just sufficient for the required purpose, and no more. I then sent for Davis, and asked him how much he had given him, and then it appeared by the quantity given him, and the work done, there must have been a considerable remainder. The prisoner then said, he believed there was a little bit over, and it was in his can. We had searched the can, and there was none there, and we told him so. He then said, it was on the board. I told him it so unfortunately had happened, that we had searched both can and board, and there was none about either. I then sent for an officer. I gave him to understand that, I had done so. A few minutes afterwards, he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out the wire, rolled up, for the more convenience for putting into his pocket; I observed my mark very plainly upon it.</p>

            . I am a journeyman to the prosecutor. On the 10th of November last, I received some silver from the prosecutor, for the purpose of my keeping it in my can until I should want it. I gave the prisoner four case edges and four flat edges in the afternoon of the 11th they were marked. He could not have completed the work for which they were necessary until the following; morning. In the evening, Mr. Jackson asked the prisoner. If there was any of the flat edges left, and he said, there was a bit, which was in his can. I had not seen the can. I had seen the board, and it was not there, when he said it was. After a time he produced a piece out of his pocket; one of the pieces which I had delivered to him that day. Mr. Jackson asked him for the rest, and in a little time he produced more, in all, about two ounces and a quarter.</p>

In consequence of something that he told me, and some direction which he gave me, I ordered both the prisoners up stairs, and asked each of them if they knew anything of a tea caddy which was missing;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060023"/>and they both denied any knowledge of it. I then desired them both to come up into their bed rooms, and also the footman, in order that he might be a witness to all that passed. The prisoner Gummer was the first person I desired to let me see her clothes, that was to open her box; she did so, and to my great supprise, it was nearly empty; I found nothing in it, which I claimed. I enquired where her clothes were, and she informed me in the drawer; by my orders, she turned the contents of the drawers out. I found a plain muslin cap belonging to my mother; that is not in the indictment. I found no other property of mine in these drawers. Then I told West to open her trunk. She unlocked it, and the first thing that presented itself, belonged to one of my children; several other things I saw in her trunk, peices of muslin; but I did not count the number. Then she put her hand into the centre of the box, and took out the tea caddy, for which I had been enquiring; it was a tortoise shell caddy, and I had had it about a year; I don't really suppose it is worth more than twenty shillings. She said, there is your caddy ma'am, and I have no more of your property in my possession. She was then going to close her trunk, when I desired a further search. I found various articles which are mentioned in the indictment, and which will be produced. The twelve yards of lace, valued at twelve pounds, was not found. There was a great quantity of baby linen, and various small articles. I did not send for a constable until after some conversation had taken place. Whether these things were taken all at one time, or at various periods, I cannot tell.</p>

I was employed in removing part of the things from the house at Parson's Green, to Walham Green. When my mistress came on the 10th, she made some enquiry respecting a hat, which I had had to brush. When I looked for it, I found it was missing, from a shelf in the pantry where I had put it. I told my mistress I could not find it, and she ordered the two prisoners up stairs. I have heard the account my mistress has given of what took place then, and it is perfectly right.</p>

Last Friday, the 1st of December, the articles mentioned in the indictment were in the front parlour; I saw them in the parlour safe in the basket about ten minutes before I missed them. There are other lodgers in the house, and the street door generally stands open. I went down at near five in the evening into the kitchen, to get some water, leaving my children in the room. I heard a foot in the passage, and heard one of my children cry out mother; I ran up stairs immediately, and then the basket and its contents were gone. The things were in the basket, and must have been taken at the same time.</p>

He had not been ten minutes, nor so long as that. The prisoner was dressed like a blacksmith, and the man gave the basket of clothes to him. One of them gave me a smack on the head, and one of the others said, take him into custody Jack, and put him into the watchhouse; meaning him to take me up. They ran away, and I told the prosecutrix. The next time I saw the prisoner was at Lambeth Street office; I had given a description of him.</p>

            . I am an officer, belonging to Lambeth street office, I know the boy who has just given evidence. The woman came to the office, on the apprehension of the prisoner and the boy came with her, and described the prisoner before he saw him, as appearing like a blacksmith, and a long brown great coat, and walking lob sided. The prisoner's person certainly answered taht description; and he has a kind of roll in his walk. We have not found any of the property.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, Church street, St. Gile's. I do not rent the whole house, I live in the back parlour. Yesterday, for the first time, I heard of the prisoner's apprehension; he sent for me, because he slept with me, last Friday night was a week. He came from his mother. to whom I owed a little money; and as I could not make it up that night, he staid with me until the next morning, when I could get it for him. I am a barrow woman. The messuage to attend here, was left at my house. I met his mother at Billingsgate the next morning, and gave her the money.</p>
               <p>THE COURT, in summing up the evidence to the Jury, told them that the first point which was necessary for their strict attention, was the evidence of the last witness, who was called in the part of the defence; she had been called by the prisoner to substantiate the place which he had set up of alibi, and which was either the best or the worst of defences. Best, if the manner of the witness who was called to establish it, was given in such a manner as to clear up every doubt and abolish every suscipion entertained against the prisoner; but worst, if the contrary. To the evidence of this woman, apposed that of the boy, who not only speaks now that the prisoner is before him, to the identity of his person, but gave such a description of him before he had had opportunity of seeing him after his apprehension, as in the mind of the officer to whom it was given, corresponded with the prisoner's person, and particularly of his taste. In this case, the woman in, which the conflicting evidence was given opposite witnesses, was the chief thing to be examined. If any doubt, in favour of the prisoner, should be cleared up in the mind of the Jury, then their consideration would be turned to value. Unfortunately, they had not an opportunity of judging of it themselves, by the production of the stolen property, in the absence of which they had but the value as described by the prosecutrix; and which did not very far exceed that amount which was required by the stalute to make this a capital felony.</p>

The prisoner at the bar came to the door, and asked the price from the boy of pickling wallnuts; she was told four shillings a hundred. The boy brought her into the shop, she wanted some cauliflowers. Then I stepped out of the parlour, and she had the wallnuts and cauliflowers in the shop; that is the boy had them ready to go with her. She asked for change of a two pound note, with a bill and receipt, and said that the people over the way were so very sorry that her mistress had left off dealing with them, she asked for two quarts of white currants, and four pottles of raspberries for table. I told her I did not think I had any that was fit for table, but I would endeavour to get some; she said they were not for that days dinner, but for the next. She told me to make out the bill, for her mistress always paid ready money. I asked her where it was? and she said 21, Grosvenor place. I asked her if the name was Madam Tait, and she said, it was. I then called the boy into the parlour, gave him change for a two pound note, deducting the price of the articles, and cautioned him not to let either money or goods go until he had got the two pound note, nor to leave them with the prisoner under any pretence whatever.

            . The prisoner at the bar, first asked me the price of the walnuts; she said her mistress was a very good customer, and used to deal over the way; but they were so saucy that she was obligad to quit them; She then asked me if I knew a boy who wanted a place? this was after I was carrying the things with her; she said it was a very good place; they found them in shoes, and would give four and sixpence a week, and I told her I did not know of any body wanting a place; she then got a little way on, and I was before, she asked for the change; I had the things; she said she wanted to get some tea and sugar for the <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060025"/> company; I gave her the change; she told me to go to 21, Grosvenor place, to get the two pound note, and she said, I might have two or three old pottles for myself, which were under the dresser. I went, and saw the footman in the servant's hall, at 21, and told him I was ordered to bring these things by the cook, and asked for the two pound note; I found it was not there. I went to No. 20, and found it was not there, either. I then asked them to be so good as to let me leave the things, until I went to look for the woman; I went to a grocer's shop in Piccadilly, thinking she might have gone there; but I could hear no tidings of her. I returned, crying, down Piccadilly, and got the things from No. 20, and then went to 30. I had a lettuce to leave at No. 41. I then went to where my father worked; but he was not in the way, and I heard that there was an old French Lady lived at 21, King's road; but it was not there. The Lord Milton's footman looked into the Court List for me; but could find nobody of the name of Madam Tate. I gave the prisoner a one pound note and fourteen shillings.</p>

The prisoner had bought a lot a few minutes before, and paid one shilling and sixpence for it. The bookseller went out to look for the person of whom he spoke; but his search was fruitless. On the 2nd of December, the prisoner bought three lots, amounting to one pound fourteen shillings, and he paid four shillings deposit. When the sale of that day was concluded, I was going out, and was stopped by two booksellers, who were bringing the prisoner up to the sale room, on the first floor; they accused him of having taken a book, and put it into his pocket. I requested him to produce it; at first, he denied having taken it; but, at last, produced it, saying, he purchased it at the sale. I remarked that that could not be the case, as the book was the "Polite Philosopher," and had not been sold. He was then taken to Bow-street, and I gave him in charge of an officer, and requested he might be searched immediately; to this he made so violent a resistance, that it required four persons to do it. In the scuffle he put some duplicates into his mouth, which he chewed to pieces. They succeeded in taking seven from him, which contained twelve books, my property.</p>

               <p>Mr. Andrews, as counsel for the prisoner, called a great number of witnesses to establish the prisoner's insanity; and from their evidence, it appeared that the unfortunate man had on several occasions combined drugs together to make a panacea as he supposed for all diseases, and had taken them himself, and had most materially injured his constitution, by producing a discharge of bloody urine. He had also appeared to have conceived himself contractor for the illumination of Charlton House; he was engaged by Government to go from the Downs to Brest, and burn the French Fleet. That he could turn old boots and shoes into new, and various other extravagancies, which clearly proved that at times, he laboured under mental derangement.</p>

On Thursday, the 2nd of November, he was in my house almost the whole day; he had not a good deal of liquor to my knowledge, none at all, that I knew of; at a quarter past ten o'clock, I was in the bar, and heard a noise in the tap room; I went in, and saw the prisoner standing in a kind of fighting posture; but I did not see any fighting. I took hold of the prisoner, and pulled him out of the tap room, telling him at the same time, that if he would not be peaceable, I would send him to the watchhouse; I left him outside in the passage after I pulled him out of the tap room. I then returned into the tap room, and saw the deceased sitting upon a bench; he did not appear to have received any injury; I saw no blood nor any thing about his face; he staid some time after that in the house; I saw him go out at the door with the woman he lives with, and he said, good night to you all; he left my house at about eleven o'clock, and soon after I sent a lodger to see him, and after, that news arrived that he was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. I heard a noise like a quarrell. I did not see that the deceased was hurt at all; I neither saw blood nor any marks upon him.

            . I was in this house on that night; I was in the tap room; I saw the prisoner there; there was a girl there also. The girl and the deceased's woman were quarrelling together. I saw the prisoner and the deceased's girl quarrelling, and the prisoner said, have you any one to take your part, he said that to the deceased's girl. Then the deceased came out of his seat where he sat, and struck the prisoner; then they fought together about five or ten minutes; neither of them fell; then the deceased gave in. Then they went out and came in again in about ten minutes. Then the deceased wanted to shake hands with him and make it up, and the prisoner hit him over the left temple. He would have fallen, only somebody caught him and put him in the the seat. He looked very pale, and appeared very bad indeed; some water was got to wash his face with, but I can't say whether he fainted or not. He appeared better after that. and went out in about a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I live in Bell alley, St. Catherines. The deceased lived in the same house with me. I was in this tap room of this public house. The woman who belongs to the prisoner, was quarrelling with another young woman; and the prisoner knocked me down, and Torvick took my part. He took hold of the prisoner, and shoved him, and they fought together, but not much. The prisoner struck the deceased in his left temple, and he fainted with that blow. Some water was thrown in his face, and he got better after that, and I went home with him. After he recovered, he said he should have a black eye, and that would prevent him getting into the hospital. He sat down when he got home, but never spoke after he sat down. He opened his eyes, and fell off the chair dead. He had not been in the house more than a minute, when he fell off the chair dead.</p>

I opened his head, but could discover no marks that I could naturally suppose was the occasion of his death. His head was in a natural state; and I believe his death was occasioned by an apoplexy.</p>

The door of the adjoining house was open, and I and Thomas Foy went through No, 7, into its<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060027"/>garden. The garden of No. 7, is separated from that of No. 8, by a small low fence. I left Plank and

             in the street, and desired them when I got through, to knock at the door, and get admittance that way. When we were in No. 7, we heard the same noise. I got over the fence, and into the prisoner's garden. The whole back of the prisoner's shop, at the back part of the house, is a window, and looks into this garden. I saw all the prisoners, at that part of the shop where the press is. The candles were lighted, but I could not immediately see how they were employed; but they were all at the press. I went into the shop by a door which goes from the garden. My brother went in with me. At that time there had been a knocking at the front door, but I did not hear it. When I went in at the shop door, William Bagnell the elder went into the kitchen; he attempted to pass one of the front kitchen door, but finding it secure, and finding some one there, he return'd into the shop where I was. We took the three prisoners into custody, and as soon as my brother took hold of William he threw down a quantity of dollars; I saw him throw them down; there were six in number; they were perfect dollars; I marked them, and gave them to Mr. Westwood. In taking the father into custody, I was about to search him; he had his hand clinched, I opened it, and found four dollars on him in that hand (dollars put into the hands of the witness. Those are the four dollars I found in the hand of the father. Those are the six thrown away by William Bagnell the younger. Then I searched the shop, and found a stamping press; the lower dye of which bearing a matrix of the King's head, was fixt; I parted it, at the same time I found that the collar was on.(Articles put into the hands of the witness.) This is the upper, and this is the lower dye; the collar fits them. The use of the collar is to prevent the mettle spreading in stamping. From the appearance of the press altogether, it is my opinion that it had been working previously, and from the upper dye being warm, I think it had been just struck. On the press I found a spanish dollar, with the original impression upon the sides and edges, obliterated apparently by a file or some such instrument; that would inable the impression to be made with more facility. There was an iron tray, in which were thirty two Spanish dollars similarly prepared From the appearance with which it was working, when we heard it, there must be three persons at work at it. The principal upon which it is worked is this. - An immense weight is raised by two persons, and then let go, after the manner of a pile-driver, upon the dyes, and thereby occasions the impression to be made on the piece of metal between them. This weight is raised by a rope going over a wheel, and a third person feeds the dyes, that is, puts in the blank metal, and takes out that which has the impression. Plank and my other brother had come in at the front at the same time. The father said I hope you will observe, we are only stamping Spanish dollars, and hoped his case would be represented as favourable as possible; and said, that if his giving up the persons who employed him would be of any service, he would do that willingly. We apprehended all three and brought them away, with the press and all the other things,</p>

            , I am engraver to the Bank. I look at the dollars, and the dyes, and these dollars are made from the dyes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley, on the part of the prisoners, objected that the offence with which the prisoners were charged, was not the one contemplated by the statute; because that was to prevent persons for counfeiting five shilling dollars-when in fact, this was counterfeiting five and sixpenny dollars; and therefore this offence did not come within the letter of the statute. A similar punishment was alloted to persons convicted of coining three shilling, and eighteen penny bank tokens. Suppose the bank chose to issue the one for three shillings and six-pence; the other for one shilling and ninepence; after such nominal value, could the counterfeiter be punishable under the act as it now stood? unquestionably, in the learned counsels opinion-not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry, on the same side stated, that in the preamble of this statute, the bank appeared to think it necessary to recite their authority for assigning three shilling and eighteen penny tokens, by doing so; and he objected that it had not shewn its authority for issuing five and six penny dollars; and the case of the prosecution being closed, they were now excluded from doing.</p>
               <p>COURT. We will first dispose of the objection taken by the latter gentleman.</p>
               <p>It is not material upon the present occasion, for the bank to shew their authority for affixis ng a nominal value of five shillings and sixpence to the dollar; and it is merely an engagement on its part with the public, to give that sum for the dollar. In respect of the first objection taken, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060028"/>the indictment charges the prisoners with making and coining, and acting and assisting in such making and coining pieces of coin, resembling certain silver dollars coined, &amp;c. by the governor and company of he bank of England, containing certain impressions; which the indictment recites, and in the indictment of which consists the offence aimed at by the statute, and therefore the value nominal, or real, has nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Bagnell the elder defence, now put in a written defeuce, most solemnly denying any intention to defraud the bank; but stating that he had been employed by a person named Goldston, to immitate a certain coin which that person gave him, which though in a degree it resembled, was not so like the bank dollar, or for any one to be deceived by it. This he immitated, and it was in its impression considerably different from the bank dollar; he further agreed that it was a well known fact, that he as a dye sinker, and every man in his profession, with equal case, had he been fraudently inclined, could copy most correctly the impression upon genuine dollars; and he concluded by endeavouring to exculpate his sons from any blame in the matter.</p>
               <p>A number of witnesses were then called to character.</p>
               <p>THE COURT then summed up the evidence for the jury, and informed them, that it was immaterial for this charge, what the mettal or composition was of, which the counterfeit coins were made.</p>

I lived servant with Solomon, on the 15th of last month; I saw the prisoner that evening; he came into Solomon's house between six and seven o'clock in the evening, with a deal box; he put it down in the middle of the room, and said, "he had made a bloody smash." The first thing he pulled out, was a blue pelisses; he said he should keep that for his girl. My master, Solomon, was at home then, and gave him a one pound note for them. I knew the man twice before; he had been at our house at about four o'clock on the day of the robbery, eating a herring.</p>

When I got home with her, I thought it too little, and gave her seven shillings extra. We had some spirits to drink, and we then went up stairs, and I began to undress myself, and she took three three shilling bank tokens out of my waistcoat pocket; I did not care a b-r about the silver, and therefore she might have it. I put my clothes under the pillow, and she under a pretence of adjusting it, took the two one pound notes out of my pocket; instantly she flew down stairs. I did not think it safe to pursue her, not knowing who might be below, as perhaps there might be a combined party, who would take my clothes too. I reported it to the landlady, and she gave me leave to stay all night. When it was day light in the morning, I took down the number of the house, and the name of the alley, and observed, that exactly opposite the chamber window, there was the sign board of one Locke, a carpenter.

We waited there all the day, and in the evening, sure enough she came; we then apprehended her, and had her taken into custody. I am positive as to her person; I was quite sober.</p>

I was in his company the evening previous to the robbery, and therefore he came to me the first thing in the morning. I went with him to the house at the corner of Short street, and waited with him until the prisoner came in; we then gave her in charge of Mr. Harding, the City constable.</p>

In consequence of that, two persons were apprehended, and from information they gave, the prisoner, Wilson, was apprehended. A dispute took place at the examination of the prisoner, between himself and a person named Joseph, who was apprehended as a receiver; it was a dispute as to the price which Joseph gave, and the prisoner received for the stolen hats."Joseph said, he paid ten shillings a piece to the prisoner for them, and the prisoner said, he only received eight shillings for each hat."</p>

            . On the 24th of November, I apprehended the prisoner; I searched him, and found a five pound note, a one pound note, and a silver watch, which I delivered to Mr. Hick, in the presence of the Lord Mayor, to give to the prisoner's wife</p>
               <p>Mr. Hick. I was present during this dispute which took place between the prisoner and Joseph. The dispute was whether Joseph had paid the prisoner ten shillings or eight shillings a piece for the hats."Joseph said he paid ten shillings, and the prisoner said, he only received eight shillings for those he had sent on the Friday morning, and he had given him one in." I reside in this house; it is my dwelling house.</p>

            . I was in the employ of Messrs. Oliver and Hibber, I was sent by them to sleep in the house where the goods were, at No.129, Wood street on the 2nd of December. I used to go to the house about every hour. I went at about five o' clock on the evening of the 2nd of December, and found the locks fast, and all was quite secure. I went at about a quarter past six the same evening, and found the padlocks and binges wrenched off the door, and the door shut quite close to. I opened the door gently and heard somebody on the premises, I immedaitely pulled it to, and held it quite close. As soon as I had done that, some person who was inside tried to pull the door open. I put my feet against the door post and held the hasp tight, and called for assistance; all this time the person inside was pulling the door trying to get out. That pulling tore the skin off my hand, and hurt me a good deal. As soon as assistance came which was Mr. Weller, and the person inside finding he could not get out, he bolted the doors, as we should not get in. As soon as we found the door was bolted, I asked some one to go to the next door for not to let them go to the top of their house, and I requested somebody else to get an iron crow, to break open the door; I requested all this so loud, that the person inside might hear it. In about three minutes, the person inside unbolted the door, and endeavoured to come out, when Mr. Weller seized him by the collar, and I likewise by the jacket. We forced him back into the warehouse, and there were lights brought immediately; it was the prisoner. We then found the articles named in the indictment, missing, and there were three pieces of bombasin lying on the floor; I had seen them myself on a temporary shelf which was made shortly before. It was quite dark when I went to the house at five o'clock, and saw it safe, and this was at six; I afterwards examined the door, to see whether it had been forced or not, and there were the marks of a chissel, or small iron crow. The hasps were on the door, and the staples were found out, and the locks were forced off, at the side of the door, and gone. I had seen an hackney coach as I came down the street at a quarter past six, a little way from the premises; I did not see it driven away, but it was gone as soon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060031"/>as I came out for the purpose of informing my employers.</p>

At about six o'clock I had occation to go into the Cross Keys yard, and on my return, I saw the coach door open, and the coachman giving something white, to what I conceived to be a female inside the coach, but that I am not certain. I went in doors, and took no more notice afterwards, until about a quarter after five, when I heard a cry of thieves! I went over and found the young man and Mr. Weller holding the door. They requested me to get a light, which I immediately did, but in crossing the road, A biew out; in the mean time somebody brought one from the Cross Keys booking office. When I came out, hearing a cry of thieves, the coach was at the door, but when I came out of the house after assisting in searching it from top to bottom, the coach was gone.</p>

             found one on the top, covered over with two or three pieces; we did not move it; but waited to see who would come and fetch it. We watched that pile by turns. Roebuck and I were on a stack together, and saw the prisoner go by; the prisoner walked by, and looked round towards the stack as he passed. The next time I saw him was at a quarter before four, and then he was looking round, evidently to see if any one was on the watch for him, or looking at him. He then got upon the stack and looked round again; we were concealed. He then moved two pieces of wood with his left hand, and laid hold of the box with his right; I jumped down immediately and went and seized him. This stack was about four feet high; he said he had got up there to ease himself; there is a privy within forty yards. He could not have seen the box on the top of the stack passing by because it was concealed with two pieces of fustic wood; he let the box drop before we seized him.</p>

            . We reside at No. 81, Watling Street. in the month of October last, we packed up some goods for Surinam. We packed up two excise trunks on the 7th. and another on the 10th. In the trunks on the 7th. were ginghams in No. 1, and shawls in No. 2. In No, 3, on the 10th there were handkerchiefs and six pieces of cot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060032"/>ton cambrick. These goods were to be shipped for Surinam, in the ship Henry, Captain Mosely, and we employed Messrs. Jacklyn and Williams, as our lightermen. On the 30th of October, these goods were taken from our warehouse to Galley Quay, where I went and saw them on the 31st, in consequence of some information which was given me. They were not then in the state we sent them. The exterior matting was nailed in a very slovenly manner, and they had every appearance of having been opened. When we sent them, they were all locked, and the key of each fastened to the handle by a string, and nailed with small tacks. In consequence of this change of appearance, we opened the trunks to examine them; and found they were evidently plundered; about a third part of each were gone.</p>

            . I am the foreman to Messrs Jacklyn and Williams. In consequence of orders which I received, I gave some directions to Flygar. On Tuesday morning the 31st of October I saw him going down the river on the upper side of Execution Dock, in a skiff of ours; he had the three trunks in question, and a tilt in that skiff. I stept into that skiff and ordered him back. I perceived the mats of one of the trunks was quite loose, in consequence I put them into another boat, and took them to Galley Quay to remain there until we sent to Mr. Wilcock. In consequence Mr. Wilcock came down, and I was present when they were reexamined.</p>

            . I am a lighterman, in the employment of Messrs Williams and Jacklyn. On the Monday the 30th of October last, I received the directions to take them to Blackwall, and ship them on board the Henry, Captain Mosley, I had two ships goods to take. The vessels on board of which they were to be shiped, were lying at Limehouse. Which is short of Blackwall, if I should have time that night; but if not time, I was to bring them back to Gally Quay. I left Galley Quay, at about half past three. I delivered the two ships goods at Limehouse, and then proceeded towards Blackwall. In consequence of something which passed between me and a person named Spendlove, he came on board me after I had passed Limehouse, he brought a chisel with him, which he said, he would have brought; that chisel was to open the trunks. As we were going along, one of trunks was opened by Spendlove; something was taken out, which he asked me to fell, saying, he thought they were silk shawls. They were some shawls and some muslins. Spendlove and I agreed to go to Gates's; but before that, we were to go to Rammages's; Rammage occupies a public house, close by the engine house, at Blackwall, close to the River; at high water, you can step from his back door into a boat. Spendlove went on shore first; he took something, the contents of the trunk with him. Spendlove came back to me, and then I went on shore. I went into Rammage's by this back door, and saw him at the bar. I went up two pair of stairs into a room, by his direction; presently Brown came up, and Rammage came up afterwards. When they were both there, twenty-nine shawls and about eight or nine pieces of muslin were produced; they were up stairs in this room; I did not see who brought them up; I brought some up; I brought shawls; Spenlove had taken muslins. I, Brown, and Rammage, looked over the things Spenlove and I had brought. Rammage said, they were rubbishing things, and were going out to the Negroes in the West Indies. I don't know whether Rammage knew me; he knew I was a lighterman. I knew Brown before; he was a <rs id="t18151206-55-deflabel311" type="occupation">rigger</rs>

                        targets="t18151206-55-defend574 t18151206-55-deflabel311"/>. Spendlove came up, and he asked Brown what he thought of them; Brown said, he did not know what to think of them; but if he had them at home, he should be a better judge. Spendlove told him to determine something about them; he said, he did not know what to determine; he had only a five pound note in his pocket, and if he wanted money, he could have that. Spendlove and I came down. Rammage left the room before we came down; he did not say any thing. We first went into a lower room; but Rammage took us into a room over head, because he said there were some mates of East Indiamen below us, and they might hear us. Mackarel, (not in custody,) was then taking care of the boat, whilst I and Spenlove were in the house. I met Mackarel in the passage of Rammages's house, as I was going up; in consequence of what he said to us, I saw the prisoner, Ridgeway; Ridgeway and Mackarel had some private conversation together, and then I and Mackarel went down again from the house to the lug-boat; we took a lighted pipe of tobacco; when we came to the back door, the lug-boat was gone; in consequence of something that had been told us, I expected that I should find it along side Mr. Nott's barge; Ridgeway and Hastings worked for Mr. Nott. The barge was about a quarter of a mile from Rammage's house. I was taken in a skift belonging to Messrs. M.Kenzie and Grey, for whom Mackarel worked. I found the lug-boat along side the empty barge; when I came on board the barge, Hastings came out of the barge cabin. I also found Spendlove and Ridgeway in the cabin of the barge; two of the trunks were in the lug-boat, and the third was in the cabin of the barge; it was taken there in my absence.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060033"/>Mr. Reynolds. My Lord, I am for Hastings. Does your lordship think that my friends on the others side are entitled to give evidence of more than one felony. He has given complete evidence of one committed by the witness and him, Spenlove, who is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. I must hear the whole; because if there be two felonies, as you say, I must see whether they are connected or not.</p>
               <p>Witness, Re-examined. There was a light on the cabin, and a tilt over the cabin head, which was to prevent the light from being seen. I found one trunk in the cabin of the barge, which had been opened, and the goods were laying on the cabin seat. When the goods had been taken out, the matting was nailed over again; Ridgeway drove the tacks. That trunk was put back into my boat, and another taken out, and put into the barge. That trunk was the trunk which had been opened before; I was not in the cabin at that time. I remained out with Hastings, and was in my own boat along side; I did not hear them at work inside. Then I saw Spendlove with some pieces of dark blue paper in his hand, and he said, they were cambricks; he said, they would do very well. Then that trunk was nailed, and put back into the boat, and the third was put into the barge; it had red shawls or handkerchiefs in it. There was a man came to take away a sailing barge, to which Nott's barge was moored; that was while I was outside. Spendlove said, that he had taken shawls out, and they would do very well. After the sailing barge was moved, we made Nott's barge fast to lighter. Spendlove said, that he had made the trunks up, and had made all correct. The end of one of the trunks was uncovered, and I told Spendlove of it, in the hearing of the others; he said, I would see to that in the morning, and put some tacks in. The last trunk was opened whilst I was away with Hastings, in getting up his anchor; I was gone about a quarter of an hour, and when I came back, the trunk was replaced. Then Spendlove and Ridgeway went up with the barge. Mackarel had gone in his skiff while I was away. Hastings went up Bow Creek with a loaded barge. Spendlove and Ridgeway took the things with them. I did not see the goods after I left the cabin. I let my boat drive up with the tide, and put the tarpaulin over the three trunks. I passed Ridgeway and Spendlove off the Folly House; but did not speak to them. I came up to Galley Quay at ten minutes or a quarter before eleven. My trunks remained on board the boat all night, and in the morning, I put them into a skiff, and was going down with them, when Mr. Williams came on board me, and made me turn back. The trunks were then searched in the searcher's office; I was in the searcher's office while they were examined. Mr.

Hastings said she was not going to lay there above a quarter of an hour, for she was going to lay astern of the vessel which was astern of the yacht to load stone in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall. It never accourred to me to rob these trunks until I saw Spendlove.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by Mr. Gurney. We could not have managed to rob the other trunks without a cabin to couceal us, and a light to see by.</p>

            . I am a lighterman. I know the prisoners Hastings and Ridgeway; Hastings was my apprentice, and the other was in my employ. On the 30th of October, they were ordered by me to go to Bow Crcek, to navigate two barges, to take a loaded one up, and bring an empty one down; the empty barge had a cabin. In going after them, I found the loaded barge in its place; but the empty barge was not in its proper place; nor were the prisoners, Hastings and Ridgeway, to be found. Afterwards I found the empty barge by the lower tier of the town of Blackwall, I saw a skiff made fast to the back door of Rammage's house; I went into Rammage's, and Ridgeway and Hastings were both in one box in the tap room. I took Hastings backwards, and asked him how the barge came to be there in the place where it was? he told me that they brought her down Bow Creek without an anchor or cable, and they were forced to fasten her to a sailing barge; as the flood time came, the sailing barge turned their barge adrift, and he had been in search of her all night, and found her by day light in the morning at Greenwich, and they could not save tide with her any higher than where I found her. I gave them orders to come to Town.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On Tuesday, the 31st of October, I went to Brown's house, in consequence of an information which I received from Flygar; he lives in Wellesley-street, Poplar. I found a piece of muslin and a handkerchief in the passage of the house; Mrs. Browne was in the passage at the time they were picked up. Browne was not at home I also found in the same bundle, a piece of blue print, and four pounds in bank notes, and also some silver. From the information of Flygar, I went to the house of Gates, and found some handkerchiefs, in two separate paper parcels. All these were at Gates's; I found them in a chest of drawers.

I now look at the piece of red Turkey bandanas, commonly called red handkerchiefs; I can swear to them; I can swear they were in box 3.

I watched their motions; I saw them attempting several pockets, and at last they came to a gentleman who had seals. The jew was in front of the gentleman, pressing with his herd and his hands against his breast, and the prisoner was behind the gentleman, with his arms round his waist, and I saw the jew with a hold of the gentleman's seals, with an intent as I supposed, to draw the watch and give it to the prisoner, whose hand was round the gentleman's waist; but they could not succeed, and the jew exclaimed, "dawn the people, how they push." They then left the gentleman about ten yards, and I saw the jew pull a knife from his pocket. They then proceeded to the gentleman again. The jew got in front, and the prisoner behind, as before. I saw the jew's hand in motion, and guesed he was cutting the seals. The jew and the prisoner then quit the gentleman, and the jew gave the prisoner the seals, at about five or six yards from the gentleman. I saw him looking at them; and he put them into his jacket pocket. The prisoner then crossed Cheapside, and I lost sight of the gentleman. We then apprehended them, and the jew rescued himself in Fleet-street, leaving part of his coat in my hand. We then took the prisoner into a wholesale linen draper's shop, and on searching him, we found the seals in the lining of his jacket, behind. On unbuttoning his small clothes, we found this silk handkerchief. (Producing it.)</p>

He then pulled a yellow silk handkerchief out of a man's coat pocket; and the crowd was so great, that it was as much as ever he could do to get it into his pocket. He was then pushed off the pavement, and crossed the road, and I followed him down Cheapside, round St. Paul's Chorch-Yard, until I came into Bridge-Street. It was impossible to get to the man he took the yellow handkerchief from. When he got into Bridge-Street, he look another handkerchief; but what one that was, I cannot tell. I could not get up to him immediately; but in about a quarter of an hour I saw him again. I spoke to Hudson, a brother officer, and told him to be with me at the corner of Water-Lane; from all probability the prisoner would pass us on the return of the procession. He did return pass us, and on seeing us, he bolted across Water-lane into Bridge-Street, and I followed him and took him into custody. We took him into a house, and searched him. In one of his pockets we found a very sharp pair of scissors; we found some handkerchiefs upon him, among which was a yellow one, which I firmly believe to be the one he took at the corner of King-Street.</p>

I could not immediately go after him, being very busy, and obliged to mind the scales; but afterwards I told him if he did not immediately bring it back, I would inform my masters, and have him apprehended. He promised he would bring it back; but he never did. The pork was worth at least one pound I can only guess at the weight, as it had never had been in the scales. I suppose it was about thirty pounds weight.</p>

In consequence of what passed between me and the prisoners, I went with them on the night of the 30th, to get my uncle's coach glasses. There was a man of the name of Banting went with us. As we were going along, Petherick pulled of his great coat, and gave it to Williams, and Willisms took off his jacket and gave it to Petherick. When we got into the coach-house next the dwelling-house, we took a pair of side glasses out of a landaulet, Williams took the glasses. He had a bag with him to put the glasses in. We thought we heard somebody coming down stairs, and went away. Williams put one glass into the bag as he went along Ormond street, and carried the other in his hand. Petherick was standing at the corner to watch. We went with these glasses to Mr. Richards's in Bird-street, which is near Manchester-square. We took them before nine in the evening, as soon as we got in, we were taken into custody.</p>

We went all together to Ormond-yard; but did not go into the coach house. I saw Williams and Pointer running from the mews, with something, which appeared to me like coach glasses. I went into Queensquare, and soon after saw Pointer and Petherick, and asked where Williams was. I went with Petherick and Poynter to Richards's, in pursuance of the plan I had entered into; when I went in. I found Williams in custody, and Poynter and Petherick were taken as well as myself.

The first thing I saw was a coach draw up to Richards's door; Williams got out of it, and knocked at the shutters, and was let in. I went in immediately afterwards, and took him into custody, and the glasses which he had, and then returned out again. The moment Williams saw me, he said, we are sold, they are all coming in half an hour, or rather more.

            . I am a ship-breaker, and live at Brentford. I bought the barge in question from the prisoner, on the 26th of October; he told me he was employed by another person, and was to have ten shillings and six pence commission. I did not ask him whose barge it was; Ovingdon was the name upon it; I agreed to give him seven pounds for it; but only paid him four ready money; she was a very old barge, and I bought her to break up. I have a wharf upon the Thames. That barge was claimed by Mr. Church. The prisoner was to have the rest of the money on the Saturday. I did not see the prisoner again until I went and took him. He did not mention any name at first; but he afterwards told me a man named Smith told him to sell it. He rowed her up to Putney, and told me it was there. I brought it up the river to my wharf.</p>

            , SENIOR. I am an officer, belonging to Hatton Garden office. The prisoner was brought to our office on suspicion of stealing a piece of bacon, and then this thing came against her. I have made every search in my power to recover Mrs. Tippets's things, and could never find them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner set up an alibi in her Defence, but was not established.</p>

The prisoner has a husband, who is a chimneysweeper. I asked her, as she lived next door; she said, she knew nothing of them. I got a search warrant, and found one of the ducks, which I knew to be mine, by some brown feathers on the breast, in the room in which the prisoner was. I had seen some blood spilt by the door of her husband's stable, which is next door to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus. I get my living with a little washing, and a little needle work; I don't let lodgings, even for a short time. My door is not constantly open; my ducks walked the streets; the prisoner's husband has apprentices, and for what I know to the contrary, they might have killed the duck.</p>

I saw the prisoner in my master's premises, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, on the 29th of November; he was then going from the back part of the premises, and had got through the fence. He did not see me until I came up to him; he ran through a gap in the fence, and I secured him setting down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060038"/>when I was getting through. On examining our premises, I found the lead in question wrapped up in an apron in the kitchen; it had been cut from the copper in the washhouse, and then carried into the kitchen. The prisoner said he never had been there.</p>

He went to enquire after the printer in Earl-street, but could not find no such person.

He then went down to his warehouse, and brought it up. He then said, that perhaps I and my brother, who was with me, would like to walk down into his warehouse, and examine it ourselves. We immediately went down, and found a large quantity of our paper there was a portion of Banks's Peerage, a quantity of lberia's Crisis, and a large bundle of Observation on the Cure of Cancer, by Dr. Denman; also about fifty volumes of the works of the Earl of Surry; the works of the Earl of Surry had never been delivered for publication, but the others had. It would cost one hundred and fifty pounds to replace them. The prisoner Francis, described to me that he had purchased it of a boy whom he described so accurately, that I had not the least doubt but that it was the other prisoner at the bar. He said that the boy had told him, he worked for a printer in Earl-street, Blackfriars, and was allowed waste paper, as a perquisite. I went to Francis's house again on the 24th, in company with Read, the officer. The prisoner Francis had entered the house just before us. On turning over some old pamphlets on a shelf in the shop, I discovered two copies of Denman on the Cure of Cancer, stitched, and Francis said he had stitched them for his own reading.</p>

I went to Francis with a hackney coach, to take away the papers, and Francis asked me did I think it necessary for him to go with me to Hatton Garden office?

            . I am an assistant to my father, who is a milkman. I was in West-street, on the 2nd of November, at about half past two. I saw a man get up into Mr. Mill's cart, and take out a box. The prisoner stood at the other side of the way. I was looking at him; he crossed the way, and gave the box to the prisoner, and said, come along, follow me. Then I went, and told Mr. Mills, and Mills went after the prisoner, and collared him, and the other man who had taken it ran away.</p>

I lost this hat on the 31st of October, in the evening, at about five o'clock; I went and snuffed the candles in the window, and the hat was then hanging up safe. In about ten minutes or so, a man came running in, and said, what have you lost, and after I looked, I told him my black hat was gone; that was the only one of that sort I had in the window. He said don't you disturb yourself, you shall see the hat and the thief in ten minutes, and so I did, for he brought them both back, and that is all I have to say.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 31st of October, I observed the three prisoners in Clare-street, Clare-market; I have a knowledge of them, and suspected them as they were standing together; I saw them separate, and go to a cheesemonger's shop, and from their motions, I could perceive that they wanted to steal some cheese, but they could not succeed. I followed them, and saw them attempting at several shops, until they came to Leather-lane, and then I ran down to Hatton Garden office, to get young Read to come and assist me. When I fetched him, we saw the prisoner Bone, attempt to lift off a box of plumbs from a grocer's door, but he could not succeed. While Bone was at the grocer's shop, the other two were walking up and down outside; we then got them into Ayre-street - hill, to the prosecutor's house; Leeson then went into the shop, and the other two went a little lower down. He had not been in a moment scarcely before he came running out, with something in his hand in front of him; I thought it was no use to let them go any further, and so we apprehended them. Peterkin left the other two, with the hat in his hand; Peterkin soon after put the bonnet out of his hand, and I went back and found it stuck upon the railing, at a door where we took him, and I found Bone walking at the bottom of the hill with Leeson.</p>

I saw Leeson go into the shop, and in a moment he ran out down the hill as hard as ever he could, and soon gained the other two, he gained the other two in Warner-street, opposite the public-house; there I saw them hand something, and then they separated; Peterkin went one way, and the other two came towards Ayre-street - hill.

On the 8th of November last I went into the City, to settle a little business with a gentleman, and he paid me one hundred and fifteen pounds, which with the deduction of twenty five pounds expences, left me eighty nine pounds odd. I and this gentleman had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060041"/>been drinking together rather freely, and I left him when I was very much intoxicated. On my return towards home, I met with a desperate fall; by what means, I cannot tell; but I believed I was tripped up. I cannot say who picked me up, nor have I any recollection of any thing that happened until I found myself in Newton-court, Chandos-street. I have some recollection of the female prisoner. When I recovered myself, I found the whole of my property was gone. I got the number of the notes, and got them advertised, and the next day I got some information. I then applied to Bow-street, and went with Mr. Donaldson and Westbrock. The notes were not found.</p>

In consequence of some information, I went to a house in Foster's-buildings, respecting the pair of shoes in question. When I knocked at the door, the prisoner at the bar opened it, but denied all knowledge of the shoes. I sent for a constable, and she begged very hard, saying, if I would not prosecute her, she would tell me where they were. I did not make her any promise at all. She said her mother had got them, and jumped out of a back window over a wall, and upset a water-butt. On coming down stairs, we met the mother, who is a very bad character, in company with another of the same description.</p>

            . On the 28th of November, I was standing at my door, at 153, Howland-street, and I saw the two prisoners pass by with some dusting brushes beetween them; so I thought it proper to follow them. They went up a few steps, and then crossed between the coaches, and then they run. I followed them, and stopped them at the corner of John-street, in Howland-street; I secured one with my right hand, and the other with my left. Radley made his escape, and then come to the watch-house to see the other, when he was detained. I am positive as to both the prisoners.</p>

I put my hand on the table to feel for my watch, where I had left it, and found it was gone. I then got up, and felt about for my clothes, and I found them all safe except my braces. I found twenty shillings were gone out of my left hand waistcoat pocket. I then went to the door, and found it fastened outside. I knew what sort of a neighbourhood I was in, and did not like to make a noise. When it was light, a man came and let me out, and I asked him if he knew anything about the woman, and he said no.</p>

            . The last witness came to me, in company with Parsons, and informed me that he had been robbed of his watch, chain, seals, handkerchief, and braces. I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and knocked at the door, but she refused me admittance; and I told her who I was; I told her I should break open the door, if she did not; and I did break open the door, and she was lying on the bed in her clothes. Between the sacking and the bed. I found this pair of braces. I then told her I must search her person, and on searching it, I found this handkerchief tied round her body, under her clothes.</p>

            . I keep the public-house in which this took place. I heard there was gambling in the tap-room, and I went in, and stopped it, and then they were disputing about a one-pound note; there were two men and a woman in the room. I closed the door, and said nobody should quit the room until it was known who had got the note, and then the prisoner signified that he had got it; after that he denied that he had it a great many times, and so I sent for an officer. After that the pocket-book was missing. I understood that a man and his wife had gone out of the room. Armstrong searched the prisoner; but could find nothing upon him. The prisoner requested to be searched, nothing was found on him.</p>

I followed him, and he tried very much to evade me, and got into the crowd again.

I went after him, and found him. I told him if he would tell me what was become of the watch, I would say no more about it; but he denied any knowledge of it whatever. I got an officer to search him, and the watch was found on him.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to the public office Bow-street, and was in Holborn, at the time the prisoners were secured. I knew their persons perfectly well before that time; I saw them before Mr. Jones came up, on Holborn Hill, and watched them for the space of ten minutes. Just as Mr. Jones got by Hand-court, Turner went up to his pocket, and felt it, and the other covered him; they were both in company together. Turner withdrew for a moment, but they continued following Mr. Jones until he got to Red Lion-street; then Turner went to him again, and 
               <persName id="t18151206-121-person1041">drew</persName>
             a handkerchief out of his pocket, caught it up, and gave it to Perring; at that moment Barrett came up to me; he was following them and watching them, although I did not know it. We apprehended them, and Perring made some resistance, and at that time he dropped the handkerchief.</p>

I had several chests containing articles of wearing apparel in my house; amongst others, I had the articles mentioned in the indictment. The prisoner was a lodger of mine. I saw him one day with a new Guernsey frock on, and I knew he had no money to buy it. I asked him how he came by it; he said he had had a job, and a sailor had given it to him. I sent for an officer, and had the hand-cuffs put upon him, and then he confessed the truth; he confessed he sold the things, and told me where.</p>

The pantry opens into the front area, of the dwelling-house. I left a plated turene stand, in the window of my pantry, and on my return, I saw the prisoner. I saw him in Crawford-street; and I saw the turene stand, thrown into the gutter. I saw him running away, and several people running after him. He was taken directly into custody; I saw him afterwards, when he hoped for forgivness, saying it was the first crime he ever commited.</p>

I was in the shop at the other end, drinking some beer, with the other workmen, and I saw him take a chest of tea out of the shop; I saw him on his knees with his hands before him.

On the evening of the 4th of November last, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060052"/>came into our shop, and requested to look at some shirts. I shewed him some, and he fixed upon one; and then he desired to be shewn some silk pocket handkerchiefs. I took some from the window, and shewed them to him; there was a particular pattern which he said he wanted, but which he said was not there. I turned round to a draw behind to get some others; and by his position, with his hat off, and placed upon the counter, I guessed all could not be right. On my turning round again, he had got his hat on; and I jumped over the counter almost directly, and in his hat, was a whole piece of silk handkerchiefs. I sent for an officer, and delivered him and the handkerchiefs into his custody.</p>

They then walked up and down a little time, and then Roberts went in again, and come out again but did not bring anything then. He joined company with Atkinson, and in a few minutes went in again. While he was in, Atkinson walked past the door; and then I saw Roberts bring these printed goods out. I kept in the court, until their backs were turned, for fear they should see my face; and as soon as they got into St. Paul's Church Yard, I went after them, and took them both into custody.</p>

            . I am a book-seller, and reside in Holborn. Some time before the beginning of November last, the prisoner at the bar, came to me, one morning, and brought with him a parcel which was the ten volumes of the Statutes at Large, the value of which was thirty pounds; but for which he only asked ten pounds. I asked to whom they belonged? and he said to a gentleman of the profession going out of town, and he told me his name was Mr. Able Wright, of Lincoln's Inn. I told him in the first place, I must see if such a person lived in Lincoln's Inn, and if he did, and had sent these books, I would pay him for them myself. I went to enquire, and found that Mr. Long lived there, and not Mr. Wright. That same day, the prisoner came to my house, and I told him he was an impostor. He said he would take the books away, but I told him he should not, for I would keep them to find an owner; and he went away, and left them with me. In consequence of my making enquiries at all the law book-sellers, I found out the real owners. Paradice came to my house, and after examining them, knew them by some defection.</p>

            . I was in the employment of the prosecutors. I remember taking stock at Christmas last; and then having two hundred and four sets of the Statutes at Large, and I selected twelve sets as imperfect. In consequence of information, I went to Mr. De Arcey's shop, and then I brought this set home, knowing it to be one of the sets, which I had sealed up as imperfect. The prisoner was in our employ; and on my return from De Arcey's, he had absconded. I never saw him again, until he was apprehended.</p>

            . I am an officer, and on the evening of the 31st of October, I was standing at about five o'clock at the corner of Barbican, in company with another officer. The prisoners went past us, and a little girl with them. Knowing them before, I was induced to watch them; they went into a large linen-draper's shop, in Barbican, and staid in for a full hour. When they came out, I immediately went in, and asked if they had missed any thing; but they said no, they had not; for they had been aware of them, and had watched them too closely. They then went into a hatter's shop, at the corner of Redcross-street; they talked together in the shop for a little bit, and then hustled up together to a chair against the counter. Thompson was pulling her own bonnet off, which she had on, and the other was covering her, and I saw her scramble one of the hats from by the chair, and clapped it under her petticoats. Then she went behind the counter, to try her bonnet on, where she was about two or three minutes, and then she came back again, where she was before, and stopped, and put another hat under her petticoats. She then fumbled about a good bit about a band for the bonnet, and then she took another, and put that under her petticoats. In about two minutes they came out; I let them get about two houses from Mr. Frank's, and then we stopped them; they struggled very hard, and a gang of fellows came over from the corner of Golden-lane, and rescued Ford from me. I brought the other prisoner and the hats back to Franks's and he said that the hats were his property. I am sure Ford is the person who was in company with Thompson; Barrett apprehended Ford the next day.</p>

            . I am a stage-coachman. I have a bundle of things, which I bought at the sign of the Coach and Horses, St. Martin's-lane, on the 18th of November; I bought them of the prisoner Scullon. I was in the Coach and Horses when he was offering them for sale, at between nine and ten in the morning; I gave him six shillings for them; there were two waistcoats, and a pair of small clothes. I saw he offered a pair of leather breeches for sale; but nothing else. Smith, the other prisoner, was with him; they appeared to me to be acquainted with each other. Smith seemed to interfere as a friend to the other, in saying he was selling the things for too little.</p>

On that day, I had in a drawer in my house a forty-pound note, a five-pound note, and several others; the last time I saw the notes, was on the Sunday previous. I kept the drawer locked; but missed the key on the 8th; the day the prisoner left me. The forty-pound note I had had from my aunt. I never saw any of my notes since. On the 8th of November, I went out at about three o'clock in the afternoon; I left nobody in the house but the prisoner. I returned home at about six o'clock in the evening; I had left word for the prisoner to come to me if I did not return by dusk in the evening; she accordingly came to me at No. 15, <placeName id="t18151206-145-crimeloc791">Finsbury-square</placeName>

She left me at about eleven that evening, and was to have returned the next morning. I gave her one shilling and sixpence, and a shilling remained due to her. She never returned to me. I had no suspicion until the Thursday, the Lord Mayor's day, when Mrs. Godfrey came to me; I then went to the drawer, and found it open, that is unlocked; but it was pushed in as close as if it was locked; the forty-pound note, the five-pound note, and several small notes, were missing; there was some notes left in the drawer. When I missed my money, the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

            . I live in Fore-street, and am a linen-draper. I recollect the prisoner at the bar, and a woman named Evans, called at my shop, on Wednesday, the 8th of November; she stated that she wanted some mourning, for her father was dead. The woman, named Evans, said, perhaps he wont change the note you have got, we had better go to the Bank, and we will call on our return; at that time, I did not know the amount of the note, and fearful of loosing a customer, I said I would change it. Then the woman, Evans, produced the note, as the prisoner's. When I saw it, I had a suspicion that it was not good, and not having any one in the house, I beckoned to a neighbour to go to the Bank, to see if it was good. He returned with two twenty-pound notes, and then I had no doubts, and therefore sold the prisoner the articles she wanted; she bought goods to the amount of upwards of five pounds. I gave her a twentypound note, and the difference out of the change of the other twenty-pound note. I tendered the change to Evans, as the prisoner seemed in such distress at the loss of her father; I gave it to Evans, because she said she had heard some account of the death of her husband also that morning, and seeing the prisoner over-whelmed with grief; I thought it more decorous to give it to Evans. The next day she came again, and bought some trifling articles; Evans had not then the property. She then tendered me a ten-pound note, which I believe to be one of those I had paid to her the day previous.</p>

When I saw her in Newgate, I was so much affected, that I began crying; she told me not to cry, that she had a friend who had sent her a twenty-pound note, to provide attorney and counsel, Mr. Fancom, in Tooley-street; she desired me to buy her a few things for the trial; she gave me the note. When I came home, I told my husband where I had been; he was very angry with me for going to Newgate, and said, if I did not go to Mr. Fancom, he would. I then went to Mr. Fancom, and in consequence of directions he gave me, I went to the Bank, where I found the note was stopped.</p>

            . I am an officer of the City of London. I recollect apprehending the prisoner on the 10th of November; I apprehended her in Ship-yard, Redcross-street; I made her acquainted with the nature of the charge. She confessed she had taken the property, but had got drunk, and did not know what she had done with it. I told her I must search her, and so I did, as far as decency would permit. I got a woman to strip her, and search her; there were sixpence, and six-penny worth of halfpence on her. She said, she had some property in the house where she lodged; that was at Evans's, who gave me up some property which the prisoner confessed she had purchased.</p>

            , who lives in the house himself; the prisoner lodged in the same room with me. On the day in the indictment, he was sitting in the cold, in the room, and would not move, for several days, he had not left the appartment. I told him he had better take a run round the square, but that he declined, saying, that he had some halfpence, and if I would lend him two or three, he would be able to get half a peck of coals. I went to get change of a one pound note, and when I came back, I could not get the halfpence out of my pocket, and put my pocket-book down on the bench, while I got them out. I forgot to put my pocket-book into my pocket again, and then went up to work again. In about two or three hours, I put my hand in my pocket, and missed my pocket-book. Filled with terror, I ran down frightened, and looked upon the bench, where I remembered I had left it, but it was gone; and the prisoner was gone too. There was a most excellent fire in the room, and plenty of victuals, and I am sure the prisoner would not have quit them, unless it was for something better. He came home about eleven o'clock that night, drunk; and I know he had no money to buy liquor. I sent for an officer, and had him taken into custody; but we found nothing on him.</p>

A young woman brought the peliese in question to my shop, on the evening of the 8th of November, between six and seven in the evening; she wanted to sell it; I did not think she could have come by it honest, and therefore I stopped it. In about a quarter of an hour after she was gone, the prisoner came and asked me, if I had not got a pelise which a young woman left, and I told him I had; and he wanted it, but I did not chuse to give it him; he said if I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060056"/>choose to give it him; and he said if I did not give it him, he would smash the glass; I told him he might do that if he choose, but he certainly should not have the pelisse.

            . I am an officer belonging to the public office, Bow-street. I recollect meeting the two prisoners at about a quarter past six, on the evening of the 1st of December, in Play-house-yard; they had two looking-glasses, each carrying one. Frost was with me; he laid hold of Brooks, and asked him where he got the glasses, and he pointed to Gilvin, and said this is the person who employed me to carry them; I directly went and laid hold of Gilvin, and told Frost to keep fast hold, for I knew Gilvin. We took them into the public-house, and I searched Gilvin, and found on him a pair of gloves, and a pair of spectacles. I asked him where he got the gloves, and he said they belonged to himself; and the spectacles he could give no account of at all. We took them to Bow-street, where they were committed; and in coming across Spa-fields we heard of the robbery. We went to the prosecutor's house and there they gave an accurate description of one of the glasses.</p>

On the 10th of November last, the prisoner at the bar came into my house, between eleven and twelve o'clock; he asked for change of sixpence; I gave it to him. He said I will have a glass of gin now, as you have been so good as to change me the sixpence; he gave me two-pence out of the halfpence, and went out. In a minute a man came in, and tendered a shilling, and I offered him this sixpence in change; he told me it was a bad one. I gave him another, and laid it on the counter I then went down to my coal-merchant, at his coal-wharf, and on my return, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner was in the shop, getting a glass of gin. She shewed me a sixpence he had tendered; I compared it with the one I had in my pocket, that he had given me before, and I perceived they were both bad. I then put them both into his hand, and collared him, and told him he was a smasher. A person named Loveday, who was in the tap-room, came to my assistance, and went for an officer, who on searching the prisoner, found eighty-five pieces of bad money about him, resembling sixpenny pieces.</p>

Upon that, I told him it would save himself and me a great deal of trouble if he had any, to count it out on the table. He then counted out eight penny-pieces, and thirteen pence halfpenny. I then proceeded to search him, and found eighty-seven sixpenny-pieces on him. (Producing them.) They are in the same state in which I found them, with paper between them.</p>

I know the prisoner at the bar; he came into my master's shop, at about seven o'clock in the evening of the 21st of November; he asked for a pair of worsted hose, the price of which was two shilings and sixpence; he tendered me payment in three single shillings; I looked at them, and they were all bad. I told my master to look at them, and he was of the same opinion. The prisoner then wanted them back, and put a three-shilling piece down. Mr. Kennyon asked him if he had any more of the same sort, and would not let him have them back. He said he had no more, and pulled some halfpence out. He swore that he had no more. Then Mr. Kennyon sent for a constable. The prisoner stood there. He was running away, when Mr. Kennyon took hold of the flap of his coat, and detained him. He then put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out a purse, which he threw behind the counter. I picked it up, and kept it until the officer came. Then he examined the purse. They had shocking hand work in keeping the prisoner down; he knocked Mr. Kennyon down, and he knocked the shopman down, and when the constable came, he knocked him down also.

I saw Newman put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, and I suspected that he had taken something out. Vaughan at that time crossed the road, and I feared they should see him. They went a little further close to the side of Elyplace, and there attempted the pocket of another gentleman. They both continued in company, and turned up Union-court, Holborn Hill, which leads to Field-lane, towards a noted receiving house; Vaughan and I followed them. Newman was just going in at the door, when I ran forward, and seized hold of him, and Vaughan seized hold of the other prisoner. Newman at the same moment, dropped a handkerchief, and on searching him, I found another, and a knife.</p>

            . I was with Barrett, on Holborn Hill, it was about six o'clock. I saw the two prisoners pressing a gentleman, and we followed them; just before they came to Hatton Garden, Newman went up to a gentleman, and put his hand into his pocket; the other was covering him. We apprehended them going into Mother Dyna's, in Fieldlane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus, on the part of the prisoners, objected to the foundation of this indictment, and conceived that nothing could be made of it at all, because the indictment started, that they put and placed themselves close by a certain person unknown, and that one of them put his hand into the pocket of a coat, upon a person unknown, with intent the goods and chattels therein contained, to steal, take, and carry away. When, for ought any one knew to the contrary, there was nothing in the pocket at all.</p>
               <p>In the second place, this was not done under any cognizence of the Police Act; for that only enabled the officers of Justice to apprehend such persons as they knew to be notorious characters, and to deal with them as vagrants only.</p>
               <p>And, in the third place, no intent at all was alledged to the prisoner Moore.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds, contra, submitted, that the attempt to commit a felony was an offence, and that the quoanimo was the principal thing to be looked at. The prisoners were charged simply with an attempt to commit a robbery, and he conceived that from the mouths of his witnesses, he had fully established that entent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland, on the same side urged a similar answer, and the mischief that would arise from the admisubility of his Learned Friend on the other side's argument.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus, again contended, that there was no Overt Act, or Asportavit, that could constitute an indictable offence.</p>
               <p>THE COURT, was of opinion, that the argument of the Learned Gentlemen who was concerned for the prisoners was invalid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus, then addressed the jury, on the novelty of this spicies of the indictment, and assimulated it to an accusation against a man for an intent to commit</p>
               <p>"Arson, in desects of Chabia," where there was no ignitable substance, because he had a lighted torch in his hand. Here the prisoners were charged with an attempt to pick the empty pocket of a coat, on an unknown person.</p>

            . I was employed by Mr. Westwood, the deputy solicitor of the Bank, to act under Dickens the officer, for the purpose of getting introduced to the prisoner at the bar. I was introduced to him on the 10th of October, and made an appointment to meet him the next morning at nine o'clock at the sign of the white Dog, Widegate-alley. I met him at the appointed time, and place, but he could not see the person whom he wanted to see. He should not be able to let me have any before the evening. We then went out together, to <placeName id="t18151206-156-crimeloc854">Barbican</placeName>

Then he crossed the way, and desired me to walk slowly on; and in the course of five minutes, he overtook me, and said it was all right; he told me he had got one for a sample, and he gave me a counterfeit three-shilling piece, for which I gave him one and sixpence; I marked this one, and afterwards gave it to Dickens. (The counterfeit three-shilling piece put into the hands of the witness;) that is it. We were then to meet by his appointment, at the <placeName id="t18151206-156-crimeloc855">sign of the Baker and Basket, in Cloth Fair</placeName>

When he came in, he told me all was right; he had seen the person whom he wished to see, and I could have them. He asked me then how many I wanted? and I told him fifteen shillings worth; and he told me that the person of whom he had them, would not serve him under a pounds worth. I told him I had no more money, and then he gave me ten counterfeit three-shillings pieces, which I marked and gave to Dickens, the officer, in about ten minutes after I received them.</p>

Yes; I was introduced to the prisoner by a person who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060059"/>was a stranger to me, whose name in Jack; I believe Jack as they call him is in Court.

            . I am an officer. On the 11th, I saw the prisoner and Spanner in company together at the Baker and Basket, in Cloth Fair. In the morning, I gave him nine shillings, to buy six counterfeit tokens of the prisoner. He brought me seven and sixpence, and one bad token, which he marked in my presence. (Token put into the hands of the witness.) That is the token; Spanner brought me ten on the 12th. I had searched him before he went into the prisoner's company and after he came back. I had given him fifteen shillings for the purpose of purchasing, and I saw him mark them. (Tokens put into the hands of the witness,) these are they.</p>

In consequence of something which passed between me and the proseutors, I applied to Godfrey, the Bow-street officer, and he came to my house, on the 16th of November; and in the course of that morning, the prisoner brought a letter to me. I observed that there were two prickles in his cart. I followed the cart in company with Godfrey. The prisoner first went to <placeName id="t18151206-158-crimeloc872">Bullstrode-street</placeName>

He then returned with a small hamper packed and corded, which he put into the cart. He then went into the house again, and brought out a prickle, which appeared to be completely empty. He then went to No.21, <placeName id="t18151206-158-crimeloc873">Crawford-street</placeName>

I looked down the area, and saw him looking at some empty bottles. He brought the prickle up full of empty bottles, and placed it in the cart; and then turned the cart round towards Holborn, and drove off; I was within thirty yards of him all the time; I never lost sight of the cart. When he got into Oxford-street, he crossed over into Charles street, Soho; that was not his nearest way, his nearest way was through Holborn. Then he drove into Greek-street, where there is an archway, which leads thence down Crown-street, into Phoenix-street. He stopped in Phoenix-street, and took the prickle which he had filled in Crawford-street, and carried it to the end of the street, and turned down into Stacey-street. I lost sight of him for a minute, and when I recovered it, he was gone into Wainwhight's shop. He keeps a bottle and rag shop.</p>

            . I lost my clothes in my room, at about one o'clock in the morning of the 1st of November. The prisoner lodged in my house. I went to bed, and fell asleep, at about nine o' clock. I was awakened by some one pulling a great coat off my bed; I said, "who's there?" nobody answered. I immediately rose up in my bed, and caught hold of the person's very hand. I called out to my aunt, who slept in the next room, to strike a light. She gave me a light, and I found it was the prisoner at the bar. Before the light came, I let go of his hand, and he went up stairs; in making his way up stairs, he dropped a coat, a waistcoat, and a pair of small-clothes, of mine, on the landing place. He made his way up to the loft, and there we found him, laying down behind the door; he had shut the door, and tied it with a piece of string. I had called in the assistance of

            . On the 2nd of this month, I was in company with the prisoner at Mr. Grainger's, the Peacock in the Minories, where I lodged. I had received forty-one new one-pound notes for my wages; I had them tied up in a song book, called the Berkshire Lady, I had them in my breeches pocket. I don't know whether the prisoner knew or not of my having them. He and I went down to the Crown in East Smithfield, and staid there until dusk, drinking. I had five old notes besides. Thence we went to the Hambro' Arms, on Tower-hill. I was not drunk; I was a little fresh, but knew what I was about; he drank gin and water with me there; then he said I must go home with him; he took me by the collar, and pulled me out of the house; we left some liquor behind us in the glasses.

He ran away immediately; I ran after him; but could not catch him; he was out of my sight in a moment. Then I ran up and down the streets, thinking to fall in with him. I went to Mr. Grainger's to enquire after him; but could gain no information. I saw Mr. Forrester, the officer, in about three quarters of an hour afterwards, and I told him the sort of notes I had lost, and what they were tied up in.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 2nd of December, I saw the prosecutor, between six and seven in the evening, and he said he was going to make away with himself; he was in a very dejected state. I asked him what was the matter, and he said, he had been robbed. I asked him if it was a woman who took his money, and he said no; it was a shipmate. He gave me a description of the person who had robbed him, and told me the notes were wrapped up in a ballad book. I met the prisoner coming back from Grainger's, in the Commercial-road; I asked him if his name was not Kingsnorth, and he said it was. I told him there was a very serious charge against him; he said, he knew all about it; it was about the money; he said he had it to take care of. When we got to Grainger's, I said, the best way would be to count it on the table, to relieve the man's mind. He then said, he had not got it. I asked him where it was. He said he had taken it up to his own brother's, in Islington. We went to his brother's-in-law; he asked us what was the matter; we told him his brother was in charge of two officers for the money. He then said he had got it, and he took out a handful of notes; I got them, and only three more; we counted them out in the Minories, there were twenty new notes for one-pound each. I took from the prisoner this watch. (Producing it,) which he would not tell how he came by.</p>

All I know is, that whilst I was standing at my shop, a boy was looking into one of the water tubs at my door, and whilst so doing, he repeated the words half past nine o'clock; in consequence of that, I went to the tub of water, and there I saw the watch at the bottom of it; I gave it to Mrs. Davis, who said it was her's.</p>

            . I and another officer, were in company together, on Sunday, at about nine o'clock in the morning; a coach drove up to the prisoner's door, and his door opened; we saw a large green bag full of something thrown into the coach, and the prisoner got in after it. The coach drove away, and we followed it, and stopped it; upon opening the bag, we found pieces of kerseymere, and broad cloth. We asked him where he got them; he said, he was going to take them to Portsmouth, with jewellery goods. He told us when he got to the watchhouse, that he had bought the goods in the City, and could shew us bills of parcels; we let him go. He promissed to appear before the magistrate the next day; but he never came: nor did I see him afterwards until he was taken into custody,</p>
