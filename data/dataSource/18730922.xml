'She said 'Speak slow, there's somebody watching in the opposite; bar;'she spoke in a low tone of voice, and caused me to bend over to hear her; she then said 'Do try, I am so hard-up I have not a stitch to my back;' she then said 'I'll retain half a load, meaning ten, and do try and sell the rest, so I shall have a <hi rend="italic">back</hi> to do the rest.

Something struck me that all was not right; I put my hand to my side, and found something in my pocket which I knew ought not to be there, and which I thought was put there by the woman; they said 'What have you got in your hand?'

On Thursday afternoon, 21st August, about 3 o'clock, in consequence of directions I received, I went to the Crown Tavern, Oxford Street—Urben came in soon after—I was in the left partition—a few minutes after I went in Giffard came in and the prisoner joined her in about ten minutes—the prisoner stood up to the counter and the woman stood opposite, facing him—they were talking, but I could not hear what was said—I saw the prisoner hand a blue packet like this produced to the woman—I did not see where he took it from—I saw it in her hand—Urben came in and spoke to me and we went round to the compartment where the prisoner and the woman were—Urben went in first—I went in and said "We shall take you into custody for having counter<lb/>feit coin in your possession"—he got his left hand back, going to the coat pocket; his hand was clenched—I caught his hand and took a half-crown and shilling from it—the prisoner called out "Landlord, landlord, get a policeman"—I said "We are two police officers"—he said "Landlord, this woman has got half a load of bad money on her"—we took him out of the house, and I told the woman to come to the station and she did—on the way there the prisoner struggled very violently with his left hand, trying to get it to his left pocket, but I held him so that he could not get it there—when we got to the station he handed me these two packets from his pocket, and at the same time a piece of brown paper fell from his hand to the floor—he said "Here is the other stuff because I know you will find it"—I produce the two packets—one contains ten</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Andrew Sullivan Giffard, and live at 1, Addison Villas, Kensington—I am a dressmaker—I was tried with my husband at the last Sessions for passing bad money—I was acquitted and he was convicted—on the Tuesday morning I went to the Paddington police-station to get my property—I saw Urben and made a statement—and on the following day I went with Urben to the Ship, in Seven Dials, between 3 and 4 o'clock—after I had been there a short time the prisoner came in—he did not recognise me at first, but he did afterwards and shook hands with me—he asked me how my husband had got on—I told him—he said he was very sorry, but was very glad to see me out again—he told me to tell my husband on the Tuesday, when I saw him on visiting day, that he would do all he could for me—he asked me if I wanted anything—I said I wanted to see <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, who was selling—he said "Oh, he is not selling now, he's not been selling for three weeks"—the prisoner said he was a seller and I could have plenty—I said I did not want it then; I was going to my friends—he said "Will you come and see me to-morrow at 12 o'clock," and I said "Yes"—he asked me how much I wanted, and I told him ten—he asked me what I would have—I told him half-crowns, not 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces—he said "No, they are very awkward"—he told me to meet him the next day at the Crown, at the corner of Cromer Street, opposite Tottenham Court Road, and he would bring me ten half-crowns, and I could have them without the money—he said they would be 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to the Paddington police-station on Thursday and received a half<lb/>crown and a shilling from the inspector—I saw them marked first—I went to the Crown, and after I had been there ten minutes the prisoner came in, that was about ten minutes after 12 o'clock—he said he was very sorry to keep me waiting and disappoint me; but the maker had been drinking, and I could have no goods until 3 o'clock that afternoon as he was going to,. see the maker at 2.30—he told me not to meet him there, he would show me another house—he asked me which way I was going, and I said "Up Holborn"—he walked up Oxford Street with me, and showed me a small public-house, which I believe is the Crown Tavern—he said "This is more quiet here"—he left and I went across the street to my mother—she had been to the police station with me on the Thursday, and on all other occasions, but not on, the Wednesday before—her name is Jane Few, she is here—I went to the Crown Tavern at 3 o'olock, into the right hand com<lb/>partment</p>

I am a barrister of the Temple and Recorder of Margate—I produce an order of reference, dated 22nd February—I took the arbitration on the same day, in one of the rooms of the Guildhall—Mr. George Francis, barrister, appeared on behalf of the plaintiff in that action, and he called the prisoner as a witness—he was duly sworn—the first meeting was on 22nd February, and that is the date of the order.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The witness read the following portions of his notes of the examination of the prisoner, applicable to the assignments of perjury.</hi>—"I paid the men with my own money, if it was not it was some I borrowed from my sister. The defendant never paid me money, but he gave me money on account of labour. I have seen this book before, only once, in Mr. Wood's office; it was not shown to me every week while the work was going on, and the men's wages entered in it. I have seen entries made in a book of the wages of the men, but not in this book. I will swear that this is not the book. When I took the contract I did not ask Mr. Fuller to order the materials in my name that I might stand better with my creditors. On 10th July I left my book and bills with Mr. Fuller. The book was 12 inches long and 5 wide, marble-coloured sides and black back. Fuller did not take the money out of his pocket to pay Pitt. I paid the money out of my own pocket, and Mr. Pitt handed me the receipt. I paid Rosling's account of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I gave a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; I got that note from Mr. Fuller; I believe Mr. Fuller gave me that note; it was not given to me for—the pur<lb/>pose of paying Rosling; I told Fuller I was desirous of paying Rosling; it might have been the same morning that I had the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. That 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to me was a note paid for the labour account, it was not given to me for any timber account.")—Those assignments which I have read were unquestion<lb/>ably material to the issue that was before me—the first question before me was whether Fuller or Isaacs paid those different accounts, and the labour account, and whether Isaacs paid them with his own money, or money sup<lb/>plied by Fuller—it was also material whether he had left the different bills and the account-book at Fuller's house—I produce the award which has been produced, it was against the prisoner on all points, and he was ordered to pay the costs—the award was for the defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should not call it a complicated question of accounts—there were five or six meetings—it lasted till 25th April from 27th February.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live near Reigate—I was in the prisoner's employ from the beginning of February to the middle of June, and was at work three weeks after he left—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> between</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187309220017"/>
               <p>Fuller and Isaacs, between a fortnight and three weeks after Isaacs left—on the morning of the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> I saw Beale leave Mr. Fuller's premises shortly after breakfast—he returned shortly afterwards, and Isaacs came very quickly almost upon his heels—Isaacs asked where Mr. Fuller was—I said "Up stairs"—I always received my wages from Isaacs—he used to have a book before him when he paid the wages, and his son was generally by his side—the gold and silver was arranged in two plates on a bench, and he used to hand us the money—on every occasion he paid I saw him enter the amounts in the book—Whye was called <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Whye, and sometimes Old <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>—it was arranged that Mr. Fuller should send for Mr. Isaacs to dispute certain items in the bill—we were to be called into the room up stairs, and Elsey was to put his hand behind him and turn the key of the door—it was to dispute certain facts—Mr. Fuller had a bill before him relating to building materials and scaffolding—after Isaacs discharged us on the Saturday, Fuller told us to come on Monday after breakfast and he would engage us—we went on Monday, and during that day Mr. Fuller's pro<lb/>perty was fetched away from Isaacs's premises, but I did not go there—after we had done at night Mr. Fuller gave us something to drink and began telling us a great deal about Isaacs, and tried to impress upon us that he had been trying to take our bread out of our mouths, and trying to create an ill-feeling between us and Isaacs—I then said to Mr. Fuller, "If such is the case you had better ask where the pair of sashes are"—he asked what I meant; I said "A pair which were made in mistake and left behind on the premises"—next morning Mr. Fuller spoke to me about the sashes and said that he should go and fetch them—he brought them to me next morning and asked me if those were the sashes—I said yes as near as I could tell, and during the week he was continually asking us if we knew of any<lb/>thing which was left, and he led us to believe that there were things belonging to Isaacs, and to dispute those facts we were to be locked in a room face to face with Isaacs—the sashes for one of the window frames of Mr. Fuller's house were made on Isaacs's premises and were left behind—I had not seen them and Mr. Fuller led us to believe that Mr. Isaacs had been robbing him—I cannot say whether that was so—the men who made the sashes made one pair too many—when Mr. Fuller brought them down he said "Are these the sashes?"—I said "Where did you get them?"—he said "I went and asked Mr. Isaacs for them"—he put them outside the gate and I brought them away—I believe Elsey is dead—Mr. Isaacs engaged me and paid me, I looked upon Mr. Isaacs as my master—I was two hours in the room when the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was, there was a great deal of abuse—Mr. Fuller accused Isaacs of robbing him, and said "I have got your books and I don't care a damn"—just before last Christmas I was sent for to Fuller's house, he said that Isaacs had entered an action against him in the Queen's Bench and he should require me as a witness—I said "I had rather not have anything to do with it"—he said that he should subpoena me—I said "If either of you bring me into it I shall speak the truth"—I was not subpœnaed by Fuller—one Friday night I met Fuller and Whye—Fuller said "Whye, here is Ambrose, now tell old <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> all that has passed between you and Isaacs—Fuller then said "You will acknowledge to Isaacs that you knew the door was going to be locked"—I said "Yes"—he said "Did you see me lock the door?"—I said "How could I when you stood on the other side of the room?"—he said "What do you think old <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> will swear to?"—I said "I don't know"—he said "Old <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> will swear that the lock was out of</p>

               <p>repair, and that he had to take it up to the shop"—Bill said "Yes, I will," and he said "Go and get yourself a drop of ale, and I will come back directly"—I felt disgusted, because I knew it was a most bare-faced lie, and I went home—early in July I saw Fuller again, going into Reigate with Henry Marks—he said "Halloa, Heather, how are you?"—I said "Pretty well"—he came and walked by my side and turned round suddenly and said that I would swear to some of the most bare-faced lies a man had ever uttered—he accused me of being a liar—I said "Mr. Fuller, you know too well the truth of what I swore to"—he said "You swore that I brought you those sashes"—I said "You did, Mr. Fuller"—he called me all the liars he could lay his tongue to, and I said "Mr. Fuller, as long as I have breath in my body or a leg to stand on, I will stand to what I have said."</p>

I live at 4, Shorn Terrace, St. Leonard's-on-Sea—iu August, 1871, I worked for Isaacs at a house he was building at Reigate—on 8th August, after breakfast, Fuller came and asked for Isaacs, I told him that he was at the back part of the building—Fuller went and asked him to give up a glue-pot; he said "I have no glue-pot here belonging to you"—Fuller called him anything but a gentleman, in an abusive way—Isaacs said "I have nothing belonging to you on my premises, and I wish you would not come here blackguarding me in this manner"—Fuller called him all the rogues and blackguards he could—Isaacs said that he would prove who was a blackguard and who was not—Fuller said "You can't prove anything against me, you b----, I have your account-book and bills, and now I don't care for you; I have a letter from Mr. Rosling and you have laid yourself open to a felony"—Fuller then walked away to the new buildings—he came again on another occasion and asked Isaacs for some piping—Isaacs said "I have some piping here, but it is some you returned to me that I lent you"—Fuller said "It is my piping, and I will have it"—he went away for a short time and came back with a smith from the town</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Southampton, and am a Magistrate there—the prisoner was for some years a tenant of my father's, of a ship building yard, at Wolston, near Southampton—after my fathers death the property came into my possession, and the prisoner continued as tenant—in September, 1808, he relinquished the lease in favour of Messrs. Bartlett and Pudney, the mortgagees of his vessel, and I accepted them as tenants—the prisoner was building the ship, it had been remaining there in frame for a considerable period; these parties had sold him timber, he could not pay them, and the result was they took possession of the ship, and in order to enable them to complete the vessel, he made an arrangement with them that he should relinquish his lease in their favour, which he did—he did not leave Southampton for some twelve months afterwards—he never made any claim on me for any money until I received this letter of 31st March, the signature to it is the prisoner's: (<hi rend="italic">This letter was a request to the prosecutor to fulfil an alleged promise of helping him, he having had heavy losses and been at considerable expense upon tlve premises in question</hi>)—I did not answer that letter—on 19th April I received a second letter, this is it, it is signed by the prisoner: (<hi rend="italic">This referred to a claim of</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for extra rent, and compensation, for repairs, which the prosecutor was requested to send him, if not he should be compelled to consult a gentleman in the neighbourhood and expose his affairs</hi>)—I replied to that letter on 21st April, of which I have a rough copy: (<hi rend="italic">This gave an unqualified denial to the prisoner's claim</hi>)—on 22nd April I received this other letter: (<hi rend="italic">This stated that unless he received, by the following Thursday, 201., together with some offer of compensation for repairs, he should write to the person referred to in the former letter, and that the prosecutor mud blame himself if his affairs became publicly talked of</hi>)—This letter, of 6th August, was received by my son, Captain Buchan, it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187309220021"/>
               <p>is also signed by the prisoner: (<hi rend="italic">This repeated the substance of the first letter, and urged Captain Buchan to use his influence with his father to in<lb/>duce him to act justly</hi>)—A letter was also sent to my mother's, signed by the prisoner's wife, and then came this letter, of 25th August, upon which the indictment is founded: (<hi rend="italic">This contained the following passage</hi>:—"Blame yourself, and not me, if your affairs are published during next week's festivities, which they will be unless I hear satisfactorily from you pre<lb/>viously.")—The Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of London were about to visit Southampton at that time, and on the occasion of that entertainment I presided—I presume the prisoner knew of that through the public press—I am a trustee of various charities at Southampton, I was Mayor last year, I am in an extensive business, and have business all over the world—it was fearing these statements would be of consequence to me that I took these proceedings—everything the prisoner has stated in these letters is most grossly false—there is not a word of truth in the claim he has made—the only thing I can imagine is that being an aged man his mind has got confused on the subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He admitted, at Hammersmith, that he had <hi rend="italic">got</hi> 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. extra rent for the yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I admitted that I had received more rent for the yard than he had agreed to pay in his lease—there was no agreement that he should share in the profit; when he gave up his tenancy I had done with him altogether—he never claimed anything from me in respect of the paling until these letters were written; I swear that positively—in the early part of 1868 he was continually asking me to advance money on this ship, and not wishing to have anything to do with him on the matter, I told him that I had lost a large sum of money, which was quite true, in 1866—he had the place for about five years, at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he had not spent anything like 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the paling—he was no doubt at my office several times, but he never made any demand upon me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, handed in a statement which, in substance, was the same as that contained in the letters.</hi>

I am a surgeon, of Fulham—I was called in to Short on 4th September—his face was very red all over, as If it had been burnt by some corrosive fluid; his eyes were a little swollen, but not as if any of the fluid had gone into them, but next day, at the Police Court, it seemed as if some of the fluid had gone into his left eye—one eye is injured, but the other appears as if it would get well, and the skin of the face is recover<lb/>ing—oil of vitriol would be quite sufficient to cause the injury I found—I sent a bottle, and some fluid was sent to me purporting to come from the bottle taken from the prisoner; I examined it and found it to be oil of vitriol—this bottle neck (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was afterwards shown to me; I extracted the cork, it looks as if it was burnt by some corrosive matter—Short's clothes were in rags, being burnt full of holes from some corrosive fluid.</p>

               <p>months—she lived in the prisoner's house, 4, Princes Street, Red Lion Square—in consequence of a letter I received twelve months ago from some person unknown, I went to Eagle Street and found the deceased girl suffering from a wound on her shoulder, where she had been burnt some years before—it was about the size of a shilling—she also had a black eye, and a slight mark on the other eye—I knew the female prisoner before she married the male prisoner—I understood that they were married, as her name is now Robinson—on 29th August I was called to Red Lion Square, and found the deceased in bed in an emaciated condition and very dirty with maggots and lice—I noticed vermin all over the bedding—the step-mother told me that the girl used to sleep at night, not on the bed where we saw her, but on the ground, and that the bed belonged to her and her husband's children—the doctor ordered nourishment, which I supplied—I had a case at Clerkenwell Police Court at 2.30, after which I went back and found the beef which I had supplied still in a cupboard, untouched—I was told that she had had some of the brandy, but I thought not, and gave her some—I saw her twice daily—she died on 8th September—the father is a book<lb/>binder—I was present when he made a statement before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">This statement by the male prisoner, not on oath, was that he was a book<lb/>binder, and was the father of the deceased, who lost her mother two years before; that he married the other prisoner eight months afterwards, that the deceased suffered from epileptic fits, that he gave her all the food he could afford, but she was always crying. That she had diabetes, that she washed lierself, but whatever was done the vermin would accumulate</hi>).

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The father said that he earned 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week when he was in work—he was in employment when this happened—there may be eight children of his and hers, but not at home; I saw four in the room, and this girl made five—one of her children is in Liverpool—the mother informed me the girl was ill with diarrhoea—no one had been to me with an order for medicine—I did not take the meat and brandy to her, they were sent, and I cannot say at what time they arrived—I believe the meat was cooked directly it arrived—the remains of a stew were in a dish in the cupboard, and some bread—I asked where the beef-tea was, and there was the beef in the cupboard—I should call the girl an imbecile, she was incapable of follow<lb/>ing any occupation—I never spoke to her but once.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I practice in Great James Street—I first saw the deceased about August, 1872, she then had a contused eye, and it was alleged that her father had been ill-treating her—she had a large burn on her left shoulder, and the father said that she was subject to fits—I only saw her once—on 10th December I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—her body was extremely wasted, and there was a large old scar on the top of the scalp, which had healed; on the back of the left shoulder there was a superficial scar, about two inches in diameter—the intestines were devoid of fat, thin, and semi-transparent, the lungs were perfectly healthy, but their bases were congested, the heart contained a clot of discoloured fibrine, the stomach contained undigested food, its coats were thin—the convolutions of the brain did not sit well together, indicating a low intel<lb/>lectual state, and at the posterior portion of the right hemisphere of the brain was a small cist—she was in a very filthy state when I saw her alive—my opinion is that she died from inanition, for want of proper nourish<lb/>ment, there was not sufficient disease to account for that extreme wasting—deprivation of food would account for the exhaustion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not attended the family, only the grandmother—this hospital card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has Dr. Buzzard's name on it—it expired on 2nd March, but it does not say that she was under treatment for that time—I find that she was admitted on 2nd November, 1870; it was renewed on August 9th, and expired on November 9th, 1871—that is a full year—I infer from that that she was under treatment at that time—she was under treatment at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, for the burn on her shoulder, from June, 1868, to March, 1869 (<hi rend="italic">looking at another card</hi>)—the small cist, I found, would account for the fits—a girl so affected might fall and be burned—that would account for the bruises and marks I found—there was one unhealed wound—I had attended her twice daily for eleven days—I asked the Guardians to supply a nurse, who was there two or three days, and everything was done for her—they told me that she had been fed, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187309220030"/>
               <p>she told me herself that she had had what I had ordered for her—I found food in her stomach—she had diarrhoea when I first saw her—it did not continue till she died—it was not serious, as she did not vomit—I should say that she was certainly not suffering from diabetes—she passed her water involuntarily—there was congestion of the lungs, but that was simply due to the mode of death—there was no heart disease—people who die slowly have discoloured fibrine—the tumour on the brain set up congestion at cer<lb/>tain periods, when she had the fits, every four weeks, I suppose—she did not die during a fit—I should expect to find some active disease to account for what I saw—I don't know whether she was obstinate, and took things at some times and not at others—we have quite a different state of symp<lb/>toms in hysterical cases—Dr. Grant saw her five times, and he attended the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—he is not here—the diarrhoea was checked, and it returned and was checked again—she passed her faeces involuntarily, and they were not relaxed, and there were foeces in the lower bowels, which would not have been the case if she had had diarrhoea, but if she got up from bed, or used any extraordinary exertion she might die from syncope—diarrhoea has some<lb/>times that effect, if it is not checked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The state of the heart precluded the probability that she died from disease of the heart—her arms were very much emaciated—she died from <hi rend="italic">asthenia</hi>—the success of any treatment at the hospital would depend upon her having proper nourishment, and being taken care of—I have never seen a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> where we could not find the cause of death out—she was so feeble that I could not judge whether she was of weak mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there, on the part of the patient herself, a dislike to food? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say that she would take food which would not do her any good and not take the food which was ordered for her; many people lose their lives like that, but I cannot form any opinion whether that was the case here—I can only say that if she had had proper food the condition of her body would have been better than it was.</p>

On 11th September I saw the two prisoners standing, with others, at the bottom of Leather Lane; they went, with another man, into Holborn, and they all stood round a lady who was looking in at a shop window, and the man not in custody put his hand into her pocket, they then went to the prosecutor, who was standing on some steps at the corner of Brook Street—Wilson snatched his watch—the others were close behind him, they then all three ran down Brook Street, through some courts—I spoke to the prosecutor, and then went another way and met them coming out at the other end.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a beer retailer, of 9, Dove Row—on 25th July I was at the Victory beer-house, Mr. Hilldrup's—Mr. Tidyman came in, and while he was talking to me the prisoner came up, he was walking with a horse and van, which was loaded with greens—Tidyman went and said something to him, and they came back together, and the prisoner called me all manner of names, and challenged me to fight him—he has been a great annoyance to me for the last four years—Mr. Hilldrup went away, and I went to another table—the prisoner, came there, and put his face close to mine, using very abusive language, and asking me to fight him—I told him if I fought him I should have to fight all his relations—he said "When I get up in the morning at 3 o'clock I shall have my b----eye sight, "putting his finger to his eyes, "and that is a b----sight more than you will have;" and he laid his hand over my glass, which was on my right side—he put his face close to mine again, and I said "If you do so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187309220040"/>
               <p>again I will knock your head out of the way"—he put his face close again, and said "Now do it, you b----"—I got up and went to sit at another table, leaving my glass, and sat alongside of his father, but I did not know it was his father—he hoisted me off and said "I will not allow a big prig like you to sit alongside of me"—I went and complained to the landlord, and the prisoner followed me and challenged me again—the landlord said "If I were you I should get home; I cannot assist you, there are so many"—I said "I will"—I then took the seat I had moved from at first, and took up my glass of ale—I swallowed some of it, and thought they had been putting gin in it to make me intoxicated—I thought it tasted like gin and ale, but my head became affected, and I found a terrible burning at my throat—I threw the contents away, and poured out another glass, and gave it to a man named Valentine—I had to go through a crowd of people to get into the road, and when I got there the prisoner said "Come on, you b----!" and struck me and knocked me down in the road—here is the mark on my elbow where I fell—I said "Where is the man who knocked me down?"—someone said "He has gone into the shop"—the prisoner came running out of his shop, took off his coat, waistcoat, and apron, and said "I am the b----man, come on"—he began to spar, and raised his hand, as if he was going to strike me, and I felt something come on my face which took away my senses—I ran as far as from here to you, to a butcher's shop, and then fell insensible—I was carried home, and am still under the doctor's care.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been drinking, but very little—I never left home till 9 o'clock p. m.—I was a teetotaller up to that day—I had not taken the pledge, but I had said to myself "I will not drink liquor for so long a time"—I am not in the habit of giving way to drink, but when I do I am very dull—this was about 11 o'clock at night—I have not authorized my friends to settle this matter by a payment of money—I distinctly saw the prisoner's hand open—I could not see whether there was a bottle in it, because the stuff came in my face—a great, many people were about—I had not been trying to pick a quarrel with the prisouer—when we were at the door Tidy<lb/>man said to the prisoner "Go it, Joe, let him have it"—I recollect every<lb/>thing—I gave evidence before the Magistrate, and my deposition was read over to me—I said that there were one or two mistakes in it, and Mr. Lewis said "You had better leave that entirely to me"—I said that there was a mistake on the third page—I do not know whether the Magistrate's clerk declined to alter it, but he did not alter it—I poured out some ale for my friend; that was after my ale had been tampered with, but mine was in a glass, and the other was in a quart pot—I tried to get out of the prisoner's way—I went about six yards off—I came back with his brother to the place where the prisoner was, and sat down by his brother, who shoved me off—I did not tell the prisoner at what time I went to market, but I said "If I fight you now, I shall have to fight the whole lot, but I will meet you at the market and make you fight"—I know he goes to market early, but I don't know at what time—I was not quarrelsome, quite the reverse; I got out of his way many times—I told the Magistrate that when I have had a little too much I do feel a little quarrelsome—when this stuff came into my face I said "I am poisoned and blinded"—I know that what was thrown was scattered over two or three people—there were 100 or 150 people there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I mean that my eyes smarted, not the flesh round them—I saw the whole of the quarrel—I told the Magistrate that I saw the liquid leave the prisoner's hand—I mean to swear that—it was his right hand—I could not see anything in his hand to hold the liquid, the act was too quick—his hand was half open and half shut—he was standing without his coat, I can't say about his waistcoat—the prisoner did not go uuder his blind and tell Hibbert that if he came there he would knock him away, he said that if he wanted him he would find him under his own blind—Hibbert was not <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> when he was knocked down; he once raised his hands in a fighting attitude—that was before he was knocked down, but not afterwards, he put his hands over his eyes without any <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> at all—all this occurred under the blind which goes out over the pavement—the whole quarrel did not occur in the beer-shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clicker, of 2, Croft Street—I was in the Victoria public-house, about 11 o'clock, and saw Hibbert sitting at a table and the prisoner stooping down with his hands on his knees, and his face within a few inches of Hibbert's face—Hibbert pushed him aside by the shoulder, and said "Take your face out of my face V—the prisoner said "Don't you handle me, I can stand anything but handling."—I was rather too far off to hear what was said next, but the prisoner said "When I get up to-morrow morning I shall have my eyes open, but you won't"—I am</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187309220042"/>
               <p>quite sure I heard those words, and he put his hand to his eyes when he said it—they both seemed out of temper—the prisoner then said "Iam going to stay on our own ground, under my own blind," and Hibbert got up and was going away, but he met a young man and asked him where Mr. Sparrowhawk was, and went to the blind and asked where the man was that wanted to right him, and the prisoner got up and knocked him down in the road—a young man asked Hibbert to go away, and he walked to the blind and said "Allow me to explain"—the prisoner said "Don't let him come near me, for I can settle him with a look"—the prisoner had been into his shop and taken his waistcoat off, and he was sitting on a chair without his waistcoat—it was a very hot night—he then got up and squared up to Hibbert, and said "Take that, you b----," and Hibbert fell—the prisoner said "There's a coward, he has fallen down before I hit him," but as the prisoner threw his arm over I saw some drops come from his hand—I have not the least doubt that I saw liquid come from his hand, because, from the position of the persons sitting behind him, they could not have thrown it over his shoulder, they were sitting too low.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Crost-examined.</hi> There were not so many as 150 people—I saw no people under the blind, they were behind the prisoner, in a sort of half-moon—the prisoner went away from Hibbert, under his own blind, and said "Don't let him come near me "and, in the face of that remark, Hibbert went up to him—the prisoner gave him a strong push, it was hardly to be termed a blow—I did not see Hibbert put himself in a fighting attitude after being rushed down—Hibbert's manner was not offensive and quarrelsome.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 24U, Hackney Road—on 25th July I was called and found Hibbert sitting in a chair—his skin was blue, his tongue was hanging out of his mouth, and he was in a state of collapse—I smelt his breath and could not detect beer or spirits—I fortunately had two agents with me, one of which was a solution of acetic acid which seemed to do him good, as it counteracted the strong alkali—I administered that and after a little time reaction set up and his heart began to beat again—he was in a cold perspiration, and his breath was hurried aud short—I found stains on his waistcoat which I analysed, and in my opinion they were produced by liquid alkali—I should attribute them to ammonia, which is a very destructive fluid—it would be very injurious if thrown on a person's eyes—it will kill a person in eight or ten minutes, from the effluvia alone, and another effect would be to cause blindness.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Ammonia is used for the purpose of making linaments, for instance for hoping cough, but the strong ammonia of the English Pharma<lb/>copoeia, would be very injurious in any linament; when used to make harts-horn</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist, of 159, Goldsmith's Row, Shoreditch, next door to the prisoner's house, between 10 and 11 o'clock on the night in question I was making a linament in my shop, consisting of ammonia, soap linament, and compound camphor—it is used for hooping cough and rheumatism—I was using the <hi rend="italic">liquor ammonia fortis</hi>—while I was making it up I heard a large noise outside, and my wife, who is in delicate health, having an infant at her breast, being out at the time, I went to the door with the bottle containing the ammonia in my hand, preparatory to making up the mixture—the ammonia was undiluted—when I got to the door I saw fifty or sixty people, and the prisoner beyond them—the pavement is very broad and a portion of it is considered private property; there is a blind over that part—I stepped out to look up and down the road to see where my wife had gone, and before I could turn round I was surrounded by the mob, which was surging and swelling and pulling somebody along; I don't know who, and before I could get out of the crowd the stopper of the bottle jumped from the heat of the weather, and two or three drachms were spilt—I went back and put the bottle down and heard nothing more: nobody complained—I did not know the ammonia had reached anybody—I went to the Police Court when the prisoner was tinder examination on every occasion, to be called as a witness if wanted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know the prisoner from his living next door to me so long; three years or thereabouts—I never visited him—I have seen him daily, almost hourly in his business—Mr. Beard did not take down the statements of any witnesses, which I consider he ought to have done, and I believe he advised the prisoner to go to trial—I considered that it was not in my hands, or in my discretion, to say whether I gave evidence or not, but I was ready to give evidence when called upon—Mr. Beard, junior, repre<lb/>sented the prisoner—he never asked me for my statement—I did not know till the third examination that the prisoner was charged with throwing ammonia—I was not allowed inside the Court on the first examination—I went there to give evidence of what occurred outside my door, because I thought the prisoner was taken up for a common assault, striking or some<lb/>thing of that sort—he was taken up with two others—he said that he saw me at my door and asked me if I would come up as a witness—that was before I had heard of the nature of the accident—until the third examina<lb/>tion I did not connect the ammonia with the case, because I heard that the man had been smothered with vitriol, and there is a great difference between vitriol and ammonia—it was a week or two after the accident that I knew the nature of the charge—I mean to tell you that after the first examination I continued in the belief that it was a charge of common assault—I believe the prisoner was let out on bail: he came home to his house—I saw him between the first and second examinations—when he told me that he was charged with throwing ammonia, or spirit of some kind, I said "I can remember now how that happened"—that was between the first and second examinations—there were three attendances at the Police Court, but on the first nothing was gone into—by the first examination I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187309220044"/>
               <p>mean the second attendance—I went with the prisoner on the second examination to Mr. Beard's office—I did not make a statement to Mr. Beard because when we had been there some minutes some Alderman was announced who was wanted to be seen particularly, and we were ushered out—I saw Mr. Beard subsequently at the Police Court, but not to speak to him—I was about to make a statement to him, but I was told that the case would be committed for trial, and I need not do so—although I saw Mr. Beard twice, I never told him that the fluid was thrown by my hands—I only saw him about a second, and I did not tell him this until the prisoner was committed for trial, nor did I tell any solicitor, but I had spoken to other persons about it—this is the first time I have been examined—I saw Mr. Beard to speak to at the Police Court—I was in the crowd when the stopper flew out, holding the botttle midway, like this—that arose from the heat of my hand and the weather being very hot and the struggling in the crowd, although I had got out into the air—judging from what I saw when I got back, I supposed that some of the ammonia had been spilt on the ground about me, but I did not look to see—I have talked this matter over with the prisoner since, because I believed he was an injured party, and I gave him my explanation—I first told him what I have told you after the first examination at the Police Court, that is the second attendance, so that he knew the story that I was ready to tell, and no doubt this case has been the topic of conversation between us when I have seen him—he has made no offer to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The common talk was for some time that the injury had been caused by throwing vitriol, which I believed up to a certain part of the case—Dr. Chambers, who designated the agent as ammonia, was not called till the last examination, and when I heard that I explained it—there is not the slightest ground for suggesting that I have been bribed or induced to give this evidence—I went to give evidence as to the impossibility of the prisoner injuring Hibbert with vitriol, because I saw him with a pipe in his right hand—no evidence was discussed with Mr. Beard, junior, in ray hearing, I only saw him for a second—when the Alderman came into Mr. Beard's office, he said that he would see ns at the Police Court, and when we got there he said it was no good giving evidence, the case would be sent for trial—I have not seen Mr. Beard to tell him the evidence that I hive given to-day, and until the prisoner was committed, I had no oppor<lb/>tunity of giving evidence about the ammonia.</p>

                  </hi>. On 25th July, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I received a communication and went to the Goldsmith's Arms—I saw the prosecutor there, tapped him on the shoulder, and said "Mr. Hibbert, you are just the man I am looking for, don't you know me?"—he said "You are the man who came to my little dog"—I said "Yes, I want you to go home with me and see how he is getting on"—he said "All right, I will go with you as soon as I have spoken to these people"—he went to tho prisoner's shop, who was sitting on a chair smoking his pipe, and said "Where is the man that wanted to fight me?"—the prisoner said "Get away from here, and don't kick up a bother'—Hibbert said "I shan't go away," and the prisoner got off his chair and shoved him away, and he fell; he got up and was going at the prisoner again, and put his hand up to his eyes and said "Oh, what is this!"—he went towards a butcher's shop, a woman stood at the door, and he said "Let me come in"—she said "No, you can't come in," and he fell down—he was taken home, and I followed him—on the Sunday I went to</p>

               <p>Hibbert's with two or three friends; we went into the kitchen and had a little conversation about the dog, and then Hibbert said "You know about that job on Friday night; who threw the stuff?"—I said "No, I do not"—he said "I thought you knew who it was"—I said "No"—he said "Do you think it was <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>?"—I said "No, I was close by and did not see <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> throw anything, and he could not throw it over you without my seeing it"—he said "I don't believe it was <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>," and he said that he would find out who it was if it cost him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for he wonld advertise for it—there was a crowd and they surrounded me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn merchant, in Upper Thames Street, in partnership with Mr. Sedgwick—the prisoner has been in our service three years as traveller—his duties were to solicit orders, collect moneys, and pay them in to us either the same day or the following morning—he was pro<lb/>vided with a book—this is it—there is no amount entered on 16th June as received from Mr. Riley—on 10th July there is an entry, not of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Riley—on 11th July there is no entry of 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Farmer—the prisoner has never paid me those two sums of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was in the service three or four weeks after 9th July—we then dis<lb/>charged him on discovering the first item of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and he said there was some confusion in Riley's account—I after<lb/>wards discovered the other item, and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He solicited orders, and was paid a commission upon them when the accounts were paid in full—I first charged him with embezzling the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; at the same time I charged him with embezzling a sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that ought to have been paid in on 28th February, and we found</p>

               <p>a like amount entered on 3rd March, therefore we did not go into that—that was an amount due from a man named Dawes, who was paying by instalments—the prisoner had kept back that amount for three days—I don't know on what day he was discharged, I think it was the latter end of August—we theu wrote to his sureties for these two sums of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we afterwards applied for the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not write, my partner did—I have only one partner, Mr. Sedgwick—he has a son who is a clerk, a young man, not our principal clerk—we have a stall at the Corn Exchange—we close there at 3 o'clock—it is a busy time at 3 o'clock—young Mr. Sedgwick is here—this memorandum book of the prisoner's shows the amounts of money received on various days—that book was taken from him when he was given in charge—he was not admitted to bail—we serve Mr. Maggs, of Dowgate Hill—our cash-book shows his payments—it is not here—any payments he would receive from Maggs should be in this book; the entries are in his writing, and are initialed—"W. K. S." are my partner's initials, "G. A. S." his son's, "J. S. S." our principal clerk's, and "P. S." another son of my partner's; he only assisted in his brother's absence, he is not regularly in our employ—every item received by the prisoner should be entered in this book, it was his own fault if it was not—he sometimes paid over money at our office in Upper Thames Street, and sometimes at the Corn Exchange—he had to solicit orders and we paid him a third of the profit upon such orders as he brought, together with a small salary—if there was a loss, his commission was deducted—our principal business is with corn dealers—the prisoner was town traveller, and had to go about to all parts of London—I heard that he called at the office after he was discharged, and my partner's son told me that he once saw him at the Corn Exchange—I never saw him, or I should have given him into custody—it was four or five weeks after he was discharged that he was given into custody—I gave him in charge—I met him in a court in Lombard Street, and he made some remark about his coming down to square accounts and so forth; however, I looked for a policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 22, Castle Street, Long Acre—I am a commissionaire, and I was stationed at Long's Hotel, Bond Street, in May—while I was there, Atkins came up to me and gave me an undirected envelope; he had a moustache at that time—he asked me whether I knew Mr. Farquhar's bank in St. James's Street—I said "Yes"—he said "Take this letter to Mr. Farquhar's Bank, and bring me back an answer at Verrey's Café, in Regent Street, I shall be there with two ladies"—as I was going away he said "When you get it, don't you lose it"—I said that I would not—I went to the bank and delivered the envelope to Mr. Smallman, the cashier—after waiting a little while I received an envelope in answer, addressed to "Captain Candy," I took it to Verrey's, but did not find Atkins there—I looked about for him, and as I was coming out a well<lb/>dressed young gentleman walked in and called for a glass of wine—that was Valero—I stood outside waiting for Captain Candy—Valero called a cab from the opposite side of the street, and when the cab came across he said to me "Have not you been to Farquhar's bank for Captain Candy?"—I said "Yes, sir, I have, I was to meet him here in company with two ladies"—he said "Captain Candy is engaged, he can't come, he sent me to fetch the note"—I gave him the letter, as he mentioned Captain Candy's name, and said "I hope it is quite correct"—he said "Oh, yes, it is quite correct"—he gave me a half-crown, got into the cab and drove towards Waterloo Place—I have not a particle of doubt about the two prisoners being the persons I have spoken of—on 31st July, I went down to Good<lb/>wood Races with the officers in the case—I saw Valero there, and identified him, and he was taken in custody—I had seen him again before I saw him at Goodwood, and took a letter for him to a gentleman at Shepherd's Bush, between 7 and 8 o'clock on Saturday night—at that time I knew him as the person I had seen in Regent Street.</p>

I live at 18, Golden Square, and am a lithographer, and expert in handwriting—I have had a large experience in handwriting for the last thirty years; I have made it a study—I have seen all the documents put in, and examined and compared them thoroughly, and in my judgment they are in the handwriting of the person who signs himself "F. Wheeler" in the letters to Mr. Johnson; also the cheque for 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the letter left at the club, and the two letters to Mr. Poole, they are all undoubtedly in the same handwriting—I would call attention to the words "I will call and see you on, "both in the letter to Mr. Johnson, and the one to Colonel Longley—I. have seen this Latin quotation in the album, it is in the same handwriting; if you look at the capital "F" in Frederick you will see it in a moment.</p>

I was on duty in Lambeth Walk about 11 o'clock—I was called into a house—I found the prisoner lying on a bed in a back parlour, evidently in much pain—a little child was in the same room, vomiting into a pail—the name of the child was Rose Alice Catherall, about six years of age—I took them both to the workhouse, where they were treated by the resident surgeon—I was told to be at the work-house about 1 o'clock on the same day, and then I took the prisoner into custody—on her way to the Police Court she made a statement—she said "I left my apartments this morning, what things I had I sold, and the rest I gave away, and I fully intended doing this"—I had told her that she would be charged at the station with attempting to murder the child and with attempting to commit suicide—she said "I bought oxalic acid for myself, and precipitate powder for the child"—she said "The child's father has ruined me, and this is my revenge"—I took her to the station—I searched the room—I found this cup and spoon and two packets—the precipitate powder was all used, but there was a little oxalic acid in the blue paper—I also found her rent-book—she had left her apartments that morning, and paid her rent.</p>

I am a wholesale trimming manufacturer—Hopper was in my service three years and a half—I found a letter from which I discovered that he had been robbing me—I sent one of our representatives to Hooker's shop with a detective—I have seen Hooker about my premises in the middle of the day, speaking to Hopper on each occasion—he had no business there connected with me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). I took Hopper—he confessed to me, and on the same day I went with Inspector Dann to Hooker's shop, 39, Com<lb/>mercial Road—I took this parcel with me, which Mr. Lewis gave me—I went in and said "Mr. Hooker"—he said "Yes"—I told him who we were, and said "Do you see that parcel"—he said "Yes"—I said "It was pur<lb/>chased of you yesterday, this gentleman bought it"—he said "Yes"—I said "How do you account for the possession of it?"—he said "I bought it with other goods of a man named Hopper"—I told him that Hopper was in custody, and had confessed to stealing a quantity of property from his employers, and stated that he, Hooker, had received some of it, and he must consider himself in custody for receiving it knowing it to be stolen, and that I was going to search his place—I commenced searching, and he said "If you will allow me, I will assist you all I can"—he jumped on the counter and kept handing the goods down which are here, and Mr. Lewin identified them—I said "Have you got any invoices or receipts for these goods?"—he said "Yes, I will show you"—he took me down in the kitchen and gave me a file with two bills on it—I said that there were none there and asked him for his book—he said ho kept no book—he also said "Last night I sent all my books to Mr. Batchelor.</p>

               <p>rooms, and he said "I will tell you the truth, Hopper came down the other night" (I think he said Friday night), "and told me there was something wrong, and assisted me to tear up all the invoices and receipts that I had from him, and at that time he always used to sign his name backwards"—he told me to put the goods away—at the Police Court he said that he would endeavour to do all he could to recover the prosecutor's property—I received further information from him which led me to Mrs. Bagnell's, 17, Lant Street, where we received about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth more.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When he showed me the pile of receipts—he said "I know now I have not got them here"—he did not say "I saw Hopper yesterday, and he told me if I gave up the articles it would be all right; but it was similar to that—I believe he said "Hopper came here on Friday night, and told me to tear up all the receipts and papers relating to the property and put the property away"—he may have said that Friday was the first intimation he had that the property was stolen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traveller to Mr. Barnett—I received instructions from him, went to Hooker's shop, and purchased some trimming and but<lb/>tons from his wife; he was not there—I paid her 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; here is the bill—I identify them as my master's property—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard wholesale, and I paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard for it, and the same with these trimmings, for which I paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I heard Hooker tell the prisoner that he bought the things of Hopper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not say he bought them as job lots—he said "In the usual way"—I do not know that City houses sell job lots at reduced prices—I have been two years in the trade—we have job lots, and make a difference off the ordinary price.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. BAGNELL</hi>. I am a widow, of 17, Compton Street, Newington—on 29th August Hooper came to me and said that his pony was tired, and he wanted to leave some parcels with me—he left five good sued parcels in my charge—they were rather heavy—I gave them to a policeman on the succeeding Tuesday, in the same state in which I received them—he has never done anything of that sort before.</p>

I went with Ham to Mrs. Bagnell's and received these parcels from her—they weigh about 40 lbs.—they have since been opened, identified, and measured—I was at Hooker's shop and heard him say that he bought them of Hopper, who represented himself as a commercial traveller—he said that he kept no books; his transactions were all cash, and did not require invoices or receipts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He said that he bought the things for ready money, and could afford to sell them at a low price.</p>
               <p>M. <hi rend="smallCaps">BARNETT</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). The prisoner brought me five parcels—I opened them at the station-house and identified the greater portion of the property—the articles which Lewin bought at 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard I could not sell under 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we never sell job lots—I never heard of job lots being sold at half price—the fringe and gimp were all wound on cards, and the buttons were in boxes, not like job lots—the value of all the property found is 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
