                  </hi>. I carry on business as a publisher at 6, Pall Mall, and have done so for 53 years—the prisoner was in my employ for about eight years as cashier and manager of the books entirely—at the time in question his salary was about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I have a private account at Ransom's, but the account of the firm, which is only myself, is at Glyn's—I may occasionally have sent cheques to Ransom's and obtained money for them—when I handed cheques to the prisoner it was his duty to pay them in to my account at Glyn's—I handed them to him for that purpose—he kept a memorandum book in which he entered what he paid in to Glyn's; this is it (<hi rend="italic">marked A</hi>).—it was open for me at any moment to look at—on 21st February I handed the prisoner this cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed Pascoe Glyn, for the purpose of paying-in to my account—I find an entry in the diary in the prisoner's writing on that date, "Glyn and Co., 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there is an entry is this pass-book, marked B,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. I first found out that matters were going wrong at the beginning of October—I gave the prisoner into custody in February this year—I had an assistant salesman named Croxford in my employ at the same time as the prisoner—they were in totally different departments; he had not been longer in my employ than the prisoner; his father had been with me about 20 years; the son had a higher salary than the prisoner, he had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, the prisoner had about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, I insured his life, and he had gifts and things—I have seen nothing of Croxford since I commenced my investigations; I don't think he has absconded—I did not dismiss him; when the catastrophe occurred he went of his own accord—he had no money owing to him when he left—he gave me no notice—the prisoner left in October, 1880; you may call it a dismissal; I dismissed the whole of them—I believed him at that time to be a thief—I did not in January this year give him a character to enable him to go into a public-house—I think the words I used were that I had no doubt he would get on, he was a very clever fellow, or words to that effect—I was not asked as to his honesty and integrity that I recollect—I heard afterwards that he did go into a public-house, and that his relatives were going to advance 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to let him go into it—I always considered this conduct of his very dishonest and ungrateful—I did not want to be bothered with a pro<lb/>secution at my time of life—I never said I considered it a matter of account—I could not have said to Mr. Martin Colnaghi that I so con<lb/>sidered it—the prisoner offered to my son to make restitution, and he accepted that offer—I did not wish to interfere in the matter; I left it in my son's hands—I don't know that I considered myself bound by my son's action if it was wrong—the real fact is I did not want to go on with the prosecution—if he made restitution I did not wish further to prosecute him—I believe he sold his wife's jewellery; I have not got it—I believe he gave up some blue china to be sold—he admitted that the whole was purchased out of the robbery he has committed on me; he,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188105020005"/>
               <p>did not admit it to me, but to my son Boydell Graves—the prisoner has not given up property to the amount 5,884<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave up a property at Lea on which there was a mortgage, and I gave my son a cheque for 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay it off—I believe that the jewellery is not sold—I believe this pass-book to be in the prisoner's writing—I saw it every ten days or a fortnight; I never thought to look at the writing, I never dreamt of a fraud—I don't say now that it is his writing, I think it is, it is like it; it did not strike me before or I should have discovered it—he has given up a number of oil paintings and engravings; the whole of them have been sold a month or so ago; they produced 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he also assigned two life policies to me; I have paid two premiums on them since I held them; I don't know that I shall continue them—Croxford's father also assigned a policy to me—I do not know that my two sons have borrowed money of the prisoner—I did not get two I O U's, one for 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my sons; it never came to my knowledge—until a notice came to me a day or two ago I did not know of any such loans; I had notice to produce the I O U'S, which I have not got—I don't know whether the prisoner was intimate with my sons—I have the general management of the business, especially of the publications.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I had every confidence in the prisoner—the total amount of his defalcations amount to 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—an accountant has gone through the books—he has restored property to the amount of about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not know that he had that property—I heard that his wife had large private means—I did not desire to prosecute him at first; when I heard that he had sold his furniture and house and kept the money I considered he was a double-dyed villain.</p>

I am barman at the Red Lion, Russell Street, Covent Garden—on 25th April, about 2.20 a.m., on the house being opened on account of the market, the prisoner came in and tendered a half-crown for some rum and milk—it felt greasy, but as I had been spreading butter, I put it in the till, and gave him four sixpences, three pence, and two halfpence—he passed the rum and milk to a man who stood in a corner of the bar, and walked out quickly, which attracted my attention, and I took it out, bent it, and found it was bad—I broke a small piece out of it, and gave both pieces to the constable—the only coins in the till were four shillings—he returned in about eight minutes, asked for a cup of coffee, and gave me another half-crown—I kept it in my hand till I had served two more people, and then I tried it, and found it bad, and got over the bar, laid hold of him, and held him till a constable came, and gave him in charge with the coins—I lost one piece.</p>

I am the wife of Arthur Cockerton, a carpenter—we live at Copenhagen Terrace, Limehouse—on Saturday, 5th March, I was in St. Paul's Road about a quarter to 1—I saw the prosecutrix there with the bag—I saw three young men come along; Davis is one of them, and Norris is the one who took the bag; I can't swear to the third one—I saw Davis give Miss Malinson a knock on the right arm—I did not see whether it was the arm on which she carried the bag—the struggle did not last long, it was very quickly done—then they all three ran away, and I did not see what became of them; they turned down the first street they came to—the prosecutrix screamed out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Buss—we keep a coffee-house at No. 187, Bow Common Lane—on Saturday, 5th March, three men came into our house at about 1.30—I can identify Davis and Vaughan; I am not sure about Norris—Vaughan had a scratch on his hand, which was bleeding; he had no hat on—they asked for three cups of coffee, and sat down in one of the boxes near the door; we keep the window shutters at the end of that box during the day—I said to Vaughan "You appear to have met with an accident," and Davis said "Yes, we have been fighting," and that in the struggle Vaughan had lost his hat—Vaughan asked me if I had an old one to give him; I told him I had not got one; he said "A sack or a bag will do"—I tried to find one, and could not—he then asked me for a newspaper; I gave him one, and he</p>

               <p>took his coat off and made a parcel of it in the newspaper, and put the parcel on his head—the two other men went out first, and Vaughan followed with this parcel on his head—no one else had been in that com<lb/>partment where the shutters are kept that morning—about three-quarters of an hour after the men had gone Inspector Godden came to my house, and I went in the box where the prisoners had been sitting—I looked behind the shutters, and found this bag; it was cut; nothing was in it—I handed it to Godden, and he took it away—Vaughan was in the house about three-quarters of an hour, Davis about half an hour, and Norris only a few minutes—I afterwards, on a subsequent occasion, saw Davis again at the police-station; he was placed among eight or nine others, and I picked him out—a few days after that I saw Norris at the police-station; he was put among others, and I picked him out—I can speak positively to Vaughan.</p>

I said "No one"—he said "If they don't pick me out I will stand to it"—I went with Sergeant Thick to Messrs. Lumley's works, Bow Common Lane, about two o'clock that same day—I spoke to Mr. Chapman, the manager and foreman, and Heldergill was called into the office—Mr. Chapman said "These are two police-officers, they wish to speak to you "Thick said to Heldergill "You had better be careful what answers you make to our questions, as we are in possession of information"—I said "Do you know a man named Vaughan?" he said "No"—I said "Do you know of the robbery committed upon a young lady in your master's employ?" he said "No, I did not put it up"—I said "No one asked you for that remark"—on the way to the station he said "I met Vaughan," and I think he said Davis, "in a public-house at Bethnal Green, and he said 'Can you put us up to anything where you are?' he said 'Yes, there is a young lady goes to the City every Saturday and fetches the money to pay the men, and I should think you might get it'"—I said "Do you know Vaughan, the person you speak of?" he said "Yes, I know Vaughan has been in trouble"—he said "I never met them again until the night of the robbery I then saw Vaughan and Davis; I said to Vaughan 'Well, you have done the job, then?' he said 'No, it was not me, it was <hi rend="italic">Mivey</hi>' (<hi rend="italic">Mivey</hi> is a nickname for Davis, I believe);' all I got out of it was a glass of ale; on the morning that I was</p>

I am a Bachelor of Medicine—I was house-surgeon at Bartholomew's Hospital when the prosecutrix was brought in—she was lying on a stretcher quite insensible—I examined her; I could not find any bruises upon her, nor any bones fractured, and the movement of all her limbs was perfectly natural—after a few minutes she began to become conscious, and when quite conscious she complained of very great pain in the left knee and hip and the lower part of her back—she was taken into one of the wards, and put to bed—next day there was a alight swelling in the knee and hip, and the day afterwards a good deal more—at first I did not think she was very much hurt, but next day she appeared very much injured—afterwards there was effusion into the knee joint, and a good deal of swelling; the whole of the left thigh was exceedingly tender and painful to the touch, the left hip joint showed signs of bruising, and there was a general shock to the system—for the first three days I could not say whether she would recover or die—it was the 12th April before she could go to the police-court, and then only with great difficulty—she is still suffering from injury to the left hip—I cannot tell whether she will recover from that; certainly not for some time—the injuries were such as would be produced by being thrown from a window; I should have expected them to have been more serious—I could not tell whether she had been drinking or not; I do not think she had.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>, I have three little children. She loves another. She was always bruising me and knocking me about. I have a black eye, and I have been stabbed with knives and forks every night I go home. She got out of the window herself. I have stopped her from doing all manner of tricks several times when she has had a drop of drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a hotel at 28, Surrey Street, Strand—on the 30th March I had been to Victoria Station; I was going home; it was rather later than 12 o'clock; I went along the Embankment to the entrance to the Temple Station, and in turning towards the Temple Station I saw two men at the foot of the steps and a woman half-way up—I had my coat buttoned as it is now—as I was going up the steps a third man that I had not seen placed his hand round my throat: I could not see his face, he was so close behind me—he then dropped his hand from my throat, and laid hold of my coat and pulled me down on my back—the two men who were at the foot of the stairs then rushed up; they ripped up my overcoat, then my under-coat—I had a watch in my waistcoat; it was attached by this chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I put my right hand over the chain; one of the men slid his hand over mine along the chain, got the watch, and twisted it off the swivel; I could not see which did it—while they were taking the watch I was shouting "Murder," and fearing I should be struck I did not get up—in a few minutes a policeman came with a man in custody—I could not see the men farther than that they went up the steps.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger—I live at 22, Bridge Street, Mile End—on 30th March I was on the Thames Embankment, going towards the City—when I was about 20 yards from the Temple Station I heard a shout and a cry of "Murder"—I went across the road; just as I got to the middle of the road a man came from the direction of the City and a man ran up to a woman; the policeman came running by, and two men ran up the Embankment towards Westminster, one on the right-hand side and one on the left—the policeman followed them in the middle of the road, crying "Stop thief"—I followed the policeman, and when he was nearly up to him the man running on the left-hand side of the road stopped; the policeman went up and took him; it was the prisoner—I came back along with the policeman—Mr. Parker was lying down on the ground; I helped to pick him up—I got the policeman's lantern and looked about on the ground and found this bar of a chain; the chain was in Mr. Parker's hand.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 286). I was on duty on the evening of 30th March near the Temple Station about 1.45—I heard a shout from the Temple Station; I could not distinctly hear what it was—I ran towards the place, and when running I heard another shout—when I got to the entrance to the Temple Station I saw the prisoner with two other men leaving the prosecutor, who was lying on the ground at the entrance to the Underground station at the foot of the steps—I saw a woman standing by the prisoner, and two other men, who on seeing me come up ran away—one ran up Arundel. Street, the other two towards Waterloo Bridge—I followed the prisoner and the other man; the prisoner separated from the other man, and I followed him alone for about 250 yards—when I was within 20 yards of the prisoner I shouted "Stop thief"—he stopped, turned round, and asked what was the matter—I ran up to him and took him into custody—I told him he would have to come back as there had been a man robbed—he said he did not do it—I said, "What were you running for?"—he said, "I was running after the other man"—there was no man running in front of him—the prisoner was dressed as he is now—I brought him back to the prosecutor, who was still lying on the ground, and he said, "That is the man," or "One of the men"—I asked him what had happened—he said he had lost his watch—I think the chain was lying on the man's breast—I took this bar off the boy—he searched for the bar and handed it to the pro<lb/>secutor—I do not remember seeing the boy till I got back to the prosecutor; he might have been there, but I had not time to see him—the prisoner was taken to the station and charged; he said nothing—it was a cold, sharp night, and moonlight.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "April 25th, 1881. Stevens says, About 9.30 p.m. on Friday, the 22nd, Witherington came to me and said, "Cosher, there is a box of money in No. 7 arch;" he said "I have knocked it down into the dock and covered it over with straw." About half an hour after, he came up to me again, and said "I am going to get a basket to put it in, and I will brine it up to you, I left it in the second recess by the second column." About three quarters of an hour after, he brought it up into my cabin in a basket, and left it there. In about a quarter of an hour he came up and said, "Have you anything I could break it open with?" I said "You may find something in there." He went into the cabin and broke it open, I was outside</p>

He went in the hut and pulled a bag out of the box, and gave me about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I spent.' Witherington says: 'About 3 p.m. on Friday, April 22nd, I saw a box of money similar to the one produced, in No. 7 arch on the bank. About 8 p.m. Stevens asked me to fetch the box from No. 7 arch to his hut. I did not fetch it, but Stevens did, and took it into his hut and opened it. Stevens told his mate he was going into his hut to knock a few nails in to mend it. About 10 minutes past 11 p.m. he called me into the lift, and we went into his hut. I saw the box open, and two bags of money lying on the ground. Stevens's mate came to the hut, but Stevens would not let him go in, but handed him his coat out. About 11.30 p.m. I went into the hut used by Stevens; he was there, as also John Gray. They both had their trousers and coat pockets full of coppers; Gray said to me "You take some." I said I did not want to take any. Gray said "You take this outside," at the same time hand<lb/>ing me about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in new coppers. We then booked off duty. Stevens and I wanted to go back with, the other men, but Gray would not. We (Stevens, Gray, and myself) walked to Spitalfields Church, Gray leaving us there. Stevens and I then went for a walk to Commercial Road, where Stevens met a friend, and said to me "Give me the coin you have got." and I did so. He handed me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver for them. He also handed me a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and half-a-crown of his own money, and asked me to mind them for him till the next morning. This I promised to do, and then I went home. I gave him that back when I came to work on Saturday morning.'") Sergeant Herron found the box produced—it was brought into my office and shown by me to the prisoners.</p>

Open the door," and the prisoner said "Nothing much, you are not wanted here;" with that my husband said "If you do not open the door I shall burst it open," and my husband burst the door open, and we both entered the room together—I saw Mr. Wegener sitting on the bed, and Mrs. Wegener standing between the door and the window—I helped her into a chair—she was bleeding from the outer part of the left ear; the ear had been cut—Mr. Wegener went to the cupboard, and fetched some sticks out and lit the fire, and made some hot water, and I fomented the ear—Mrs. Wegener then said "I think I will go to bed, I feel very cold;" I said "Do so"—she was quite sensible—the prisoner had been drinking; I do not think he knew what he was about—he lit the fire—when Mrs. Wegener got into bed he was in bed—she was quite sober—I went back to my own bed—I returned again about 6.30, and on going into the room I saw Mrs. Wegener lying on the bed (I had not heard any disturbance between the two times); I asked her how she was, and she made no answer, and I went to my husband—I returned to the room, and found her insensible; in consequence of that my husband sent me for a surgeon, and I fetched one—I noticed her head again before I went for a surgeon; there was a blow on the left side of the skull which had not been there before when I saw her—the doctor was there almost as soon as I got back, about 7.30; he proceeded to examine her—I saw nothing lying in the window-sill—the prisoner had lived in the same house with his wife for about seven years, and we have lived there too—since I have known them they have lived on affectionate terms together until Christmas—since Christmas he has been drinking—I never knew them have any unhappy words until this night—he was a very kind, affectionate husband, and she was kind to him.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—on the morning of 22nd March last I was in bed with my husband—I was woke early in the morning; my husband struck me a blow on the side of my ear—there had been no angry words between us before going to bed—I had been out with him that evening, and returned between 11.30 and 12 o'clock—up to the time of going to bed we were on entirely affectionate terms—when I went to bed my husband went out and got himself some tobacco and some more beer; he drank some at the bar, and some he brought home—I do not know how much he brought home, for I was asleep when he came home—after he hit me the first blow I remember nothing else—I recollect Mr. and Mrs. Moulford coming in—my husband lit the fire, and made some hot water for Mrs. Moulford to bathe my ear—when I got into bed my husband was sitting on the side of the bed—Moulford and his wife got into the room by breaking the door open—then my husband got into bed, before I got in; I said I was cold, and I got in—I remember nothing else for a day or two—I was not aware of having a second blow—I do not recollect the surgeon coming—when I came to consciousness I was in my own bed; that would be Thursday, more than a day after it happened, as that was on Tuesday—I don't recollect receiving any blow after I got into bed again—I have been married 11 years—I have always lived on affectionate terms with my husband—we have always lived on happy terms until Christmas; since, then my hus<lb/>band has been another man, he has been taken up with nothing in the world but drink.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D., Cambridge Gardens, Kilburn. About half-past 7 on the morning of 22nd March I was called to No. 2, Rupert Street—my assistant went at once, and sent for me, and I got there about 8—I found Mrs. Wegener in an unconscious state, with a wound on the left side of the head and a fracture of the parietal, temporal, and frontal bones—there was an incised jagged wound of about 2 or 2 1/2 inches; it went through the skin and muscle—I should say the injuries must have been caused by a series of blows—I took away five or six fragments of bone from the wound, and there was excessive depression of those bones on to the membranes of the brain—I performed the operation of tre<lb/>phining, and did what I considered necessary—she recovered conscious<lb/>ness about two days afterwards—I looked on it as a very serious case—I thought she would have died, but she gradually recovered—on my first visit to the room I found this knuckle-duster on the window ledge, covered with fresh blood—such an instrument would produce the injuries; it was impossible for a fist to have done it—I asked the prisoner if he had done it with this knuckle-duster; he said "No," but he would not tell me what he had done it with—he was under the influence of drink, but knew perfectly well what he said and did; he was in a very morose, abusive condition.</p>

I said "What for?" he said "For striking my wife;" I said "Is your wife hurt?" he said "No, I dont't know that she is"—I said "Where and when did it take place?" he said "Only a short time ago, at my house, No. 2, Rupert Road"—I noticed that he was the worse for drink—I asked what he struck her with; he said with his fist—I called a constable and told him to go with the prisoner to his house, and they left together—he returned with the prisoner in custody in about a quarter of an hour—he said "She had been out whoring, and I struck her."</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "My wife and I had been drinking together at the Albert Edward public-house, and returned home about 12 at night, taking home some beer with us; we went to bed, and while in bed had some angry words; I got out of bed and struck her on the side of the head with the knuckle-duster; Mrs. Moulford then came into the room and washed the wound: we went to bed again; about 5 we had some more words, and I struck her on the head, which caused the wound there; I did not strike her on that occasion with the knuckle-duster, and I will not say what I did strike her with; I was to be hung; if the rope had not broke I should have hung myself, and have saved you the trouble of bringing me here.")</p>

My mother died in Caterham Asylum, and my father was raving mad; he had something the matter with his head; he died at Guy's Hospital. If I have any trouble, or drink, I hardly know what I am doing, and I can't work. I send in my patterns all wrong. I believe it is the drink that has caused it. It seems to me like a dream. This knuckle-duster has been knocking about the place these 26 years. I am a moulder, and I picked this thing out of some ruins, and drilled a hole in it to make another from it. I never used it before or offered to use it; I don't know that I used it then, but as the doctor says there was blood and hair on it I can't deny it.</p>

               <p>never came into the vestry or the study—I once saw her going out of church with the congregation—my sister also attended the services, and sometimes my mother, Lady Dunbar—it is not true that I ever drank whisky in the church with Mrs. Foote—I never kissed her in my life—I never drove home with her from St. Andrew's Church—I never saw her there on a week day—I never knew of drinking in the church, but they had refreshments—I had been ill more or less for a long time, and had to take nourishment, and I used to have some wine there beaten up with egg before service—Mr. Fagg assisted Mr. Williamson, and they had to direct large numbers of circulars and do other work—Mr. Fagg lived at Slough and Mr. Williamson at Westbourne Park, and when they chose they had their supper there: chicken and duck—the room is not part of the church—a petition was filed in 1880 against me by my wife for a judicial separation—there were some writs against me—an illegitimate sister of my wife sued me, the verdict went against me, and I was unable to pay—I lived at the Russell Club, and had a bedroom there, and when the club was dissolved, some of Mrs. Foote's friends suggested that I should take a very small house of hers in Prince's Square instead of going into lodgings, and Mr. Williamson and I lived there for some time—my health got worse there—everybody who knew me knew that I lived there—I was only pressed by one creditor at that time, who was paid, and by Mrs. Reeves—an operation was about to be performed on me, and the doctor thought I ought to have quiet and rest—I went to an hotel at Windsor for one day, and found it too expensive, and Mrs. Foote offered that Williamson and I should go to Gloucester Place, and I accepted her offer—the operation was performed there, but it was not intended to be—my sister was sent for, but I did not tell her the exact day, because I did not wish her to know—she assisted in nursing me throughout, but she was in extremely delicate health—she had been living with me some time, but the annoyance of these Wentworth people made her quite ill—Mrs. Firman came and stayed a week or 10 days—I returned to Prince's Square on a Sunday, and Mrs. Foote visited me there and my sister and Mrs. Firman—I was confined to my bed, and was dreadfully ill for about six weeks, and ill for a long time after—when I got better I went to Mrs. Foote's house in Porchester Terrace once or twice—I think that was after an early dinner—I did not stay very late—I went with Mr. Williamson, I forget whether he left before me or not, I have heard that he did—Mrs. Foote's nephew was there—I forget whether he went with us, I think he was there when I arrived—there never was the slightest shadow of impropriety or familiarity between me and Mrs. Foote—I remember kissing my sister as she left the church in Tavistock Place in a cab or carriage—she was not very often there, she is very delicate, and cannot walk even a short distance, so she was prevented from coming very often—I have not kissed other ladies there—my wife's petition was heard in February last, and I heard what the defendant swore about the familiarity between me and Mrs. Foote—there is not the faintest truth in it—I was called at the trial and so was Mrs. Foote, and the Jury were satisfied, and stopped the case, and dismissed it.</p>

After hearing that letter I swear that it was a loan to my wife alone—I went through the Bankruptcy Court, and I have filed a petition against my wife for the restitution of conjugal rights—from that church I went to Prince's Square, and had Wednesday evening services in the conservatory there, but it was not open to the public, only to the class—Williamson attended there, but not us an official—I do not know whether Fagg attended—I afterwards had religious services at St. Andrew's Hall, Newman Street, and Williamson attended there as sacristan, and Fagg also—from there I went to a private chapel in Fitzroy Square—I do not remember Williamson taking part in any service there—Mrs. Firman did not come to Gloucester Place till after the operation, nor do I think my sister did, and it is very possible that for three days and nights Mrs. Foote and I were living and sleeping in that house—from Prince's</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Oxford M.A., and a clergyman of the Church of England—I went to St. Andrew's Church about eighteen months ago, and acted for Mr. Dunbar in some of the offices occasionally when he was away—I have seen Mrs. Foote there but do-not know her by any name: I only saw her at the end of the time she was there; I thought she was Miss Dunbar; I am quite sure she is the person—by the end of the time I was there, I mean about a month or six weeks before</p>

               <p>the church was finally closed; I should not like to be sure to a month, I think it was about April last year—whether I have seen the Arch<lb/>deacon kiss her is a question I should not like to answer; to the best of my belief I have, but I will not swear I have—I have seen him hand Mrs. Foote into a cab at the church porch; it might have been only once or it might be more—I should not like to swear he kissed her; I am afraid of an Indictment—I am not doubtful of the person; I thought she was Miss Dunbar—I am sure of the person, but not so sure of the kiss—as a man of the world I have no doubt about it—I have seen that occa<lb/>sionally I believe; it might only have been once or it might have been two or three times; I cannot remember; it was on Sunday evening I believe—I occasionally officiated on Wednesday evening, and I believe Mrs. Foote came there on one Wednesday, but I am not sure; I do not recollect speaking to her on any Wednesday evening—I know a room which has a little piece of paper pasted over the door, "The Rev. Arch<lb/>deacon Dunbar's private study"—there was no regular place to keep anything—I have seen smoking and drinking in the study—I have seen Mr. Jacquet smoke there, and I believe an Austrian nobleman, I under<lb/>stood it was an Austrian title he had, and also Williamson and Fagg—I have occasionally seen females there; I was introduced to one lady up there; I don't know whether she was a relation of Williamson or Fagg—there was a drawer there which was full of playing cards, there was a large table with a marble cover and a drawer to it, and occasionally the small vestments, such as stoles, maniples, and bands, were there, and the cards also—I have never seen anybody playing with the cards in the room, but I have seen them handled by one of the acolytes, Weller.</p>

I am a cab proprietor of 44, Walton Street, Clerken<lb/>well—on 15th December the prisoner came to me and asked for employ<lb/>ment—he produced this licence—he gave no name, we always suppose that it is the name on the licence—this 9th January was on it and "5 feet 4 inches," and this endorsement except my name, I put that myself—he said that he had been driving for Mr. Rintoul for some months—I asked him how he managed to tear the licence—he said that one of his children got hold of it and tore it, and he plastered this piece of paper over it—I employed him with cab 5994, it was 74 Midland, and he brought it back the following morning about 5 a.m.—I kept the licence till 14th February, when I took it to Scotland Yard.</p>

I am the wife of John Reeves, of 210, Arlington Road, Camden Town—about 12 on Friday, 25th March, Bryant asked me to buy a box—I told him I did not mind, but asked him if it was perfectly safe—he said it was as far as he knew—he asked 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I paid him the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked me to buy a hat for my daughter—I said I did not mind—he said he would send his friend with it—his friend came, and I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Bryan asked me to buy some clothing at the same time he brought the empty box into my house—I told him I did not mind, but I would see it—the stranger brought the clothing, and I was to pay him 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Bryan received 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from me on the Saturday—he lodged in my house—he said his friend's sister was gone over to America with a gentleman, who would provide her with plenty of clothing—he said he wanted the money to give it to the man—the same night the police came and apprehended him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The man said "My sister has gone to America, and left me these things"—afterwards, when I spoke to Bryant about the under-clothing, he said "My friend's sister has gone away to America with a gentleman, and that gentleman will provide for her, and provide her with things, she does not want these things"—I have known Bryant three years—he is a respectable man—he works for the Gas Company—I do not know the price of a box like this, I never bought one—the prisoner has lodged with me a year and 10 months—he said "I would not like to see you doing anything wrong"—he was not present when the other man came—he was about 10 minutes in the house on the Saturday when he asked me for the 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said the man wanted it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Chief Clerk at Westminster Police-court—I was present on 15th February when William Irving was charged with stealing a purse and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the property of Charles Rowe, from the person of Estella Rowe—this is the charge sheet—Estella Rowe was the first witness called—I took down her evidence; she signed it—Henry Catley, a porter at the District Railway Station, was called on the same day, and I took his deposition; also Henry Durrant, a constable, and Sarah Vernon (the prisoner)—she has changed in appearance since then—she was sworn in the ordinary way—this is her deposition. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that she lived at</hi> 5, <hi rend="italic">Blue Heart Court, Bell Alley, London Wall; that she did not know the prisoner, and never saw him before to her knowledge, and that when the prosecutrix asked her to come to the station she was quite alone</hi>.) She was recalled after Osborne gave evidence, and stated: "I saw them go away together in a third-class carriage"—then Vernon, who had been in Court, was recalled, and said "I positively swear that not to my knowledge did I ever see the prisoner till the lady said he had taken her purse. It is a mistake to say I was on Hammersmith platform with him. I had not been on Hammersmith platform that afternoon. The prisoner did not call me into the same compartment with him. I have not spoken to the prisoner since he has been in custody"—in cross-examination she said "I gave instructions to the defendant's solicitor to defend the prisoner; the fee was half paid by me and half by a friend. I had a conversation with a friend of the prisoner, who said he wished he could afford Counsel, and I said I had been suspected myself, and that</p>

               <p>was the reason I paid half the fee. I did it out of pity"—then there was a remand till the 22nd—on the remand Vernon did not appear—the case was further remanded till the 25th—she did not appear then—on the 25th Urban, another inspector was called, and the prisoner was com<lb/>mitted to take his trial at Middlesex Sessions on 7th March.</p>

On 14th February William Irving was brought to the station about 8.45—I entered the charge—the prisoner came in with Irving and the prosecutrix—she said "I was on the platform, and the lady first accused me of having had the purse. I know nothing of the purse and I do not know the man; I think the lady must make a mistake about him having the purse; I came here partly because she accused me and partly on behalf of this poor man"—she gave her name Sarah Vernon, 5, Blue Hart Court, Bell Alley, London Wall—Irving was detained and taken before a Magistrate the next day—the prisoner attended as a witness—she told me she would do so and said Irving was a total stranger to her, and that she never saw the man before.</p>

On 14th February I was on special duty at Hammersmith Police-court—it was the day of the boat-race—I saw Irving on the platform of the District Railway about 3.20—I saw the prisoner with him; I saw them speaking together—I watched them—the prisoner tapped Irving on the shoulder with her right hand, he turned shortly round; she said something to him and he looked towards me, and they walked down the platform—he sat on a seat and she stood at the other end—I was in plain clothes—Irving got into a carriage; he beckoned to her and she followed him—they went away in the same compartment—the train went towards the Mansion House—I called Osborne's attention to them—he is a travelling inspector—I got out of the train at South Kensington and spoke to a gentleman—they were in the train then together—I got out at Westminster and at Charing Cross—I am quite sure the prisoner is the woman I saw with Irving—I saw them from 20 to 25 minutes at Hammersmith Station—I afterwards attended at Westminster and gave evidence that I saw Irving and the prisoner together—I cannot say I know her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The boat-race was between Hanlan and Laycock—there were a good number of persons at Hammersmith—persons were returning from the race—I gave evidence against Vernon on 25th of February and 25th March—I do not know whether I said at the police-court that the man beckoned—that has not occurred to me since—I do not recollect saying I saw them together in the carriage—my memory has not improved since.</p>

               <p>to be quarrelling; I watched them—Irving got into a third-class carriage and beckoned to the prisoner—he said "Come on;" she appeared to object—then he got in and called her in—no one else was then in that compartment—she got in and went to the opposite side of the carriage while he sat next the door—the train started—I saw them speaking together side by side—the compartment was then full—I did not go by the train—after Irving was given in custody I attended before Mr. Partridge, and after my evidence the prisoner gave her evidence—she was recalled—I am quite sure she is the woman I saw there—I noticed her at the back of the Court—I believe I have seen her before, but I do not know her—I have seen them both before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant E</hi>). On 7th April last I apprehended the prisoner at the corner of St. Mark's Road, Camberwell, about 350 yards from 45, Grosvenor Park—I had ascertained that he was living there—I was in company with another officer—I said to him "Mr. Powell, I believe?"—he said "Yes"—I said "We are two detective officers, and are going to arrest you for being at large when on return from transportation in the name of Leeson"—I took hold of his arm—he said "What name did you say?"—I said "Leeson"—he said "Don't hold me, I will go with you"—after we had gone a little way he said "A convict! that is nice, very nice! this is a mistake, and a very un<lb/>pleasant one for me"—we got into a cab, and on the way he said "I suppose it is no use my asking you gentlemen at whose instigation this is?"—he was taken to Bow Street Station, and from there to Tot<lb/>tenham Court Road—he was there placed with about eight or ten other persons, and Superintendent Thompson picked him out as Charles Leeson—next morning I examined the prisoner's arms; on the left arm there was an urn tattooed, something after this style (<hi rend="italic">producing a paper</hi>)—this is a sketch of it that I made—on the right arm there was a cross with the letters "C. G." or "G. G." on the top, and under it "I. H. S." and "M. M."—I subsequently went to 45, Grosvenor Park, Walworth, with Inspector O'Callaghan, and assisted to search the place—O'Callaghan found what he will produce.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now Superintendent of the E Division—in 1866 I was an Inspector of the Detective Department at Scotland Yard; in that year I arrested two persons in London connected with a charge of breaking and entering a warehouse in the country—the prisoner is one of those persons—I knew him then in the name of Charles Leeson; he was then keeping a beershop in the Kennington Road—I arrested him there; I took him to the police-station in a cab—he was afterwards charged before Sir Thomas Henry—I was present and saw him, and again on remand, and then I took him to Manchester—I saw him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188105020069"/>
               <p>when he was examined there before the Magistrate from time to time, and was present at his trial with three others before Mr. Justice Blackburn; the trial lasted several days—I was in Court from day to day and saw him there—I have no doubt whatever that he is the man—I produce the certi<lb/>ficate of his conviction; his sentence was 15 years' penal servitude—he had been previously convicted as Charles Kelly in August, 1858, and sentenced to seven years (<hi rend="italic">These certificates were put in and read</hi>)—I think I saw him afterwards at Millbank with the others, but I am not sure—in April last I saw him at the Tottenham Court Road Police-station in custody—there were a number of other persons there—I recognised him at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The arrest was early in September, 1866—I had seen him previous to that—I had occasion to keep observation on him for three weeks or a month—I was present at his trial with three others—it lasted four days—I believe I saw him after at Millbank for a few minutes or half an hour, early in 1867—since then I have never seen him till this year—I stated in cross-examination in April that on taking the Manchester convict in September, 1866, I went with him to the station in a cab with Sergeant Potter and a private constable—I said, "I am less sure about Potter being there, and still less sure about the private constable"—I think I also said there was another constable, but I could not give his letter or number—I have no doubt Potter was there—I think what I said was that I was less sure of Potter than I was of the constable; I did not say I was not sure of him—I said to Sir James Ingham that to the best of my belief the prisoner was the man—my belief at the time was very strong; I am, if possible, more sure to-day—I said at the Tottenham Court Road Station, "My belief is a very strong one that you are the man, but I should be unwilling to swear with absolute certainty"—I do not remember a case of the police being put on taking a convict into custody 13 years after his conviction; such cases have happened, I can't call them to mind at this moment—I do not know the statute by which whoever shall discover and prosecute to conviction in such a case shall be entitled to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward—I am not the author of first looking after the prisoner; the information was sent to the Director of Criminal Investigations, who referred the matter to me, and in the ordinary course of police duty I placed the case in the hands of O'Callaghan and subject to my directions he acted in the matter—I gave him no directions till Powell was in custody—it was to some extent without my cognisance that he forced his way into a private house, and laid his hands on a woman, and took away papers—I should say that is a thing not done without a warrant—I do not know the exact number of persons who have been taken to Newgate to try and identify the prisoner; I should think over 10—the larger portion have not identified him—I do not know that the Governor of Newgate differs from the police as to the marks on the prisoner; it has not been reported to me—I do not know the exact period when transportation ceased. I should think about 1865.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief warder of Her Majesty's Prison at Walton, near Liverpool—I know the prisoner—I produce a certificate of the conviction of Charles Gleeson in October, 1854, at the Liverpool Quarter Sessions; the prisoner is the person—I was present at the trial—he was sentenced to be imprisoned for two years with hard labour and to be whipped—he served his term in the Walton Prison; during these two years I saw him every day, and very often several times a day—I saw him after the expiration of that sentence, in December, 1866, at the Manchester Assizes, when he was tried in the name of Charles Leeson, and sentenced to 15 years' penal servitude—I then proved this conviction against him—I recently went to Newgate—I saw about 30 persons there, the prisoner amongst them; I pointed him out to the governor—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man—I knew him before 1854.</p>

The charge against you now is that you are at large while under sentence of transportation;" he said "They have told me that already, it is very vague"—I said "We believe that as Charles Leeson you were convicted at Manchester for a stamp robbery in 1866, and sentenced to 15 years' transportation, and that you escaped from Western Australia in 1869;" he said "I have heard all you say, and I say nothing"—I was present when he was formally charged at the station—he was asked by the inspector his age, name, and address; he said "I decline to make any statement what<lb/>ever"—after he was in custody he was visited by a woman in the cell—before she came I went to 45, Grosvenor Road, Camberwell—I there saw that same woman—I found a safe there, and at my request she opened it, and I found there these documents, amongst them these two receipts.</p>

Chad wick's, is in custody; where is the paper?"—Coker said nothing, but took us into a room at the back of the shop and showed us a quantity of paper piled up on shelves, 110 reams—Downs said "Have you any invoices or receipts?"—he made no reply, but produced the receipt.

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of 51, Bear Street, Hackney Wick—on 10th April, about a quarter to 12 p.m., I was in Whitechapel Road, standing about a yard and a quarter from a coffee-stall, looking down the road for a tram—I saw the two prisoners and some other men—the prisoners whispered together, and Stokes came up and asked me where I was going—I said, "I want to go to Well Street, Hackney"—they whispered together a second time, and Stokes came up and punched me on my nose, it bled, and saturated these two handkerchiefs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), one of which I had to take off my neck—Pepperell then came behind me and put his hand in my left trousers pocket and took my watch and chain out—I snatched the watch away from him, and he went away to the lamp-post, and said, "It is no b—good "—I walked up to him and snatched a piece of my chain from him—he ran away with about nine inches of it, here is the remainder of it; it is gold—I know Pepperell by the brown mole on his face—I picked Stokes out at the station on 14th April from several others directly I went into the room—I have no doubt as to their being the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been to No. 58, New Road, to see my young woman—I left her about 11.30—I looked at my watch in the street two or three times after I left her, and I looked at the hospital clock when I was waiting for the car—there were about 25 men round the coffee-stall, as the public-houses were closed—a young man who saw it done went with me to the station—I have not seen him here to-day—I did not hear him say, "I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Pepperell was sitting at the back of the police-station dock when I identified him—I have no doubt he is the man—this affair occupied about 10 minutes—I was standing up and saw Pepperell go to the lamp—I did not suffer much pain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver and manager in the service of Mrs. Berry, of 36, High Holborn—on 21st February, on returning to the shop about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I found the two prisoners there talking to Mrs. Berry—in their presence she handed me this coin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and asked if we could make dies to produce this—I examined it and saw it purported to be a coin of Russia or Poland, and I said "I don't think we are justified in doing so"—I consulted with Mrs. Berry, and finally told the prisoners to call again—before leaving I asked Scawitz for his name—he spoke to me; the other could not speak English—Lowensohn wrote on this card "R. Lowensohn," and Scawitz gave me the address, which I added, "5, Little Holloway Street, Commercial Road"—on their leaving Mrs. Berry went to Scotland Yard, and when she returned a letter was written to this address—next day the prisoners came and ordered two dies and paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit; I asked four guineas for them, they would not pay more than three, and I agreed to that—Scawitz always referred to Lowensohn in the conversation—Lowensohn paid the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit—I told him the things would be ready in about ten days—they gave me some wooden models to show the way in which they were to be made, but they would have been too expensive, and I induced them to adopt the English mode—they said they must be exact to the coin, the same thickness and everything—at that time I was acting under the directions of the police in what I did—Scawitz said he could not pay more than three guineas, because he had got no more money coming from Russia, he had written for that and no more—this was on 26th or 27th February—the dies were promised for the 3rd of March, but they were not ready then—on Monday, 7th, they called and the dies were then finished—these are they (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I showed them to</p>

               <p>them on that day—at that time the two letters M and W, at the foot of the eagle, were not engraved on the die, and they said that those two letters must be put in, as it must be exact to the pattern—Scawitz looked at it first and showed it to the other—I could see that the letters were not cut in—they called again about half-past four that afternoon; in the meantime I had put the letters in, and they were pointed out to them—I struck this impression on copper, later in the day, from the die, and showed it to them when they called—there was a certain mishap in the reverse die, which made a mark at the back, which they did not like; it was something very trifling on the edge of the coin, but they noticed it, and I agreed to have it altered and have it finished by 9.30 that same evening—they said they were going to start for Hamburg the next morning—Scawitz filed the reverse side of the copper impression and showed it to me, and asked if I could see any difference in it—I said "Yes, it resembles the pattern very much now"—he said "Yes, is it not good?"—the filing produced the effect as if it had been in wear a good deal—I handed to them the two dies and this collar, which I had also made by their instruction—the dies fit into it—Lowensohn paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which, with the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit, made 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him a receipt—when they left the premises they were taken into custody—everything I did was under the direction of the police and communicated to them.</p>

On Tuesday, 19th April, at 9 p.m., I saw the prisoner and prosecutor together in the Three Kingdoms public-house, Lower Thames Street—I watched them—I noticed when the prosecuter left the public-house he was wearing a chain on his waistcoat—I followed them to another public-house, where they remained about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes—when they came out I followed them to Billiter Street; they remained in conversation for some 5 or 10 minutes in rather a dark portion of Billiter Street—it appeared to me that the prisoner was buttoning up the prosecutor's coat, or doing something to it—they then left Billiter Street and I followed them to the Liverpool Street Railway Station; they there bade one another "Good night" and parted—I spoke to the prosecutor, and from what he said I followed the prisoner and stopped him—I told him I was a police-officer, and that he would be charged with stealing a watch and chain from the person—he said it was a mistake—I took him back to the prosecutor, who said "You have got my watch;" he said "It is a mistake, I have not got it—I said to the prosecutor "Will you give him into custody?" he said "Well, I am not quite certain he has got it"—I then put my hand into the prisoner's right-hand coat pocket, and produced the watch and chain—I said "What's this?" he made no answer—the prosecutor identified it—I took the prisoner to the station; he made no answer to the charge—he as sober—the prosecutor was under the influence of drink, but knew what he was saying and doing.</p>

I am a surgeon at Park Place, Greenwich; I am also divisional surgeon to the police—on. 21st February, about 12.30 a.m., I was sent over to the police-station in Park Road to attend to Bell—he was completely covered with mud, and was bleeding from the little finger of the right hand—he was sitting in a chair; he could move with difficulty—he complained of being in pain all over—I examined him; there were no bones bones broken—I dressed his linger and ordered him to be put to bed—it was a small wound just on top of the finger—I attended him the following morning—he was in bed and could not move without great pain—his knee was injured, either by a kick, a fall, or a blow from a stick, or from some violent force—he is getting better, but suffered a great deal from standing about at the police-court and here—he has been under my care since 22nd February—he was in bed nearly six weeks, and unable to get up—he will not be able to attend to his duty for a month yet—there were other tender parts, but no other bruises.</p>

John Cain struck me a blow in the eye and another in the right side. I did not take much notice of it at the time. On Sunday the pain passed away, but on Tuesday the pain was so great I could not get out of bed. On Friday I was brought here and I have been here ever since." <hi rend="italic">By the Prisoner.</hi> "Now, Annie, on your dying oath, did I strike you any place about your body?

                  </hi>. I am the assistant-master of the Greenwich Work-house—I have known the prisoner for about a year and a half—he was an inmate of the workhouse in September, 1879—about March, 1880, a charge was made against him of stealing tools—I was a witness in the case, and gave evidence at the police-court, and also at this Court: he was convicted and sentenced to twelve months with hard labour; that was 24th March last year—I saw nothing of him from that time until this occurred—on 24th March I went to bed about 12 o'clock that night—after I had gone to sleep I woke up and found myself struggling with the prisoner—I felt some blood running down my head and neck—when I was conscious I was out of bed, at the foot of the bed, struggling with him—I had hold of his right hand; I saw a chopper in it; I tried to keep it away from me—he seemed to try to throw it at me, but I succeeded in throwing him down on a box behind the door; I pushed him back on the box, and was kneeling over him, and a rush of blood came from my head, but I succeeded in getting the chopper from him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believe this was between 3 and 4 o'clock—I had a small glimmer of gas in the room—when I got it from him he said "Kill me, Mr. Prowse, kill me"—I told him to keep there and I would lock him in, and I went out and aroused the store<lb/>keeper, Mr. Hughes—no one came to me—I ran out of the room, along the corridor, and up the next floor to Mr. Hughes's room—I did not go back to the room again—I saw the doctor, my wounds were dressed, and I was carried up to a spare room—I had three wounds on the head, one on my back, and my fingers were cut, and my left arm was bruised—I heard the statement the prisoner made at the police-court—it is not true that I met and taunted him after he was discharged—I never saw him till this morning, when I had hold of him.</p>

"On Thursday, 24th March, I left my lodgings in Great Charlotte Street, Blackfriar's Road, about 5.45 a.m. I walked down on the Middlesex side as far as Barking, seeking employment. I crossed the water at North Woolwich. I was walking along the Trafalgar Road about 8.30 p.m. I met Mr. Prowse; he asked me when I was liberated. I told him upon the previous Monday. He asked me i! I was doing anything; I replied "Not at present." He then told me he supposed I had gone down to give the carpenter's shop another turn, but, was he in my place, he would make sure of a market, that I should not get off with 12 months'. I went into the British Queen and had two glosses of ale. Not having had any for 14 months, it took effect on me, and, with the excitement caused by Mr. Prowse's taunts, I was not conscious of what I was either saying or doing. When I was brought to the police-station I was in such a state of excitement that the superintendent deemed it necessary to place a guard over me the whole of the day, and on my removal in the police-van to the House of Deten<lb/>tion the same constable was sent there in the van sitting alongside of</p>

On 18th March I went with Prince to the Neptune Chemical Works—Mr. Dickenson sent for Wellbourne, and said "Wellbourne, I am very sorry to find you have been selling my tar; these are two police officers, and I intend to give you into custody for robbing me "—I told him he would have to go to Lewisham Police-station with us—he sat down in chair for a minute or two, and then looked up to Mr. Dickenson and said "Yes, I have sold two lots to a builder at Perryhill"—Mr. Dickenson asked him what lots, and what day it was (Prince cautioned him just as he began to make the statement)—he said he did not remember the day, but he nearly filled the runlet; that the builder asked him how much he was to give him, and he said 'The same as you gave my mate,' and he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Mr. Dickenson said "You were seen down there last Monday"—he said "Yes, that was the last lot I left; I filled the runlet, and put some in a tub; the builder was riot there at the time; I went across to the buildings and saw the builder, and he came back with me and saw what I had put in the tubs, and he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I said 'This won't do for me,' and he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more; I should not have sold him any had he not pressed me; he spoke</p>

On Friday, 18th March, I went with Elcome to Blythe Hill Terrace, Winchester Road, Lewisham—we were in plain clothes, and met Mr. Walker leaving his house—I told him we were police constables, and were going to take him into custody for feloniously receiving a quantity of tar from one of Mr. Dickenson's carmen on the 14th—I cautioned him that anything he said might be used in evidence against him—he replied "Yes, but I do not understand why I should be charged, as I paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the three lots I received from two carmen; I met the carmen in the road and asked them if they could supply me, which they did; I gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the first cask and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the second, but it was not quite filled; I was not present when the third lot was left, which I gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for; the carman went down to my works and left the tar, filled the cask, and partly filled a small tub; he then came across to my works, and I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., telling him that that squared the lot; Wellbourne said 'No, this won't do for me and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more"—I asked him if he had got any receipts for the money—he said "No"—I took him to the station and found Wellbourne there in custody—when placed in the dock Walker turned to Wellbourne and said "You have got me into a pretty mess"—Wellbourne replied "You are not going to put it all on my shoulders"—in going to the police-court in a cab next day Walker said "I wish to correct the statement I made to you yesterday; I paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for one lot, making 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in all.</p>

I am manager of the Neptune Chemical Works at Deptford—they are the property of Mr. Francis Ditton Hay—Well-bourne has been in the employ three or four years, on and off—he was in our employ on 14th March as carman—his duty was to drive the tank vans to the works at Sydenham Gas Works and back, twice a day—the tank vans hold over 400 gallons of tar, which would be emptied into a large tank underground, holding about 40,000 gallons; we have tank room for 100,000—sometimes on Saturday, to give the horses a rest, they would only go once a day—we never sell raw tar—we sell refined tar retail at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gallon if it is in small quantities; it would be cheaper in larger quantities—Mr. Hay has a contract with the Crystal Palace Com-pany—I never authorised any one to sell any of this tar—I received some information from Mr. Arless, the secretary of the Gas Company.</p>

I live at 5, Rutland Road, Catford Bridge—I am in Mr. Walker's employment, and have been for about 18 months—on Monday, 21st February, about 10 a.m., I was with him walking up Stoney Lane—we met the two carmen, Wellbourne and Killick, with their tanks, coming from the Crystal Palace Gas Works—he asked them, in the presence of both, if they could sell him some tar—they said, "Yea, sir," and asked how much he wanted—he said, "Between 30 and 40 gallons"—they asked where he wanted it—he said "In Rutland Park," and they said they would bring it—there was some tar wanted there for the damp courses; I had mentioned that to Mr. Walker—on Wednesday, the 23rd, about 10 a.m., Killick came down to the works without his van, and called to Mr. Walker and told him he could not leave the tar till he had been to the yard, and he would bring it back—Mr. Walker said, "Very well"—at this time there were several of Mr. Walker's men about the spot—about 1 o'clock Killick came with the tar, and delivered about 30 gallons—Mr. Walker asked him how much he was in his debt—he said 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—I saw 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid—nothing was said about beer—Killick asked if he would want any more—Mr. Walker said he would let him know—I was with Mr. Walker the whole of that day, assisting him, and there were 14 or 15 bricklayers on the spot—there was no attempt to conceal the tar in any way; it was there for anybody to see—after that first lot of tar had been consumed we wanted some more—I saw Wellbourne coming along the Lower Sydenham Road, near the same place as we saw him before—I asked him if he could bring us some more tar—I was alone then—on Tuesday, 2nd March, I saw Wellbourne bring the tar and put it in the tub—the workmen were on the works while he was delivering it—I did not hear Mr. Walker say anything to Wellbourne about payment that time—he brought about 14 gallons—I met Wellbourne again a few days afterwards, and asked him if he was going to bring the other tar—he said he would bring it back with him—on Monday, the 4th, I found that some more tar had been left in the tub—about 2 o'clock that day he called and saw Mr. Walker and myself, and asked how that would suit him—we went across to see what he had left, and Mr. Walker gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Wellbourne said, "This won't do for me," and he gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, and he said, "Thank you, sir," and went away—everything was done openly for anybody to see—I have an entry here in a book about the tar as it came in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We do not often have things come on the works without tickets—I am a labourer—we wanted tar for the buildings—I saw the name on the carts, "Charles Dickenson, Manager of the Neptune Company"—Walker could see it—I did not know that tar could be got at the Crystal Palace Works—I knew that these tanks came from there—I did not know that we could get it retail—this was the first time we had bought things in the street in this way—we have delivery-notes with bricks, and timber, and sand—I thought the men had a right to sell the tar, as they said they could not leave it till they had been home to the yard—I was not with Mr. Walker at Windsor; I don't know whether he came from Windsor—the runlet holds about 30 gallons and the tub about 5 or 6—no price was agreed on before the tar was delivered—Killick delivered the first lot, and Wellbourne the second and third—it was on the 23rd that Killick came, not the 22nd—I said the 22nd before the Magistrate; that was a mistake—the quantity was guessed at—I have paid 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gallon for tar, and I have paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I thought too much was paid for this—I am a son-in-law of Mr. Walker's.</p>

Kirkland came round to the side bar, where Midgley was, who said "Good morning; I have come to inquire after a man named John Coleman; what sort of man is he?" Mr. Kirkland said "He is all right as far as I know"—Midgley said "Is he honest?" Kirkland said "I never found him any otherwise"—he said "Is he sober?" Mr. Kirkland said "I never saw him drunk, and he is a very good man at business, and that is as far as I know"—Midgley said "That is good enough for me; Coleman, you can come to-morrow, and think yourself devilish lucky you have got it too, for I have had a good many applications after if this morning; you just stay clear and keep away from the girls, and keep your * * * "—Midgley called for something to drink, and treated the governor and had something himself—he then got into his cab and went away—the whole interview lasted from four to five minutes—by the work I have to do in the morning I can positively say it was not 12 o'clock—I never heard the name of Miller mentioned—Midgley did not say "How long has he been here?" I heard nothing said about seven months—Kirkland did not say "I can highly recommend him"—Midgley did not say "What is he leaving for?" nor did Kirkland reply "Trade is very quiet, I don't require him in my bar"—Midgley did not ask if he was single, nor did Kirkland reply "Yes"—when Coleman single, nor did Kirkland reply "Yes"—when Coleman came back from Midgley"s he told Mr. Kirkland in my presence why he had left so soon—I believe that was on a Sunday—David Coleman. a lighterman, who is Coleman's brother, was a customer there.</p>

I keep the Anchor and Hope beerhouse, George Row, Bermondsey—I was at the White Hart on 17th March at 11.30 or 11.40 a.m., and saw Midgley there—he did not stay five minutes; I was there all the time—he came in and said to Mrs. Kirkland "I came to inquire about a man named John Coleman; if the master at home?" she said "Yes," and he came round to the side box, and Midgley said "Good morning, Sir; I have come to inquire about a man named John Coleman; what kind of a man is he?—Mr. Kirkland said "A very good man as far as I know"—he said "Is he honest?"—Mr. Kirkland said "To the best of my belief"—he said "Is he sober?"—Mr. Kirkland said "I never saw him drunk"—Midgley said "He is good enough for me; Coleman, you can come to-morrow; you ought to think yourself devilish lucky to think you have got it, as I have had a great many applications this morning; mind what you are after, and Keep away from the girls, and ***"—I saw; Coleman draw something for him, but cannot say what—I had been a customer for the preceding two or three months, and have seen Coleman there; he has served me on several occasions—Midgley did not say "How long has he been with you?" nor did Kirkland say "Seven months" or "Seven weeks," or "I can highly recommend him"—Midgley did not say "What is he leaving for?" nor to the best of my knowledge did Kirkland reply "Trade is very bad, and I do not require him in my bar"—nothing was mentioned about his being single.</p>

I said "I think of paying for my passage out"—he said "Don't waste your money, I can get you a berth as under steward; I shall want 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for doing it"—I gave him a sovereign then—he said "I am second steward on board the Potosi"—I made an appoint<lb/>ment. to meet him on 1st March in Chenies Street, to go down to the docks—I went with him to the Albert Docks—he introduced me to a man he said was the shore steward of the Orient Company that had the engaging of all the under stewards, and he told me to walk up and down in front of the office window so that the man could see me; then he took me on board the Liguria, and there I paid him 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked me to let him have some more money to square the shore steward to get me a berth as under steward—after I gave him the 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he went to see the man—he spoke to the party inside the office—I said "I want to see the party to</p>

I am the wife of Henry Cooper—I now live at Rotherfield Villas, Battersea Rise—at the beginning of August, 1879, I kept a school at 27, Middleton Road, New Wandsworth—my name was not on the door—I issued prospectuses—on Wednesday, the prisoner, I believe, called on me and asked if I would receive a child about 9 years of age—he said his name was Henry Marsh; he wrote it on a small piece of paper—he said he was a solicitor, a widower, and gave his address, Gloucester House, Geoffry Road, Clapham—he held one of my prospectuses in his hand, and said, "Tour terms, I see, are 36 guineas; I am willing to give you 40 guineas if you will receive the child and instruct her in English and music"—he gave me a reference to a Judge in chambers at Westminster—he said if I would cash a cheque for him he would pay me 107. in advance—I said it would be better for him to send it to me—he afterwards produced two cheques, one for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he gave me (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 30th July</hi>, 1879, <hi rend="italic">drawn by Arthur James Brennan on the London Joint Stock Bank, payable to Henry Marsh</hi>)—I believe it was already endorsed "Henry Marsh, Gloucester House, Geoffry Boad"—I wrote my name on it—I was not able to cash it, and he went out to get it cashed—he returned and said that two tradesmen had refused to cash it, one had already sent his money to the bank—I then gave the cheque to my daughter, and the prisoner went out with her to get it cashed—she came back and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody—I think I travelled with him once—the child was to have been sent on the Friday; it sever came—I saw the prisoner at Guildhall, I think, three weeks since—I firmly believe he is the—man; I have not the slightest doubt of it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is the address he wrote at my house.</p>

               <p>the morning of 23rd March, about a quarter or 10 minutes to 1, I was disturbed and went downstairs—I found the drawing-room door locked on the inside—I ran to a window at the back—I heard footsteps in the garden—I called out but got no answer—a police-sergeant came, and we got into the drawing-room and found that the window had been forced open, and everything in the room ransacked, but nothing taken—the window was shut when I went to bed—this knife was on the floor; it does not belong to me.</p>

About 4 o'clock on the morning of 23rd March, in consequence of instructions, I watched a field in Kingston Road, Wandsworth, about 500 yards from the prosecutor's house—I heard a noise in the hedge, proceeded to the spot, turned on my lamp, and found the prisoners concealed under the hedge—I said, "I want you; there has been a robbery here to-night; I shall take you to the station"—they said nothing at the station—Hastilow said, "We went into the field to stop till it was daylight, so as to find our way to Walton-on-Thames"—they were numbed with cold—I found this knife on Hastilow, and this small penknife.</p>

In consequence of what the last witness told me I took the boots from both prisoners, and compared them with footmarks in the prosecutor's garden; they correspond exactly—I traced them up to the drawing-room window, and in several places in the garden—the greater part was soft mould, and left a clear impression—Tonga's were nailed boots, and there could be no doubt about the impression.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 82, Barnley Street, Stratford—in 1879 I was in the employ of Mr. Hollyer, of Ludgate Hill—for about three months Cornell was employed there—after that I filled a situation at a tea merchant's, and then went to the prosecutor's at Victoria Buildings, near Victoria Station; that was about January, 1880—while I was there I saw Cornell in the street, at the corner of Victoria Buildings; I then stole about a dozen and a half of sable brushes of my master, and gave them to Cornell, who gave me 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I afterwards took a dozen more, for which he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was there three months, and then went to another shop of the prosecutor's on Snow Hill—while I was there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188105020125"/>
               <p>Cornell came there for some work; I had some conversation with him, and afterwards met him in the Old Bailey; after that I stole some camel<lb/>hair brushes from Snow Hill—I took things from the time I went there till 26th February this year, when I left—I took distemper tools, camel<lb/>hair brushes sables, ground brushes, and mops, three or four times a weak, about a dozen each time—there are 12 in a percel, and two dozen of the small ones—I used to leave them at the George public-house, in the Old Bailey, with William Davis, the potman, and in the evening Cornell and I received them from Davis and went to Stubbs's oil and colour shop, in the Blackfrairs Road—Cornell went in, I did not—he generally stopped 10 minutes or half an hour, and when he came out he used to give me about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not go with him every time, he sometimes received things from Davis and went alone, I do not know where, but he gave me about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. next day—he used to give Davis about 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for minding the parcel—Cornell gave me directions what sort of brushes to select the day before I took them—I shall be 16 next July—the prosecutor discharged me on 16th February.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first went into his employment about 15 months ago, in Victoria Buildings; that is a shop—I had nothing to do with serving in it—Mr. Beissbarth was not often there, he was at Snow Hill, but he used to come to look over the place; Mr. Hollyer managed it—there was a large stock kept; the burshes were in a glass case—only Mr. Hollyer and Mrs. Davis helped in the shop—it was a warehouse at Snow Hill, and a large stock was kept there—three boys and a man were employed there, and Mr. Isles conducted the retail business there—I used to tell what they were, but Cornell told him, and he told him that I was him brother; he did not tell him because he was out all day—I never opened a parcel at the Old Bailey—no one laying hold of a parcel would know what was in it unless they were brushmakers—I also took some distempers and sash tools—none of them had Mr. Biessbarth's name on them, but these distemper burshes were marked "Warranted 12oz."</p>

I have pleaded guilty to this charge—I first knew Slaughter at Holley and Parkes's two and a half years ago—I was in the same employment—I left just before Christmas, 1879—I knew that he was afterwards in Mr. Biessbarth's employ—I knew Studd about five years ago; he was an oilman in the Blackfrairs Road—I had a conversation with Slaughter when he was in Mr. Biessbarth's employ in Victoria Buildings, and he brought me some brushes, which I sold to a person at the Angel, Islington—he then brought me some more, which I sold to a person at Euston Station—he used to bring me things once a week, and I received them at the door, and sold them to the same person a Islington—he afterwards brought me property from Snow Hill once or twice a week, which he gave to me at the George public-house, Old Bailey—I was not always there to receive it, and then he used to leave it with the potman, who handed it to me done up in brown paper—the parcels con<lb/>tained brushes of all description—I sold them to Studd—I first began to do so at the latter end of August—he knew where I was; I was then in</p>

               <p>the brush line on my own account—when I first took them to him he did not know that they were stolen—I first took him a dozen of the No. 9 English sash tools, and he bought them for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the fair price for them was 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took him some more next day—he said, "Where do these come from?"—I said, "Biessbarth's"—he said, "Can't you get any distempers; about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each you know, <hi rend="italic">nicked</hi> ones?"—that means stolen—I said, "I will see if I can," and I spoke to Slaughter, who brought me about six distemper brushes, which I took to Studd, who said, "I will give you 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them"—2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each was a very fair price, being stolen, the ordinary price is 90<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—I said, "I am quite satisfied," and he gave me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the six—I went outside and gave Slaughter some money—I afterwards took him six more, for which he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and then another six, and he gave me 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them; and some camel-hair goods, because he could not get any more distempers—I took him about 200 of those, and asked him if he would buy them—he said that they were no good, but he lent me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them, and said, "Are you not going to bring any more distempers?"—I met Slaughter and had a further conversation with him, and he brought me some sash tools, which I took to Studd—he took 48 of them, for which he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the ordinary price is about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen for the large ones, and 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen for the small; the sizes were 6, 7, 8, and 9—I then took him some of these other brushes, a dozen or two at every time—they were then red—he gave me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen; the price of them is 58<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I took them to him they had "Warranted all hair" on the handle, and nothing down the centre—I took five or six dozen mops all at once, but he did not buy them; he lent me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them—I had three dozen back, and he said he could not find any more—I also took him some artists' sable brushes; he did not buy them, but lent me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them—this continued for five months—that was all that Slaughter brought me from Biessbarth—I told Studd that they were Mr. Biessbarth's property—he said that he had sent some brushes back to Mr. Biessbarth, who was going to summon him for the money, and he said "Give me an invoice, so that I shall be all right if it is found out"—he said, "It does not matter what name," and I gave him an invoice in the name of Bailey; that is my father-in-law's name—he said, "I will keep that in my pocket till it gets dirty, and then I will put it on the file"—I gave it him on 21st February—he said that he took off the mark "Warranted all hair," and put a mark of his own on, and painted the leather part black, upstairs, after the shop was shut up of a night—he said, "If you get stopped outside you will have to look out for yourself"—when I was taken in custody I made a statement to the officer.</p>

I am a white lead and colour manufacturer, of Great Suffolk Street—a man named Mitchell was in my employ, he had the charge of apart of my premises—on 12th March Sergeant Harvey fetched me to Studd's shop, and I identified, I believe it was, 12 varnish cans which had been stolen from me—they had not been sold—to the best of my belief it was varnish which was in them, they were labelled varnish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They were marked with a green label, which had on it "Pale oak varnish," and on others, "Oak varnish," my name was not there—I was a traveller in the business down to May, 1880, and then came in as a partner; the partnership continued to August, since when I have been in business on my own account; one of the partners is now in Scotland and one at Hampton; they superintended the business at that time, and Mitchell was in their employ—I paint all my cans this colour, but I only identify them by the labels; I made them when I took the place, I have one of them here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was the "Harrow Paint and Colour Company" when I took it, and I took over the stock—when the old cans are not fit to repair we get anybody to take them away, or give them to a dustman—I gave away about 20 or 40 when I took the business, I gave them to Mitchell to give away—he is a colour-grinder, he had authority to sell things for cash at times, there are cash sales over the counter—I have no stock book to show the number of cans he gave away, they all leaked or bulged—I do not know whether Studd has bought them from Mitchell—I did not hear that he was anxious to return goods which he had bought of Mitchell—Mitchell was practically manager when I was out of the way, if anybody came in—my wife was in the business in the front shop—the two businesses are entirely separate—she looked after the retail business—they do not sell anything wholesale unless I am there, because of the prices—Mitchell would not know the prices unless I was there—I bought the varnish from wholesale houses in casks and filled the cans—Charles Turner and Sons, varnish manufacturers, of Broad Street, Bloomsbury, and High Street, Whitechapel, are a highly respectable firm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Francis improved my position—I was to sell any<lb/>thing retail in his absence; I did not sell wholesale; it is principally retail business; the wholesale was done while he was there—before that I was at Captain Isley's; that is the same firm—I gave away as many cans as I could pack away on a costermonger's barrow, a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> goes about the street and collects them—Studd bought some barrels of me, and paid Mr. Francis for them—I put some of the labels on them, not all—two or three of us, and the boy and the mistress, helped to label the cans—I took them to Studd, sometimes in the evening and sometimes in the morning, and sometimes he sent his boy down—I gave him no invoice—Hatfield's supplied Mr. Francis with varnish—I took Studd cans the last time, I think, some time in November, but I have no memorandum—it was three gallons of varnish which he paid 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for, and there was some a week or a fortnight before that—I used to sell the varnish in the shop for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gallon retail—the buyer is supposed to pay so much on the can, and when he returns it he gets his money back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I expect I said before the Magistrate that I was the prosecutor's wife—I have been unfortunate lately—I gave myself this black eye, I fell down on a tub against a wooden balustrade in my house—Mrs. Clark lives next door, and I wash for her—it was not Jones who gave me this black eye; I think I could do him, I am the better horse; he has no occasion to give me black eyes, he is too young—I have known him about 15 years, and sometimes I have lived with him; he goes by my name—I did not see the prisoner knock him down till he knocked him down the second time—they were in the gutter when I went up—he had been out from 4 o'clock till 11—he always stands in the Old Bailey on Saturday and on Thursday nights with a basket—I know Mr. Baxter, of Billingsgate, he can give me a good character—I saw one other man, but I could not recognise him in the excitement—I know Emma Clak and Rebecca Parsons, Clark lives in the same house with me, and Parsons next door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the Westminster Bridge Road—on Saturday, 12th April, I was in the Borough Road, opposite the British Schools—my hat was blown off; I went to pick it up and fell—the prisoner and a woman came up to me—the prisoner said, "I hope you are not hurt"—I said, "No, thank you; I am not"—he said, "Shall we dust you down; we are close at home?'—I said, "No, thank you, I am close at home"—my knee was hurt, but I walked away—I rested against a tree and rubbed it—I walked 30 or 40 yards and suddenly found the prisoner on one side of me, and the woman on the other—he said, "You had better let me assist you home"—I said, "Thank you for your assistance, I do not require any thing further," and almost immediately he struck me on my mouth, knocking me down, and, snatching my chain, he made off—Shaw brought him back—my watch was safe, as the swivel was defective, and gave way—I have not seen the chain since; it cost 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. some years ago.</p>

               <p>the woman—he had a <hi rend="italic">billycock</hi> hat—no light fell on his face—I saw him next when he was brought back by a constable, who said, "Is this the man who assaulted you?"—I said, "Yes"—I did not pick him out—he was apprehended almost on the spot—the woman was not taken—she was short and stout—there is no mistaking the prisoner; I recognise him by his general appearance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was not in the slightest degree tipsy—I have not the slightest doubt that the prisoner is the man—I received a violent blow which cut my lip and loosened a tooth, which has since come out—my lip is not well yet.</p>

                  </hi>. On 2nd April I lived in Fulham Road, Newington—on that night I was going down the Borough Road and saw Mr. Wise; the prisoner had one of nis arms and a woman the other—I suspected them, and followed for a yard or two, and put my hand on Wise's shoulder, and said, "What is the matter?" I spoke twice to the prisoner, and he made no answer—I have no doubt he is the man—I said, "Don't drag him along; let him rest awhile"—I looked back and saw the woman walking away, Wise on the ground, and the prisoner over him—I said, "Let us help him up"—he said, "No; if he does not choose to get up, let him stop where he is," and walked away—a little boy spoke to me as the prisoner turned the corner—I followed him and sent the boy for a policeman, who came—I stopped the prisoner—he is the same man; the policeman and I took him back to Wise, who gave him in charge—I had seen him strike Wise on the mouth, and he drew his hand back as Wise was falling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been to the theatre—Wise seemed lame; he seemed to drag one leg along as they were leading him—I do not think he was sober—I thought he had got a clout in the month, and was silly for a moment—lie looked as if he had got a severe knocking about—I had never seen him before; it was a very dark night; it Was 11.20—Wise was bleeding from his month—he appeared to have had a fall—they let him fall suddenly at the corner of Mansfield Street purposely—I was two or three yards behind them—Mount joy brought him back—I did not pick the prisoner put from others, but I never lost sight of him.</p>

On the evening of the 2nd April a little boy spoke to me, and I went to Mr. Shaw—the prisoner was walking five yards from him—I followed him, and saw Shaw catch him, and I and Shaw took him back to Mr. Wise, whose mouth was bleeding, but he did not appear much hurt—he was sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> From Wise's appearance I think he had had a struggle—the prisoner said "I know nothing at all about it"—I arrested him about 30 yards off—Wise did not seem to be suffering from drink—I searched the prisoner at the station, and found 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. loose in his pocket—I took good care that he did not pass anything away.</p>
