                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140003"/>Howard. I never saw him before to my knowledge; I challenged him with having taken something; he said he had not, and gave me liberty to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you think he could get into your shop in so short a time?</p>
               <p>Howard. There is an ale-house next door, and I have reason to believe he was sitting on the bench at the door when I went out. I desired my wife to withdraw, and made him strip; at that time I missed a watch from off a peg in the window; he had two waistcoats on; upon throwing one down, there was something fell heavy; I said, I believe I have you now. No, said he, it is only my knife. I took and looked in the waistcoat, and found my watch in a little pocket, seemingly made on purpose to conceal things in, at the bottom of one of the hind lappets of his waistcoat, (a silver watch produced in court) this is it; it is put into my hands to sell for a person, and I am accountable for it if lost. We took the prisoner before a magistrate, and there he confessed he did take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went into the shop to sell a button which I had found, the gentlewoman took it and would not give me any thing for it; this watch was lying on the counter, I took it up and said, I would have something for the button; I had never been in London, but was coming up from Devonshire.</p>

I and my wife were in the shop, my wife shewed her some. She did not agree with my wife. She came to me to see some long lawn. I was at another counter. She bought a yard and a quarter; I changed her half a guinea, and she paid for it. Then she said, let me look at that muslin again, I had rather be served by you than your wife. I shewed it her; she bid me measure it; she sat down by the side of the counter; while I was measuring it, she was fumbling about her stays; I saw her drag something from under the bundle that I was measuring; it put me all in a tremble. As she was pretty well dressed, I thought she was some tradesman's wife. I observed her hiding it under her stays. I measured it, and said, Pray madam do you sell muslin? said she, What is that to you, if I pay you for it. There was 18 yards and a quarter of it; she said, You will send it to the Bell in St. Martin's lane; I said I did not know it; she was going; I said, Madam, you must walk into my parlour, you have got something of my property about you, deliver it, and you shall go about your business. She would not deliver it. There was a woman that keeps a fish-stall, went for a constable; the constable said, Madam, you had better be searched; she said she would not; as she advanced towards him, she dropped the piece of muslin; my servant took it up, it had been near her body, it was quite warm (produced in court, and deposed to)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lett these things with the room.</p>
               <p>Whitaker. I did, I found him the 4th of this instant May, and charged him with taking the things; at first he said his wife carried them away, and he did not know where she was. I took him before a Justice; going along, he owned he had been a partaker of the money made of the things; he confessed before the Justice, he pledged the sheets. I have never found any of the things.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Austin. I have know the prisoner 12 years, he has worked 6 years for us; my husband is not well, or he had been here. We live in Wood's-close; my husband is a salesman, and keeps carts; the prisoner used to go with them, go on errands, and do little menial offices about the house; sometimes he has been trusted with money 20 or 30 l. at a time; he is a very honest inoffensive simple man; I always thought him an honest man. His wife used to use the poor man very badly.</p>

            . I live in Turnmill-street; I heard a great uproar in the street between twelve and one in the day, on the 19th of April; I pursued, hearing the prosecutor had been robbed, I stopped the prisoner; she had the two coats under her arms; I carried her back to the prosecutor's house. She was taken before Justice Girdler, and he committed her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. I was at the prosecutor's house in the back parlour; there was an uproar in the street, which made Mrs. Gillilan go into the shop; she then missed the two coats; I had seen them at coming in a little before. I went out, and met Mr. Blowman bringing the prisoner back.</p>

               <p>I am a young beginner in buying and selling old cloaths; I gave 13 s. for these two coats, and was going by the prosecutor's house, and the people cried, Stop that woman: I bought them of a woman in Cow-cross.</p>

I went into the shop about one o'clock, I believe I had been in about 4 or 5 minutes, when I heard the alarm given by a baker and a dustman, who came and knocked at the door, and asked Mrs. Gillilan if she had lost any thing; I believe it was morally impossible for the prisoner to contract a bargain in the time.</p>

               <p>Jones. I got acquainted with Walters at Statute-hall at Charing-cross: I never saw Plumber in my life before we took the stockings, (that was another offence.)</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet together that night?</p>
               <p>Jones. We met in Leicester-fields between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon; Walters said he was going to break a window for some gold rings at another shop. We went to Plumber at the Horse and Groom in Castle-street, by Leicester-fields; we staid there till it was just dusk, and when we came to the shop where the gold rings were, it was shut up: that was in Carnaby-market: then we went into Oxford-road, and Walters went into a baker's shop and took the till out; then we walked down almost as far as Soho-square; we passed by Mr. Hudson's shop 2 or 3 times and looked in; Walters said he would break the window, which he did with his fist, and cut the palm of his hand with a piece of glass; the other prisoner and I stood on the opposite side the way; Mr. Hudson came and asked what we stood there for; we said a person was gone to a cheesemonger's shop for some cheese, and we staid for him; he went there, and we went down Poland-street.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw three lads walking over the way, and one of them said he would go for a pennyworth of cheese; I followed him, and said, you are one of the lads that broke my window; he vowed to me he was not, so I let him go.</p>
               <p>Jones. We followed Walters to the King's-arms in Prince's-street and had some beer; the young fellow that went for the cheese came to us, we gave him six-pence because he should say nothing; then we went into the Meuse and cut the handkerchiefs off; they had 3 each; Walters shewed them us at the King's-arms, they were brown, green, and white silk handkerchiefs in one piece,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140006"/> all of a pattern.

               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Lucar. No, I was not fuddled, I had been drinking; I had 45 guineas in gold and some silver, but how much I cannot swear. When I came from my own lodging I had 58 l. but I had spent the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been?</p>
               <p>Lucar. I lay in a very civil house in John's-street on the Monday night, and on the Tuesday I was drinking about, but was very sober all the day, and lay in John's-street that night also. I lay with a woman, not in the same house, but was not wronged of a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a bed-fellow on the Monday night?</p>
               <p>Lucar. I had. On the Wednesday morning I had my money in my pocket, I counted it over. I was at the Bell part of the day, and in the afternoon I light of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by all this money?</p>
               <p>Lucar. It was left me by an aunt, she left me an hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive it?</p>
               <p>Lucar. I received it since Christmas. I had the money mentioned in the indictment. When I went to bed with the prisoner, I counted it in her lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see you?</p>
               <p>Lucar. I do not know whether she was gone out for liquor; I put it loose in my right-hand breeches pocket; I laid my breeches under my head, and we went to bed together before 11.

At last, I got a warrant and took her up; she owned she had taken all the things, and begged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140008"/> I would not hurt her; she said they were pawned, and she had friends in the country that would help her to money to take them out. She said one Mrs. Lloyd had prevailed upon her to let her have some of my goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mrs. Lloyd?</p>
               <p>Chillingworth. She did live in Poppin's-alley, but is since dead; she was an intimate acquaintance of the prisoner's. I kept the prisoner afterward, in hopes she would get the things replaced.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this did you keep her in your house?</p>
               <p>Chillingworth. I kept her about a month after, and waited upon one of her relations, and asked her if she would be so good as to assist her to fetch the things out; she told me the prisoner had been so expensive to her relations, that she would not do it; then I told the prisoner I would not lose my goods, and if she could not get them out, I must take another method; she said she would write to her aunt in the country, and put it off from time to time, so I was resolved to take her up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this relation refused to take the things out was it that you took her up?</p>
               <p>Chillingworth. I believe it was within a fortnight; I took her before my Lord-Mayor, there she acknowledged that she had been guilty of taking every thing mentioned in the indictment, and that they were in pawn; I found out the woman that sent them to pawn, that was Mrs. Lloyd, who acknowledged she sent her servant named Clifford with them to pawn, and the places where they were pawned; some at Mr. Wilmot's, some at the corner of Stonecutter-street in the Fleet-market, and other places, (the goods mentioned in the indictment produced in court.)</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen the money last?</p>
               <p>Fricker. About a week or a fortnight before they were missing. There were between 30 and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140010"/> 40 l. in the bag where the guinea was, and there were six 3 l. 12 s. pieces, a guinea and a half where the other was. I put a piece of paper in each bag of the quantity of money in them, and the drawer was locked. The prisoner went away the 3d of April; we suspected her, and sent for her to the Angel and Crown, Whitechapel, on the 14th of April; I asked her what she had done with the 3 l. 12 s. and guinea; she would not own any thing to it at first, but at last she did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said to her in order to induce her to own it?</p>
               <p>Fricker. I said, if she would, I would be kind to her; we were apprehensive there was some body concerned with her. So Mr. Lewis talked to her to persuade her to tell what she had done with the money; and at last she confessed she had taken a 3 l. 2 s. and a guinea out of the drawer in my room. This key (producing one) she took out of her pocket; it will open every lock in my house of the size, except the flap of my bureau; and my wife found this steel tobacco-stopper (producing one) upon the prisoner; this was in my bureau where the money was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your wife find the tobacco stopper?</p>
               <p>Fricker. No; I was not present then.</p>

               <p>Q. How long time might it take from the first of her denying it, till she acknowledged it?</p>
               <p>Fricker. I believe it was a couple of hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come without a constable to the Angel and Crown?</p>
               <p>Fricker. She did voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you over and over again tell her, if she would confess she took the money, she should have no harm done to her?</p>
               <p>Fricker. I did.</p>

            . On Monday the 14th of April, I was sent for by the prosecutor, to know if I knew the tobacco-stopper; I looked at it, and said I made it for Mr. Fricker; we went to Whitechapel; I went to the prisoner's new master, I desired him to let her go a little way with me; as we were coming in the street, she cry'd, and begged of me not to take her up, before I said a word about the affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her who wanted her?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I told her her master was at the Angel and Crown; she begged I would not take her up and put her into goal, for she knew nothing at all of what was laid to her charge. When we got her to the Angel and Crown, she was asked if she would tell what was become of the money; and it was told her, if she would tell, her master would be favourable to her; she said, she knew nothing at all of the matter. I had this tobacco-stopper in my hand, I shewed it her, and asked her how she came by that? She said first of all, she took it out of a bag from off a shelf one day as she was dusting the room; but there is never a shelf in that room; I said, her master and mistress would take their oaths it was in the drawer where the money was taken from; then she confessed directly the taking the 3 l. 12 s. I asked her what day of the month it was? She could give no answer to that, but said it was between two or three o'clock in the afternoon; I asked her for the key with which she unlocked her master's drawers; she said she had left her keys at home; I said, feel in your pocket; she pulled out a bunch of keys; I said, Which is the key you opened the drawers with? She gave it me; I took it from the bunch; then she asked to go out into the yard with me; we went out; then I asked her concerning the money her master missed; she said she took but one guinea; I asked her what use she had put it to She said one half guinea went towards buying a pair of new stays; I asked her what she did with the other half guinea? She said she had bought coloured aprons with it; I said, I am certain sure your master will be favourable to you. if you do but let him know what you have done with the cash. She owned to me, she opened four drawers several times in the same chest.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is she?</p>
               <p>Lewis. She is not 18 years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make any confession before Mr. Fricker and you had made a promise to be favourable?</p>

I thought to change the indentures were sufficient. I missed only the shifts when I discharged her; then I went to Mr. Gunston's, a pawnbroker, and found a saucepan, a shift, and an apron; before I went there, the father affronted me in the street very much, and said he would take me up for attempting his character; then I took out a warrant against the girl, fearing he should do me an injury. She was taken up and committed; she would not own to any one thing before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. If the father had not abused you as you say, should you have done as you have?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise?</p>
               <p>E. Hebbert. I said, if she would confess what she had done with the things, I would not meddle with her; this I said to the father: then she said she had taken the shift and lent it to a girl that was going to be married, and she took my key in order to put it up again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who found her in cloaths?</p>
               <p>E. Hebbert. Her father and mother did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not use to take the girl to plays?</p>
               <p>E. Hebbert. Her father ordered me to go to the play with her as her guardian, as she was young.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for seeing the plays?</p>
               <p>E. Hebbert. He used to give her money to pay for me and herself, and my cousin when she went. I have been a school-mistress; I brought her up at school; there is but one saucepan mine, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140012"/> other is the property of

               <p>Q. How came she to go away?</p>
               <p>E. Tweed. She told me her mother had got a better place, and seemed to be willing to go; so upon that, I was willing she should go; and on the Wednesday after, I missed ten guineas; my mind was a little confused that I could not justly tell at first; I sat down and counted it, and looked at my bills that I had paid, and found I had lost that money; then I went to a gentlewoman that her mother washes for, who sent her maid for the prisoner's mother; after that Mrs. Clark and the mother went and brought the girl to me; when she came, I asked how she could use me so ill as to rob me of so much money; she denied it some time; Mrs. Clark took her into the back parlour, and in a few minutes she came out, and said the girl owned it: then I went in, she owned to me she had taken four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what she had done with it?</p>
               <p>E. Tweed. She said she had taken some things out of pawn with some of it, and bought some things. I asked her when she took it; she said she took it after I brought the box into the parlour, after I was returned, the day I paid for my stays.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her mother before?</p>
               <p>E. Tweed. I never had seen her mother before.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon whose recommendation did you take the girl?</p>
               <p>E. Tweed. I took her upon her looks; I thought she looked like a very honest creditable girl; the mother said she would go and see for some of the money; out of mercy and tenderness to the mother, as she seemed to be in so much sorrow and grief, I would have let her go, if I could have got my money again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your money again?</p>
               <p>E. Tweed. I did not; they told me if I took her to a Justice, it was a capital crime, and it would take her life. I kept her in Mrs. Clark's house till half an hour after nine o'clock; then the mother and she went to my house; the mother went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140013"/> out and returned, and said, she could not get the money, but begged of me not to charge a constable. She went away on the Friday morning, and on the Monday her mother brought her to Justice Fielding's; then I took them both up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to the charge before the Justice?</p>
               <p>E. Tweed. She owned she had taken four guineas, and owned to no more.</p>

            . I am a housekeeper in Holbourn; I lett the prosecutrix a shop and parlour in my house. On the 1st of May I came home about eleven o'clock, and found this lady and the prisoner in my parlour along with my wife; the lady declared the prisoner had robbed her of ten guineas; I applied to the prisoner, and said, My girl, have you robbed your mistress of this sum? she made no answer; I asked her again without any threats; she told me she had, but said, I did not take ten guineas, I only took four; said I, you may as well tell the truth, it will be no more criminal to take ten than four, and you will have a greater claim for clemency of your mistress if you confess: she then said she did take ten, and had given her mother five guineas, and had taken her own cloaths out of pawn, and other things for another girl her acquaintance; and had bought some things, mentioning a pair of shoes, which she had on her feet; I advised the prosecutrix to stay, and not charge a constable if she could recover the money, as the girl was young; I advised her not to prosecute her, as it was a capital offence; it was the prisoner's own desire to stay in the shop, and the prosecutrix desired me to go to the mother in the morning, but the prisoner made her escape in the morning; after that, there were people sent to take up the mother; she was taken up, and another person; they said they would produce the girl, and before Mr. Fielding I heard the girl acknowledge she had taken only four guineas; the morning after the girl made her escape, the mother and a gentleman came to me, and made proposals of giving five guineas, and a note for the rest of the money.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clark. The prosecutrix came to me on the 30th of April, and told me she had been robbed of ten guineas by the girl at the bar; I said, I would send for the mother, accordingly I did; when she came, I acquainted her with what her mistress had told me; she said, she knew she had some money, but did not know how she came by it: then I went with the mother, to fetch the girl from the mother's house; we brought her to my house; I took her into the back parlour, and said, if she would tell the truth I would intercede with her mistress for her; then she owned she had taken four guineas and bought some things, and taken some things out of pawn; she went from my house about nine o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went to Mrs. Clark's house, and by my mistress's desire, she told my mother she would let me be at her house till 12 the next day; my mother did not come till four in the afternoon; when she came, she said she could not get the money that my mistress charged me with; my mother went home, and my mistress took me to Mr. Parker's house. and told him I had robbed her of ten guineas; I told him I had not; he said, I might as well say it, it would be all the same, and I did not own to it a great while; Mr. Parker bid me say my mother had five guineas, and I had the rest; I said, if I should say that I should say a very false thing; my mistress took me into the house, and said she would lock me up; she locked me into the shop, and I remained there till three in the morning; she imagined I was going to get out, and I was not; she got out of bed and dragged me from the counter, and struck me two or three times, she would not let me sit down nor lean upon the table or chair; I said, I could not stand without sitting down on the floor: she dragged me from the floor, and called the watchman, no watchman came; she got into the bed and left the key in the door; I let myself out, and locked the door and went away; and after that, I heard my mother was taken up, then I went and delivered myself up.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Is this true that she has been relating as to your behaviour to her?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is utterly false.</p>
               <p>Parker. What the prisoner has said relating to me is utterly false. I never bid her say her mother had five guineas, I only desired her to tell the truth.</p>

               <p>Parker. When this last evidence came to my house, he came by way of insult to the woman that has lost the money; I said to him, as he was an officer, how came he to insult the woman; said he, she keeps her a prisoner in her own house. I said, if he was in her case, he would have cause to go down on his knees and thank her for that favour, in not being put into the custody of an officer; I think that was far from abusing him.</p>

               <p>I want to go to the Captain; he has wrote for me; my husband is a gentleman; he is settled at Boston in New England. I was taken up and put into prison among all thieves; Justice Fielding and Mr. Welch know me, and they want to send me to my husband. They call me a mad woman: I am not mad, only I am kept from my husband, who loves me as well as his own soul. Nobody knows I am here now, my Lord, but myself. I wanted to see you, and they would not let me: I went and broke the high constable's windows; there is money enough to pay my passage. I may as well be dead as alive. They put me in a goal in Moorfields three times for the same crime. I have been put in Newgate, and the Gatehouse. If they will produce a letter that the captain does not like me, I'll agree to be hanged. He allows me a lady's income.</p>

            . I keep the Golden Cross, Charing cross; on Sunday evening last it was very wet, and coaches were very scarce. Mr. Carr ordered me to call a coach; I saw the prisoner near my door; I asked him if he would go; he said he would. I took Mr. Carr's portmanteau and put it in his coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner see you put it in?</p>
               <p>Sloman.

In our return from the Justice's, I told him he had better produce the portmanteau; he said he had a man that cleaned his coach and looked after his horses sometimes, of whom he had a very bad opinion; and he had great reason to think, from his absconding, he had got the portmanteau: that he could not tell his name, only that he went by the name of Gallows Jack; he sent a man to look for him.</p>

            . On the Tuesday night this gentleman brought me a warrant to apprehend the prisoner at the bar; I took him before Justice Girdler; he said he knew nothing about the portmanteau, it was never put into his coach: but he had a servant who had absconded ever since the Monday, which he had reason to suspect had taken it away, he not coming to his work as usual. A man came to us; I said to him, If you have any regard for this man, go and seek after him; he said he would, and come and let me know if he heard any intelligence of him; in the morning he came, and told me he had heard nothing of him. On the Wednesday morning the prisoner's wife came to me between six and seven o'clock, and told me the portmanteau was thrown into their coach-yard; I went, and there I found it. There was a padlock upon the place where the coach went in; I believe it never had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140018"/> opened till I opened it; it has been in my custody ever since, (produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I was at Charing-cross between six and seven that night; Mr. Sloman came and ply'd me; I said I would, but he did not deserve serving, because he never employed me when the weather was fair, and this was a very wet evening; I went to get myself a glass of rum, a few doors beyond the Golden-Cross; in the mean time, a gentleman dressed in black, and a lady, were got into my coach; they ordered me to go to Ludgate-hill; there I set them down; I got a fare into Cheapside, and from thence came into Holbourn, and from thence returned home, and put my coach up: the next morning I went out as usual; when I came home at about ten at night, Mr. Sloman had been to my wife after a portmanteau; I told her I had not seen any such thing, and if there was any such thing missing my servant that was absconded was the likeliest person to have it. Mr. Sloman came again on Tuesday in the afternoon, and charged this thing upon me; I denied it: he took me before Justice Girdler; as we were coming back, I told him, if there was any thing lost, the servant that was gone from my service had got it; upon that, I employed a neighbour to see after him; soon after, I had intelligence the portmanteau was brought to light. I did not see it put into the coach, and I never saw it before I was at Justice Girdler's; the two people that came into my coach came out of Mr. Sloman's house.</p>

It was understood by the people in general, that the old-beadle in our ward, being a drunken fellow, was intended to be discharged last Christmas; this was talked of 6 or 8 months before Christmas. The prisoner then was a hired Constable in the room of another person; he applied to me, and said he heard the old man was intended to be discharged, and said he should be very glad of my friendship in order to be put in the place, I told him the old one was not to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140019"/> displaced, and desired him not to think any more of it.

               <p>Mr. Tyser. Upon receiving this, I sent an order to the constables to be ready, thinking to have a double watch that night, the fellow meeting with somebody in the street to whom he mentioned the thing, and when I came home the whole neighbourhood was alarmed; I continued this watch several nights; I had a very good opinion then of the prisoner, and desired him to watch the second night, and he should be satisfied for his trouble. In about a week after he brings me a letter directed to himself, which he received by the penny-post, with the post-mark upon it, (produced in court.)</p>
               <p>It is read in court, in words and letters following.</p>
               <p>July 8. 1765</p>

               <p>Mr. Tyser. I endeavoured to find out where this letter was put into the post; first I went to the General Post-office behind the Change, they apprehended it was put in at an office in Newgate-street; I went there, and there I was told it was put in at the corner of Fleet-ditch, Ludgate-hill. I went there, they told me it was certainly put in there, they knew their own mark upon it, but said it was impossible for them to recollect what sort of a person put it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention this your enquiry to the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tyser. I think I did. In consequence of this I consulted my Lord-Mayor, and we determined to draw up an advertisement, which we did, and advertised a reward of 50 l. to any person that should discover any person concerned in this affair. After this, the prisoner brought another letter to me, which he pretended was thrown into his shop, and seemed to be very much terrfied, (produced in court.)</p>
               <p>It is read in words and letters following.</p>

               <p>It is read in words and letters following.</p>
               <p>Sept 25 1765</p>

               <p>i c c d</p>
               <p>Directed to Mr. Sutton These</p>
               <p>Mr. Tyser. The prisoner came to me, and told me, there was a drunken idle fellow had made a disturbance in Aldersgate street, and said he would set the houses on fire; and that he had seized the fellow and carried him to the Compter; I was at the trouble of going to the Compter to this fellow; I desired the keeper to get him to write, which he did; I did not find the least similitude in the writing, and therefore, I did not entertain the least suspicion of him, and he was discharged; this the prisoner pleaded as matter of merit for seizing of him. I began to have a suspicion of the prisoner, and thought of a method to detect him; I do not recollect I had seen any of his hand-writing: I enquired about, and collected five receipts of his writing, which I compared with these letters; I had not compared them two minutes, before I was fully convinced he wrote these letters; I then consulted several friends, and shewed them the letters and receipts, and they were of the same opinion. Then I went to my Lord-Mayor, there was one of the Sheriffs, and Mr. Sclater the chaplain; I laid the letters and receipts on the table for inspection. I took up the prisoner; he was desired to sit down and write as a gentleman dictated to him, sentance for sentence; the words of two of these letters, which was kept from his sight; I have his hand-writing here.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tyser. This was on the 19th of February last: I had not the least doubt but the man that wrote this, wrote the two letters which were dictated to him. I am clear of the opinion that he wrote them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you made any inspection with regard to the spelling?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tyser. There are many words in the letters spelled very badly, and also, the same in that which he wrote: the letter of the 1st of July, the word parish is spelled Parrish, he wrote the word the same before us; both the first and second letters are liable to the same observations.</p>
               <p>The writing produced in court and compared with the originals, wrote in words and letters as follows.</p>
               <p>London July 1st 1765</p>

Mr. Lewis went in before her; he clapped the door in my mother's face; my mother said, You good for nothing fellow, what did you do that for: he said, I did not see any body behind me. There were no more words said about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it hurt her?</p>
               <p>M. Gibons. It hit her in the forehead, but did not much hurt her; then we all went into the kitchen; there were Mr. and Mrs. Lewis, the cook, my mother, I, a little girl, and my little girl; mine is about three years old, the other girl is servant to Mr. Lewis, I do not know her age. My little girl had occasion to go into the yard, after we had been there about an hour: I went out with her; Mr. Lewis was standing talking to a man at the fore door when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>M. Gibons. This was about five in the afternoon; I only staid while the child made water, and went into the kitchen again; then Mrs. Lewis was helping my mother off the ground: I said. What have you done to my mother? She said, Your mother has struck her hand against Mr. Lewis's knife. No, said my mother, don't say so, for Mr. Lewis jobb'd the knife into my hand. They put some stuff to it to stop the blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the wound?</p>
               <p>M. Gibons. It was on her left hand, on the back part between the fore finger and the next to it; it appeared like the scratch of a pin, about half the length of a middling pin. I went home in about three quarters of an hour, and left my mother there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you gone out of the house?</p>
               <p>M. Gibons. I believe I was not out of the house above two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else said about it after you went into the kitchen?</p>
               <p>M. Gibons. No, there was not for the time I staid, which was about three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mother seem to be in pain?</p>
               <p>M. Gibons. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mother sober?</p>
               <p>M. Gibons. She had been drinking; she was a little in liquor, but not fuddled, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How old was your mother?</p>
               <p>M. Gibons. She was sixty-four years of age; my mother came to me in Berwick-street, Soho, the next day; then she complained a great deal of her hand; I saw it, it was swelled; Mr. Bedford was the surgeon, and Mr. Maschall the apothecary,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140024"/> which she employed. She lived better than a fortnight after, and then died</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of her death?</p>
               <p>M. Gibons. Her hand mortified, of which she died; she said she should die of it.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what day this was done?</p>

               <p>M. Walls. She died on Monday was a week, of a mortification in her hand. My mistress sent me with a letter to Mr. Lewis; the kinswoman told me he was eating bread and cheese, and she behaved very indecent, and he said if she did so again he would strike her. but he did not; but she up with her hand, and hit the back of her hand against the knife.</p>

            . I am the apothecary. I saw the deceased on Sunday the 20th of April, she said she had received a wound on her hand on the Wednesday; she complained of great pain in her hand, which was much inflamed and swelled; I examined it, and found a small wound, I thought it to be but a slight wound; there was no mortification began at that time; I attended her again in the afternoon; the next morning the symptoms increased; I advised her to send for a surgeon; she did, and I attended with him till her death. She imagined, when I first came to her, it was done by a poisoned knife.</p>

               <p>Maschall. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say who gave her that wound?</p>
               <p>Maschall. I do not recollect she did; at times she would say it would be her death, and sometimes she expressed some marks of resentment against the man that had done it.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might the wound be?</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I attended the deceased on the 21st of last month; I found the back of her hand very much inflamed, and the arm below the elbow swelled, and a small wound a little oblique on the back of her hand, the length under an inch, seemingly very superficial.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you probe it?</p>
               <p>Bedford. I did not; it was rather too much inflamed.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by superficial?</p>
               <p>Bedford. I mean a wound that extended but very little in depth; it was what might be called an exceeding slight wound; the depth was in a very slight proportion to the length; the length might be from half an inch to three quarters of an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose it could have been done with a stab?</p>
               <p>Bedford. It rather appeared to me to be done with a round edged knife; it appeared as if a drawn cut had been made with a round pointed instrument; from the inflamation there came a mortification, of which mortification she died, which was that day fortnight I was called in.</p>

I went with her to her lodging; I met a gentleman in the dining-room: I asked him if he was the surgeon; he said he attended the deceased for another gentleman; I asked him whether she was in her senses; he said she was. I went into the room and asked her her story, and to be punctual that she was in her senses, she answered every thing very reasonably; I asked her three or four times before I took it, and she never varied from it; she was sworn to the examination; here it is ( producing it) this is her mark upon it; she set this to it after I had read it over to her two or three times; the surgeon had told her there was no probability of her recovery; upon this a warrant was granted to take up the prisoner for an assault.</p>

On the 23d of April I was sitting in my easy chair alone, he came to me and said, d - n you, you old b - h, money I want, and money I will have; and held up a knife to me, and swore he would rip me up if I cried out; I had cried out murder on his ill usage before, and nobody came near me; I never opened my lips; he took my silk purse out of my pocket, with a half guinea and 8 s. in it; I fainted away; after which I went to bed, and was not out of it for two or three days; I was at that time under the apothecary's hands, very ill.</p>

I am between 18 and 19 years of age: I was bred up in London. and bound to a goldsmith in Monkwell-street, named Picket; I served him almost four years, but he dying, my mistress and I could not agree, and I ran away from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140034"/> her; I went down to Birmingham, that is six months ago; I worked there about three months, and returned again by Christmas; after that, I lived with my brother, a gold watch-chaser, on Clerkenwell-green, till I got 40 l. which was left me; I was not to have had it till I was twenty-one years of age; I spent that, and then I took to this course of life.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave your brother?</p>
               <p>Valentine. I left him about six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive the 40 l.?</p>
               <p>Valentine. Just as I came up from Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you spent it all before you left your brother?</p>
               <p>Valentine. I had about fifteen guineas when I left him; I spent that about in drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you become acquainted with the two prisoners?</p>
               <p>Valentine. I became acquainted with them since the last sessions at Guildhall, Westminster; I had seen Mussin under the piazzas at the play-house, just when the play was going to break up, and I became acquainted with him there. One

             and I found the two prisoners at the Star in Compton-street, either the 23d or 24th of March, between five and six o'clock. Till is now gone out of the way. Mussin and I came out there, and we parted with Reding and Till; they went and got a warrant for a man who had called one of them a thief. Mussin took me to this shop in Long-acre, he shewed me the box of rings, and said Reding and he should have them this night: then he and I went back to Redding and Till; we desired Till to go and pawn two or three handkerchiefs; he went and pawned them; then we agreed, if we should be pursued, to go to the Thistle and Crown in Russel-court. Then Mussin bid me go cross the way because I was lame, and not able to run.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your lameness?</p>
               <p>Valentine. I had got the venereal disease. I went cross the way, facing the window, and Reding to the window; he hit the window three times, and it broke; he took the rings out; Mussin was close by him; then I run away, and hobbled along as fast as I could to the Thistle and Crown; one ran one way, and the other the other; the two prisoners came in while I was there; this was between eight and nine o'clock. I met Till in Bow-street, he went in with me; Mussin had a brilliant ring on his little finger, and Reding had a gold ring, with garnets set round on his little finger; they said they could not stay, they must go out again; they went out, and come in again in about twenty minutes; then Reding had an enamelled gold ring, with a white stone in it, on his finger; and Mussin came in with the same ring on he had before; they gave me the ring Reding had on before, and gave Till another garnet ring; that ring they gave me,

I got up the next morning and was going to the Change, and in St. Martin's-lane we met Old Bob of Black friars, who bought some of the rings, but I was not there when they were sold; the prisoners told me of it afterwards; this was on the Friday: we went into the city; when we were at the 'Change Till saw a Jew there; he went and asked him if he would buy the rings, we were all four together. The Jew agreed to come and meet him at the Thistle and Crown in the afternoon, at five o'clock. I saw the Jew in the house, but Till ordered us to stay at the door; Mussin gave him the stone white ring, and desired he would get half a guinea for it of the Jew; and I desired a crown for mine, and the other a crown for his ring; they did not sell them to the Jew. He offered 7 s. for the two gold rings with garnets, and nine shillings for the other.</p>

             was slightly acquainted with me; I have seen the prisoners and evidence pass me very often in a night, but was not acquainted with them. Till desired me to pawn a ring for him, and bring the money to him at the Thistle and Crown; I did, and brought the half crown to him there, then they were all four together.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you pawn it?</p>
               <p>A. Freeman. To Mr. Stiles in Castle-street, Leicester-fields; then Till desired I would go with more, and Mussin said it was a wrong thing to ask it, and desired him not to mention it any more: I did not sit down, nor stay any longer than putting the money into Till's hand; he desired me to keep the duplicate till he came the next day for it; and when I was taken out of my lodgings I produced the duplicate, that is what I had of the pawnbroker.</p>

They were not of them which I sold him, they were women's gloves; he had put them that he had bought into his pocket; after he went out of the shop I followed him and brought him back again, and bid him take them gloves out of his pocket; he said he had got none of mine, but he pulled them out of his pocket, and threw them down on the counter (produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I know they are not, I have the other at home now; he had not paid for them, and he owed me money before; there were four pair and an odd one in the parcel, when he delivered them to me again; he began to shuffle about when I took him back into the house, and he picked a hole in the paper and threw three odd ones out of the parcel into the fire-place, which made up the six pair.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bradistone. I have known the prisoner about five years; he was servant to me; he has quitted my service about four years; I had him in very great respect; I do not think of all the servants I had, during almost fifty years, that I had above one that I thought to be a better servant; I parted with him with regret; I would not now scruple to take him into my service again, if he was in a capacity to go to service; he has a wife and two children; I hope this was a mistake.</p>

I live just by the place where this accident happened; my husband and I were at supper, as the saying is; the prisoner and another woman, which came with him, were eating with us off of a piece of calf's-head, as the saying is; Mrs. Dunn came in very much in liquor, as the saying is; she said, Andy, will you come and drink with us; he said, I am in company, as the saying is; said she, I shall never forgive you, if you don't come and drink with us; then, as the saying is, she came to him and took hold of him, and chucked him under the chin, and snugged him to her, as the saying is; I thought to myself it was very odd, so on that, directly after they had drank their beer, they went out of the house, and for a curiosity, as the saying is, I went out after them: when I was at the door, I heard Andy say, I must go home; she said, you shall have some aniseed with me, as the saying is; said he, I don't want any more; I stood and heard this, but was not seen, as the saying is: in a little space of time I came back to my husband, that he might not miss me, as the saying is, because I wanted to see how things went; so upon that, I went in again, and we had our complement of beer, what we could afford, as the saying is; after that, I had a proper occasion to go out of the house, you may understand what I mean, I need not speak it out; I went in again: and when I went out again, they went out of that house which I saw them go into.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was that?</p>
               <p>S. Coney. I cannot tell the sign; I know the house; I believe it was the next house to the corner of Bear-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in there?</p>
               <p>S. Coney. They were in there about a quarter of an hour; when they came out, Andy said, I am going home, God bless you, and a good night.</p>

On the Monday morning, as soon as the news-paper came, I saw in it, that Mr. Smith had stopped the mug; I went to his house and found it was my property; I got Mr. Smith to come with me to the Justice, and had the prisoner removed from Bridewell to the New Goal.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in Crooked-lane. On Friday the 4th of April in the morning, about a quarter after eight o'clock, the prisoner brought a little piece of a knob of silver to me, and desired to know if it was silver, and said, he found it in some rubbish; I weighed it; there was about half an ounce of it; I bought it of him; he said he wanted a pair of buttons, and looked at his sleeve; I shewed him a pair; he bought a pair; I put the silver in the email box, and it was melted down with other silver; before he went quite away he turned again, and said he wanted a pair of silver shoe-buckles; I shewed him some; he chose out a pair, and said, lay this pair by, and I will call in the evening for them; he said, what do you give an ounce for such silver, pointing to some silver mugs, will you give 6 s. an ounce? I said, no; then he went away: I mistrusted he had something not right in his mind; I gave my people notice, that I thought the man had stole something, and wanted to sell it to me. In the evening the prisoner came; I was obliged to be out; he would not tell his business till I came home; when I came home, I said, what are you come for your buckles? and delivered the buckles to him, that he had looked out in the morning; he said he did not like them, he would have another pair; he laid them by, and seemed to be a little confounded, for I had several people by me to be witness; he said, I have got a piece of plate if you will buy it; he put his hand into his right-hand pocket and kept fumbling: I said, I cannot tell till I see it; he pulled out this mug, I looked at it; said I, this is almost a new mug, it has been very badly used; how came you by it; he said he was laying down a pipe, and he found it in the mud, (it was very muddy) I turned it up to look at the bottom, to see for a mark, and the mud ran down my sleeve; come, Sir, said he, will you buy the mug? I said, I believed I should not; said he, then give it me again; I said, no, I shall not; give me the buckles, he said; I said, no, I shall not do that, I shall stop the mug to know how you came by it; said he, I'll bring a person to-morrow morning to prove how I came by it; I stopped it; he went away, and came on the Saturday morning, but I was not at home; he came afterwards, and a publican with him, to give him a good character; said the man, I hear you have stopped a mug, let me see it; I said, no, you shall not till I advertise it; the man said he knew nothing about the mug, and but little about the man, only he used his house about 12 months, and had paid him honestly; I said to the prisoner, how did you come by the mug? he said he found it under the common shore; I said, when did you find it? he said, about a week ago; I said, pray how came it so very muddy, when you brought it last night? said he, then I will tell the truth; I let it lie till the tide was going down, and in the afternoon about five o'clock, I took it out. While the prisoner was with me at noon, I took down his name and where he lived; he said his name was

               <p>I hope the Judge and Jury will speak in my just cause, and listen to what I say. I worked a quarter of a year for Mr. Roberts, at the bank side, in Surry; I was captain of a float there; I was going from the float, and I observed this lying in the mud; when I went to dinner, they charged me to keep off the float, because the tide would be going down; I saw it was a mug without a handle. It was so black, I took off the button, and went to Mr. Smith to ask him whether it was silver or not. I said, Is this silver? he said it was; said he, If you get any more bring it to me, and I'll buy it; I said, Perhaps I may; what will you give me an ounce for it? he said, 4 s. 6 d. I said, will you give me 5 s. 6 d. after that I called again for a pair of buckles I had seen before he came in; I asked for them, and what he would give me an ounce for this old broken plate; he looked at it, and looked at me, and asked me where I got it; I said on the other side the water; is it silver, said he? I cannot tell, said I, you are the best judge; for if what I brought the day before was silver, this must be silver; said he, Have you any body to give you a character? I said I had a publican in Thames street that will; said he, then I'll keep the mug till he comes: I made no resistance against it; I went to this man; he came with me the next morning; I went home again to see after my work over the water; I took the same man a second time. It shews by looking into it, that I must be innocent, or else I would not come so many times; Mr. Smith asked the gentleman if he knew me; the gentleman said he had known me twelve months, and never saw any harm by me, and nothing but what was just and honest. Mr. Smith said he could not give me any money for it, till he got it into the Monday's paper; he asked me my name; I changed my name; I had a reason for that: I, in five years, several times found scarlet cloaks, bunches of stockings, shalloons, and cloths, there is a gully-hole that runs through; I knew my own name would be mentioned in the paper the next day; and so many men worked with me, they would be all expecting a part of it; it is my fancy; this is all spite and malice; I had the care of five or six men under me, to keep them to their working hours. This gentleman holds a tenter-ground for my master, so he will not give me a character.</p>
