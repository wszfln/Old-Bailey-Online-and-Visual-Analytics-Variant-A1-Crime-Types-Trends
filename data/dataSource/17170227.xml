The Affidavit of the Deceas'd was produc'd and read in Court, that he spying the Prisoner in his Master's Garden, who, seeing the Deceas'd, ran to get over the Wall out of the Garden again, he ran a nearer Way and met him just coming down the Ladder on the outside of the Garden-Wall in an adjoining Field; and that following him to seize him, the Prisoner said, G - d G - mn him, if he offer'd to touch him, he would murder him; and that he gave him the said Blow on his Head with the Bill.

Mr.Carpenter gave a very good Character of the Deceas'd, lamentaing the Loss of the best Servant ever had, or feared ever should. The Prisoner in his Defence deny'd he ever was in Mr. Carpenter's Garden; but said the Reason of his being out so soon was that he had a Sister very ill, who had sent for him to come to her. He did not deny that he gave the Deceas'd the Wound; but said he did it in his own Defence. And being ask'd what Business he had with the Hedging-Bill, reply'd, that he carried it to defend himself from Rogues, tho' it seems he need not have been under much Apprehension of meeting any greater than himself, either in Person or Impiety .

The instrument of his Ordination was read in Course, sign'd Georgin Hictes, under the Denomination of Bishop of ford . The Council for the Prisoner was Mr. Kettleby , who indeed did not at all go about to justify any one of the seditions and scandalous Patlages contained in the Libel ; but only argued against the Libel's being found upon the Prisoner, being a Publication according to Law. Mr. Roberts and Mr. Bilssington, two Messengers, deposed, that having receiv'd Orders to take Mr. Howel into Custody, they went to his Lodgings and seized about a 1000 of those seditious Libels, and the Manuscript Copy from which they were composed; and that the Prisoner tore part of the Manuscript Copy in pieces before them, but they secured some part of it, which was produced in Court, and appear'd to be the Original Manuscript from which the Libel was composed.

And several other Witness deposed, he still persisted in giving affronting Language, and told the Prisoner, if he was an Officer, he had Sixpence to drink with him; but if he was not, he would see him out. The Prisoner told him, that he was a saucy Fellow, and, because he was a Soldier, thought he might take the liberty to abuse People. The Deceased told the Prisoner again, if he was an Officer, he had Sixpeace to drink with him; but if he was not, he would see him out. The Prisoner told him, if he would go to the Plough and Horrow in St. Martin's Lane, he might be informed what he was but desired him to go his Way, and he would go his; or if he would go there, that he might go on one side of the Way, and he on the other; and so the Prisoner went on, and the Deceased followed him to the Rails, and pushed him through, and struck him with his Sword undrawn, bidding him. If he were an Officer, draw, and shew him that he could handle his Sword. That the Deaceased drew his Sword, struck at the Prisoner, and cut his Hand before he drew; that than the Prisoner retreated back and did draw, having no other Way to decide himself from being cut to Pieces.

There were some few Evidences, who gave an Account something different as to Circumstances, in Favour of the Deceased; but a far greater Number, and many of good Reputation agreed, that had not the Prisoner so defended himself; he must in all Probability have undergone the same Fate from the Fury of his Adversary.
