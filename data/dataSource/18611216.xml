                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the indictment must fail, inasmuch as the statute upon which it was founded, the 12 and 13 Vic c. 106, had been repealed by 23 and 24 Vic. c 134; and the only arguable point in favour of the indictment would be, whether section 230 of the later Act continued the offence under the former Act, and prevented the repeal taking effect; for there were numerous cases which established that if an Act of Parliament was repealed, the offences contained in it fell to the ground; this same question had arisen in every Bankruptcy Act that had been passed; it arose when 6 Geo. 4 repealed 5 Geo. 4, and again, when that was repealed by 12 and 13 Vic. (Lord Brougham's Act). The learned counsel referred to the cases of Reg v. Swan and Reg v. Nairn, reported in 4 Cox's Criminal Cases, pages 108 and 115, also in the 31st vol. of the Sessions Papers, pages 227 and 279. The <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi> inquired, whether in those Acts there was any section at all equivalent to the 230th section of the present Act. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> replied, that the words were almost identical with those used in 12 and 13 Vic.; if the 230th section had stated, that the offences committed under the former Act should still be offences prosecutable by law, his argument would fall to the ground, but it was confined to "proceedings pending;" the word "penalty" might be relied upon on the other side, but in the cases quoted, the word "penalty," which was used in 12 and 13 Vic, was held to refer to pecuniary penalty, and not to penalty of imprisonment or penal servitude; it could not, therefore, be contended that there was any word in the present Act which preserved the offence, or entailed upon the prisoner the possibility of a conviction of it; for though the penalties were preserved and the proceedings kept alive, the offences were not mentioned, and according to the authorities the offences must be preserved in the clearest and most express terms before a conviction could take place.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">was heard in reply: he inquired, if "penalty" applied to imprisonment and punishment for an offence committed under this Act; whether that offence was a felony or a misdemeanour? but for the reservation, the former Act was repealed; that Act made the offence a felony, by the present Act it was a misdemeanour; yet it was contended that notwithstanding the offence of felony was taken amay, the offence was continued because the penalty remained; that tended to show that if it preserved anything connected with it, it ought to have kept alive the offence eo nomire.</hi> (<hi rend="smallCaps">THE RECORDER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">They are bound to prove a felony; unless it is a felony you have an acquittal.) How did they show this to be a felony? they urged that the penalty for a certain thing was kept alive; he contended that the offence was not kept alive, because the words "shall be deemed a felony" were swept away, and if the penalty remained, there was no power which preserved the right of indicting for this offence. In the Criminal Law Consolidation Act, passed contemporaneously with this, not only were the offences preserved, but the power to try and determine was all to continue as before; here there was no such thing; and supposing "penalty" meant, as was contended, the power of transporting, as well as of inflicting a fine, where was the power to indict or sentence, or what was to be the mode of getting at the parties; he submitted that all that was preserved was the penalty in respect of any matter or thing done; there were no words that were equivalent to an offence, or which showed that it was intended to keep alive criminal proceedings.</hi>

I am in partnership with my brother, James Innes, carrying on business at 210, High Street, Wapping, as warehouse-keepersâ€”on the 1st November I went into the warehouse in Cinnamon-street, Wappingâ€”I found that a window on the first floor, about sixteen feet from the ground, had been openedâ€”I found marks on the window-sill as if ropes had cut into itâ€”there was the mark of a rope clearly as if something had been loweredâ€”I also found ropes on the floor with running nooses in themâ€”I found an empty hogshead on the floor which had previously been filled with sugarâ€”I cannot say how shortly before I had seen itâ€”I do not examine all the packages, they are so numerousâ€”it ought to have contained sugarâ€”I found the wrappers of three bales of canvas on the top floorâ€”I missed six bales of canvasâ€”nearly all the ropes which had bound the bales were left on the floorâ€”the ropes that were made into the nooses were a portion of themâ€”with those ropes they could lower those bales out of the window into a court below quite easily, they were just the length to reach to the groundâ€”the weight of the canvas I missed was about six tons, and the sugar about fifteen cwt.â€”the value of the canvas was I believe from 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the sugar about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.â€”I drew the attention of the police to this matterâ€”I have since seen the canvas produced to me by Stimson, and this is a part of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)â€”they are all marked, and correspond exactly with the way in which my canvas was markedâ€”it does not belong to usâ€”we are merely warehouse-keepersâ€”it corresponds exactly in every respect with the canvas I missedâ€”the sugar has not been foundâ€”I have had between five and six bales of canvas produced to meâ€”some of it has been made up into bagsâ€”reckoning what is made up into bags, there is more than five and less than six balesâ€”this roll does not represent a whole bale, only about a twenty-fourth part of oneâ€”there are twenty-four of these in each baleâ€”ninety-six rolls have been discovered in their original stateâ€”there are a certain number which have had the mark cut offâ€”we have discovered ninety-six of these rolls, and I think twenty-four of these other rolls; they have just been cut openâ€”that is allâ€”I think the canvas came from the manufacturers at Dundee, and the mark that I speak of is their mark, and comes up on the canvasâ€”it is the length and breadth of the canvas.</p>

               <p>retracted as to the letter; that was the state of thingsâ€”he had previously stated by letter that the prisoner had no authority from himâ€”all those letters were anterior to the production of the two documentsâ€”I did not authorize the prisoner to sign the name of William Toodâ€”I think it is the prisoner's handwritingâ€”he had no authority whatever from me to do soâ€”I saw the prosecutor write his name and address in pencil in his pocket-book while he was with meâ€”I cannot identify the pocket-bookâ€”the one he had contained a vast number more leaves than this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)â€”I cannot possibly explain how it was, if he did write my address, that these letters were directed to No. 91 and 95â€”91 would be as likely to find me as 95, and the inference is, that if one came the other wouldâ€”I do not venture to make a specula<lb/>tion as to whether the letter was sent or notâ€”I do not say that the cheque was an imaginary thing altogetherâ€”I think it is possible it might have been returned to the prosecutor if you ask me; and I will tell you why, because in one of his letters he states that one of his letters, directed to William Tood, 95, was returned to him from the post-officeâ€”if that was so, I should think it very likely that the other had been returned; and in one of my letters I believe I put a question to him about that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Perhaps you think it very likely that a man at Bath would send up money, and the very day he sent it up, or a day or two alter, would authorize a person to go up and receive it, and pay back a portion to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not think it at all likely; but if you ask me what has passed between these parties, I will tell you what I do think likely about itâ€”I understood afterwards that the prosecutor's son was a lunaticâ€”I did not know it in the first instanceâ€”the body of the receipt is wholly in the handwriting of the prisoner.</p>

The prosecutor gave me a list of the witnesses. He gave me the order after I told him he had made a mistake in putting 95, Newgate-street, instead of 75. I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the money in August, as the receipt bears date, only it is dated the 17th, instead of the 16th, by mistake; the 17th was on a Saturday, and it was signed on Friday.

The reason of it all is this: I was to have 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for drawing up an assignment for him, upon which he has received 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. since I have been in prison. The man who deposited it in hits hands signed, in my presence, "William Henry" and would not sign any farther, and his relations have put in a claim for the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I should never have been here had it not been that I made known my views of it, that it was signed "William Henry" only, and he wants to get rid of me. I leave it in your hands. I am inno<lb/>cent of the charge that is laid against me; if I had been guilty I should not have gone twice to the bank about the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; but I told the clerk I would pay the expense of their sending the note up to the Bank of England. They charged 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for making the inquiry. I must have been well aware that the note had my name and address on it, and would be evidence against me if I committed myself in any way.

The following week no witness was there; when we came up the second time the policeman said, "I will put you away if I can," and the third week he brings up this old man to swear he saw this young man running with a note in his hand. It is very strange and unlikely that a thief would stop to pick a note out from a lot of money; and if he ran past him quickly it is not likely he should see him so distinctly as to know him again in a different dress at the end of three weeks. My mother can prove that I was indoors all the Saturday till half-past 7 in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Attenborough of the Strandâ€”on 14th November, the prisoner and another man came into the shopâ€”the prisoner said he had just arrived from America, and had been in England fourteen days, that the weather had been so extremely unfavourable, he had not been able to get out much; that he had a niece who was going to India, and he wished to make her a present before she leftâ€”I introduced a brilliant bird necklet, which he liked very much, but asked to look at a teapotâ€”I brought from the window a beautiful little silver kettle, which he liked very much; his friend admired it alsoâ€”they said they should not decide that dayâ€”the prisoner said that he should be taking a carriage drive, and most likely his niece would call with himâ€”on Saturday, 16th November, about half-past 4, they both called again, and said they had come to decide about the neckletâ€”in the mean time I had procured a few more to show himâ€”he said that he wished to see no other than the one he had seen beforeâ€”I took it from the window and placed it on the glass caseâ€”he took it up and said, "It is the prettiest thing I ever saw in my life"â€”he showed it to his friend, who noddedâ€”he then said, "I will take it"â€”I said, "The price is 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."â€”he said, "I am perfectly aware of the price; you have told me once, and I never forget these things; I will take it, and I will pay for it"â€”he put his hand in his pocket to pay for itâ€”I closed the lid, and was going to pack itâ€”he then said, "By the way, there is the teapot"â€”I said, "You mean the kettle"â€”I ordered the porter to go to the window and take it from the window, because I would not leave the neckletâ€”the moment he saw the kettle he said, "That is not the one I saw before, the one I saw before was, a much larger kettle"â€”I assured him that it was the same, as we had no other so smallâ€”he said, "Well, I may be mistaken, I thought it was not the same; could you tell me how much it holds?"â€”I said, "It is what we should call a three pint kettle"â€”he said, "Do not you know what it contains; it is necessary I should know what it holds, because I am about to make it a present to a friend of mine, who intends using it for chemical purposes, and it will be perfectly useless unless I know what it contains; if not too much trouble perhaps you will fetch some water and try it"â€”I hesitated rather, but said to the porter, "Fetch the water, we will fill itâ€”the water was brought, and in the act of pouring it in, the prisoner's friend moved round to his rightâ€”the prisoner said, "I thought it was not the size, I must think it over again, we had much better call again"â€”they both hurriedly went towards the door, and left the shop, which excited my suspicionâ€”I lifted up the necklet case and the necklet was not thereâ€”I ran towards the door, turned to a side street, and saw the prisoner running as hard as he couldâ€”I shouted "Stop thief!"â€”he darted into Hungerford-market, turned into a cigar shop, and threw himself into a corner like a ball, so that I had gone in in a hurry I should not have seen himâ€”I had the door closed and accused him immediately of stealing a brilliant bird neckletâ€”he said, "Sir, you are mistaken"â€”the mob round the door fetched in the police, and I gave him in chargeâ€”there were no other customers in the shop, but Mr. and Mrs. Attenborough, and their nephew, passed throughâ€”I am perfectly sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I am often employed in plain clothesâ€”I have known Humphreys some years, and I knew Ward before this matterâ€”in consequence of information, I watched Humphreys to Pleydell-street, which turns out of Bouverie-street, Fleet-streetâ€”I saw him come out of a house there about 5 o'clock on Monday morning, 2d December; he went down Fleet-street, Ludgate-hill and St Paul's church-yard, into Cheapside, where he joined Willis at the end of King-streetâ€”they both went to the end of Iron monger-lane, remained in conversation a few minutes; Willis then left Humphreys, and went down the lane, to the back entrance in Iron<lb/>monger-lane, of Mr. Bannister's premises, 2, King-streetâ€”he remained two or three minutes, then left, joined Humphreys, and went to King-street, where he took some coffee of a man who stood there, and I left him in St Paul's churchyardâ€”next morning, about 5 o'clock, I saw Willis and Hum<lb/>phreys come out of Pleydell-street, from the direction of Humphre's house; they went to Cheapside, stopped at the corner of Ironmonger-lane, and con<lb/>versed</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Messrs. Price &amp; Co.'s factory, Black<lb/>friars, and am a messenger in their employmentâ€”on 7th December, from information I received, I went and searched the van about half-past 8â€”it was in the yard; I found in it a five gallon drum of oil, at the fore part, rolled up in the tarpaulinâ€”there was no mark, number, or address on itâ€”Avis was the driver, bat he had not started with itâ€”I followed him out of the yard, hailed him, and told him to stay, as Mr. McNeil wished to speak to himâ€”he stayed, and Mr. McNeil went to him.</p>

               <p>Messrs. Pickford'sâ€”on 27th November, about 4 o'clock, I was loading a truck for Huddlesfieldâ€”where I was loading was right round, you have to go right round, to get three or four hundred yardsâ€”the prisoner came on to my bank, and asked me if I had Birkenhead goodsâ€”I said, "Yes"â€”he said, "I do not mean Birkenhead, I mean Wigton"â€”I said, "No; that belongs to Old Marsh"â€”his van was round at the backâ€”he left a minute or two afterwards, and I missed a chest of tea, within two minutes, which I had seen at the time he was on the bankâ€”the number of it was 2,290â€”it was about a yard or a yard and a half from the place where he wasâ€”I saw no one with himâ€”he had no business at all thereâ€”I communicated with Mr. Robinson.</p>

Pickfordâ€”about half-past 4 on this day, Metcalfe called my attention to a tea chest, in consequence of which I followed the prisoner's van to our establishment in White Swan-yard, Whitechapel, where he had to take the goodsâ€”when I got there I saw a chest of tea covered up in his van, with a sheet over itâ€”I communicated to Mr. Lane that I thought there was some<lb/>thing wrongâ€”the other goods were exposedâ€”the chest was marked 2290â€”the prisoner had his bill with himâ€”Mr. Lane asked him how the chest came thereâ€”he first said that he had loaded it at the Liverpool bank, where he had been to look for a delivery-bookâ€”I then left him in Mr. Lane's hands, and had no more to do with itâ€”I had seen the van near the Liverpool platform a few minutes previous to the chest of tea being missedâ€”to get by the van to where Metcalfe was loading, he had to go 300 or 400 yards roundâ€”the van was close alongside the Liverpool bank, where the chest of tea was missed fromâ€”he had no business there whateverâ€”he afterwards, brought back a chest of tea by my direction.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I beg to explain as far as I can respecting the facts. In the early part of October, I was reading an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> to apply by initials in Bond-street for the situation of a butler; I went home and wrote a letter, and next day took it and asked the shopman if he knew who it was for; he said that he had no instructions to say, but the letter would be sent; in a few days I received a letter from Sir Norton Knatchbull, but did not know who he was, because there was no name; it was to meet a gentleman and lady at Chesham-place on a certain day. In two or three days I went to see them, and saw this gentleman; I presented this letter, he asked me some questions, went up stairs, and afterwards called me up, and I saw a lady, who said, "Oh! you are the tall man who wrote to Sir Norton, you have lived with the Duchess of Somerset as groom of the chamber." I said, "Yes;" she said, "After living in such a distinguished family, would you like to live in a quiet gentleman's family in the country, in a very large house and a great deal of plate, but not much company?" I said that I would live wherever I was comfortable; she said, "Who shall I apply to for your character?" I said, "The Duke, from his official capacity as first Lord of the Admiralty, seldom troubles himself with, characters, and the Duchess I do not wish to trouble, but Mr. Billaud, the steward, knows enough of me to speak of me." I thought, I do not know who you are, and I will not trouble the Duchess until I know what family</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186112160080"/>
               <p>I am going into. Sir Norton took me down stairs, took pen and ink, and asked me who he was to write to; I said, "Mr. Billaud, the head steward;" He said, "Is he in town?" I said, "I do not know;" he wrote and gave me the note to put in the post; going home I saw Mr. Billaud and ran over the way to him; he said that he was in a very great hurry indeed. I said, "I want to speak to you. I have been after a situation. I do not think the place will suit me. I have taken the liberty of referring the gentleman to you, but I shall write to the Duke or the Duchess." he said, "I do not know what I can say; I cannot stop now; you write me a letter." I said, "I believe the gentleman is going to write this evening;" he said, "You had better call at the Admiralty, and see if there is any letter, and take it to your house." I went home. My wife advised me not to write the copy, but I did, and left it, saying, "If you see him you can give it to him." He called in the morning, when I was dressed to go out, and said, "Here is a letter from this gentleman." Mr. Billaud took the letter away, and I did not see him afterwards. I went to Woolwich next day, and on my return to town there were two letters; one from Sir Norton, saying that he was satisfied with the character Billaud had sent, and another saying that I had not answered. I wrote to say that I had been out of town, which was the cause of my delay. My friends pressed me not to disappoint the gentleman, as he might be having company, so I went down to see how I liked the situation. All went well for eight days, as Lady Knatchbull was away, but when she came home she led me a life which these walls for ever would be nothing to; a dog's life. I afterwards received an unfortunate letter from my wife, which caused me to take some beer. I got muddled, and Sir Norton discharged me.</p>
