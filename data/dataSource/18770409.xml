I was at the entrance of the Cannon Street Station of the South Eastern Railway in company with my cousin—the prisoner came up and spoke to me—I referred him to the officials—as I was passing the barriers constable spoke to me—I felt at my waistcoat and found that my watch was gone, and my chain hanging down, which my watch had been fastened to—I was wearing my coats open—afterwards at the station, at the suggestion of some one, I searched my outside great coat pocket, and to my profound astonishment found my watch there, it is worth about twenty guineas—when the prisoner spoke to me he came close, and brought his person into contact with me.</p>

               <p>got home, in Soho Square, and when I cried Wilding said "If he had hit you twice as hard I am sure he would not have hurt you"—the prisoner was not present then—he was when my husband struck me in the room, and he left the room—he did not say anything before he left—I called him back and said "Don't you go out nor go to bed, if any one goes out let this girl go out"—he then came back—my husband gave me another blow because I said she should not stop there, which sent me spinning round the room—the prisoner then said "If you hit her again like that I will hit you, it is something scandalous the manner you have knocking her about lately"—my husband said "Oh, will you"—he said "Yes, that I will"—my husband went to the fire place to get the pocker to strike the prisoner and the prisoner stepped to the head of my bed and got his gun—he belongs to a Volunteer Corps—I had stood the gun there because there was no room for it in the back room—my husband was coming towards him with the poker like this (<hi rend="italic">raised</hi>) in his right hand, and the prisoner stood like that with the gun (<hi rend="italic">detailing</hi>) holding it by the muzzle with both hands as if to ward off the blow; not pointing it; the butt end was towards my husband—I said to the prisoner "Don't hit him Andrew, hit me instead"—I got between them and got the blow on my head I imagine from the gun and I remember no more—when I became conscious again I felt my husband's forehead was growing cold—he was on the floor—I then became unconscious again—and when I came to again my husband was dead.</p>

I am a mineral water maker, of Lloyd's Row, clerkenwell, and have a stable at Garnault Mews—on 3rd April, about 11.15 p.m., I was called up and went to my stable and saw some man putting out some straw which was on fire—the police inspector afterwards examined the premises with me, and I saw him pick up two matches, which I believe had been struck—I received information and gave the prisoner in custody—there had been a fire there in August last, and a. pianoforte placed over my stable was burnt, at which the prisoner had worked for some years—there was a horse in my stable.</p>

I live at 9, Garnault Mews—on 3rd April, about 10.30,1 heard footsteps going towards Mr. Mayor's stable, and in less than four or five minutes I heard footsteps returning, running very fast round the corner of my house—about five or ten minutes after that I heard foot—steps come again towards Mr. Mayor's stable, running very fast, just in the same way—they came back again a third time, walking towards the stable, and in a few minutes returned, running very fast and stumbled near my window and went on again—I spoke to my husband, and then got up and went into the other room, opened the window, looked out and heard a match struck—I then saw a light from the match in Mr. Mayor's stable, but it went out—I called out "Mr. Hicks, is that you?"—he is a horse<lb/>keeper—I got no answer—I called several times "Who is there?" What do you want?" but got no answer—I stood at the window ten minutes, and all was quiet—I then heard a match struck again in the stable, and the stable was lit up by it, but it went out—about sis matches were struck,</p>

I live at 4, Garnault Mews, nearly opposite Mr. Mayor's stable—about 10.30 on this night I saw the prisoner standing in middle of the gateway of the mews, but there is no gate—I looked over his shoulder and saw a piece of paper and some matches in his hand—he went towards Mayor's stable—I then went to my brother's house and knocked at the door, I heald some one running—I did not speak, but stood there and saw the prisoner run by—my brother had gone to bed so I went in doors, and in a few minutes I heard a cry of "Fire"—my husband ran downstairs and I went down and saw the fire in the stable—the prisoner was standing at the top of the mews, looking down to where the fire was, and he got out of the way to let me pass—I caught hold of him and said "You vagabond, what have you been doing of, setting the place on fire again"—he said "I have not done anything; what are you doing of?"—I called my husband, and the prisoner was taken in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been for some time living with the prisoner as his wife at Crown Court, Spitalfields—on the morning of 29th March we were in bed, and I asked him to get up to go to his work—he said "God bless you," and wished me good morning, and I wished him the same and dozed off to sleep again—I was awakened by a blow, and found the prisoner by me with this chopper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand—I took it from him—I was cut and bleeding—I caught hold of his hand and said "What do you mean to kill me?"—he said "Yes I do, you will lock me up"—I said "I will not lock you up if you will get me some water"—I said that to get him out-" side the door—he went out and I never saw him afterwards till I saw him at the station—he was quite sober, he does not drink.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am an hospital assistant physician and examiner at Apothecaries' Hall—on 15th February, about 1 o'clock, Mr. Finnimore fetched me to 1, Morpeth Road—I saw the family, their sufferings were entirely consistent with poisoning by white arsenio—I filled this bottle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with vomit from the sink in the back scullery—I have analised this bottle of tea, there is only a slight trace of white arsenic in it, but sufficient to cause the illness from which Mrs. Barker was suffering—I examined the milk and water, there was a very large quantity in that, some of which can be seen now in solid crystals not dissolved—I analysed some water from the kettle, there was only about a teaspoonful—it gave reactions with three tests, showing white arsenic—I found a large quantity of white arsenic in the vomit which I took from the stone sink—that arsenic could not have been obtained from colouring matter on the tea I have never heard of arsenic being used in tea; copper is very frequently—I should expect to find a sediment in the kettle if a large quantity was put in—there were no grains of white arsenic in the water procured from the kettle, it was a quite clear solution—it is possible that a person could drink a breakfast cup of the tea without feeling the effects of it before he had finished the draft, it sometimes takes an hour or two before the symptoms come on—there is very little taste, some persons say none at all—I think it has a slight taste—I tried the water with three tests and found the presence of poison, there was a very small quantity of water, the rest was accidentally spilled and I cannot say what the proportion was—there was no green colour in the water—this could not be accounted for by phosphoric paste.</p>

I am clerk to Talbot and Nalder, oil and colour merchants, of 60, Fenchurch Street—the prisoner was in their employ as book-keeper—I saw some white arsenic in his possession about three years ago; I asked him for some to kill mice and rats, and be gave me some—I can hardly tell how much he had, but certainly under ¼ lb.—in June or July, 1875, I asked him for some more, and he supplied me with some—I do not know that I saw how much he had then, nor do I know what he did with the remainder—on 14th February, I had a conversation with him about emerald green, which is manufactured from arsenic more or less.</p>

I'll rip them open"—I missed them for a minute and then saw a policeman stop the prisoner, and I went home with the prosecutrix—when we got there the prisoner was there drunk and sitting in a chair with a young woman I used to know—I had padlocked the door, but the lock was broken off—I called a policeman and gave him into custody—the next evening the prisoner came to my room and broke it open again; Foley was then with me—he kicked Hannah Foley in the eye—I went for assistance—on the Saturday, about 12.10 at midnight, I was going to my room I saw a light, the prisoner was there—Foley had not come home then—the prisoner threatened me with a shovel—I came away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, and live at 26, Gower Place, Easton Square—upon the afternoon of the 27th March, about 2.45, I went into the African Chief, in Somers Town, and there met Cain's brother—I bad previously known him—the prisoners were there—I remained three-quarters of an hour—I treated them—I wanted a cab; Cain's brother fetched a four-wheeler—Cain and I got in—we drove away and stopped at the Rising Sun, in Euston Road—I had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy, and Cain a glass of ale brought to the cab; Cain had asked me what my watch and chain were worth at the African Chief—I said 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took it out in the cab while it was waiting at the Rising Sun—we then drove on—in Grafton Street, I received a blow in my face, and another on the top of my head—I had two black eyes; Cain gave me the blows—he and I were the only persons in the cab—I had 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket—we struggled; I felt a tug—the cab was stopped—I missed my watch; a policeman came up—we drove to the station and then got out—the constable walked by the side of the cab; I told the inspector Cain had robbed me, but he declined to take the charge; I was in liquor—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a part of my chain—it dropped from my waist<lb/>coat button when I was standing in the station.</p>

I am a cabman, ray number is 1,626—I live at 12, Cooper's Buildings, St. Pancras—on the afternoon of March 27th I took up a fare at the African Chief at the corner of Chapel Street—Cain called me as I was coming down the road; I know him by sight—they were all drink<lb/>ing and I had to wait some time—Banks and Cain got into the cab—as I started I noticed Waugh on the pavement—I drove on till we got to the Rising Sun, about 150 yards off; when we stopped I saw Waugh again; he had followed us—another young man was with him—we drove on after a while—my attention was attracted by a noise in the cab when we had gone about a quarter of a mile—I heard scuffling and saw Cain's elbow come through the window—I stopped the cab and got down—I saw Waugh running away—I saw Cain hit Mr. Banks twice, once on his right eye and once on his nose; that was after the men were running away—I gave a boy a penny to fetch a constable while I held up Banks by the collar—I went to the</p>

                  </hi>. I am attached to the fire brigade—I went with a fire engine at 12.41 and broke the front door open—I went through the front shop into the back parlour, which appeared all on fire—I got a stand pipe and hose and played on it and reduced it—I afterwards found that there had been two distinct fires; the first in the centre of the floor of the back room, indicated by this red spot on this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was about 4ft. from the grate, where the fire was still alight, but there was no communication with the fire in the grate and that in the centre of the room, because there is a hearth-stone—the edges of the boards were charred, and between the joists there were four or five bundles of firewood, hardly burnt, just slightly scorched—the opening was about 18 in. wide—it was all open, some part of the flooring had been taken away; it was very old flooring—I could not find the pieces—joists number two and four were quite exposed, and number three partially so—pieces of board appeared to have been nailed on the floor—it appeared to be an old breaking, no other portion of the floor could be taken up without force—an iron gas pipe came from towards the shop, along the inside of the fifth joist, I think it was—I did not notice whether the gas was turned on—the other fire was at the top of the stairs, going down to the basement, under the landing—the fire was under these two shelves, the upper parts of which were very much burnt, and the three top stairs were burnt right away—the ceiling which runs under the shop floor and under the landing of the stairs was burnt—there was no communication whatever between the two fires, in fact, one was 5 ft. or 6 ft. from the other—there was a hamper of straw burning under the shelves, I kicked it about and helped to put it but—I was present when Langham cut through from the hole in the flooring to the basement ceiling to see whether there was any more fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The gas pipe ran from the front of the house to the—back, along the joists—my attention was particularly attracted to it, but I could not tell whether there had been an explosion or not—there was no hole in the kitchen ceiling till Langham cut it through, standing underneath it—there was no hole till one of my men, who Trent across the room in the dark and the smoke to open the window, stepped with his foot through the floor, and made a hole in the <hi rend="italic">ceiling</hi>—I was there at that time—that was before it was cut away—I then went down to the basement with Langham, who began to cut away the ceiling—there must have been a hole there, because the man's leg went through it—I had not been down there before that—there was no hole except where the man's leg went through—the hose was brought in through the front of the house and poured into this room with very considerable force—there was a small portion of leaden pipe on the iron pipe, and I saw that it had absolutely been melted—the fire under the stairs was the larger of the two—the tamper was not on the shelves, it was on the ground, exactly under where the fire was on the stairs—there were no doors to the shelves—I saw nothing on the shelves that would be a likely place to stow away old hampers and rubbish—the hamper might have caught fire from the stairs when they were on fire, or the stairs might have caught fire from the hamper—the first floor was filled with water from the hose.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090052"/>
               <p>or five bundles of firewood not burnt—the strings remained on three of them, and between the third and fourth joists there was a quantity of fire<lb/>wood and some fat or dripping—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is some of it—there is a little fat adhering to it—there had been no fire whatever between the second and third joists, which were the nearest to the fireplace, between 5 and 6 feet from it—I am only speaking from memory, and hare not got my measurements with me—it is over 3 feet from the fireplace to the com<lb/>mencement of the third joist—part of the ceiling under the fire had been cut away, and these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the laths which hung down-some of the fat is adhering to them now—between 2 and 3 feet of the ceiling was fatted or greased under the third and fourth joists—I should say, by the remains I saw, that there were between 3 lbs. or 4 lbs. of fat or dripping—I have some of the fat here which I found between the third and fourth joists—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was the only piece which was among the fire; wood, the rest had run through—an iron gas pipe runs between the third and fourth joists, away from the direction of the two fires—the joists ran from front to back of the house—the gas pipe came from the main through the fifth joist, and over the fourth into the third—it did not run parallel with the joists—when it got into the back parlour it ran through the joists to the window, and there was a lead union in the centre between the third and fourth joists, with lead piping, which had all melted away—there had been no explosion of gas whatever—if there had been it would have blown the windows out either back or front—this small piece of lead pipe (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) was melted off the iron pipe, and was left on the firewood, and the gas, which was full on, was escaping, but there was no explosion—the second fire was 6 feet or 7 feet from the first, and 10 feet or 12 feet from the fire<lb/>place—there was no communication whatever between the two fires—there was an ordinary wood partition and a door between them—some straw in a basket had been on fire under the shelves, and some firewood on these shelves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the upper surface of the lower shelf and the under side of the upper shelf are burnt—the fire began on the upper side of the lower shelf, as there is no burning on the lower side—the burnt firewood was on. the top of the lower shelf—here are the remains of it—the fire on the shelf might have communicated with the basket—some of the wood might have fallen, and set fire to the straw in the basket—the three upper stairs were burnt away, and in the partitions about a foot from the door I found a hole such as a hot poker would make—it appeared to have been drilled with something hot—the edges were burnt—that hole would cause more draught under the stairs, and the flame would go further up the stairs—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for the firewood being there, he said he could not tell me—I asked him if he was the last in the place—he said that he was, and that he went to bed about 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no escape of gas when I found this piece of lead pipe on the firewood between 6 and 7 a.m.—I said that the gas was escaping owing to the lead having melted, but no gas was escaping to my knowledge—it would require very little force to get this piece of pipe off, the hand would do it—joists and rafters are the same thing—the pipe went straight from front to back, except that it crossed one joist and went between the rafters—the pipe altered from iron to lead between the third and fourth joists, close against the seat of the fire where the hole was cut—this is a portion of the bend, I cannot say that it is a union—I have never heard of such a thing as a leaden union—an explosion of gas arises from an escape</p>

               <p>when a light is placed to it—an explosion will cause a flare for a short time, and it puts itself out—I saw no crack in the pipe which would account for an escape of gas—this hole in the pipe has been done by the action of the fire—I have not noticed that before—the flooring of the bar or back parlour was a little out of repair in several places; the people of the house call it the bar—I saw crevices between the boards in one or two places—I saw no fat on the boards—I saw a table there—I heard the servant say at the police-court that her master used to keep bundles of firewood on the shelves under the stairs.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I lifted the shelves up—they would not come away and I broke them away—they each rested on two brackets—the lower one went up to the staircase—but I cannot say about the upper one because the staircase was burnt where the shelf would have reached to—flame rises and the draught would cause it to flow up, but I do not think it curious that the under sides of the shelves are not charred—I found under the table in the bar, a tin which had had dripping in it and I put it on the table—it was partly under the table and partly out—I do not think it could have been knocked off the table because the table was pretty well full, and if it was knocked off it would have knocked something else off with it.</p>

I am the wife of John White, we lodged in this house in the back room, second floor—I did not set fire to the house—I went to bed at 11 o'clock—I did not see the prisoner before I went to bed—some time before this the prisoner told me that his business was very bad and he was going to let it, and if he did he would let me know a week before, that we might get lodgings somewhere else—shortly after Christmas he said that he could not meet his rent and should have to borrow 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of somebody, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his mother—I last went through the back parlour about 8 o'clock on the Sunday evening—I saw no firewood there, it was kept on the lower shelf downstairs—I knew that there was a hole in the back parlour floor—I had noticed it during the week—it was not open on the Sunday before, but the tin had been off for some days—I did not see the hole after the fire—I did not see any wood in the hole when I passed through at 8 o'clock—I do not think I should have noticed if there had been—I came down the fire escape.</p>

                  </hi>. I had been in the prisoners service five months at the time of the fire—I used to come in the morning and leave at night—on the night of the fire I left at 6.30; there was then a large fire in the bar—the dripping-pan was always kept in the shop window exposed for sale, and it was there when I left, there were about 7 lbs. of dripping in it—on Monday morning when I returned, the dripping-pan was on the table in the bar—I did not see it under the table—there was no dripping in it then—it was generally kept in the back-kitchen on the lower shelf—I brought up two bundles of wood in a scuttle of coal every night—I brought the bundles up the night before, and they both, still remained in the scuttle in the bar on Monday morning when I got there—there were twenty-four bundles on the shelf when I left—there were two holes in the bar parlour floor which were covered with tin—the tin was over both the holes when I left on Sunday night—the steps were always kept at the top of the house in a little cupboard in the top front room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Two bundles were for the shop and two for the bar but some was always kept under the dresser—four extra bundles were there when I left on the Sunday evening—the fat used sometimes to run out of the tin on to the floor, and on Sunday a good deal of fat ran out of the tin, and' it used to soak through the cracks of the boards in the bar—it was my duty to clean up the bar, and I always cleaned it after the cooking was over—I have been to see the prisoner twice in prison and had conversations with him—the dripping pan was upset outside the fire place about three weeks before the fire and I cleaned it up—the hearth is stone—after the prisoner put his foot through the floor Mrs. White's went through the same hole, and then a fresh tin was put over the hole which was screwed down when I left on Sunday.</p>

I went to the house on Wednesday morning the 28th at 9 o'clock; the prisoner came downstairs with Inspector Hilder, and I said "I am going to take you in custody on suspicion of setting fire to this house, I have taken Borne wood out from between the joists"—he said "How many bundles are there?"—I said "I have found the tyers of four, in between the second and third joists, and I have also found a portion of others between the third and fourth joists and I cannot say how much may be there"—I found these strings and this table knife between the joists; and surrounding the gas pipe I found this wood (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and also some which was charred—I said "Can you give any account of it?"—he said "You might have placed it there yourself for what I know this morning"—I said "What have you to say about the grease, I could not have put that there?"—he said "There was a dish containing some dripping on the table over night"—I asked where it was and the servant produced it from under the dresser"—I said "This looks very suspicious, it will have to be investigated before a Magistrate, you will have to come with me to the station"—he had sent for some ale and he asked me to have some; I refused—he then went to the sink and said "I will face it"—and placed his head under the tap and rinsed his face—he asked to put' on a clean shirt, and I went up to his bed-room with him where his wife was—he told her that we were going to take him to the station, she wished to accompany him, but he told her to remain where she was and keep her mouth shut and answer no questions—I took him to the station—I saw some steps in a cupboard adjoining the second floor landing—there is a trap-door close to the landing at which I got out by means of the steps and went on to the adjoining houses.</p>

In consequence of information I received at Mrs. Allen's, and this escutcheon which was found, I went on Friday to the shop where Hassett and Samuel were working, in Little York Place with the detective—I said to Hassett" We want to speak to you privately"—when we got into the parlour I asked him if he had been to Mr. Allen's on the Tuesday to offer some castings for sale—he said "No"—the officer who was with me said "I am a police-constable, we know more than you think we do; you had better speak the truth"—then he admitted he had offered some of the things, the German silver and the brass castings to Mr. Allen, of Drury Lane—I then asked him if he bought them—he said "No"—I said "Where did you get them from, you know they are my property"—he said he got them from "<hi rend="italic">Ted</hi>" meaning my brother—I said "Did you have any bill?"—he said <hi rend="italic">"Yes</hi>"—he fumbled in his pocket, he could not find one—then we searched his place and found a similar un<lb/>finished escutcheon to the one found at Allen's, and other articles now produced which I have identified—the screw plate I recognise by the stamps upon it—he said my brother had lent him this tool—I said "He had no authority to lend it, and you must have stolen it"—he made no reply—I will swear to these buckles and the India rubber used for shackles—he admitted the shackles were some that were left of a quantity he had had of my brother—he said he bought the stops, but he could not give me a name—these unfinished handles are mine, they are separate patters—as</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising in New Square, Lin<lb/>coln's Inn, and have been a great number of years in the profession—I knew the prisoner's father many years ago, who was also a solicitor—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dated the 4th August, from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This letter contained a request from the prisoner to Mr. Appleyard, to undertake an administration suit for the winding up of his late father's estate</hi>.) The estate had never been properly administered, and he asked me to communicate with Messrs. Rail, which I did, and the various letters which I have here passed between us in the matter of this estate—in September, the prisoner brought me this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) headed "Bank of England, Liverpool Branch," dated the 15th September, 1876, for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed "Ernest Thelli<lb/>sod," endorsed "Percy Robinson," which I passed through my bankers, Messrs. Gosling—he told me Mr. Thellison was administrator of his father's estate, and had given him that cheque as a loan and that he had applied for it on account of some expected share in the remainder of his father's estate—he told me he had seen Mr. Thellison, at the Victoria Hotel, Euston Square—he asked me to keep it for a day or two because he did not mean to take "it as a loan, but demanded it on account of some part of his father's estate—he afterwards brought me this letter signed E. Thellison. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Sir,—Mr. Percy Robinson borrowed 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me which I sent him by cheque on the Bank of England, Liverpool Branch, requesting its acknowledgment In a letter received from Mr. Robinson, he informs me that he has deposited his cheque with you.

                  </hi>. I am a printer at 12, Elder Street, Edinburgh—in August, 1876, I received a letter signed Hawkins—I have lost the letter—I have searched for it and cannot find it—I replied to the letter—that is also lost—the letter I received inclosed an order, and in consequence of its receipt I prepared a number of a newspaper, called "Sport"—on the llth of August I received the letter of the 10th—on the 11th I also received a tele gram—on Monday, the 14th, a Mr. Hawkins called on me; he is one of the prisoners, Frederick Kurr—he asked me if I had received the telegram from Mr. Hawkins—I said "Yes"—from that I concluded he was Hawkins—he then asked me how the newspaper was getting on—I told him we were pushing on with it—he told me to hurry on with it—I said I would—he then asked me about a cheque plate—I had 1,000 cheques to print from this plate—I told him in substance the plate was in the lithographer's hands—I saw Hawkins every day afterwards for a number of days till about the 19th—I prepared the cheque plate—I do not think I showed it to him—I sent it to London—I printed 1,000 cheques, and sent them to 324, Essex Road, Islington, London—I did not print the cheques before Hawkins left—I did print a number of the newspaper before he left—I showed him the newspaper—he took away a proof, and brought it back another day—I printed 500 copies, and he took them away—I told him I required the publisher's name—he gave the name that is on it, "Ralph Henderson, "and the address "Newcastle Street, St. Clement's, London"—the matter from which we printed was sent from London, some in print, and some in manu<lb/>script—the leading article, which is the first article, was in manuscript—the cheques were stamped by the Inland Revenue Department before being sent to London—Hawkins told me to get them stamped—the two copies produced are two of the cheques—the other papers are proofs of the cheques—they were given to the lithographer as a voucher for printing—the plate produced is the plate from which the cheques were printed—I gave up the possession of it—I asked first of all for a deposit, and I received a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which was sent in two letters, half in each, one of the letters containing copy for the newspaper—my bill came to 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received a second payment for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then another for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these payments came by post—they overpaid my account—they are all the payments I received—on August 20th I received a telegram—I then sent off 250 more copies of the paper to the same address as before—I also prepared a coloured die for an envelope and a head plate and die for the paper—the die was lettered "Royal Bank of London" originally, and the head-plate was "Agar Chambers, Charing Cross, London"—the plate was altered to "The Royal British Bank—all my instructions came from London—I printed 500 headings and stamped</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090067"/>
               <p>500 envelopes, and sent them to Essex Road—I did not print any after the alteration—the envelope die contained the letters "R. B. L."—they were sent in one parcel—I saw Hawkins or Kurr again on Friday, 3rd November, when be came to my office in Edinburgh, and brought copy for another news<lb/>paper, the "Racing News"—he also came on November 6th and told me to get on with the copy—a gentleman called Harry Street was with him, who I was a clerk to betting agents—he then left a die and ordered some cards to be engraved with the monogram "C. H."—I did not print it, because the police-called upon me on the 9th November—I had never known Kurr befora—I bad known Murray in Edinburgh four years ago as Williams—I also knew' William Kurr as Anderson four years ago at No. 3, Elder Street, Edinburgh.—they were betting agents, and in partnership as Gardiner and Co.—I then printed for them—I received these five telegrams, dated August 9th, llth, 17th, 20th, and 22nd, from Hawkins—before Frederick Kurr called on me I re<lb/>ceived two letters from Hawkins, which I have searched for and lost—I had a conversation with Frederick Kurr about the contents of the letters con<lb/>taining the order—when he first called he asked me if I had received a telegram about his coming—that was a telegram stating that on Saturday or Monday Mr. Hawkins would be with me; he did not say anything about' tie letters—I afterwards saw him on 3rd November—he did not then refer to those letters—he spoke about what they contained, about a French prospectus—there were 1,000 copies of it printed; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is one that I printed—he never got them—I have not got the copy from which I printed them, I got it from Hawkins—also this letter for a card-plate—he wrote it in the office on one of my envelopes—it is "Henry Cuthbert, 4, Oxford Street, &amp;c, Ecosse."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT PARRY</hi>. It is about four or five years ago that I knew William Kurr, in Edinburgh—it is about a twelvemonth ago that he was carrying on the business of a betting agent as Gardiner and Co. I did not know Mr. Gardiner—there are not other betting agents in Edinburgh now; there were before the Act came into operation that did away with betting in Scotland—it is supposed that betting agents are now altogether abolished in Scotland—before the Act there were numbers of betting agents in Edinburgh—I don't know whether they were Englishmen or not, they came from England.</p>

Brooks—nothing had been said in conversation with Hawkins about that address.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 324,. Essex Street, Islington, and keep a tobacconist's shop—I think I know Frederick Kurr, I only saw him on one occasion—there was permission asked if a letter might be left there—I was not present at the time, the permission was asked of my sister—he came in the evening—I had not the slightest knowledge of who or what he was—I believe him to be the man—he asked for something, a cigar or tobacco, or something of that description—and then asked for a letter that was on the shelf for him in the name of Hawkins—he asked if I would give him that letter, he could see it on the shelf; it was addressed to Mr. Hawkins—I asked him what name—he said Hawkins—I did not ask him his name—I asked him what name the letter was sent in and he said Hawkins, and I passed the letter to him and he went away—I believe I re<lb/>ceived other letters in the same name, I think this was the first—I know that other letters were left there in the name of Hawkins—I think it must have been near about the middle of August—I think I went away about 20th of August—it was some day in August that the man came—I can't say more than that I took no notice of the matter—besides the letters there were several telegrams came to the same name they were to be left till called for; they were called for.</p>

Young, 22, Medina Square, Glasgow"—he brought a little luggage with him; Captain Gifford used to dine with him—the others came in and out very frequently—I could not say how frequently, they were there very much in the morning and afternoon part—I don't know what they were doing; I did not see them doing any<lb/>thing, they went upstairs in the drawing-room—Mr. Young did not go out very much, he went out on one or two Sundays, and several times besides.</p>

I am post-master, at Shanklin, Isle of Wight—I know the prisoner Benson by the name of George Henry Yonge—I think it was in February, 1875, that I first knew him; I knew him during that year and a part of 1876, he was staying at Rose Bank, Shanklin, till the end of June or the beginning of July, 1876—I knew William Kurr by the name of Captain Gifford, and also by the name of Medway—I saw him in my shop, adjoining the post-office—I am a stationer and bookseller—he was not in any one's company—I have never seen Yonge and Gifford together—I believe it was in July, 1875, that I saw Gifford—I could not swear that I saw him more than once; he came in to write some telegrams in the name of Medway—I do not know where or to whom they were addressed—I do not know any of the other prisoners—after July, 1876, I never saw Yonge or Gifford until these proceedings.</p>

The newspaper called "The Sport" purported to be the</hi> 1,711<hi rend="italic">th number, and contained a leading article in commendation of the skill and knowledge of Montgomery in all racing matters; and the letter con<lb/>tained a glowing account of the profits to be realized in the transactions in which the writer was engaged</hi>.) I received the circular at the same time, and inside was a translation into French of the article in the English newspaper—I read the circular and the letter—on 2nd August I wrote a letter to A. Montgomery, Esq., as requested, and in reply received the letter marked E, in which was a cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a similar form to the others—I sent it to Charles Jackson, of St. James's Place, London, and in Sep<lb/>tember I received letter F, and on 5th September I wrote letter G and sent it to the post, I afterwards received letter H, in which was a cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also this cheque for 20,000 francs, payable to Jacob Francis, 2, Cleveland Row, St. James's—this endorsement is in my writing—the cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in the same form as the others—there was, I believe, only one cheque in the letter—I then received letter K with a cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 4<hi rend="italic">,000l</hi>.—all the cheques were in the same form, and they were all signed George Simpson—in consequence of that letter I forwarded a banker's draft for 30,000 francs to Francis in the letter marked L, and 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Jackson—I sent back in letter M the cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had received—the indorsement on that draft is in my writing—on the same day I wrote a letter to Montgomery, the copy of which is marked N—I afterwards received letter 0, and on the same day the memorandum P through the post, and by the same post letter Q, which is signed "Montgomery," inconsequence of which I wrote letter R, and inclosed in it a draft for 50,000 francs, marked S,. and I endorsed my name on it—I had previously sent a telegram to Ellerton—on 14th September I received the telegram marked T—I also received by post the memorandum signed Thomas Ellerton, marked U, and by the same post letter V, in which was a cheque for 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the same form as the others signed George Simpson—upon that I sent my draft W to Eng<lb/>land for 25,000 francs, dated 17th September, 1876, in a letter to Ellerton—this endorsement on it is in my writing—on 16th September I received telegram X from Montgomery, upon which I sent him telegram Y, and another (Z) to Ellerton—I also sent this letter (B 1) to Ellerton, and in<lb/>closed in it draft A 1 for 125,000 francs, this is my endorsement on it—on the same day I sent telegram C 1 to Ellerton, and telegram D 1 to Mont<lb/>gomery, and on the same day letter E 1 to Montgomery—I afterwards received letter F 1 from Montgomery, dated 18th September, in which were two cheques for 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, both of which were signed George Simpson in the same form as before—I sent one of those cheques to Jackson, and the other to Francis—on 19th September I received by post from Ellerton letter G 1, and letter H 1, dated 19th September, from Jacob Francis—I sent back all the Royal Bank cheques which I had received, as mentioned in my letter, including the one for 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also sent to Jacob Francis this draft (A 3) for 3,000 francs, which is mentioned in this letter—it is endorsed in my writing—I also received letter I from Francis, dated 15th September—that was before I sent the cheque for 3,000 francs—I then sent to Montgomery telegram <hi rend="italic">K</hi> 1, and received telegram L 1—I also received letter M 1 from Thomas Ellerton, dated 20th September, 1876—I then sent telegram N 1 to Montgomery, and received from him telegram O 1—on 21st September I sent telegram P 1 to Gregory, upon which I received from</p>

Montgomery" were written by the Montgomery mentioned in that paper, and that he resided in King Street, Piccadilly, and that what the newspaper said about him was true; and that the telegram purporting to come from him, in reality did so—I believed that the cheques George Simpson were genuine; that Thomas Ellerton lived at 4, King Street, St. James's, and was a sworn book-maker; that all the documents were genuine and came from the persons whose names were affixed to them; and that the statements made in them were correct; it was in consequence of that that I sent my drafts—I obtained this draft (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the Credit Lyon<lb/>aise from my bankers, Messrs. Vallet, at Vitry le Franchise—in one of the later letters I was asked for a further sum of 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I went to my bankers, at Vitry, to obtain it—they had not got that sum in their posses<lb/>sion, and at that time I commenced to see by the signatures that the whole thing was fictitious, and it was in consequence of what passed between me and them that I consulted my notary, M. Chavance, at Vitry, and my bankers sent the documents to the office of the Credit Lyonaise, in London, and they were placed in the hands of Mr. Abrahams, the solicitor, about 23rd September.</p>

Coster"—he said that he was staying at McCrae's Hotel but intended to go to some lodgings which he had taken—the cheque clerk wrote this address—I took Benson to the teller and he got this pass-book to take to the telling table that the money he paid might be entered in it—he put his initials "M. C." on the notes at my suggestion and deposited 1,735<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the notes were sent to our head office in Manchester—on 30th September he presented this cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I expressed my astonishment at his sending in a cheque for so large an amount so soon after opening the account, as it is unusual for a stranger to open an account and the very next morning to take away the major part of it so early in the morning, and I said that I had omitted to have a reference from his firm in London—he then wrote "M. Costa and Co., Austin Friars, London," and said that his bankers were Rothschilds—he said that the cheque was for a parcel of diamonds which were offered to him and he required the money to pay for them—I asked him to come again at 12 o'clock that we might have a communication with Manchester, as it was Saturday—I also communicated with the head office, Glasgow—on 3rd October he sent his servant, Frederick Kurr, with this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was doled Glasgow, October 3rd, and signed W.

Elliott"—I asked him to do so—he signed the signature-book, and I gave him two books of thirty cheques each, payable to bearer, and told him I would place the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his credit and send the cheque to London for collection—I filled up this paying in slip, which he signed—he called again next day and said that he wanted 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he had some small payments to make—I had not received any advice about the large cheque, and I gave him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, for which he wrote this cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he called again next day, October 4th, and I told him we had got an acknowledgment of our letter by post-card, but that it would be another day or two before we heard—he said that he would call again, but did not, and the balance is still in our hands—this "I per cent 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." is the interest we allow on private accounts.</p>

I keep the Queen's Hotel, at the Bridge of Allan—on 3rd November last, about 8 o'clock a.m., Benson and William Kurr came there, Benson came first with a servant who was called Penchant or some name like that, Benson gave the name of Young, he brought some luggage with him—he had a private parlour and two bedrooms., he com<lb/>plained of missing a large deal box which had been left at King's Cross, marked P P—on 4th November, I went to the station with the servant and sent a telegram to the stationmaster at Edinburgh about the box—on that afternoon William Kurr came, a bedroom had been taken for him by Benson—he used the same sitting room as Benson, they dined together—Kurr went by the name of Captain Gifford, I know Mr. Monteith, the manager of the Alloa branch of the Clydesdale Bank—Benson wished to know if I knew where he lived; I said I would find out, I did not know—I did find out and Benson gave me a card to send to Mr. Monteith—at that time or shortly afterwards I was introduced to a gentleman named Meikle<lb/>john; Benson gave me this card on which is written "Mr. John Meiklejohn, inspector of detective police, Great Scotland Yard, S.W. Mr. Monteith will be kind enough to come to the Queen's Hotel as soon as possible"—I did not know before who Meiklejohn was, no doubt he was there, but I did not know him, he introduced these persons to the manager of the bank—by Benson's desire I telegraphed to the Stirling Arms, at Dumblane, to have dinner—ready prepared at 2 o'clock on Sunday for five persons—two men came and visited Benson in the morning, they were supposed to be Goller and Wilson from Glasgow—on Thursday, 9th of November, Benson ordered a carriage to go to Alloa, that is 7 miles from the Bridge of Allan—he went in the carriage, I think two persons went with him, but I could not be quite sure,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090088"/>
               <p>Captain Gifford was with him, I believe in the carriage, but I won't be certain—they both came back in the afternoon—while they were at my hotel a good many telegrams came for them—on the 10th, about 6.30 p.m., Mr. Monteith came and dined with them—about 8 o'clock, a telegram came which was handed to William Kurr; he went upstairs with it; he showed it to a youngman in the front hall of the hotel, I don't know who he was, he did not dine in the parlour with them, he dined in the coffee-room—Kurr, walked upstairs to the sitting-room, that he had occupied with Benson, where the dinner was—up to that time I had no notion that they were going to leave—previous to that, Pierre the servant said they were going to stay a good deal longer—they got ready to go, Gifford and the youngman went south by the 9.9 train at night, and Benson went at 10.40 north to Inverness, with his servant—before he left he paid his bill with a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Clydesdale note—he paid the bill for the whole, the young man, the servant, and all—the young man came that evening, he might have been there before, but that was take time I saw him—Benson told me to keep his rooms till Monday—the box that was telegraphed for came before they left—Benson told me if any letters or telegrams came to keep them till Monday, till they came to occupy the rooms again—someone came for the letters on Saturday afternoon; I could not be certain who it was; Bale is a little like him, but I could not be certain—I have no belief on the subject—he looked much stouter than this man does now—letters and telegrams did come for them after they left, I gave them to Inspector Druscovitch, I refused to give them to the man.</p>

I remember a man named Young coming to our hotel on the 3rd of November. Ben<lb/>son is the man whom I knew as Mr. Young. His servant came with him. The photograph produced is that of his servant. He said he expected some friends, and would require one or two more rooms—he did not men<lb/>tion their names. On the following day a gentleman came by the 3 o'clock train from the south; he was called by Young, Mr., and by the servant, Captain, Gifford. He occupied the same sitting-room as Young until the evening of the 10th, when all three left. I saw them mostly every day. I have no doubt about Benson being Young. Kurr is very like Gifford, but I did not see him so often. I have very little doubt as to his identity; I don't think I have any doubt. I never saw Meiklejohn to my know<lb/>ledge; I did not know him. I remember their going out on the Sunday. I remember Mr. Menteith coming on the night of the 10th; they did not gay where they were going. I had received no notice that they were going to leave.

Donald, who brought Murray back to the bank—I told the superin<lb/>tendent that I had heard from Glasgow—they remained for a short time in the office, and came back again and made further inquiries—I showed him the telegram I had received—we asked Murray his name; he said Henry Munro, 9, Amos Terrace, Victoria Road, Leytonstone, Essex—I asked him who Mr. Carsons was, to whom the cheques were made payable; he said a Liverpool merchant, a friend of his who had asked him to come to Alloa for the money—I asked him why Mr. Carsons did not get the money in Liver<lb/>pool himself—he said that Mr. Carsons considered it better that he should send direct for it—I allowed him to go.</p>

I am superintendant of police at Alloa—on 14th November, I took Murray into custody as he was going to the Commercial Hotel—he wore a beard at the time—I said that I wanted to speak to him as I understood he had presented a cheque on the Clydesdale Bank, and I must detain him—he asked who I was—I told him I was a superintendent of police—he said that it was all right—I asked him for the cheques, he produced them, and I asked for them into my hands—he asked if it was necessary, I said "Yes" and I got them and said that I should keep them—he said "Is there anything wrong?" and asked me who Gifford and Yonge the drawers of the cheques were as they were unknown to him, and said that he got the cheques from Mr. Carsons a friend of his in Liverpool—I asked him who Carsons was; he said a speculator in bonds who asked him to go to Scotland for the money and he would give him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for himself—I asked his name—he said Henry Munro, 9, Amos Terrace, Victoria Road, Leytonstone—I took him to the bank and had a conversation with Mr. Murray—I have heard what Murey has said to-day, he is accurate—Murray wanted me in the bank to cross the cheques, I handed them to him—he crossed them and re<lb/>turned them to me—he went to his hotel and I saw him leave for Stirling—at 1.40 p.m.—I let him go because a telegram came from the bank at Glasgow not to detain him on their account—I kept the cheques.</p>

He said that he received the notes from Walters and another man, but I will not swear who the other man was—I had seen Murray above twice before in my life—I gathered from him that the notes were improperly obtained—the two interviews I had with him were very short, and he suggested this to me, almost a perfect stranger—I had never had such a thing suggested to me before, but I was not intensely surprised—I am not in any business since I lost my sight—I was an accountant up to June last when I gave up my chambers, as I was ill—I was in the same chambers in Marlborough Street as Chidley and Morris, the attornies, and did business for them; I acted as an attorney's clerk—they used one of the rooms and I used the other two—I bought the business of Mr. Chidley; I bought the chambers and furniture; I did not buy Chidley with the chairs and tables, but he had the right to use them, he did not pay rent for them—Morris used them too, he paid a very small sum for them—I was not Chidley and Morris; Morris was another solicitor—I do not call my<lb/>self a solicitor's clerk—Chidley gave up the chambers to me, but he continued to use them only for a very short time—I let part of them to Morris, he is not there still; they are all cleared out now—Chidley and Morris did not act as my solicitors, they did their own business, but I did not have any of it—I gave them the place for nothing, because I had the use of their clerk when I wanted him—there were two clerks, one was named Dear, I forget the other; they conducted no law business for me, but I will not swear that they did not do some business which I introduced to the firm, but I never had any money for it, it was a job for anybody to get any money out of them—I know Mr. Pulley, another attorney; I have not been clerk to him; I had something to do with conducting a Chancery suit for him with Madame Louise and a man named Britten, but I had very little to do with it and did not have a shilling out of it—I do not know where Chidley is—Morris is to be found at his chambers, where he has been for twenty years unin<lb/>terruptedly for what I know; I never heard that he retired temporarily—I</p>

The moment I lost sight of Murray I went to Scotland Yard and gave information—it was a little before June, 1875, that a man named Woods, who was at the Mansion House, called upon me to get bail; I did not know his name till the police called on me—I procured him bail and he ought to have surrendered on June 7th, but did not—the only interview I had with him was for two minutes at the Mansion House when he was released—there was a criminal charge against Murray; I was asked to get him bail, I did so and he did not surrender—I did not know him when he came to me, but he reminded me who he was—I knew him as Murray in 1875, but when he called on me in November he said that he had been going by the name of Wells—I was not one of his bail; I was promised 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. For getting bail, which was not paid—I did not know till I went to the police that a reward had been offered, Inspector Clark first told me of it.</p>

               <p>and Co., is precisely the same, by whomsoever written—this paper contain<lb/>ing the words in pencil "Henry Cuthbert, 4, Oxford Street, Edinburgh" (12), is Frederick Kurr's—the signature "Arthur Chapman, for Brooks and Co." to this agreement with Flintoff, is Frederick Kurr's I believe—I can<lb/>not identify letters 15 and 16 as Benson's, but they possess several points of similarity to his writing; they are not disguised, and there is a strong family likeness between them and Benson's writing—I find in my experience a similarly of writing in families, and after the time I have expended in examining the letters to identify them if possible with Benson's writing, I have strained my energies to do it and cannot do it; I cannot say that they are his—this letter from Jacob Francis "Please give bearer an open cheque," &amp;c. is Frederick Kurr's writing, and so are these letters of "11th and 15th September, 1876, and this cheque for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the London and County Bank, signed Jacob Francis (28 and 29), and this letter of Jacob Francis of 23rd September—number 44 is a paying-in slip of the Bank of Scotland, which is in Bale's writing—this paying-in slip of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 7th September, to the London and County Bank, is Frederick Kurr's writing, and so is the en<lb/>dorsement "W. Reynolds" to these two cheques of September 4th (52 and 53), and this cheque of Yonge's on the Clydesdale Bank for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (59)—this cheque of 14th November on the Clydesdale Bank, which the clerk would not cash, is in William Kurr's writing—these two envelopes (66 and 67) ad<lb/>dressed to Morton at Rotterdam are both in the same hand, somewhat dis<lb/>guised; I think they are William Kurr's writing, and the same observation applies to number 70—number 80 is a cheque of the Clydesdale Bank, W. Gifford to W. Kurr, that is William Kurr's writing—those orders written by Chaplin (84, 85, and 86) are I believe William Kurr's, and 89 too, but I have to look at some of them a considerable time before being certain—they are the same as 88, but on the face of them there is an apparent difference, no one could recognise them, except as experienced a person as myself—I can trace similarity between certain formations of the letters—letters 91 and 92 are Benson's—I have this morning examined one of the letters found on Benson in Newgate, and it is Benson's writing—I do not speak to three of these five telegrams from Hawkins to Brydone; two of them are in French and are F. Kurr's—number" 105 is a telegram from Gifford to Wilson; I believe that to be William Kurr's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. Nearly all my evidence is embodied in my report—I have not seen the documents since March 2nd, I had them in my hands two or three days at three different times—I did not strain my mind to come to the conclusion that some of them were Benson's, I said that I could not do it in fairness; I do my utmost to come to a correct conclu<lb/>sion—I daresay I was half a day sometimes in coming to a conclusion upon it and then found that I was not examined upon some of these documents—I was told before I got them that some were said to be Benson's, not all—I accidentally heard Mr. James give evidence on one document only, but I had formed my opinion before and I was rather annoyed at Mr. Abrahams giving it to me to determine, when it had been determined by somebody else, I had expended a great deal of trouble upon it; that was the corrections to the proof sheet of the "Racing News"—one or two of the papers I had net seen till I was in the witness-box—some of Benson's writing is very studiously disguised—the first of these yellow tele<lb/>grams is slightly disguised; the last is also disguised, but less than these other two; there are various grades of disguise—you will see the word</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT PARRY</hi>. I have given my opinion in a great many instances in Courts of Justice—I do not believe that I am infallible—I daresay I have found out that I have made mistakes on two or three occa<lb/>sions—you want to know whether I sometimes alter my mind—I am some<lb/>times wrong if I am asked to come to a hasty conclusion or before I have studied the whole matter; I afterwards come to a different conclusion and it is generally the right one—there was the case of Miss Faithful when the jury and the Judge both thought that I was wrong—I was engaged in one most important case where the jury on the first trial gave a verdict contrary to my opinion and two other juries afterwards approved my opinion; you ask me whether I was not wrong because a jury said so, but six judges gave an opinion one way in the Franconia matter and seven the other; that was a matter of law, but mine is a matter of opinion—I believe I have in one or two instances after forming a particular opinion found afterwards that I was in error; not that it has been proved, but I have weighed it in my mind and I have said "Well, I think I must be wrong"—I am quite certain that the two letters from Northumberland Street! and the letter signed William Harrison, in 1874, were written by William Kurr—it is necessary for me to have a genuine known writing to form an opinion from and that is the reason I have found myself wrong-sometimes in the witness-box, because the standard of comparison is mis<lb/>leading—from the examinations I have made I have conscientiously formed the impressions I have told you—in some instances the opinions of banker's clerks and persons who know the writing would be better than mine, but in very many instances I should not surrender my judgment to anybody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I have not heard Mr. Cherry examined—this paying-in slip signed Ellerton is in Bale's writing; I do not see any palpable disguise—this signature "Roberts, for J. Francis." on this receipt I have been told is Bale's, it appears to be written in an undisguised hand, there is a little variation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. These are instances where several papers are put before me, and I have to state my opinion, not being told whether I am for the defence or the prosecution, and I form my judgment quite inde<lb/>pendently—certain documents were placed in my hands as being in F. Kurr's writing, there were signatures, there was an entire letter number 75, and the little pocket-book number 83—my opinion has been formed under the belief that those were Collings' writing—I did not suggest that the book should be obtained, it came quite unawares—it was shown to me at the police-court; I did not have it in the first instance—I used it to confirm my opinion, but I did not make much use of it as I was quite satisfied with What I had got, and it has nothing to do with my evidence to-day; I have relied upon the letter and the memorandum-book and other documents mentioned here—I quite relied upon letter 75, being Collings' writing, and I believed that it had been proved to be so when I stepped into the box yesterday; it was intimated that the letter would not be proved, and I said "Then I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090106"/>
               <p>shall have some difficulty in proving Collings' writing"—I firmly believe that it is Colling's writing—that very document was partly the foundation of my belief, but there are cheques proved to be in his writing as well, and there is the little pocket-book, no use has been made of it, but I do not exclude it, I have compared the writing in it with the letters, and they appear to be the same; I put it aside finding I had got quite sufficient without it—the capital H in the book you will find is the same as the "H" in H. Cuthbert, in number 12—the "H "in Harris, at the bottom of this page is not Collins' writing—my attention has not been called to it before I should exclude it at once—I noticed it when I had the book—this is all F. Kerr's writing down to the words "One bottle short allowed"—bankers become very familiar with signatures by large practice; I do not think they are much more qualified to speak to signatures than myself, for this reason, that I often know them to be wrong, and they do not go by the signature book, and they very often pay forged cheques.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I have been engaged in the study of handwriting between twenty and twenty-five years, and have been very often-examined in courts of justice, besides which many cases come before me which never come into Court; I do not think I come into Court once in nine times—I tell the parties whether they are right or wrong, and I am as often against them as for them—apart from the desire which I make to be right, every mistake I make is an injury to my reputation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. Although most people write differently, there are still some characters which are uniform and there is something in the writing which you cannot get rid of and which comes out in various degrees if a person writes with his right hand, even if in trying to disguise his writing he actually prints it; I had an instance where in fifty letters I could not identify one, but there was a peculiarity in under scoring by which I iden<lb/>tified the writing—I sift documents through mentally to find what minute points are likely to escape the writer's attention—in writing at a certain pace it is impossible to avoid doing certain things—some persons dot their "is" before and some behind, some make an up stroke and some a down stroke, some cross a "t" from the line, or across it, or upwards or down<lb/>wards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">said the indictment described the instrument as "An order for the payment of money" and to make out the offence of forgery the intent must be to use it as such; the evidence here clearly showed that there was no such intention, and, therefore, this Court had no jurisdiction to try the prisoners for what was not the offence of forgery contemplated by the statute, which was intended to limit cases of forgery to orders for the payment of money</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">called attention to the evidence affecting Murray, which he submitted was not sufficient to constitute him an accessory after the fact</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in replying to the objections, contended that as to the reality of the name of the person drawing the cheque, or the existence or non-existence of the bank, these were questions of fact for the Jury. As to the forgery, the real question was what was the character of the instrument itself, not the purpose for which it was used. The intent contemplated by the law was to make a false instrument pass as true. The question as to the uttering was raised on the Extradition Treaty.</hi>

With regard to like uttering, there was some difficulty; it was obvious here that the utter<lb/>ing was not intended to be in this country, and if upon consideration it became necessary he would reserve that question, but the argument might be met in this way, that as the intent was to have the instrument returned to this country, that might constitute an uttering here. As to the Extradition Treaty, he should feel justified in acting upon the bill found by the Grand Jury, and leave the question of uttering to the Jury.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at 38, Walbrook—I knew William Kurr's father some seven or eight years ago, and did business for him on several occasions—I transacted professional business for William Kurr on two occasions with reference to giving up the house in Marquis Road, that was three or four years ago, because he thought it was danger<lb/>ous to health to live in it, and I endeavoured to put an end to the agree<lb/>ment for him—I recollect receiving a letter from William Kurr about 13th August last year, I gave it to Mr. Humphrey's clerk; this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "29, Marquis Road, Canonbury, 13, August, 1876, to S. Price, Esq., Liver<lb/>pool Road. Dear Sir,—Will you kindly let me know by bearer at what time to-morrow morning you can oblige me by calling here; the matter I wish to see you about is some business I wish to introduce to you It is "important I should see you before going into the City. Wm. Kurr." I live at Barnsbury, two stations beyond Canonbury, on the North. London line—in consequence of that letter I called at the private house a day or two afterwards; I there saw William Kurr—I then went in his company to 55, Beresford Road, and was there introduced to a Mr. Yonge, that is Benson—I had a conversation with him in William Kurr's presence, it was about a bankruptcy petition—I was then engaged professionally for Yonge; I attended at the Court on three or four occasions, and acted in the matter—my first instructions were to avoid an adjudication, there had not been any adjudication then; from that time and "during September I had constant interviews with Kurr with reference to Yonge's bankruptcy petition—you may take it from 15th August till the end of October—I had interviews with Kurr to about the middle of October, occasionally with Benson, more frequently Kurr—the interviews I had with reference to Youge's petition were almost invariably on Yonge's behalf; I insisted on it, in fact, because it took the shape of negotiation for payment of the petitioning creditors debt, and a friend was to find the money for the purpose, and I said on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090110"/>
               <p>more than one occasion Benson should not send me instructions personally, I would rather take them through Kurr, who I knew—I knew nothing of Benson before that day—I took my instructions from William Kurr as I understood it was through him that the money was to be found—I think I had from twenty to thirty interviews with Kurr, some of them were at his private house, he called at my house on some few occasions, and I think at my office three or four times, 38, Walbrook—when I called at his house in Marquis Road, it was generally in the morning, on my way to the city, from 9 o'clock to 9.30—the negotiations were unsuccessful and Benson was adjudicated I think on 23rd September—on the day before I received in<lb/>structions from Benson to offer 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the receiver who had been appointed by the Court of Bankruptcy, in addition to the assets they discovered and had in hand, in order to satisfy his creditors, so that he should not be ad<lb/>judicated—on the morning of the 23rd I called at Marquis Road, and saw both Kurr and Benson there; Benson, I think it was on that occasion who particularly instructed me to offer 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition to the assets, for the purpose I have told you—I said "I think it would strengthen my hands if you were to give me the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so that I should not make an empty offer—I asked for the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Benson said to William Kurr "Will you get it for him," or "for me," I don't know which—William Kurr accordingly left the room and brought in 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Bank of England notes—I ultimately returned them—I made the offer, but it was unsucessful—on my way back that afternoon I called to report what I had done, or rather what I had not done, and I returned to them the same notes—to the best of my belief I put them on the table and Benson took them up and counted them—I can't remember what notes they were; I should think they were old notes, notes that had been in use, not new notes—I should think altogether there were ten or twelve of them—I don't remember what Benson did with them, he seemed to take possession of them—after that there were still further attempts to negotiate with the creditors—I think I saw Benson up to about the middle of October, not daily, I only saw him at intervals—I have a call-book—I have been through my letter's out as far as I could, to ascertain this date, my call-book will not show much about it—I saw William Kurr from time to time in reference to these further negociation—he did not hand me a draft for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Smith, Payne, and Smith—it was sent to me by Kurr—I was out of town at the time—it was to take the proceedings off the file—I received a letter of credit for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payable to Yonge or order—it came by post from Brighton—I returned it to Kurr and Benson—I paid it in to my bankers, at least the proceeds, on 13th October—I subsequently saw Kurr and Benson with reference to it and had a con<lb/>versation with them—that was somewhere about 13th October—I think it was at the Stoke Newington Road—it was either there or the Marquis Road; I forget which—I then handed the money back to them—I have my sons letter out acknowledging the receipt of it, in my letter book—I said that I could not take that money as from Yonge, I could only take any money for the purpose of settling with the creditors—I received the draft for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of settling with Yonge's creditors—I did not like the notion of taking money from a bankrupt for the purpose of settling with his creditors, because the bankrupt ought to have given up every thing to his creditors—what I did was to find some disinterested friend to advance it—my instructions were that he would find funds to advance it—I declined to take the draft as coming from the bankrupt because I knew that it ought by rights to belong to his creditors, and that he was only giving them what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090111"/>
               <p>he ought—I said "I will not take this from you, but if I may take it as coming from William Kurr I will do so"—I preferred that it should appear to come from some one else and not from the bankrupt himself—there was also this reason, that I had known William Kurr and his father, and I did not know Benson—the result of the conversation was I think that the money was taken as a payment—T was told I might take it as a payment by William Kurr—ultimately I think I paid 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and bought up some securities; the debt of the petitioning creditor—I discussed the mode in which it should be done with the petitioning creditor's solicitors, and I took an assignment of the debt, not to myself, to William Kurr originally—Kurr called at my office and asked me what the mode was in which it was to be carried out—I told him—he said was there any liability about this—I said "No practical liability, you buy the man's debt and become the assignee, the only thing I can see about it is that you may be summoned before the Bankruptcy Court to give some account of this transaction"—he said "Well I have had enough bother about him, I shall have no more, he must get somebody else"—there-upon a man named Street was found who became the assignee—I paid the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Street became the assignee—the bankruptcy was not settled then; it is pending still.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. The object of getting the assignee was to buy up the bankruptcy—the debt was 1,350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I expect the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was part of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I ultimately gave Street back the 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had left of the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Benson instructed me that Street would become the assignee—and I paid' Street my cheque for 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the balance I had, and he handed me a cheque for 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I assumed that Street was acting as one of the friends of Benson at that time—in fact it was the bankrupt buying up that particular debt—he or his friends were going to buy up the whole of his debts—Street had been sent to me by Benson at the first meeting to make proof of a debt due by him to Street—I don't know who Street was, except that he gave me his name—I can give you his address from the draft assignment—I had previously sent the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Kurr at Brighton—I did not make out any bill of costs—I have been paid by Benson; that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I asked for costs—I was paid fifty guineas in a lump sum—I paid 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purchase money—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for my costs and I was afterwards paid two guineas for my disbursements by Benson—I really can't say that the money came out of Benson's pocket—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I dare say did—but I really have no knowledge of it—I suppose the fact is that it did; but I have no knowledge about it—I expect that Street and William Kurr were nominees of Benson.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I only saw William Kurr, I think when his father's estate was divided—I heard at that time that he was employed by Deben<lb/>ara and Storr—after leaving them he wrote to me to ask me to give him Borne law copying; I think that was about eighteen months ago—I don't know of either of them having any knowledge of betting transactions—at the time the father died Frederick Kurr was not quite of age, and was a clerk in Debenham and Storr's office—I made efforts to get employment for him as a law writer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOWEN</hi>. I never saw Street but twice in my life, he is a dark man, about thirty years of age, as near as I can remember, I saw him at my office, he came to me by appointment, Benson made the appointments—I have not the slightest idea where he is now—he gave me his address, 25, Devonshire Street, Islington; I am looking at the draft assignment of the debt: he gave me that address on the second occasion;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090112"/>
               <p>he gave me an address on the first occasion, I don't remember whether it was the same, I think it was, I am pretty well sure of it—I think the first occasion that I saw him was about the 21st September—Mr. Hamilton, the petitioning creditor, is a merchant in Mincing Lane, the amount of debts was about 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Robinson, a clerk from the Court of Bankruptcy, stated that the petitioning creditor's debt was</hi> 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and that the debtor had not filed any accounts</hi>.) May I refer to my pass-book for the second occasion that Street came to me; because on that occasion he gave me the cheque for 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was the last day of October, or the 29th of October, I cannot give the exact date, the bottom entry in the book, 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is my cheque for 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I handed to Street, there is no entry of the 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Benson said that Street was indebted to him in a sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he came on 21st September, to make a proof, and when I found what it was, I would not take it; it was for money lost on a betting transaction—I received from Street, on the second occasion 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a cheque, on the Holborn Circus Branch of the Union Bank of London, it was a cheque drawn in Street's name, signed by him, and payable to me, or order; that does not appear in my book for this reason, my appointment was for the 4th November, to complete the pay<lb/>ment of this cheque, he gave me a post dated cheque of that date in exchange for my cheque of 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I had in hand payable to me by Kurr, who declined to become assignee, and Street took that money and found the balance for the assignment—I never saw Street excepting on those occasions, or heard from him or of him; I never knew any<lb/>thing of the man before or since—I have not inquired after him since, nor after any of them—I gave Street my cheque for 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before I got the 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I was careful to get the consent both of Benson and Kurr, together to the giving of this 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over—I said "Am I to understand that Street is a man of respectability, and that I am to hand over this balance," and they said "Yes"—Benson I believe said it, but it was in Kurr's presence; the bankrupt authorised me to pay over 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the assignee who was going to take an assignment of the petitioning creditor's debt; all I wanted was a good discharge for the money—Benson said that the creditors were all personal friends of the bankrupts, except three, and if the debts of those three were purchased he could arrange with all the others himself—no doubt the object was to get those three creditors paid; first I offered to pay the trustee, he declined, and then I was going to buy the other creditors in detail—I do not think I should know Street's handwriting—I saw the cheque, and I have his endorsement to the 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—the first time I saw Benson was at Beresford Road I went there with William Kurr—I don't think I have here any entry of the dates of my interviews with Benson—these are the whole of the entries 1 have in the matter—these are my shorthand clerk's transcripts of entries taken by him—I have none in my own handwriting; these are what I dictated to my clerk from the call-book, and he took it down in shorthand and transcribed it—the first time I received money from William Kurr was in Bank of England notes, which he fetched from another room; they were handed back to Benson—on the second occasion I received a bank bill or a letter of credit—I have never seen that since; I cashed it at Smith, Payne, and Smiths; I should say it was a letter of credit—it was on a sheet of letter paper; I think I cashed it on 13th October—I received Bank of England notes for it—I don't know that Benson knew I was going to cash it, or what was to be done with it—it was received by my son; it was directed to my office and received by me in a letter from Benson—the most</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090113"/>
               <p>ordinary thing would have been for me to pay it in to my own account—I was not asked to get bank-notes for it; I was not asked to do anything with it; I was to keep it for the purpose of purchasing these debts—I "have not got the letter I received from Benson; I returned it perhaps immediately afterwards, because I refused to take the payment as from Benson; I treated it as a withdrawal of the payment by Benson to me—I paid the bank-notes into my own bank immediately—I did not pay Street's cheque in to my bank for the reason I gave before, that he had post dated it—when the purchase was completed I had to send and get the cheque cashed into notes, and I took the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes with me, and paid it there and then as the purchase-money for the debt—I paid the cash into my own bank, the Chancery Lane branch of the Union Bank, and here is my pass-book with the entry of the payment in (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I think I paid it in before I had the interview with Benson and Kurr, at which I said I could not receive it from Benson—I think I kept it about six days,' until I could see them; I received it on 6th October; I can tell by a letter out—I never knew William Kurr by any other name—I have seen him both at Beresford Road and Stoke Newington, but I never went with him but to Beresford Road; he took me there, that was the first interview I had with him—I don't think he had occasion to give any name there—when I went to both places I asked for Yonge—Mr. Hamilton was the petitioning creditor who was to assign the debt to Street—1,350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the debt, 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had proved for, and 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had not proved for, 1,350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all was due to him; the whole of that was to be assigned to Street—the security that Hamilton held was two letters of guarantee signed by Benson; it was rather an intricate case, there were two creditors in fact, the letters are here, one was to Hamilton, and one to Matheson, another creditor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. The debt arose in this way: Hamilton and Matheson had become security for a man named Andrews for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a Scotch Insurance Company, and in consideration of their becoming bound Benson was to cover them with these letters of guarantee, and they were to have certain securi<lb/>ties deposited with them, 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. actual value in Portuguese Government stock—it was Andrews who had deposited the securities—he was to have Hamilton's debts and securities; the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Portuguese stock was not among those securities—the security Street was to have was simply some shares in the Bartrup Coal Company; the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Portuguese Government shares were given to Matheson, who kept those; but with regard to the Bartrup shares, they put them at less value, and those were the shares that were assigned to Street; it was a very complicated thing—as near as I recollect the last time I saw Benson was late one evening, about the middle of October, when he came to my house—the last time I saw William Kurr was about the middle or the 20th November—he came to me after this fraud had become exposed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. He came to my house one evening and I had a converses<lb/>ation with him, he came to me among other things for advice—I should think I saw him two or three times a week in September, it was always about this bankruptcy and nothing else, I had no other business with either of them than that—where some creditors are bitterly hostile and others not the only thing you can do is to conciliate the hostile creditors; I did not think there was anything wrong in that, or I should not have done it; I should not have lent myself to the transaction if it had been palpably brought before me that that the bankrupt was finding money belonging to his cre<lb/>ditors;</p>

               <p>if I had known the status of the parties then as I do now I would have had nothing to do with it—really and truly I thought he had borrowed 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Kurr, I have no reason now to doubt that; I have very little doubt now that the money came from Benson.</p>

I live in Sutton Street, Clerkenwell, and am theproprietor of the Crown Brewery, in partnership with Mr. Grimble—I know William Kurr, and also Mr. Wiggins—I remember their calling on me in the morning in the autumn, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I had a black mare which had been under Wiggins' treatment, I asked him if he would like her out—he said no, he would see her in the stable; I asked him why he was in such a hurry—he said "We are going to Sandown Races"—they were in the street in a gig—Kurr was driving—he drove away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, of High Street, Deptford, and have been a customer of Mr. Chatwood, of 120, Cannon Street; of whom in 1875, I bought a genuine Chatwood's safe—early in 1876 I required another safe for another business of the same sort—I went to Cannon Street, where I saw Scott—I told him I required a safe for my business premises at Deptford, describing the size I required—he said he had not one at that time but if I waited two or three weeks he probably might hear of one—shortly afterwards he wrote saying he had met with such a safe as I required—I called on him and he gave me the size—I said it was rather larger than I required—I asked him the price and he said 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him; it was more than I expected to pay—he said the price new would be 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said it was made by the firm of Chatwood, for the Peruvian Government</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090126"/>
               <p>and that it was then in Paris, and he would advise me of its arrival in London—I then left—some two or three weeks after I received a letter from Scott which is destroyed—I have searched for it—it was from Chatwood's Company to the effect that the safe had arrived and to get my place ready for the reception of it—all the letters from Chatwood's Company, bore "120, Cannon Street;"—the place was prepared at 9 o'clock according to instructions—the safe arrived at about 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day—six or seven men came with it with Wagner as the foreman—they were three or four hours fixing it during which time Wagner was there apparently superintending and directing them—the door of the safe was open and I called Wagner's attention to the fact that the name of Chatwood did not appear on the door on the inner part; it should appear on a sort of central plate on the inner part of the door—he said that the safe had been repainted and it was obliterated or erased—I also called attention to the want of the escutcheon on the outer part of the door; and he said that it had been taken off to be re-lacquered—it is a sort of tablet over the keyhole to protect it—I gave him some money for beer and they left—Steel looked on for about an hour while they were putting the safe in its place—I cannot say whether he heard the conversation between Wagner and me—Wagner called the next day but I was not there—an escutcheon was brought the next day or the day after, and put on in my presence—two or three days after, before I saw Scott again, Steel applied for the money with this invoice "to second-hand safe "so much—I objected to it as it did not specify that it was a Chatwood's safe, and I refused to pay—he said he would take the invoice back and report what I said—next day, or the day after, he brought this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) upon which I paid him the money—I saw him sign it—I cannot say whether the body of it is in his writing.

I gave him this cheque, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the rest in notes and gold—It is not my own cheque; but it was paid to me—I saw Scott some two or three days afterwards and asked him how it was there was a Lord's lock on one of the doors and the rest of the locks were made by Chatwood—he said that it was the wish of the Peruvian Government to have one of Lord's locks put on—I parted with my money thinking it was one of Chatwood's safes—I should not have bought it otherwise—I saw Mr. Chatwood about August, who told me that it was not one of his safes—I had never seen him before—I had bought a safe of him previously—I believe he saw the safe at my place, but I was at another shop when I saw him—I mentioned the escutcheon to Scott and he said it had been re-lacquered.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. The safe I bought before was a new one—I concluded that transaction with Scott, I looked upon him as the manager; I knew nothing about Mr. Chatwood not dealing in second-hand safes—I took these proceedings at Greenwich some time in March, I think—I am the prosecutor—Mr. Chatwood has not said that he will be liable for the expense; I hope he will be; he has not said directly that he will be—I was defrauded by his people—the delay in my taking proceedings was because Mr. Chatwood had told me he was going through his books—I heard later on that Chatwood had discharged Scott, or quarrelled with him, and I heard that he had other complaints against Scott—I had not, independently of Mr. Chatwood, had any engineer to look at the safe; I have since, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090127"/>
               <p>not an independent person—I have not the slightest idea whether it is "Chatwood and Co.," or whether Mr. Chatwood is the company—I merely want a safe and go to his place for it—I know nothing of the people—the bolts of the safe fit badly—I am not an engineer—I have not instructed an engineer to look at it—I believe Scott applied to see it and saw it since this inquiry, I was not there at the time; they have never made application at my place to see it since—they asked the Magistrate to make an order for it to be seen, but he refused to makes the order, and I objected to show it unless recommended to do so by my solicitor, Mr. Boardman—I never received an order and they have not applied to see it—I made the objection in the midst of conversation at the police-court—I do not know that an engineer was sent on Scott's behalf to my place of business to see the safe and was refused permission to see it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GLYN</hi>. Wagner appeared to be foreman of the men who brought the safe; the principal conversation I had with him was about the beer for the men—the safe door was open when I asked him about the name—Wagner said the escutcheons had gone to be re-laquered and somebody would come and fix them—he did not tell me where they had gone or who had told him so—I did not ask him what name was going to be on; certainly not my name—I do not remember Wagner saying he supposed my name was to be put on, to the best of my belief he did not, I will not go further than that—I never saw Wagner again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Steel</hi>. The day the safe was delivered you did not come down with the others, but came later on—I did not hear you make any observation; I did not know what your business was-; I do not remember your asking if the safe had been delivered; you stood there looking on while the men fastened the safe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I was not there when the escutcheons came down, which was two or three days afterwards—there was something about the Government of Peru on them—the safe is not in the brickwork, it is merely rested upon timber, it is 6 feet high, it is a very great weight, you would have great difficulty in getting it up here; we are on the ground floor—this is one escutcheon. (<hi rend="italic">This was inscribed "E. Gobierno, Del Peru</hi>") The other is just the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman at Bolton to Chatwood and Co's works, where the patent safes are manufactured—I have been there nine years and knew Wagner as being employed there as safe finisher; he left about four years ago—I have seen the safe at Mr. Carpenter's, which he bought in 1876—it is not a Chatwood,'s safe, nor was it made at the Bolton manufactory; they have no other manufactory—it is not so strong as our patent safes, the material is thinner; the lock is Chatwood's, but it is not intended for a safe lock at all, it is simply intended for a wooden drawer; it would not be proof against burglars—I have tested the composition between the plates, and I believe it not to be fire-proof—I should say the safe as it stands, taking the price of the material and workmanship, would be produced for about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is intended to imitate a Chatwood's safe—there is a T iron frame in the body and the look-case used is to represent Chatwood's, but it is put together in the <hi rend="italic">block</hi>, what we call a <hi rend="italic">block</hi> jib—any man with a ham<lb/>mer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090128"/>
               <p>and chisel could put a safe together in that manner; it is not done by machinery; ours are done by special machinery—I have been down to Middlesborough to see a safe at a Mr. Eaton's, a pawnbroker, which is numbered 7,643; that had been manufactured by us in the ordinary course and sent to the London depot as a stock safe in December, 1871; Wagner finished that safe—this escutheon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of our make; not the lock; it goes over the key hole; it would be used as a deed-box escutcheon, not a safe escutcheon at all—this escutcheon marked "E. Gobierno, del Peru" is not our manufacture at all, but it is made out of our material, our 3 inch till lock castings; some of them are in London in stock; they come up as rough castings and are kept in store for repairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. The material and workmanship of the safe might be produced for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a genuine safe of that size fitted up in that manner would be about 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it would be considerably stronger—we should not charge 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be the net price—I cannot Bay that we sometimes allow 50 or 60 per cent.—the frame in question is a T frame and a solid flange lock, an angle iron set in a solid flange lock case without the claw bolts—ours have not claw bolts in that quality but they have in some qualities—the solid flange lock-case is like ours in general appearance, but is not so strong—Mr. Chatwood is not the company, he is managing director and patentee—I cannot say whether this patent has expired or not, but two or three have; the patent includes the solid flange lock-case, T frame body, and invincible lock; I cannot say which have expired—the strength of the door of one of our safes of the quality of the one in question would be three-eighths of an inch—I said that the thickness of this safe was three-eights of an inch, on the first examination; I only saw it on Friday night and made a hasty examination of it—I say now, after a second examination, that it is full quarter—when I said it was three-eighths thickened up to five-eighths I meant the solid flange lock-case; the lock-case and the door of the safe become one; the lock-case is a plate round the edge of the door, making the edge of the door appear to be five-eighths thick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The difference between the safes is that the one in question is of thinner material, not so heavy; is not made by machinery; the difference is in the locks and the composition—we mix sawdust with alum; there is less alum in Mr. Carpenter's safe, and we use hard wood and his is soft wood.</p>

               <p>lock, it is for a wooden drawer, and not made for a safe—these locks were kept in stock at Cannon Street, in pigeon holes, for the purpose of sale-Scott had access to them—this is a blank key, it is not the proper key of that lock—they never make keys to this sort of lock so long as that—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the original length of key for that size lock—this was the original key to that lock before that other key was put to it—it is one of Mr. Chatwood's keys, but not of his finishing to the lock—it differs in a slight alteration to the levers inside the lock—it differs from the original one very little—I think it lifts the levers up a little higher—the escutcheon is screwed on outside the safe door—when the escutcheon is put on the original key is not long enough to open it—the key now here attached to the lock is made to open it when the escutcheon is on—the blank key is to show how the keys are sent up from Bolton—we kept blank keys at the stores in a cupboard, and that is one of Mr. Chatwood's—on the back of this escutoheon you will see marked "Chatwood's three till"—the material it is made of is the same as this, evidently showing that this escutcheon is made out of these castings—this escutcheon which was on Mr. Carpenter's safe, is one of Chatwood's genuine escutcheons used for deed chests only, but never for safes—I generally kept the blank keys locked up in a cupboard—this key appears to be made out of a blank—these castings were not for sale at Cannon Street, they were used for making up safe locks only in the workshops—I have seen the safe at Mr. Carpenter's, and took off some of the locks—this handle was put on in my presence and taken off again to show me that it fitted—this lock I did not take off—it was screwed onin my presence and taken off again the same as the handle—the keys wereattached to it—I only took off these two locks—there were three on the drawers, I believe—this is one of Mr. Chatwood's—those locks are never used for anything but drawers—there were locks then missing from four drawers at the depot in Cannon Street—I do not know when they were taken off—this lock seems to have been taken off this drawer—I produce the drawers from Cannon Street, from which evidently the locks have been taken—they are never sold; I have seen Wagner frequently at the stores after and before business hours—as far as I know he had no business there.</p>

That key is from Mr. Carpenter's and that is the very lock off the safe—on the key there is "Chatwood, 120, Cannon Street, E.C" on one side and "Invincible "on the other—why I say that key is not made by Chatwood, although bearing those words, is because this stamp is ordered for the London shop's use only, but the original key made for this sort of lock is always stamped at Bolton, "Chatwood, Bolton" on one side, and "Chatwood's Invincibles "on the other—there is not the least doubt that that is made out of the same blank as this—the two handles do not come from the same pattern and the heads of the screws are different—I did not fit the key produced to the lock.</p>

               <p>formation of "Chatwood and Co., Limited"—I first began the manufacture of safes nearly twenty years ago—my first patent was dated 1860—a limited company was formed for carrying on the business in 1863, from which time I occupied the position of general manager up to the time of my meeting with a railway accident at the end of 1868, when I was obliged to relinquish the office, and I was away from the business—I was appointed managing director again in 1874 I think—the depot in Cannon Street first came into existence, I think, in 1868, which I believe was first on the company's own account entirely, and afterwards I took the entire responsibility of the commercial part of the business, and the company supplied the safes to me on sale or return—they remained the property of the company until after they were sold, and an account sale was rendered regularly to the company of the parties' names to whom they were sold—I was responsible to the company for the debts, and out of that I paid all commercial charges not only in London but in Bolton, Manchester, and everywhere else—I got a commission on the amount of business done—the people employed in London were at one time the company's servants, and at another time my servants—I think that would be about 1870—in August, 1874, I suspended payment—when I resumed payment I entered into this agreement with Scott—this is the original. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 14th January</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">between Samuel Chat<lb/>wood, of Bolton-le-Moor, and James Henry Scott, appointing Scott agent in London</hi>.) Books were kept at Cannon Street, in which sales were entered—it was Scott's duty to make reports daily by post to me at Bolton of everything that was sold—I had on one or two occasions taken safes back of my own manufacture—Scott was competent to take safes back of my own manu<lb/>facture in part payment for others, allowing a suitable price for them—that was reported to me and entered in the books—I never gave permission to Scott or knew of his selling second-hand safes without communicating the circumstance to me—I have seen this safe of Mr. Carpenter's—I practically superintend the manufactory at Bolton—the safe in question was not manufactured at Bolton, or anywhere as a Chatwood's patent safe—in the first place it is not fire-proof; it is not of the same strength as those of my make; and not strong as our number 3 quality—the material is not of the same strength—the lock is not a safe lock; it was manufactured at my place, but it is one of very ordinary wooden drawer locks, a cabinet drawer, and the lock called a Lord's lock is a common lock of the same make—the safe is not burglar-proof or fire-proof—it is manufactured by hand; we manufacture ours by machinery—this is not my escutheon, but it is made out of the castings at my establishment—they are for use for 3-inch till locks—we never sell them—I have my books here—no communication was made to me by Scott or anybody else as to this safe at Mr. Carpenter's, neither is there any entry of it in the books—Wagner came into my employ at Bolton six or seven years ago, and left it three or four years ago, I cannot fix my memory—in August last I met Wagner near St. Paul's Churchyard—I told him that I was afraid he bad led Scott into mischief by inducing him to sell new safes of his manufacture as second-hand ones of my manufacture—I said "What right had you to sell one of your new safes to Carpenter, the pawnbroker, as one of my second-hand safes?"—he said "Scott sold it, not me"—he said that he had received 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, that he had not madethe whole of it, but part of it, and that it was made in London; that Scott had not sold a dozen of his safes altogether, and that it was a small matter, and to prove that, he would call at my hotel the next morning with</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of High Street, Dorking—in July last I had a watch, value 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I wished to dispose of, and advertised it in he "Exchange, Bazaar, and Mart"—I afterwards received this letter, signed "A. Hodges," and a card was enclosed "A. W. Hodges, wine and spirit merchant, St. George's Stores, Newington Causeway"—I wrote an answer to that letter asking him to send a cheque fur the amount, and stating that I would hold it over till he had an opportunity of approving of the watch—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090141"/>
               <p>I afterwards received this letter "Sir,—Kindly say per return if we can do business"—I wrote another letter to the same effect as the first and received a reply and this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), upon which I sent the watch by registered post—I paid the cheque into my bankers a few days afterwards and it was returned endorsed "Signature irregular"—on September 6th I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the watch was not worth more than 71., and that the signature to the cheque sent was not that of Mr. Collins, as it would never do to commit forgery, and that the man who gave the writer the blank cheque had decamped with the watch, and instructions had been given to the police, it expressed a hope that within a few days the watch or money would be forth coming</hi>.) I came up to town on 8th August, went to the place described on the card, and saw the prisoner—I said "I have called about the cheque"—he said "Another has been sent"—I said "I have been away for a few days and it may be at home"—I went home, but found no cheque or letter—on 3rd September I came to town again, went to the police-station, and then went with Sergeant Bell to the prisoner's place—I stated "I have called about the watch and cheque"—he said "I have not had it; Lamb had it and he will see to it and send the money—I allowed him to use my name and address"—I had never heard the name of Lamb before—he said "I gave Lamb the watch at the police-station"—next day I applied for a warrant against Hodges at the police-court, which was granted—he was admitted to bail for a week, and on the next occasion did not appear—I have never received the watch, cheque, or money.</p>

On 3rd September I went with Marsh to St. George's Stores, Newington Causeway, and saw Hodges behind the bar—I told him we had come in reference to a watch which had been obtained from Barking by means of a cheque, which had been returned—he said "A man named Lamb wrote for the watch and asked me to allow him to use the sign of our house and the name, and I gave him consent to do so, I am very sorry I did; I knew Lamb would not send the amount and that the cheque was wrong; I afterwards received a parcel by post and opened it in the presence of the postman, and saw that it was a gold watch; I kept it and Lamb called for it once or twice, but I would not give it to him; I then took it across to the police-station, and the inspector gave it up to Lamb"—I mentioned about the cheque being returned and asked him where it was—he said he had given it to his master—I asked him who his master was—he said "Mr. Thompson, a coachman, of 5, Prince's Square"—I went there and saw Mr. Thompson and he gave me a cheque—I then went before the Magistrate, who issued a warrant—at the second hearing Palmer was a witness—he was afterwards tried with Lamb, and Lamb pleaded guilty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner said to Marsh "You will have the money, I have seen the person, and no doubt he will send you the money, probably to-night or to-morrow; it was very silly perhaps of me, it was rather a curious affair, as he was not in possession of any money and could not give a cheque; that is the reason I would not give him up the watch"—I went to Mr. Thompson and received the cheque from him, and the letter. The prisoner was behind the bar managing the public-house for the landlord"—he used to pay so much a week to Mr. Thompson—I have known him as a publican before—he used to keep the Peacock—Palmer was tried for conspiracy—he was convicted on another charge, and they did not proceed</p>

Collins," and sent it—I had no authority to do so, but Collins would not have known anything about it if the cheque had been taken up at the time—I had seen Collins before—I was at Hodges' when the watch came, we examined it; he put it in his pocket—we went into the bar parlour and spoke to Mr. Thompson—he stayed some time—I called him out and said "Am I to take the watch to realise, and see what it is worth?"—he said "No"—Mr. Thompson then said said something in the bar about retaining it—I said "If you are going to do that how about the cheque; I shall get into trouble about it?'—Thompson said "Do not give it up"—I said "Then we will go the police-station," which we did, Hodges taking the watch—we saw Inspector Page; I said very little, but Hodges made a speech—Hodges afterwards took the watch to a pawnbroker in the Blackfriars Road—I did not go in, but he told me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was offered for it, which he declined to take—I then went to another pawnbroker and pawned it for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I took the money to Hodges—he said "I shall not meet the cheque, as you can only get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it"—I said "Very well, it will make a very bad job for me; you owe me a certain amount of money; there is the balance; I shall stop it—I handed him over 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.
