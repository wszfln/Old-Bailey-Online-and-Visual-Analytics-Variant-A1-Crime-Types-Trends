                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital—between 11 and 12 o'clock on 10th August, Easter Monday, I saw Hewitt at the hospital; he had a deep wound over the temple, extending down to the bone; there were three bruises over the scalp—he was quite insensible and remained so for some six or seven hours—he remained in the hospital till 24th April, suffering from concussion of the brain, which the injuries to the head would account for—the symptoms for the first two days were very serious and might have proved fatal—it will be some weeks before he will be fit for work—such a stick as that would cause the injuries—great violence must have been used, in my opinion.</p>

I keep a chandler's shop in Neale Street—I know Barry by sight, but I never spoke to him till Easter Tuesday—on that night I heard a disturbance outside; I went out to see what it was—there were about thirty people outside; most of them were women—I did not see Barry there; if he had been I think I should have seen him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 39, Baldwin's Gardens, Holborn, and am a dealer in crockery—on Saturday night, 8th April, about 10.30, I was with a hand-barrow of crockery at the corner of Cross Street and Leather Lane—I saw a two-horse cattle van coming from the direction of Hatton Garden towards where my barrow was, the Leather Lane way—I believe the prisoner was driving—there were two other men on the <hi rend="italic">dickey</hi> of the van—they were coming at an ordinary trot, eight miles or so, perhaps a little less—I thought there was not sufficient room to pass my barrow, and I held my hand up for them to stop, and called out "Stop"—no notice was taken; the van drove on, and struck a basket with some goods in, which was in the roadway beside the barrow; the crockery was smashed—I ran to the near side horse's head, and asked them to stop to see what damage they had done; I laid hold of the bridle and the reins—they did not stop—I went on with them to the Griffin public-house in Clerkenwell Road—when I got there I let go—I had gone very nearly a quarter of a mile, I should think, laying hold of the reins—I called a constable's attention, and we got into a hansom cab and went in pursuit of the van; they were not caught—after I let go the reins I heard a shriek, and I asked them to stop—while this was going on I saw the man do something—I don't know if he was whipping the horses—I was very much upset, for I did not know how to get off; I asked them to stop for me to get off—I think from what I could see that the horses had got the upper hand of him—I think the smash of the crockery may have frightened them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman O</hi> 130). On Saturday night, 8th April, about a quarter to 11,1 was on duty in Clerkenwell Road—I saw there a van drawn by two horses coming round the corner from Leather Lane; they were galloping at 9 or 10 miles an hour, I should think—after they got round the corner between three and four yards I saw a man crossing the road towards Reid's brewery; the road is wide there—the horses knocked him down, and one of the wheels, I can't say which, went over him—I at once jumped at the horses, and tried to stop them—I got hold of one rein of the off-sid ehorse, and ran with them about 120 yards but was unable to stop them, and was obliged to let go—I could not see that the driver tried to pull up at all; the van went down the Gray's Inn Road, turned to the right towards King's Cross, and I lost sight of it—besides the man who was driving I saw two men in the van, standing up by the side of him—I should think the van drove down Gray's Inn Road at 11 or 12 miles an hour—I did not hear the smash of the crockery—I should think the man was about a yard from the pavement when he was knocked down—the last witness and a constable got into a hansom and tried to catch the van—I went back to the place where the man had been knocked down; I found a constable there with him, and the man was bleeding from the head and insensible—I took him to the Royal Free Hospital in a cab—I could not say who the man was who was driving—I did my utmost to stop the horse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They came out of Cross Street into Leather Lane, where there are barrows and stalls in the roadway—going along Leather Lane there is a sudden turn into what was called Liquor pond Street, at the corner of which is Reid's brewery—I was on the side from which the deceased had crossed—it was not dark at that corner; there is a difference in the light directly you turn out of Leather Lane—Reid's brewery is a dead wall—there are five or six lamps on it, I think—I caught hold of the rein in my right hand and the trace in my left hand, and ran along—I did my very best to stop them; they were powerful horses, and I could not—I could not tell whether the driver was pulling the rein tight that I was holding, or whether he was trying to pull up or not; the horses did not slacken their speed.</p>

               <p>the last witness—I saw this van coming round from Leather Lane into Clerkenwell Road at a rapid pace, about 9 or 10 miles an hour—when it got about three yards or more down the Clerkenwell Road it knocked a man down, and I saw the fore off wheel go over him, and then he seemed to twist round, and the hind off wheel went over him—I called out to the driver "Stop!" he seemed to take no notice of it—the other constable went after the van, and when I found he could not stop it I turned on my bull's-eye, and after several efforts I found the name of "John Lowe" on the van—there was a driver and two other men in front; one of the men by the side of the driver, I can't say which one, seemed to be whipping all the time—the speed increased in the Clerkenwell Road—the other constable had to leave go of the reins—I saw the van turn to the right towards King's Cross—Wakelyn came up to me, and we jumped into a hansom cab and drove about half a mile after the van, down the Gray's Inn Road, as far as Manchester Street—the cab did not gain on it at all; it got right away from us—when we started in pursuit it had about 100 yards start—the speed seemed to increase in the Clerkenwell Road—when I saw pursuit was useless I told the driver of the cab to pull up, and went back to the Royal Free Hospital, where I found the man was dead—that was about 10 minutes after I had seen him run over—I then went to the police-station, and afterwards I and some other constables went to Mr. Lowe's yard in Maiden Lane, York Road, King's Cross; I got there at 12 o'clock that night—I found a Tan in the yard with the horses out, like the van I had seen—I found white mud on it, and on the felloe of the off hind wheel a spot of what appeared to be fresh blood—we stayed there till half-past 3 on the Sunday morning, but could not find the driver of the van, and came away—the horses appeared to trot round the corner, but when the man was run over they commenced to gallop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bonded warehouseman, of 181, Tooley Street—the three prisoners have each been in my employ at some time as carmen, and were known to each other—Hales left in the autumn of his own accord—on 27th December Saunders did not come to work; he was supposed to be ill, and Frett absented himself the same afternoon—I contract to supply vans to the South-Eastern Railway—the carmen take their vans there, receive orders, carry them out, and come back at night and book the work done—on 28th December Frett's van was at the South-Eastern Railway ready loaded—he had taken a load of paper to the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> Office, in Gough Square, and after delivering that he had to go and collect butter from Brewer's Quay, and tobacco from Hill and Co., of Shoreditch—he came to me about 7 o'clock that night and said "I have lost my van"—I said "What was in it?"—he said "Five baskets of butter and some tobacco from Hill's, of Shoreditch"—I said "How did you come to lose it?"—he said "Some person from Nettlefield's, opposite, came over to Hill's and asked if the South-Eastern van was there. I said 'I am here for the South-Eastern.' He said 'We have some empty casks; can you take them?' I said 'Yes.? I then drew my van over the way to Nettlefield's, and they gave me one empty</p>

               <p>cask there, and told me to go on to their other place, a few doors farther on, down a gateway, and they would send a man to bring the other cart up to my van, which they did "—I said "What made you leave your van?"—he said "I just went into the gateway to see if they were coming, and walked back again, and the van was gone"—I said "How long were you away from your van?"—he said "Not a minute, and whoever took it must have been in my pocket"—I said "I can't understand the van going in a minute, and I consider it was gross carelessness, as you had no occasion to leave your van, for the man had already gone down to bring the casks up to you; whoever took it must have been watching you. Did you see anybody standing about or following the van?"—he said "No"—I asked him what made him leave his van, he said "I did it in a hurry, not thinking"—he said that this occurred about 5 o'clock, and he was looking about for his van till 7 o'clock, and had given information at the police-station—I said "If I had done as I ought I should have stopped you this morning for absenting yourself yesterday afternoon"—he said "Oh, don't say anything about that, governor, this is bad enough"—I suspended him as carman, but kept him in the stable, and spoke to the police—on 11th January, Olley, a carman, made a communication to me, and I spoke to Inspector Abberline, and Olley acted under his sanction and mine—on 6th January I arranged with Dawson to let me have some goods to collect on his account; he lives in the Borough—on 23rd February I arranged for another load from the Great Western booking-office, Commercial Road, on account of the South Eastern—when I heard what had taken place I gave Saunders and Hales in custody on the Saturday following—on the Monday morning I asked Frett if he saw anything of Saunders and Hales on the day of the loss of his van—he said "No"—I said "Are you certain of that?"—he said "No"—I said "Be careful, I have given Hales and Saunders in custody; I believe you know all about it"—he said "I never saw them on that day"—I asked him twice "Will you swear it?"—he said "Yes"—I said "You will have to go to Commercial Street with Sergeant Wright"—he said "I hope you are not going to lock me up"—I said "We shall see," and on the advice of my solicitor I gave him in custody—after he went out, Looker, my horsekeeper, made a communication to me—Olley made statements to me from 11th January to 23rd February, which were correct as far at I could ascertain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman in Mr. Taylor's employ—I went there in April, 1881—I was summarily convicted in June, 1880, of stealing two jars of pickles—my sentence was three months—I knew the three prisoners in Mr. Taylor's employ—in the middle of December I was in Duke Street, Tooley Street, loading my van with tobacco and butter, when Hales spoke to me, and said "I can do with that load;" I said "I have got a <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> for it at Hoxton, I don't care about doing anything of that kind now, as I have a wife and child at home"—he went away—on the 28th I took a load of paper to the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> office, Gough Square, and Frett was following me with a load of paper; Hales and Saunders came up—Hales asked me where I was going to; I said "To Smithfield"—he said "Have you seen anything of Frett up hew?" I said "Yes, he is unloading"—just then Frett was coming along, and Hales said "Get along, he is coming, don't let him see us talking to you, or he will think we are telling you something"—I drove away, and left them there—I heard of the robbery on the 29th, and saw Frett that day; he gave me a South-Eastern Railway Company's bill and 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay to the company for him, which he had received on the 24th, and I did so—money should be paid in on the day it is received—on 11th January I saw Hales in Tooley Street, dressed in a suit of new clothes; he did not say anything—after that I told Mr. Taylor what I have stated to-day, and afterwards acted on his and Abberline's instructions—on 12th January I went to the Horse Shoe public-house, Grange Bo ad, Bermondsey, and saw Hales and Saunders, and went with them to the King's Arms—Hales said "How is Frett getting on?" I said "All right"—he said "That is a good job, as he is a good fellow; we had his load and sold it for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave Frett 201. for his share; we had Vial's load of tea, four half-chests and 14 <hi rend="italic">cads,</hi> and sold it for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I said "<hi rend="italic">You done</hi> the job very well;" he said "Yes, and we could do the same for you"—I said "It is not too late now;" he said "No, it is not"—as to Frett's load he said "We drove the van over Blackfriars Bridge, and had it in our hands for an hour and three-quarters; we took it to Bethnal Green, and the man was out, and then took it over Blackfriars Bridge, and while we were unloading the South-Western carman passed, and we thought he saw us "—on the 14th 1 saw Hales close by the King's Arms as I was taking my van to the stable; he stopped me and asked how I was getting on, and said "You know that last foggy Saturday we had a chest of tea out of a van in Crimscott Street"—I remember meeting them both at the Globe in Darwin Street—they said "We have been over to Newcastle Street, Strand, to see a Jew who will do with any goods we get from the docks, and you would have got a better price for your load if we had taken it there "—they also said "We have been to see the South-Western carman, and it is all right; he is the right <hi rend="italic">chap,</hi> the South-Western carman brought the case in his van from Petty Woods, and the South-Western carman had the case himself"—Saunders said I saw Axford in the Borough, and he did not get a load; we were dodging about Buckley's van, but it was no use, he had a doe and a boy on the van; it was loaded with batter and cheese; I should like you to hive a load from Dawson's, it is sot 400 yards from the Mart"—I reported that conversation to Mr. Taylor—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188205010018"/>
               <p>Saunders also said at the Globe "I shall come and see the governor, meaning Mr. Lorney, and if he does not set me to work I shall go to Jack's house for a job, stay there about a month, and let them in for about 30 bags of sand," meaning sugar—Abberline and Wright were at the Globe at that time, and I reported to them from time to time and to Mr. Taylor what was taking place between me and Saunders and Hales—I saw them day by day, and they asked where I was going and what loads I had got, but I never seemed to have a load to suit them—on 25th January I met them in Tooley Street, near Mr. Taylor's office; that was the foggy day; I was waiting about for orders, but got none, and they said that they would come next morning—I saw them the next afternoon, and told them I was going to Dawson's for a load; they said "All right, we will come and see what orders you get"—I went to Dawson's and got the orders, and when I came back, Saunders and Hales were by the van—Saunders said "What orders have you got?" I showed him the orders, and Saunders said "All right, get away"—on getting my load I drove into Southwark Street, and left my van and went into Dawson's for the way-bill, and on coming out I saw Hales close to the van, which had been moved 20 or 30 yards—he said "I think the van is being watched, take it away; I will see whether they are watching me or the van"—he said that he had seen a detective, and said "Here he comes limping along, I would not touch the van for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I drove the van away, and went to Dawson's and unloaded—I saw Hales and Saunders the same night at the Globe, and Hales said "When you drove the van away a lot of detectives ran out from where they were hiding;" he also said that Saunders had gone <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the Mart—on 1st February Hales said "I saw Mr. Taylor looking into a cigar shop; I suppose he was looking for some of his "—he also said "I shall have to be up to something, I am hard up, and had to pawn my clothes on Saturday"—Saunders gave me a piece of tobacco, and said "Ain't you going to smoke, here is a bit of tobacco of J. B. Hill's"—Hales said that he had a chest of tea on the <hi rend="italic">foggy</hi> Saturday—there had been a foggy Saturday—on 18th February I saw Hales in King Street, Borough—he asked where I was going; I said "To Covent Garden"—he said "I followed you from the South-Eastern Bail way, the man has taken a shed at Bed Cross Street, and is paying 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week," meaning Mark; that he had had it a few weeks, and if he did not take many things soon he should give the shed up—on 21st February I saw Saunders at the King's Arms—he said "I saw Beck here last night; I should like you to have a load of goods like he had; Beck had got a new boy with him, and we must watch him about a bit, as we could easily get the boy away and say he was wanted; you know the time when <hi rend="italic">Long Bob</hi> came to the stable and Inspector Kennett?" I said "Yes"—he said "It was about me and Clifford being at the South-Eastern Railway about a case of goods which was lost. I bad that. I thought it was a case of kid gloves going to Falson and Porter's in the City, as it was marked "F. P. "; I had a load of goods out of the South-Eastern Railway round the West End, and when I opened the case in Long Acre it was only colours, and 1 nailed the box up, and drove down Hatton Garden, and left it in a doorway on the right-hand side"—on 23rd February I saw Hales in Bermondsey—he asked where I was going; I showed him my order, which was to go to the Commercial Road for provisions—he said "All</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188205010019"/>
               <p>right, get along, I will come over there"—I went to the Great Western office, Commercial Road, and had 18 cases of provisions, and drew my van away—I then saw Hales there; he said "Draw your van up a little higher and sheet the load up, which, I did, and left it, and went into the office to get the way-bill—he said "Stay in the office, and give me time to get away with it, and then go right home to Mr. Taylor's; give me good time, and then walk right home to Mr. Taylor's, and whatever you do don't tell Mr. Taylor that you saw us"—I went into the office, and when I had been there a quarter of an hour he came to the window and beckoned me out—I went out, and he said "Draw the van round the corner, as it is too open here"—I drove it round the corner and went back into the office; when I came out the van was gone—I had said "Which way are you going?" and he said "Down Leadenhall Street and Queen Victoria Street and over Southwark Bridge into Peter Street"—next day I saw Hales and Saunders at the King's Arms—Hales said "I left the van at the corner of Peter Street, and while I was going through the railway arch, Southwark Bridge Road, I saw Bowditch; (he is one of Mr. Taylor's carmen) he shouted out to me; I turned my head, and I do not think he saw me; I went down to get the place ready, and when I came up again I saw two detectives, and I left the van there and went for Saunders; he came to where the van was, but would not touch it, as there were too many detectives about, and it was as hot as mustard"—Saunders said "It ought not to come this side of the water at all; it ought to have gone to Bethnal Green"—Hale said, referring to a man in the public-house, "That is the man we ought to have taken it to; it was a good load, and the man said it was worth about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">In his defence Williams stated that Phillips asked him to carry a parcel, and he got a cab, which putted up at a coffee-house to get the parcel, but after hearing what passed while he was in the cab lie thought all was not right, and made off. Phillips said he met a commercial traveller in the City who he had known before, who asked him to carry the parcels, but as the string broke, he left them in the coffee-house while he got a cab, and asked Williams to assist him.</hi>

I had nothing to do with Tooley Street except carrying the book over—Bosisto was employed at Fenchurch Street and at Monument Yard—he was not ledger keeper at first; he was afterwards—I stole these three sums while he was ledger keeper—I accidentally opened the letter about four or five months ago; it was long after I had taken these sums—I was away from his service five months, and when I came back Bosisto was still there—I had been travelling in the interval, and when I came back they took me back—Bosisto knew that I was betting; he and I went to Gracechurch Street every day and put our money on horses in a public-house, and I think on one occasion he went with me to a music hall; we did not go once a week—I went to live with Bosisto about a week before I left the service, and I owed about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I left; I paid up some—I have seen nothing of them since—I have not lodged with him since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stockbroker, of 2, Copthall Court, Throgmorton Street—on 30th August, 1878, the prisoner brought me this letter of introduction. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "July 17, 1878. Dear Sir,—The bearer, Mr. R. B. Goodrich, wishes to sell some stock; will you please render him your services in doing so, and favour yours truly,—C. W. Havers. Winsley Street, Oxford Street,"). I knew a Mr. Havers—I had done some stock-broking business for him, and in consequence of that I took that letter as a sufficient introduction—the prisoner said he wanted to sell 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols—I have no recollection of his saying what the total amount was—he would wait at my office while I went to the Bank and gave instructions for the transfer to be prepared—I then went with the prisoner to the Bank and identified him—it is necessary that the stockbroker should identify the holder of the stock—the prisoner signed the transfer as B. B. Goodrich, and I witnessed it in the ordinary way—I recognised him, relying on this letter—he had given me the necessary particulars for me to have the transfer made—I then drew this cheque for 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. payable to Mr. R. B. Goodrich; that would be for the proceeds, less the commission—it is an open cheque payable to order—I gave it to the prisoner—I have no recollection whether he endorsed it—he left, and took the cheque with him—he afterwards called, on me again; I cannot recollect when that was; he asked me to sell some further stock—I declined to act for him—I have no recollection whether the amount was mentioned—some time in March this year I was requested to go to the Bank about this transfer, and I gave a description of the prisoner—some days after I was in Gresham Street with Sergeant Webb and saw the prisoner in the street coming along—I recognised him; there was a slight alteration in the tinge of his beard; it was yellow or sandy—when I knew him I should say it was iron grey to the best of my recollection—I recognised him and spoke to Webb, who took him into custody—I gave a description of the person for whom I acted, and the prisoner corresponded with that description.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first heard that there was something wrong with the transfer when I received a letter from the Bank, in March this year—I then gave a general description as to your height age, &amp;c.—I can't tell the exact words I mentioned—the height I should say was about 5 foot 10 inches, and the age over 60—it was not taken down in writing that I know of—I gave it to the chief accountant—I never went to <hi rend="smallCaps">MESSRS</hi>. Pearce's to inquire after you—I heard that you were in' an office in Basinghall Street—I don't remember the name of Beard being mentioned—the only time I watched for you was the day you were arrested—Webb was there with me, and Mr. Bovill, clerk to <hi rend="smallCaps">MESSRS</hi>.

I reside at 27, Red Lion Square—I have been engaged for a great many years in the study of handwriting, and have been examined as a witness a great many times in Courts of Justice—I have seen the transfer book of 30th August, 1878, with the signature of R. B. Goodrich, also the signature on 1st May, 1879, the three dividend warrants, and the letter of 17th July, 1878, from Winsley Street, signed C. W. Havers—in my judgment they are in the same handwriting as the endorsement on the two cheques—I have seen the genuine handwriting of the prisoner in the order marked C, the draft letter 0, and three letters signed George, dated 20th February, 28th February, and 9th March, marked E, F, and G—I have no doubt that they are in the same hand<lb/>writing as the letter signed C. W. Havers, and to the best of my judgment in the same writing as the signatures in the Bank books, to the dividend warrants, and the endorsements on the cheques, but I do not express so strong an opinion on those as I do on the letter; as to that I have no doubt.

I have known him for years—he opened 'the door and ran out—he had to pass under a lamp outside my window, and 1 saw him then clearly by the light of the lamp—he knows my business—I am a costermonger and florist, and attend the market.</p>

I am a veneer and moulding manufacturer, of 9, Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road—on 15th April, about 1 a.m., I was coming down Rathbone Place towards Percy Street—I saw two men and the prisoner—one pushed me with his shoulder on one side, and while looking at him the other pushed me on the other side—when I got near the step of my door the prisoner said "That is the man, that is him," and hit me with the back of her hand—I opened my door, but only my wife and servant were in the house, and they had the chain up—one of the men struck me from behind in the eye, and I was punched about the head and thrown down on the doorstep—one of them thrust his hand into my trousers pocket, and the prisoner held me by my coat</p>

                  </hi>. I am a single woman—on 2nd March I was living at 30, Mint Street, Borough—I have known the prisoner about six months—I don't know what trade he followed—he lived at 30, Mint Street—I knew Enoch Clark, he and I had lived together for nearly twelve months—we went to live at Mint Street about a week before Christmas—Clark and the prisoner were on friendly terms for all I knew; I never beard them quarrel—they were in the habit of going out together and associating together—I never heard of any quarrel or ill feeling between them—Clark had been a soldier in the 2nd battalion of the Coldstream Guards; he left the regiment in June last—on the afternoon of Thursday, 2nd March, Clark and I were together in the kitchen, in Mint Street—the last time I saw him was between 5 and 6 o'clock; he bid me good-bye—I went into the back kitchen to wash some things and left Clark and the prisoner together in the kitchen—when Clark went out of the kitchen he said "I am going now, I shall see you about 9 or 10 o'clock if I don't see you before"—I did not see them go away; when I came back into the kitchen they were gone—I know how Clark was dressed that day—I have since seen some clothes produced by the police—those were the clothes he wore when he left me that day—Baker had on a black diagonal coat, black waistcoat, and a blue guernsey under it, a white shirt, tweed trousers, and springside boots, a hard felt hat, and a whitish kind of handkerchief round his neck—I did not see Clark or Baker again that night—that did not astonish me much; on previous occasions they had been out all night—I never saw Clark alive again—on 20th March I saw him dead at the Great Northern Cemetery—about 11 o'clock on the morning of 3rd March I saw Baker in the kitchen of the house in Mint Street—I said to him "Where is Clark?"—he said "He will be here in a minute or two"—he said nothing more at that time—I went into the back kitchen to wash, and while there Baker came and said "Look here, the state I am in"—I just looked round; I did not take any notice at tire minute—he pointed to the leg of his trousers—he had on a pair of spring-side boots, gentlemen's buttoned-up boots—I did not notice anything on the side of his trousers—I noticed a few stains the colour of port wine; I did not exactly notice the colour; I just looked round—I was washing at the minute; they were red spots—I did not notice anything on the boots—I did not say anything to him at the time—he showed me two white tablecloths, one largo and one small; he took them from underneath his guernsey and asked me to wash them—I did so, and dried them and had them mangled, and he asked me to pawn them—I gave them to Kate Egan to pawn for me, and she gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a pawn ticket, which I gave to the prisoner—up to that time, except the spots on his leg, I did not notice anything out of the way with him; he seemed the. same as usual—about 2 o'clock I saw him again standing by the table—I asked him if he had seen Clark—he said "If he is not here soon T shall go down and see if I can hear anything about him "—I think he then said as they were coming along to a field there was a fence and there were two policemen, one was on horseback and one was on foot, and the one on foot looked over the</p>

               <p>fence, and the prisoner saw him and took out a port-wine bottle from his pocket and hit him over the head with it, that he hit him a second time and knocked him insensible; with that he missed Clark, and he thought the policeman on horseback must have run after him, as he heard the springing of a rattle, and he must have been caught—I saw some silver knives and forks with white handles, two pairs of nutcrackers, and a fork and spoon in a red morocco case—they were put into a little wooden box belonging to me, which was kept in the kitchen—the prisoner asked me to put them on a shelf; I did so and covered them with a cloth—I did not at any time have any conversation with the prisoner about the spots on his leg—between 3 and 4 o'clock on the afternoon of the 3rd a man named <hi rend="italic">Curly,</hi> whose proper name is Wool ridge, came into the kitchen with a basket—the prisoner spoke to him; I did not hear what he said—they went out after that—they came back between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening—<hi rend="italic">Curly</hi> was carrying a basket; he put it under a form, and left it there—there were several lodgers in the kitchen at the time—the prisoner and <hi rend="italic">Curly</hi> waited until the lodgers had gone, and the basket was then produced from under the form—the prisoner opened it, and produced several pairs of boots of various sizes, women and children's—he also took from his pocket a bottle of wine, a bottle of rum, and a flute in three pieces, with silver tops—he was then wearing his own spring-side boots—I did not notice what he was wearing when he went out with <hi rend="italic">Curly</hi>—the wine was drunk by us and some of the lodgers who came in—<hi rend="italic">Curly</hi> had left—I got the worse for liquor, and went to bed between 12 and 1 o'clock—shortly after the prisoner came to my bed, and he slept with me that night—next morning, 4th March, I got up about 8 o'clock; the prisoner had risen before me, and gone down—he gave me a pair of boots to pawn—I pawned them at Amherst's, in the Borough, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and gave the money and ticket to the prisoner—the ticket was burnt—the same day the prisoner gave me a pair of lady's boots to pawn—I gave them to a lodger named <hi rend="italic">Chick</hi> to pawn, and he brought me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a ticket—I gave it to the prisoner—the prisoner gave the ticket to <hi rend="italic">Muffin Jack,</hi> as he was called—his name is Smith—the prisoner went out that afternoon, taking with him the silver knives and forks, the red morocco case, and the flute—I saw him again between 11 and 12 o'clock—he slept with me that night, at the same place—next day I saw him using a combination knife and fork which I had seen with the other things on the Friday morning when he came home—on Monday, the 6th, I said to the prisoner "It is strange we have not heard anything of Clark"—he said he must have been locked up—I said "Well, I will go down to see; I think I can find out where he is "—he said "You had better not go; perhaps he has given no fixed name or address"—I asked where he thought he would be locked up—he said either at Highgate or Barnet—I continued to live with the prisoner until the day of his arrest—on one occasion, the 6th or 7th March, the prisoner went out, and on coming back he said "I have just read a letter that has come to Nunney from a young man who is committed for trial, and he has sent out to say that Clark was fully committed"—he did not say what the man's name was; he said Nunney was the young man who was committed for trial, and he had sent out the letter to another young man, who showed it to the prisoner—he said Clark sent out word that he hoped I was getting on all</p>

               <p>right with the prisoner—after that I read in the newspaper an account of a dead body being found in a wood at Finchley—I did not say any<lb/>thing to the prisoner at that time;" I don't think he was in the kitchen at the time I read it—I spoke to him afterwards, and said "There has been a body found in a wood, and it is identified as a gipsy, and it could not be Clark, as he was so fair; "Clark was very fair—on another day the prisoner said "I will <hi rend="italic">go</hi> up, to satisfy you, and see the body"—I said I would go if I knew where it was—he said "If you <hi rend="italic">go</hi> you will never find it"—he said "Before I go I know it is not him, because we were nowhere near there"—he afterwards went out for the purpose of going to see—he was away some time—when he returned he said "I went as far as Shoreditch, and I saw reports of a man being identified as a gipsy, of the name of Butler, by a shoemaker at Brentwood"—he said "Don't upset yourself, as I know it is not him"—Clark would have been 21 on 19th June-—on the 14th June <hi rend="italic">Muffin Jack</hi> came to me, and in consequence of what he said I gave him the prisoner's guernsey—on the 16th this photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was shown to me by the police; it is a photograph of Clark, taken as he was lying dead—I then went with "the police to Blackman Street Station, and from there to Kentish Town Station—some clothes were shown me which I identified as the clothes which Clark was wearing the last time I saw him—I then went back to Mint Street—I had not seen the prisoner all that day till 8 o'clock—a friend of the prisoner's then came and gave me a message, in consequence of which I went to a public-house at the foot of Southward Bridge Road—I there saw the prisoner—I said to him "I have seen Clark's photograph and his clothes, and it is no good your saying it is not him"—he made no reply—I said "I shall not go back to Mint Street till it is late, because they have threatened me so"—he said "I shan't go back to-night, if you come over the water I will find you a bed "—I went to Clerkenwell Road and we slept at a coffee-house together—next morning, the 17th, we breakfasted at the coffee-shop, and came out and walked towards the City—I then said "I shall go over the water"—he said "I shan't come over till it is late, as I have got a man to see "—we walked on to King William Street—we there had some beer, and when we came out I saw the prisoner in the hands of the detectives—he then had on the side-spring boots and the coat that he had on when he went out with Clark the night of the alleged murder; in other respects the clothes were different—I last saw the trousers with the red stains on the Tuesday or Wednesday—I saw them for about a week after he called my attention to the stains—I don't know what became of them—the last time I saw them was in the kitchen—I saw the dead body of Clark on the 20th at the Great Northern Cemetery, Colnoy Hatch—I identified it as the body of Clark, who had lived with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Clark left the Coldstream Guards in June last—he told me he had been five years in the regiment—he did not know many persons living about Mint Street whilst be was in the Guards—he was acquainted with two or three persons when he came to live in Mint Street—he knew all the inmates of No. 30—he did not have many acquaintances in the street; ho had some—it is a street frequented by bad characters—when the prisoner showed me the stains on the trousers in the washhouse, he said they were port wine stains—I did not notice them very much—later in the day he said if Clark did not come soon he would go</p>

               <p>and try and find him; that he most have been caught—that was all he said at that time—it was after his return with <hi rend="italic">Curly</hi> in the evening that he made the statement about having met two policemen—Checkley was not there at that time, I think; I am not quite sure—no one was present to my remembrance—the account I read in the newspaper was of the body of a gipsy named Peter Butler being found in Finchley Wood, a man between 27 and 30 years of age—it was not an account of the inquest that I read; it was a description of the finding of the body—it was then I said to the prisoner "It can't be Clark?"—I don't remember seeing any account of the inquest—it was on the same day I saw the account of the finding of the body that the prisoner said he had gone as far as Shoreditch but no farther, for the reason ho gave—it was then he said "Don't upset yourself, for I am sure it is not him"—I noticed no marks or scratches on the prisoner's face or about his person when he returned on the morning of the 3rd March, nor were his clothes in any way torn or disarranged.</p>

I am known by the nickname of <hi rend="italic">Curly</hi>—I am a labourer living at this lodging-house, 30, Mint Street—I had known the prisoner about four or five weeks before 2nd March, by the name of Jack Baker—I also knew the dead man Enoch Clark about I three or four months—we were all living in the same house—I last saw Clark alive on the afternoon of 2nd March, about 2 o'clock, sitting in the kitchen of the lodging-house—I went out with my basket selling primroses and left him there—on 20th March I went with Inspector Dodd to Colney Hatch Cemetery, and there saw the dead body of Enoch Clark—Clark and the prisoner were companions, they usually went out together—about 10.30 on the morning of the 3rd I was in the kitchen at Mint Street—there were several of us there—the prisoner came in; he showed us a knife, each side of which came apart, and one contained a knife' and one a fork—it was a combination knife—he said "This is a funny sort of knife"—I did not take it in my-hand; I looked at it—the blade was about six inches long, coming up to a sharp point—I went out of the kitchen leaving him there—I came back about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and I then saw the prisoner talking to Checkley, whom they called <hi rend="italic">Chick</hi>—he said "Never mind, <hi rend="italic">Chick,</hi> here is <hi rend="italic">Curly,</hi> ho has got a basket"—he said to me "Do you want to earn a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">Curly?</hi> I said "Yes"—he said "Well, come on then"—at that time he had on an old pair of low ankle shoes, cut up the centre, and a blue Guernsey under his waistcoat—we both went out together, I carrying my basket, along the Borough, into a coffee-tavern opposite the Borough Market—we had cocoa, sausage, and bread and butter—while there the prisoner said "Have you got a piece of string for to do up my shoes?"—I told him I had none, but I would get him a piece, and I got him a piece at the bar—he tied his shoes up with it—from the coffee-tavern we went to Moorgate Street Station—he took two third-class tickets to East End, Finchley, and we went by train, arriving at Finchley about 5 o'clock—we went along a road until we came to a place where there were some gipsies, on the right-hand side of the road—we walked past them till we came to the corner of the lane, and there was a ditch in front of me—the sides of the ditch were strutted lip, and he walked across the struts with my basket into the field, leaving me on the other side—he walked right over to the corner of the wood—I don't know the name of the wood; it is the same wood I afterwards went to with Inspector Dodd—I there lost sight of him—I remained where he left me for about half an hour, and he came back to me—he had the basket; the top of it was covered with leaves—he told me they were boots—I could not say what</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 298). On Saturday, 4th March, one of the last witnesses came to my house at New Southgate, and I at once went to Coppett's Wood, near Irish Corner—I went into it, and saw the body of a man lying there between two trees, on his back, dead—one of the two Brinkleys pointed it out to me—he had no hat on; no handkerchief round the neck, but was dressed in other respects, except part of the right hand side of the vest, which was torn away and missing; the shirt was open down the front from the collar, and the coat was lying back; the shirt over the right side of the body, over the breast, was saturated with blood; the left arm was thrown out from the body, the right was pressed to the right side—I noticed one wound on the throat at that time—the left side of the face was covered with blood; that was all I noticed at that time—I sent for Dr. Langford, and remained by the body till the doctor and the inspector came; neither I nor anybody touched it in the meantime—when the doctor came, after the body had been examined by Inspector Bullock and the doctor I searched the ground round about—this was about 9 o'clock; it was quite dark—I found first a hat and this empty hamper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) close together, about 30 yards from the body; that was all I found that night—the body was removed to the Baldfaced Stag at Finchley—the next morning, Sunday, 5th, I went I to the wood after daylight between 7 and 7.30—I searched the wood near where the body was found—I found these old shoes with string in them, about 90 yards from where the body had been lying, in the direction of Irish Corner—at the same place I found a quantity of plate, a pair of plated candlesticks, a toast-rack, six wine-bottles, four empty, two full—the two full were sealed in the ordinary way; some pieces of glass, which appeared to be part of a broken bottle—the boots were exposed; the other things were covered with leaves near the boots—I could see them through the leaves without moving the leaves—it appeared as if they had been covered up and the leaves had been blown away; you could just discern them through the leaves—I could not tell what had been in the bottles—I did not smell them or disturb them—I also found the missing portion of the vest covered up with leaves at the foot of a tree—I produce it; it appears as if it had been torn away; it corresponds with the waistcoat the deceased was wearing; it was about 20 yards from where the body was lying; that was also iu the direction of Irish Corner from the body, between the plate and the body—I also found this gravy-spoon, two pairs of ladies boots, and 11 wax candles at the foot of the tree covered up with leaves, about 20 yards from the body, and 12 from where I found the portion of the vest, in the direction</p>

               <p>of Irish Corner—the boots and gravy spoon were completely covered with leaves; a small portion of the vest was visible through the leaves—I also found this snuff-box or mull 15 feet from where the body lay; that was in a line with the body, in the direction of Finchley; only a small point of it was visible—close beside the mull there was a line of blood, commencing about 23 feet from the body, and extending past the mull to the body—there appeared to be more blood 23 feet from the body, the leaves were stuck together; it gradually grew fainter, ending in a few spots near the body—I could see blood at daylight where the body was lying—this piece of bark (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) had been freshly cut off one tree about 5 feet up—it was found about 6 feet from the body—a mark was left on the tree, and I found it about 5 feet from the tree, which was about 20 yards from the gravy spoon, boots, and candles—I tried the bark to the mark on the tree, and it fitted—the body lay between that tree and another—the tree from which it had been taken was not more than a foot from the deceased's feet—next morning I saw another tree with a very small piece of bark off it, not so large as this, also about 5 feet from the ground.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The charge teas, being concerned with Enoch Clark in a burglary at Mr. Hill's house, and also with wilfully murdering the said Enoch Clark in Cobbet's Wood.</hi>) This charge was read over to the prisoner; he made no reply—3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on him, and a handkerchief and a leather nurse—his coat was taken from him and handed to Inspector Fox; he was stripped and examined by Sergeant Harvey, and I carefully examined his body all over, but found no marks of violence, but on his right thigh there Were a few scratches, very slight, just in the front; I should say that they arose from some skin irritation by the look of them; they appeared to be of recent date—on 20th March I went with <hi rend="italic">Curly</hi> to the East End Railway Station, Finchley, "and he pointed out the place where he stood while the prisoner went into the wood across the struts—the plate was found between two trees which are about 7 feet from each other; it was lying at the foot of each tree hid by the leaves, a portion at one tree and a portion at the other—these two trees were at a distance of 90 yards, in a direction towards Irish Corner from the place where the body was found, and between those two trees the pair of shoes was lying on the leaves within 7 feet of them—anybody entering the wood from Irish Corner would see the tree where the bark was cut off—going into the wood you would be attracted by the blaze on the tree as soon as you got within a visible distance—the marks on this plan are correct—this is the Gipsies' Corner; the red dotted marks are the footmarks—the plan is made to scale, and the measurements are marked on it—on 29th March I went again with <hi rend="italic">Curly</hi> to Irish Corner—he showed me a way across the fields to the Wood Green Railway Station, leaving the Alexandra Palace on the right—I measured the distance from Mr. Hill's to Coppett's Wood; it is 1,190 yards to the nearest side of Coppett's Wood, and from that spot to where the body was lying is about 80 yards, making a total of 1,270 yards from Mr. Hill's—the distance from where the body was found at the south-western corner of the wood in the Irish Corner direction is 170 yards, and from the boundary of the wood in that direction at Irish Corner to the spot where <hi rend="italic">Curly</hi> stood when he went with the prisoner on the Friday is 246 yards—it is about 300 yards from Irish Corner to where the gipsies were</p>

                  </hi>, F. B. C. S. I am examiner in forensic medicine at the University of London, and surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital—Dr. Langford and I saw the body of Enoch Clark at the Baldfaced Stag, Finchley, on 7th March—he was a strong man, about 5 feet 9 inches, and of a muscular frame—there was an old scar on the left arm—he was from 20 to 25 years old—no decomposition had then set in—there were nineteen wounds on the body, all made during life, three of which were mortal; one on the right side of the chest penetrated the right ventricle of the heart, the heart-case being quite filled with blood; it was in the fourth space between the ribs, and was about two inches deep; it was a stab; a sharp-pointed knife would do it—the second wound was in the lower side of the chest on the right side, passing through the liver into the vena cava, the large vein of the abdomen; that had led to copious bleeding—that also had been inflicted by a knife or a sharp-pointed instrument—the third had opened the internal jugular</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188205010074"/>
               <p>vein; and there were four wounds in the neck, six in the back, three in the left forearm, two in the chest, one on the lower lip, one on the left temple dididing the temporal artery, one on the back of the right hand, and one in front of the right thigh—they varied from a half-inch to an inch in length, and they had all been produced by some sharp instrument, and four of them by an instrument at least from three to four inches long—the three wounds on the left arm were just above the wrist, as if he had put up his hand to protect his throat—I have seen a case before where the ventricle of the heart was penetrated, when a man shot himself, after which he shot another charge into his brain, and lived twenty minutes, but it is quite uncertain how long a man would live—the abrasions were made during life on the head, neck, and wrists—the one over the left temple might have been produced by falling against any hard body—there was one abrasion on the back which was made <hi rend="italic">post mortem;</hi> that was probably done in removing the body—he was quite healthy—there was considerable effusion of blood over the surface of the brain and into the cavities; that was probably the result of excitement, and I should think of a struggle—I have seen death result from excitement alone, or combined with a struggle; mental and physical excitement would do it—there was some half-digested-food in the stomach, vegetable pulp and the skin of stone fruit—that had been taken not more than two hours before death—I saw some cuts through the clothes alleged to have been removed from the body, which corresponded in size and position with some of the wounds—the clothes would not necessarily prevent the blood spurting—if he had a tightly fitting dress it most likely would not spurt—there was one dividing the temporal artery, and of course there were no clothes there; that would certainly spurt; the others might or might not—on 20th March I saw the body in the cemetery; the features were quite easily recognised—on March 28rd I received from Inspectors Fox and Dodd, a black diagonal cutaway coat and waistcoat, and a pair of button boots full sized, a blue guernsey, and a clean white tablecloth there was one spot of blood on the right flap of the coat behind quite at the back; it was quite dry—that was undoubtedly blood of a mammal; I applied the modern tests and speak without hesitation—I can't say how long it had been there, but I should say some days; I examined it a few hours afterwards—blood will wear off, and can be readily scratched or brushed off, but the ribs of diagonal cloth would make it more likely that the globule would be preserved—there were some stains on the waistcoat from nitric acid, which is used for testing metals—there was no trace of blood on the guernsey—I do not think the marks would rub off in wearing, but they might be intentionally removed—there was a red stain on the toe of one of the boots which was not blood; I can't say what it was—if blood had been rubbed off with a rag, and the boots cleaned with blacking I should not find it—I scraped them and found no blood—the cloth was quite clean except some stains left after washing; it had been washed, but there were some dark stains of port or something of that kind; it was not blood—a man after receiving such wounds as I have spoken of might live for twenty minutes, but any one of the three fatal wounds would weaken him, and he would not be able to make much resistance, the shock would be so great—he died from his injuries.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188205010075"/>
               <p>not the immediate loss of blood—my analysis was most careful; the spot of blood on the coat could be covered by the top of the little finger—I can't say whether it was human blood—the wounds were made during life—I heard Dr. Langford examined before the Magistrate, and agree with him generally, but there are parts in which I slightly disagree with him—on my first examination of the man I took him to be from 20 to 25 years of age—I stated that the effusion of blood over the surface of the brain was probably the result of excitement such as would be produced by a violent personal struggle; it might be caused otherwise; that was what I said before the Coroner—I stated before the Magistrate "Assuming that the deceased was perfectly healthy and sober at the time, the apoplectic appearance in my opinion would only ha? e arisen from a severe mental or physical struggle, especially at the age of the deceased"—the deceased was a perfectly healthy man—there was no evidence one way or the other of his having been drinking—I saw scratches on the deceased's left hand and wrist and a bruise on the forehead—the scratches were such as might have been caused by finger-nails.</p>

It is possible that the deceased might have been drink<lb/>ing immediately before his death and his stomach show no indication of it; but not strong spirits—if he had taken beer two hours before, it might have passed away—I think alcohol in a concentrated form would probably have remained in a sufficient quantity for detection—there was no trace of red wine—there was a complete absence of anything in the shape of alcohol, either in colour or smell—if it had been taken on an empty stomach within an hour of death, it might have disappeared; but if taken with food it might be seen—there was a considerable quantity of food; it was all in a pulpy state, nearly half a flint of half-digested food—I think the wound in the neck was probably done when he was standing up, because it went quite transversely from one side of the neck to the other—that would not be necessarily so; that is my opinion—it was more likely to be done while standing; of course, the man might lie on the ground and be stabbed in the neck—there was nothing to indicate with any degree of certainty either way as to any of them—they might all have been produced while lying down or while standing up, assuming that the assailant was the same size and height as he was.</p>

               <p>by a blade, apparently from half to three-quarters of an inch wide dagger, pointed, and from four to six inches in length—three of these wounds must have been fatal; there were others that might have been if they had been left unattended—my report agrees with Dr. Pepper's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cause of death was probably exhaustion, consequent upon the loss of blood, and from the shock—enough blood had been lost to occasion death from exhaustion—the wound which penetrated the heart might have been fatal within a minute or so—I think that was the opinion I gave before the Magistrate, and it is my opinion to-day, within some <hi rend="italic">few</hi> minutes—I meant by causing death that it would incapacitate the man entirely—even though he might live on he would be perfectly helpless and unable to do anything, unable to move or offer any resistance—the effusion of blood covering the brain might have been caused by excitement in the struggle, or from drink, provided drink had been taken—there was no appearance of the presence of drink—all the organs of the body were healthy—it was the body of a very muscular man—I think I was asked if more than one person might have been engaged in the struggle with the deceased, and I think I said that might have been the case; but I did not give it as a fact—there was nothing to prove the contrary—I gave it upon being pressed in cross-examination—it was not really my opinion that there was more than one person, but there might probably have been more than one—I gave it as my opinion before the Coroner that death was caused by loss of blood from the injuries received, which were quite sufficient to cause death, and that the effusion on the brain might have arisen from congestion during the struggle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The congestion of the brain from the struggle would be due to excitement—any excitement might have caused the same thing, mental or physical exertion, or from a blow or shock, or a combination of the whole three—extreme mental excitement might cause the congestion of the brain—excessive terror would do it—what I said before the Magistrate was in cross-examination, that from the appear<lb/>ance of the body and the clothing there might have been more than one person engaged in the struggle with the deceased—I meant to say that there was no evidence to the contrary—there might have been two or three people, or a dozen, but there was nothing inconsistent with its having been done by one person.</p>

On 17th March I went with two other officers to the White Bear public-house, King William Street, City—I there caw the witness Emily Matthews—she came out of the house, and the prisoner came out shortly afterwards out of another door—I laid hold of him, and said "I want you"—I and a brother officer then took him across the road into a paper shop and handcuffed him—I said "Do you know me?"—he said "No"—I said I am Harvey, the detective; I arrest you for the murder of your mate Clark in Finchley Woods"—he said "That is what you say; you have got to prove that"—I took him out of the shop towards London Bridge; going along some boy annoyed him by coming and looking in his face, and he refused to walk, and I had to get a cab to take him to the station—I searched him there, and found on him a purse and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2,—I examined his boots, and found they were spring-side boots—I found no knife upon him.</p>

On 2nd November, 1881, I received a telegram from Mr. Zeffat, and went and saw him at 12, Sunning dale Place—he showed me some braids and buttons, and I went into another room, saw the prisoner Trevelli, and said "I am an inspector of police; I have been told you have deposited a quantity of braids and buttons with Mr. Zeffat for an advance or sale; what is your name?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188205010080"/>
               <p>he said "Hamilton Gordon; I trade at 24, Martin's Lane, City"—I said "Where did you get them from?" he said "I shall decline to tell you, you have no right to ask me"—I said "Will you show me the invoice?" he said "No, I will Dot"—I said "I know you by the name of Victor Trevelli. I was present at the Old Bailey in March, 1877, when you were sentenced to five years' penal servitude for forgery; that is my reason. I have known you and your associates for the last 8 or 10 years, that is why I want to know where you got the goods from;" he said "I shall report you for unnecessarily interfering with me"—he showed me an invoice in the name of Hamilton Gordon and Co. relating to these goods, in which the sale price of the goods to him was 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but I did not keep it—I said "You have offered these goods for sale for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and asked for an advance of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is beneath the price invoiced to you; that, coupled with the fact that I have known you so long, causes me to ask you these questions;" he said that he would take the goods away—I said that if he took them out of the house I should charge him with unlawful possession of them, and asked him who the man was who was waiting outside for him; he said "I shall not tell you"—I pressed him further as to who the owner of the goods was, and he said "The man outside"—that was a German clerk named Frater, who I had seen in Trevelli's office—I fetched him, and as I was taking him to another room, Trevelli called out something in German which I did not understand—I told Zeffat to detain the goods—Trevelli told me he was agent for a man at Leicester; I asked him the man's name, but he refused to tell me—Frater wanted to take the goods away, but I refused—on 4th November I saw Trevelli at Paddington Police-station—he said "I want those goods, I am suffering pecuniary loss by their detention;" I said "I shall not give them up"—Zeffat was detaining them at my request—he made an appointment to introduce me to the person he got them from, and Sergeant Mitchell and I met him outside the Mansion House at 2 that afternoon, when he introduced Kendrick, and said "This is the person to whom the goods belong; he consigned them to me"—I said to Kendrick "What is your name, and what are you?" he said "I am a wholesale dealer in haberdashery goods at 10, Walnut Street, Leicester, and have been there five months"—I asked where he was before that; he said "33, Braunston Gate, Leicester; I transferred these goods to Hamilton Gordon and Go. on Monday last; he was to have paid me 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash and a bill for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at three months; I have had one transaction with him before amounting to 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he paid me 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash and gave me a bill for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at three months, which was paid"—I said that I had found Trevelli offering these goods for sale for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than they were invoiced to him for—he appeared much surprised, and said "It appears to me that Gordon has been trying to swindle me; I am much obliged to you for stopping them?—I said "Where did you get them from?" he said "That is a private matter; I decline to tell you"—I showed him this label with the name of Bodega and Ensall, 1, Watling Street, on it, and said "Have you ever had any business transactions with Bodega and Ensall?" they both replied "No, I don't know the firm"—I said "I found this in the parcel of goods consigned by you Kendrick to Trevelli, and claimed by you Trevelli at Mr. Zeffat's:" they again said "I know nothing about it," and Kendrick said "Will you give up</p>

               <p>the goods to me?" I said "Iam going to telegraph to the police at Leicester to ask as to your character and position first," and made an appointment with him to meet me at Paddington Police-station in the evening—I received this paper from Trevelli:" 24, Martini Lane. Mr. Zeffat,—Please deliver to Mr. Kendrick (the bearer) the buttons and braid left with you. Hamilton Gordon and Co. "That was an authority to me to give the goods up to Kendrick if the answer from Leicester was satisfactory—I saw him write that—I then telegraphed to Leicester, and on the same day called on Mr. Ensall, who went with me to Paddington Station, and while we were there, about 5 o'clock, Kendrick came in, and I said "Do you know <hi rend="smallCaps">MESSRS</hi>. Bodega and Ensall?"—he said "No," and then looked at Mr. Ensall and said "I think that gentleman is from <hi rend="smallCaps">MESSRS</hi>. Bodega and Ensall's "—I said "Yes, he is; it appears to me that you got these goods from them on the reference of Hamilton Gordon, who is a convict on licence "—lie then made a statement which I made this note of: M I have known Gordon about five months; have bought goods, braids, and buttons from him, and paid him cash for them; hare had two or three purchases amounting to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; have sold him braid and buttons and received 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash and a bill for the remainder; the bill was honoured all right; gave Gordon reference to Bodega and Ensall; I will gladly give up all the goods to Mr. Ensall; have been ill for some time"—I said "I shall decline to give up the goods to you "—he then wrote and signed this document and gave it to me: "November 9, 1881. I hereby authorise Inspector Morgan to deliver up the goods from 12, Sunning dale Place to Mr. Ensall, of Watling Street, from whom I obtained them. J. H. Kendrick, 10, Walnut Street, Leicester. "On 7th November I went to 24, Martin's Lane, and saw Trevelli and his clerk Frater—Trevelli said "Kendrick brought the goods to this office from Mr. Walker's, a money lender, who lives in Falcon Square; he tried to get an advance on them but failed, and then induced me to take them to Mr. Zeffat's "—I then, with the sanction of the Public Prosecutor, obtained warrants, and on 18th November arrested Trevelli at his house, 45, Ashmore Road, Paddington—I read the warrant to him at the Harrow Road Station; he became very agitated and said "I am done for; this is through innocently giving a reference "—I searched his lodging and his office, and found a large quantity of documents; some of them were references and other papers, land seventeen pawn tickets for clothing, jewellery, and other things, pawned from 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. up to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took away a letter-book—I found a pocketbook on Trevelli, in which was this:"IOU 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

Welham "—I arrested Kendrick on 20th November, at Leicester, in the street, told him the charge, and asked him where he lodged—he said "I shall decline to tell you, I don't wish to bring any one eke into trouble"—he asked why he was arrested—I said that all his statements were falsehoods—he said "What won't a man do when he is in trouble? if I had not been ill so long and nobody to do my work I would not have done it; I know I ought not to have said that I bought goods from Trevelli, because I never have, except two rings. He is a bad fellow; he wrote me a letter threatening me. I bought two rings from him about a month since; I was to have paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, but I have not</p>

I cannot tell you the name of any person from whom I bought goods and paid for them; I tore up all my books when I left 10, Walnut Street, a week last Saturday, and do not know what I did with the pieces"—I showed him this letter addressed "Mr. D. Goily, 45, Ashmore Road"—he said "I wrote that letter; Trevelli told me to write to him at that address in that name. I sent that letter in answer to the threatening letter he sent me. I know Trevelli tried to do me out of these goods because he sent a German-clerk with me to Mr. Walker's to fetch the goods, and brought them to his office; they were taken away at once; I did not know where they were till you told me they were at Mr. Zippart's. It is all a lie his telling Mr. Ensall that I had bought goods of him and paid cash; he had some bills from me and I was sued on them; I tried to get them back but could not"—I found on him a crossed cheque on the Standard Bank of London for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., drawn by Hamilton Gordon and Co. in favour of J. H. Kendrick or order—that is the cheque he alluded to in his statement—he said that he presented it at the bank and there were no effects—I then went to 10, Walnut Street, a small cottage of five or six rooms, but found no signs of business there—I then went to 35, Braunston Gate, to make inquiries—I called at No. 33, which is a large private house, and no person named Kendrick was known there—I found also in Trevelli's pocketbook this contract note. (<hi rend="italic">For</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">advanced by Zippart on gold and silver watches, and a bill of exchange for</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">with power of tale if not redeemed by 2nd January,</hi> 1882.)

Adams, of 68, Lower Thames Street—I made inquiries of them as to Trevelli's respectability—I think I recognise Schneider, but his face is so much altered—I do not see Adams here—I told Schneider that I was referred to him by Mr. Trevelli, and I asked him how long he had known him; he said five years and upwards, that he had done business with him, that he was a highly respectable person, and he would make me a very desirable tenant—I let Trevelli the premises—he occupied them up to the time he was taken into custody—he was to pay 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he only paid one quarter—he entered into possession on 24th June, 1881.</p>

I think for printing the memorandums and the cards, about 2,000 or so—Wright took away a good many of them when he left; a good many were sent out asking for samples and for orders—I think Irish got about half of his money; he came over a dozen times for it; Wright paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, and I think I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

Adams" was written up there, but he had no office there for some considerable time there was a notice "Bills for acceptance, letters to be left within for Grey, Hiller, and Co. "—I said "Who is Mr. Grey?" he said "Oh, there is no Grey, it is simply to give the name of Hiller a better appear<lb/>ance "—I took him to the station and searched him, and found on him these two documents; one is a notice that a bill on G. Hiller, drawn by——, lies at the London and County Bank, Lombard Street; also an India-rubber stamp with "Grey, Hiller" on the back in ink, a pad, several bills and memorandums, and a pocket-book, with nothing in it of importance; there was the address of "A. Jacob, 4, Sidmouth Street, Gray's Inn Road "—I asked him for his own address, and he gave 6, Hay don Square, Minories—I went there and made inquiries—I found it was a public-house—on 24th January I saw Jacobi in custody at the detective office, Old Jewry—I said "Mr. Jansen;" he said "That is not my name, my name is Jacobi"—I said "You will be charged on a warrant with being concerned with John Schneider, already in custody, for obtaining goods from various persons "—he said "What persons?" I said "Among others Mr. Parnell, of Bristol, a lot of office furniture "—he said "What do I want office furniture for?" I said "If you did not want office fur<lb/>niture why did you get Mr. Rogers, the carpenter, to fit up your office for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is a great loss to him?" he said "It was Schneider who would make me have the office fitted up.

Information was supplied to me by Jacobi, or his solicitor, as to where the goods were, and on Monday, 1st May, I went with Sergeant Mitchell to 27, Hackney Road—Mr. Gower refused to show me his books as having received the goods—the information was supplied to me three weeks prior—I had expressed my willingness to Mr. Boardman, the solicitor, to accept the goods back—at that time the credit had not expired.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE HAWKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">In a case like the present, when eleven defendants are charged in one indictment, containing ninety-four counts, with various distinct misdemeanours, alleged to have been committed on different days some by several of the defendants jointly, and others by most of the defendants separately—I do not think that the calling of witnesses by one defendant entitles the Counsel for the Prosecution to a general reply upon the whole case as against all the accused. Where, in an indictment against several prisoners, one of them calls evidence which is applicable to the cases of all, I think there is a general rigid of reply, which the Counsel for the Crown must exercise according to his discretion. But where the evidence called by one prisoner does not affect the cases of the others, as, for instance, when one prisoner calls witnesses to prove an alibi for himself only, and the evidence of those witnesses does not affect the case as against the others, the reply ought to be confined to the case of that one prisoner; so, when, as in the present case, one prisoner is separately charged in the same indictment with an offence altogether distinct and unconnected with the offences charged against another, or others of the prisoners, the calling of witnesses by that one prisoner to rebut the charge made against him does not entitle the Counsel for the Prosecution to a general reply upon the whole case as against all the accused. If, however, from the witnesses called for one prisoner evidence is elicited in favour of others indicted with him, then I think the right to reply should be extended to the cases of such other prisoners, so far as such evidence affects their cases.</hi>

On 4th April I went with Mr. Fardell to the City of London Coffee-house, kept by Mr. Alldis—there are stables in the yard, and Robey and Tilley stabled their horses there—Mr. Alldis procured the key, opened the loft door over the stable, and moved four trusses of straw, behind which were these two tarpaulins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) marked "G. E. R. 7,474" and "G. E. R 7,079," with a red stripe—I went to the Old Gaol gate, saw Barchell, and asked him if Robey and Tilley were on the premises; he said "No "—I said "I have been to Mr. Alldis and found two tarpaulins there which have been identified by Mr. Fardell as his property stolen in December; do you know anything about them?" he said "No"—I asked him who the large chain in the hall belonged to; he said "To me, I bought it of a carman, and gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it "—I asked him whose carman; he said "Fardell's, that was all it was worth to me "—I said that I should take him in custody for having it in his possession—Tilley came from some part of the premises, and I said that Mr. Alldis said that the two tarpaulins were placed there by him and Robey—he said "Yes, we bought them of a carman, and put them there "—I asked who paid for them; he said "I am not certain whether it was me or Robey, we had not the money with us, and went to a coffee-shop and got it"—I asked him whose carman he bought it of; he said "Eardell's; that is Mr. Fardell, is it not f' I said "Yes"—he said "The carman asked us whether we could do with the tarpaulins; we said 'Yes,' and he said we were to give him something more when he came again; was not that so, Fred f—Burchell said "I know nothing about the cloths, I bought the chain"—I afterwards took Buttons in Gower Street, Commercial Road, he was with a van, and told him the charge; he said "I did not steal it, the other man stole it and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a portion of the money. I took a steam wheel to Fenn's at Greenwich, the chain was on the wheel, and I kept it on the trolley"—when I got back to the station Robey was there; I believe he went there to see Tilley—I told him he would be charged with Tilley in receiving the tarpaulins knowing them to be stolen; he made no answer.</p>

I am the wife of Edward Howard, a solicitor, of 71, Oakley Street, Lambeth—the prisoner is my brother—about the end of March or the beginning of April he came to stay with me for three weeks, and I kept him—I had not seen him for two years, and then not for 14 years before that—on Tuesday night, 18th April, we had some words, and I told him I would not let him stay any longer, and he ought to get some work—he slept out that night, he came in next morning about half-past 8 o'clock—he said "I don't know whether I am welcome or</p>

               <p>not "—I told him I did not want him to stay any longer—I also told him he might light a fire and make some tea—he did so, and remained till the evening—some friends came in, and we all had something to drink together—my friends then went away, and I went out—when I came back, about 11 or 12 o'clock, I found the prisoner in my bedroom—he began to use abusive language to me, and I requested him to go away—he said something to me and I took up the tongs and said. "If you hit me again I will knock your brains out "—I did not strike him—he had not hit me then—he had assaulted me on the Saturday evening previous—when I said this he took up this shovel and hit me across the head and stunned me—I fell on the bed and the blood ran down my face—while I was on the bed 1 found a knife at my throat; I did not see it; I struggled for my life; the prisoner was on the top of me—he said "You b——, I will be hung for you"—I got away from him and ran down into the yard and bathed my head—the police came and took the prisoner to the station—a doctor was sent for, and he dressed my head—I am still under his hands—I have been suffering a good deal since—I have not seen the prisoner do any work since he worked at Ware as a blacksmith, that is about 20 years ago—each time he has come to me I have not known him do anything—I don't know how he has got his living—I know no more of his career.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 137, Westminster Bridge Road—I saw the prosecutrix at the station about 5 o'clock—she had lacerated and contused wounds on the scalp, and an incised wound across the throat, such as would be produced by a knife like this—she was bleeding profusely, and fainted—the wounds in the head were not in themselves dangerous, but they might have been, as erysipelas might have set in—one wound was quite an inch or an inch and a half long, and went down to the bone—her life has not been in danger—I noticed that her breath smelt of drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLOTTE CHAMBERS</hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Chambers, a bricklayer's labourer at Norbiton—on Thursday afternoon, 23rd February, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I was in the Sir Robert Peel public-house—the prisoner and deceased were there; they were playing cards; they played a game or two, and each lost a game—they then went on to play double or quits who was to pay for it; apparently Taylor lost—there were a few words over the payment, and after that they said they would go outside and settle it—they did go outside—I followed out directly after; they fenced up to each other in a fighting attitude—Taylor had his coat off; but whether the other had pulled his coat off or not I will not say—I never saw a blow struck—Heriot clasped his hands to the lower part of him and said "I am done; I am stabbed"—he was soon afterwards removed in a barrow to the infirmary—I saw nothing else, only a few words between my son and the prisoner; but that had nothing to do with their quarrel at all.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw the knee bent, and it was immediately after that that the man clasped his hands as I have stated—I did not see any kick but I saw the foot rise, and that instant he clasped his hands and said "I am done "—I could not say whether the knee was close to the deceased's body; they were close together—I have never said that I saw the prisoner kick with his knee; I did not say so before the Magistrate; it was the knee—it was not a kick, he gave him a <hi rend="italic">bunt</hi> with the knee; that is what they called a kick—1 saw the knee rise; I did not see it go—they were not wrestling with each other; they did not have their arms on each other.</p>

Taylor lost four games, and paid for three pots of beer, leaving one pot to be paid for. After that I had a quarrel with Taylor, and he challenged me to fight him. We went out into the road, and squared up. I did not strike him, but I felt a blow at the bottom of my stomach, which was done by the prisoner butting me with his knee. After the blow I have no recollection of what occurred."</p>

He jumped out of the tap-room and pulled off his jacket and said he was as good as me; I said 'I dare say other people are as good as you in that game, 'meaning fighting. 'I said, 'Don't create a disturbance in the man's house, come outside,' and when we got outside I said, 'Do you mean to fight?' he said, 'Yes, let us have an up and down;' I said, 'Well, I shall not show myself a coward,' and we both stood up in a fighting attitude; he struck at me, and I jumped on one side, and he ran into me and tried to catch hold of my leg; with that I shook out my left hand and hit him somewhere; he turned round and said to one of his mates, <hi rend="italic">'Alf</hi> my guts are coming down again;' he said 'Well, you are a better man than me and I will treat you and fight you another time,' and we went in; he stood twopenny worth of whiskey and had twopenny worth himself.

I was told if I subpoenaed them I should have to pay their expenses. This woman was in the Sir Robert Peel during the day. Once she fell down and bruised her forehead, after that she sat down to cards and played £2 stakes. If any one knows it, it is her own sons. She won the game. One son was showing her how to play, and the other was looking into the other person's hand. The man turned round to me and said "I will treat you another time if I have done a cowardly action. "We went outside. I was in my own defence, and I shook out and hit him, where I don't know. After that we went in and had a drop of whiskey together. He afterwards went out, and he fought with her two sons and her with them. When I saw a chance of getting out of it I did so. I have no doubt the woman went to the infirmary and told the man what to say, as he was a great favorite of hers. The day his deposition was taken he was unconscious. He was asked if the knee did it, and he said yes. What I did was the result of the one blow, and only one, that I hit him. I am very sorry for what has occurred.</p>

I am the wife of Robert Overall, of 1, Cyril Street, Walworth; the prisoner is my daughter and has been living at home with me—on the afternoon of 17th April she was very violent, and I went into my lodgers room because I did not want to stay with her—I don't remember what she said—whilst I was in the lodger's room she set fire to the mattress and bed in the front room downstairs, my room; I did not see her do it, but I smelt fire and went down and found the bed in a burning state—a person came in from the other side of the road and told me of it—I called for assistance and put the fire out, and I sent for a policeman and gave my daughter into custody—my lodger, three little children, myself, and the prisoner were in the house at the time—the bed stood against the partition, which was lath and plaster; it was an iron bedstead about 2 feet from the floor—part of the bed was burning when I saw it, it was flaming up; a dress and a sheet were put upon it and paraffin oil poured on it; nothing but that was burnt, the bed was stripped at the time, there were no clothes on it; the dress was put on it—there was a smell of paraffin—the fire was put out with the assistance of neighbour and the mattress was taken into the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist, of 3, Mortlake Terrace, Kew; my household consists of myself and a lady named Newton; we are the only persons who sleep on the premises; Mrs. Newton has a boy but not on the premises—I missed money from my till in the counter about four times in March; I determined to watch, and on 24th March I came down shortly after 11 p.m., placed myself in the parlour at the back of the shop which fronts the street, and shortly before 1 o'clock I saw a light thrown on the back window, and heard footsteps in the back garden—they passed down the steps to the basement; I then heard the handle turn and the scullery door open; I next heard footsteps across the kitchen; heard the door open from the scullery under the trap, and then heard steps softly ascending the ladder; heard the trap-door pushed up quietly, rested back, and a figure crept up carrying a bull's-eye light; it passed softly round the back of the counter towards the window where there is no outlet—my till is in the middle of that counter—I heard the lock of the till turned and heard the rattle of money in the till pool as the clock struck I—he returned along the counter, and as he passed me again I saw he was a policeman, and therefore judged it wiser to let him depart, as I was alone—he went down the trap-door and left in the same way; on 27th March I determined with my friends Mr. Bower, Mr. Horton, and Mr. Thompson to watch—we all four placed ourselves in the parlour behind the shop about a quarter to 12 o'clock, and shortly before I on the Tuesday morning I heard steps at my garden gate; they softly crossed the garden path, passing the ground floor door, and again went down to the place on the stairs, and I heard the scullery door unfastened by the turning of the handle; I had left it shut; I next heard the door from the scullery into the kitchen open, and heard footsteps quietly cross the kitchen, pass the kitchen stairs, and heard the handle of the door leading into the shop cellar unfastened; there was then a pause for about a minute, during which we kept complete silence; I then heard footsteps ascending. the ladder; the trap-door was opened up, and rested back, and a figure emerged carrying a light; it crept stealthily round the back of my counter to the till; I heard the key turned in the lock; that is the only key on that side of the shop—I then heard the door pulled open as the clock struck 1, and heard the rattle of money in the till pool; the light remained stationary—I saw a figure stooping over the till, and whispered to the witnesses to look and see also; 1 then stepped out, saying, "What are you doing there?"the figure started up; I heard the till shake and the light was turned off—Mr. Horton immediately turned on a bicyclist's bull's-eye which he had, and we discovered the prisoner standing upright; he said, "All right, Sir, only a policeman; found your doors all open: came to see all was right"—I am sure that all the doors were shut before we took our positions; I had tried the handle of the cellar door not long before going into the parlour—Mr. Horton presented an unloaded pistol at the prisoner and said, "Move a step and you are a dead man"—we then lit the gas, and I went to the counter and blocked the way—I had placed 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in</p>

               <p>silver in the till, and marked some of it and locked the till, leaving no money on the counter, but after the prisoner was discovered I found a florin on the counter—I sent Mrs. Newton for a constable and the prisoner was given in custody—he said, "I kicked at the steps, and could not make anybody hear;" I said, "We were all listening and you made no alarm whatever "—I went back to the shop and got the florin, which was lying on the counter; this is it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My house is one of a terrace; there are stables at the back—there is no thoroughfare through the mews; there is a gate from the mews into my garden; there is a lock on it, but it is useless—it would fly open if any one pushed against it—any entrance from the back is through that gate—I did not miss money after the 21st, but I missed a bottle of perfume, and I am not positive that 1 did not miss a bottle of essence of wood-violets—there were workmen on my premises at the time, but not when I missed those goods; they were there while I was missing the money, sometimes one, and sometimes half-a-dozen—there is a bolt and a lock to the basement door—I had not watched during the night before the 21st, but I had about 6 in the morning—the basement door was fastened by a bolt, but on the 20th it was only closed—it would not fly open with a push without turning the handle—I left it unlocked purposely on the 21st; I cannot say whether it was bolted on the 19th—I do not know the superintendent or inspector at Richmond; I do not think they use my shop—I did not report this at the station—some of the money was marked with acid, and I was the last person in the shop after it was marked—I did not count the money in the till every night, but on finding it wrong I took account afterwards; I had been counting it about a week—I did not tell the officer who took the charge that a florin had been found on the counter; I did not mention it till I got to the station—I sent Mr. Bower back to count the money before we got to the station; I did not count it before I gave the prisoner in custody.</p>

I said "Yes" he said "So do I; I have moved down there now; are you going home?" I said "l am making my way towards home "—we went on together, and when we came to Lock Square, which is rather a dark place, I missed my dog, turned to look for him, and the prisoner snatched my pin from my</p>
