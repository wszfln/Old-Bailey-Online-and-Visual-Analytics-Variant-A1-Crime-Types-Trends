He went on shore and staid some time, and came again with a pot of beer in his hand and made me drink, and said, he would meet me at Battle-bridge; and as I was coming up I called at another ship that lay at St. George's stairs, where some persons took me, and asked me what I had got; I told them I did not know, I had not touched it, but I thought it was sand; they let me go. Then two more came and stopped me and they let me go. Then these two men stopped me and sent for Mr. Scrivener, and he bid them let me go. But they said they should have 5 l. each for stopping me.</p>

               <p>William Jackson. On the 24th of Dec. the prisoner brought a hat to me to pawn for six shillings. He came about an hour and half after that to my man to fetch it out, when my man put it on the counter. The prisoner had somebody without the shop door who push'd it open, and the prisoner took the hat up and run away with it, without paying for it. My man run after him, and took him with the hat upon him, and brought him back, and he confessed several such like things he had done that very night.</p>

I desired he'd take what I had and I would go and fetch the rest. I went out and he followed me and took the hat from me. I was a little in liquor.</p>

I ran about 50 yards after him, when he stumbled and fell down. I was just behind him as he got up. I took hold of his arm, and the young man came up. Said I, what has he done to you? Said he, he has robbed me of my hat. The prisoner said he was almost starv'd. I saw a hat flung down, but I cannot swear to it. The hat was produced.</p>

            . As I was going up Holbourn on Christmas Eve, this young man cry'd out stop thief! stop thief! I saw the prisoner running as hard as he could. I ran after him; whether the hat came from his hand or under his arm I cannot say. I saw it drop from him. I ran by it about 20 yards. We took the prisoner. Then the young man came up, and said, this man has stole my hat. We took the prisoner to the high-constable, there he owned the taking it.</p>

               <p>As I was coming along Holbourn, I saw a man walking behind the young man, I was about 12 yards behind him. I saw that man take his hat off his head. I ran after him to take him, and ran a considerable time. I by chance fell down, and the man got away; and these gentlemen came and took hold of me and thought I was the man, so they swore against me. What they say of my owning it is false.</p>

He swore he'd blow my brains out; they down'd with me directly and used me very ill. There was another man, he had trowsers on. They beat me about my head and face: they picked my pockets when I was senseless under their hands. I lost about 13 or 14 s. in silver, and about 4 d. in halfpence, a pair of spectacles in a case and a steel tobacco box. This I believe was about a quarter after eleven o'clock.

               <p>Woodman. Yes I did, but upon seeing the prisoner before justice Fielding, I then recollected, and told him he was the man that laid hold of my jaw.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take hold of the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Ecklin. I cannot say he did, because it was a very dark night. When we do such things we are in a great flutter, thinking how to make our escape, when we have got the goods. We left them and went to the Seven Dials and stop'd a chair, but the watchmen surrounded us, and we escaped as well as we could. The next day we met again at the India Arms about twelve o'clock, and divided the money, which was about 3 s. 6 d. a piece. I saw the prisoner have 2 s. of it. We had some silver lace, which was wrapped up in a piece of blue paper, which they said was taken out of one of the pockets.</p>
               <p>On his Cross Examination he said, He was taken up about 12 o'clock, and the next day he made this discovery amongst other robberies. That he had had no conversation with the prosecutor, concerning this robbery since; only being before the justice, when he and the prisoner were there. That he gave the same testimony on the other trial. [See No. 508. in John Blachford's, Esq; mayoralty.] That he did not see it, but was told afterwards, the prosecutor was struck with a pistol. That the prosecutor and his wife were arm in arm, when first they attacked them; and then the woman went to run, and he overtook her. That there were five of them in company.</p>

               <p>George Nelson. Here is a Bill of Exchange that was brought inclosed, in a letter by one Wallice a porter, it came on the 1st of November in the evening, about 6 or 7 o'clock. I opened the letter, it was signed Sydne Stafford Smythe; the porter said, it came from one of the barons of the Exchequer, who lives in Cary-street. The contents to this purport.</p>
               <p>Please to pay the bearer the contents within, &amp;c. Cary-street, Sydnea Stafford Smythe. On the back of it was a Receipt wrote ready to sign.</p>
               <p>Received the contents, for the use of Sydnea Stafford Smythe, Esq; by me a blank left for the porter to write his name.</p>
               <p>I told the porter I had no advice of this Bill, and that it was a larger bill than what Mr. Legrass used to draw without advice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you to be like Mr. Legrass's writing, or had you any doubt about it?</p>
               <p>Nelson. I then thought it was, but he happened to have a clerk in town, and I told the porter I chose to shew it to him before I paid it; so I told him to come the next day, being Friday, about 2 o'clock, and I'd endeavour to see the Clerk before that time; he came accordingly, but I had not seen the clerk, so I told him he must come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175101160007"/> again, which I ordered on Saturday any time between two and four; he came about six or seven; I staid at home till five, then went out of town, and had left word, if the porter came to appoint him to come again at 3 o'clock on the Tuesday following. He came at that time, and when he came I laid hold on him, and told him the bill he had in his hand was forged; he said he could not tell any thing about that, he was only sent with it. I told him he must produce the man he had it of, he said he could easily do that, saying, the man was at my gate at the same time. I said that did not appear well to me; nor to me neither said the porter, but he said to me he ow'd some of your men money, which was the reason he did not care to come himself; but said the porter, if you desire me, I'll fetch him in directly. I did not think that proper, because the porter was a stranger to me. So he described him to a servant of mine,

            , who went out and fetch'd him in: when they were both in my compting house, I asked the porter, whether that was the person that gave him the bill? The porter replied, yes, he sent me 4 times with it; then I asked the prisoner, if that was true? He said yes, and what then? I told him the bill was forged, and I believed he was concerned in it: and I sent for a constable; then he fell down on his knees, and begged very hard I would let him go. I told him for my own part I freely forgave the offence against me, but it was what I could not answer to the community.</p>
               <p>This is the identical bill, and had never been out of his custody.</p>

I told him it was no matter where, he must go, and if I had wronged him I'd ask his pardon. I took him to my master's house; as soon as the porter saw him, said he to me, you are right, that is the man; then my master sent me for a constable ; I know no more.</p>

               <p>Oroath. No, I did not, the prisoner's uncle was my attorney. I had no intimacy with him, in my life time.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in his office on the 1st of Nov.?</p>
               <p>Oroath. I cannot be positive. I lodge just by Chancery-Lane, and as his uncle was my attorney, I used to be there sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever desire the footman to go out of the room, when you was with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Oroath. No, I never did at any time.</p>

            , Sheer Lane.) She said it was given her by a young man in the Temple; we did not think proper to lend any money upon it; I seeing the name on the bottom, bid her carry it to the right owner; I went to see for Mr. Cole, and found he was moved. On Monday morning she came to our shop, and I asked what she had done with it? she said, it was carried to the proper owner; then I saw the advertisement after she was gone, and it was found on the prisoner, concealed under her petticoat and gown, tied by a string, hanging on her right side; when we went to search her, she said it was in the chamber.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cole. I live at the Mitre tavern, Fleetstreet ; not finding my tankard at Mr. Scott's chambers where I sent it, I inquir'd for the laundress, when she came, she said she had given it to my servant, after that upon examination she said, she gave it to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175101160009"/> tavern boy; said I, which of them I said she, a lad in a white cap; I said you are just out, I have never a boy dress'd so. I advertised the tankard; on Monday morning the pawnbroker that is here, came to my house; I sent for the prisoner, and as his back was towards her, I ask'd her if she knew any thing of the tankard? she said she did not; said he, how can you say so, when you offered to pawn it with me on Saturday night? then she turn'd up her gown, and there the tankard hang'd, tied by a string.</p>

               <p>On Saturday night, when I was at my master's chamber, there was toast and bear in the tankard; I took it home, as I had done often, for my supper; then I had occasion to go by the pawnbroker's shop; being very well known, out of a joking way I said, will you take this tankard in pawn? he said no, I'd have you carry it home again; so I will, said I; I went there again, and met Mr. Cole and Mr. Scott's servant in Mitre Court; they ask'd me if I knew any thing of the tankard, I did not say any thing, but delivered it them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cole. On Saturday night, she said she would swear it to one of my boys, and on Monday, she denied knowing of it, till she saw the pawnbroker.</p>

On monday morning, as I was going out about 7 o'clock, I missed my hat, going into the hall, there I found the shoes, which the overseers and churchwardens had sent in, and the child's clothes were gone. We had five dozen of shoes, but I had disposed of some of them, so I can't be exact as to the number, but I believe there were forty pair left, which were taken away; I let the overseers know of it, and we did what we could to find them. One Ross, who was cast last sessions, gave us a slender account of them, but would not tell the person's names, &amp;c. The next was Clements the prisoner, I went to him in Clerkenwell Bridewell, with the two overseers; there he confessed every thing voluntarily, and his confession agreed with this account by the evidence. Westley own'd to the fact, that he was on the outside, and took the things, &amp;c. And before the Justice, they were all for being admitted evidences. There was neither threats or promises made them, to induce them to confess.</p>

            . Bisben and Clements were taken up on suspicion, about a week or eight days before this confession; Bisben was committed to Tothill-fields Bridewell, and Westley was taken in the mean time; then the confession came out by Clements. We sent for the prosecutor with a view to have him admitted an evidence; they all confessed, expecting each to be an evidence against the others; one said he could tell more than the other, the other could tell more than he; so it came all out.</p>

On the Sunday morning before this robery was done, Bisben and Clements asked me to go and drink a pot of beer, I went with them; we went home to Bisben's house, I was drunk; about 12 o'clock they wanted me to go out, I was so sick I could not; the next morning I saw the shoes lying, I did not ask where they had them, nor they never told one. They fetch'd a man who look'd like a gentleman, he took them away in a bag; I was with them at the Adam and Eve, in Jewin-street, he paid them some money; they treated me all the next day, and would have had me went to the play with them.</p>

               <p>Edward Carter. On Sunday morning the 6th of this instant, I was informed my house had been broke open; I missed the things mentioned. On, Tuesday morning I went amongst the brokers. I saw my stove standing at a door in Peter-street. I enquir'd how they came by it, I was told they bought it. I told them it was mine, and desired if the persons that brought it should come again, to stop them. I went to another place, and was sent for back; they had stop'd the two persons who came again, they were two women; we have them here to give evidence. I examined them how they came by them; they said their husbands gave them to them to sell, I had found a watering pot of mine at the other place, and ordered the people there to stop the person that brought it, if they came again; than I had word brought me, the person was stopt who brought that. I found all the goods, at different places.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Gyles's parish; the prosecutor brought Sherlock to my house, and gave me charge of him; he said he suspected he had stolen a canister of tea; the boy said he knew nothing of it: as we were going to the round-house, said he to me, I can tell you where it is: he took us to a house, and ordered us to stand back till he got into the house, and he would help us to it. It being a bad house I would not part from him, so I went in with him; there was Fordham sitting by the fire; Sherlock ordered Fordham to deliver it to me: then Fordham took it out from under a chest of drawers; when Fordham delivered it, he begged to be forgiven.</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I told them Fordham had it, and carried them to the place where he was. I leave myself to your lordship's mercy.</p>
               <p>Fordham. I have nothing to say for myself.</p>

On the 9th of January I had a little business out in the evening, I went out between six and seven o'clock: when I returned I found the prisoner at the bar sitting in a box with another man, drinking a pot ; they continued so for about three quarters of an hour; they went out; as soon as he parted with the other he returned again and joined company with some other gentlemen; he stayed in the house an hour longer ; and I heard him say, all his money was gone but four pence, and said he would not carry that out of the house; so he had two glasses of usquebaugh for it; then he went out of the house, and betwixt nine and one he returned again, and asked my wife if she would trust him a pint of beer; she told him she did not chuse it; then he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out something, I did not see it, but he said here is money enough; then he went out of the house again, and in about half an hour returned again, and called for a pint of wine. I told him we did not sell wine ; then he said he would spend a shilling, and threw it at my wife: I then said if you will have it, have it in punch. There was no sugar below stairs; I went up stairs for some and found the door open. I came down to my wife, and asked her what time she was in the room, she said not since four o'clock; then she run up and came down again, and said, I am robbed, but spoke softly to me. I went up with her to see; then she said, I'll lay my life that fellow has robb'd me, for I saw some pieces of money in his hand; we came down immediately, and he was gone away and left his punch behind him: I saw no more of him that night. I went into a house in Piccadilly that very night, and the gentlewoman that keeps the alehouse, told me he had been there changing two pieces of gold.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Collingwood. The prisoner was in my house all that evening; he and another person came in and called for a pot of beer, then they went out again; the prisoner said he would not bid me a good night, he would come back again.</p>
               <p>She went on and confirmed the testimony of her husband with this addition: That when he came again the last time but one, he pulled out of his pocket and shewed to her a 36 shilling piece and a 27 s. piece; then he went out again and soon came in, and she saw in his hand much silver and half a guinea amongst it.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I went out on Christmas Eve, about half an hour after 9, and before 10 my house was broke open: I was gone to a neighbour's house, the news was brought to me. I went home, and met the prisoner coming out of my gate. I took hold on her, she wanted to get away. She had got the goods under her arm, and she let them fall to the ground. [The goods were produced in court.] The lock of my door and my window were broke open. The casement was fast when I went out; I lock'd the door, and had the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Eliz. North. I live near to Mrs. Frances; I saw a light in her house. I went and ask'd at the door if my son was there? I was answered, it is not Mrs. Frances, it is I. Said I, who are you? Said she, I am just come from her. I knowing where Mrs. Frances was, I went to her, and ask'd her, if she had sent any body to her house? she said no. She was but about 20 yards off. I told her there was a light in her bed-chamber, so she came, and we met the prisoner with the goods mentioned, and my son and we stop'd her.</p>

            . I am lighterman to Mr. Staples and company; every lighter that is loaded, I send a note with it; and when this lighter was unloaded, there were four sacks missing. I then took up Bennet, and had him before justice Hammond; there he acknowledged, that he and Cox stole the corn, and that Cox told him he could sell it to Pursley, for he used to deal with him. I had a warrant to take up Pursley; I went to the house, and told him I had a great suspicion he had received four sacks of wheat which were stole, and that he must go before a magistrate. He said I was welcome to look all over his house; for as to Mr. Cox, he knew nothing of him: after that he said, he knew Cox as a neighbour; at first he denied he had any dealings with him, then he was ask'd, whether he thought Cox could come honestly by four sacks of wheat. He said no, he did not believe he could; then we carried him in order to go before Esq; Hammond; he was not at home; so justice Browning committed him for farther examination, and in the evening we carried him to justice Hammond, where at first he stead-fastly denied it; said Esq; Hammond, what will you say if I bring the man to your face, and he says you bought it? [ Cox was brought out of a room to him. ] Said the justice to Cox, do you know any thing of four sacks of wheat that you stole out of Mr. Rouse's lighter? yes, said he, I stole them, and sold them to Mr. Pursley. Mr. Pursley was in a rage, and said, I wonder you should serve me so: said Cox, you need not deny it; Cox said, he had received 35 s. and 5 s. in bread of Pursley; at last Pursley was very sorry, he said, for what he had done, and made a few excuses; Pursley then said, he paid him 40 s. for them, but he never saw the wheat. I have known Cox for 15 years; he was servant to a miller, and used to work his boat up and down the river; but for some time past he has been a boom-boat man, selling gin upon the river.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think them 16 bushels of wheat were worth at that time?</p>
               <p>Rouse. These four sacks of wheat cost my masters 50 s. and they bought a great quantity together at Bear-key, it cost 24 s. and 6 d. per quarter, and lighteridge and other charges, makes it amount to that money. I heard Pursley say, he paid Cox for them four sacks of wheat.</p>

            . The price at Bear-key, at this time the wheat was stole, was 24 s. and 6 d. per quarter, and according to my own opinion, I think Mr. Pursley must know the wheat was then worth more money than he gave for it.

            . On the beginning of last September I was in company with Mr. Best going a journey. On the road (it was on this side Turnham Green ) we overtook the prisoner; as soon as I saw his face I knew him to be the person convicted at Rochester, and who was transported for that offence. He hovered round the chaise, sometimes before and sometimes behind it in a very extraordinary manner; he attended the chaise to Hounslow, and about the middle of the town we got out of the chaise, and demanded the prisoner to surrender himself, which he did with out making any resistance at all, and declared he had no intention at that time to do any person an injury: he was taken before a justice of the peace and committed to the county goal, for returning from transportation.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner and you meet together ?</p>
               <p>Fuller. It was about five or six miles from Hounslow, I think it was a little on this side Turnham Green.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he offer to molest you in any shape whatsoever?</p>
               <p>Fuller. No, Sir, he did not, he made no attack nor any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any resistance, when you demanded him to surrender?</p>
               <p>Fuller. No, none at all, but in a supplicating manner, desired we would not take any notice to any person we saw him in England.</p>

               <p>Fuller. He said his intention in coming over was to get assistance from his friends, after which he'd return and abide there for ever, pursuant to the sentence passed upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The offence I am charged with is a capital one, and I humbly implore your lordship would in regard to the family to which I belong, who never had a blot in their escutcheon, that your lordship would report me favourable. The remainder of my days shall be spent in making myself deserving of such mercy, and shall for ever pray for my generous benefactors. [Being told his majesty was a merciful prince, but to persons guilty of such an offence as his, mercy was very seldom extended.] He said, I should be glad to receive his majesty's mercy; and was sorry he had given occasion for his displeasure a second time.</p>

I forgot my own safety, and when I was got about a yard into the alley; I turned back to see if they stop'd these two gentlemen, intending if they had so done, to call the watch; the two fellows met me body to body, one of them threatened me saying, if I spoke a word I was a dead man, he would blow my brains out if I moved an inch; I found my self in bad hands, so I turned back and set myself against the wall in the alley; the evidence placed himself on one side me, and the other person on the other, the evidence had a pistol and held it to my head, threatening as before mentioned. They took from me a gold watch, with a gold chain and seal to it, and I believe they took some silver, but I am not quite certain what I had in my pocket; the man on my right hand had his hand in my pocket about two minutes, he seem'd much concern'd and behav'd in so remarkable a manner, that the evidence took his pistol from my head, and levell'd it at his, and swore if he did not rifle me, he'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175101160020"/> blow his brains out; he left half a crown and a shilling in my pocket; the evidence put his hand in my other pocket, and his finger in my sob; but he was in some concern, for he left half a guinea there ; then they order'd me down the alley, and they ran down Mark-lane : by the behaviour of the other fellow, I did think he had some knowledge of me, from his reluctance to hurt me; for my part I do recollect his face very well, but I cannot tell where I have seen him, nor who he is. As to Applegarth, I saw nothing of him, I saw but two persons; Soss seems to be about the size of the other man, (that was present) but I will not swear to him; but he took great pains to hide his face from me, but the evidence did not. There was a lamp about a yard from my face, it shone in my face, I had not an opportunity of seeing them as they might me. I make no doubt of the evidence being one, by answering every question I ask'd him. Soss denied knowing any thing of the evidence, but afterwards confessed before the justice, he was in bed with him that same night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Spurling. I am brother to the Prosecutor, I know nothing of it, but what came out at justice Fielding's. I attended at the examination of the two prisoners. Mr. Fielding ask'd the prisosoner Soss, whether he had any acquaintance with Brown the evidence; he absolutely denied having any before he was imprisoned with him, and mentioned this particular word, (before he turned buck or stag) which was interpreted an evidence. Mr. Fielding said, he had got this cant word very readily; there happened to be a person in company, who said he remembered him formerly being an evidence. Afterwards Soss confessed, that he lay that very night the robbery was committed, in bed with the evidence, and parted with him the next day at 8 o'clock; and also there was a woman lay in the same bed with them, but he confessed nothing of the robbery.</p>

He ask'd me five shillings for it, and I left half a crown in his hands, and I brought it back again the next morning and delivered it to him, and told him it was good for nothing: he told me he would go and buy me shot and powder, because I was afraid to buy such things.</p>
               <p>Hen. Peal. I was in a public house when Applegarth was brought in; the evidence Brown sat in a box; he said, he was not afraid of what could be done to him, for he was never concerned in but one robbery, and then he had none of the money.</p>
               <p>Applegarth's defence, I know no more of the thing than the child unborn; the evidence thought me an unfortunate man, therefore he had me put into the information.</p>
               <p>Soss's defence. The gentleman have sworn falsely against me, and that only for the sake of the reward.</p>
               <p>Manassah's defence. I have nothing to say; but let him bring a person to prove I paid him the money for the watch.</p>

On the 5th of December last I was out all the morning. I came home about one o'clock, and was inform'd, a woman had been and ask'd for me, with a power of attorney, to receive

I was very certain, that whoever came with a power of his, it must not be a true one, and I told Mr. Cotes so, who had informed me of the woman's coming; this was on the Wednesday, and I was informed she would come again on the Monday; I did intend to take her up when she came. On the Thursday, the day following, about 11 o'clock, the prisoner at the bar came and brought me this power of attorney, which probably is the same, but I did not see the other. The power produced in court, as set forth in the indictment. Mr. Cotes being in the back-parlour, hearing me mention the Swan sloop, came out; and he and I obliged the prisoner to go into the compting-house, where we took the power of attorney out of his hand. We compared it with the receipt Mr. Picket had given me, and it did not at all resemble it; Mr. Cotes went into the back-parlour, and he brought a gentleman out, to whom, in the presence of the prisoner, he told the same I have told now. The prisoner fell down on his knees, and beg'd I would forgive him; and said, he was innocent of the thing, as to himself, and that a woman had made over this power of attorney to him, to receive it for her use ; I ask'd him, if he knew where the woman was? to which he gave me little or no answer, or what I could make nothing of, something evasive: I told him as he could not, or would not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175101160023"/> produce the woman, I was obliged to carry him before a justice of peace, and if he was innocent, he might clear himself. Mrs. Cotes came into the room to him, and he fell on his knees to her to intreat forgiveness for him. I was obliged to go into the city, so I left him to the care of Mr. Cotes, and never saw him since, till now.</p>

               <p>Mr. Cotes. On Wednesday the 5th of Dec. I was told there was a woman at the door, who wanted the prize-money of a sailor belonging to the Swan-sloop of war; I order'd the person to carry her into the compting-house, and I follow'd her, when she produced the letter of attorney which Mr. Fazakerly has mention'd; I looked at the prize-list, and saw the two letters (Pd.) right against the number of the distribution sum of

            , midshipman; and knowing Mr. Fazakerly a very exact man in his business, I declined paying the woman the money. I desired her to call again on the Monday following, when she would be sure to find Mr. Fazakerly at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that was the same power of attorney which is now produced?</p>
               <p>Cotes. I look'd at it several times; I do take it to be the same. Mr. Fazakerly came home about 12 at noon. I acquainted him with the circumstances which had happened; he said he imagined the letter of attorney was a forged one, for he had paid Mr. Picket the prize-money, and immediately shewed me the receipt for it. We then gave orders for the clerks in the compting-house to stop this woman if she should come again to demand the money, and on Thursday following, the prisoner came with the letter of attorney; as soon as I saw it, I immediately took the prisoner into the compting-house, and ask'd him how he came by it; he said, he had it of one Eliz. Symonds. I was called into the back-parlour about some business, and left him in the care of the clerks. I staid there some little time, when I came back again, the prisoner fell down on his knees, and beg'd I would let him go, for he said his life was in my hands: I told him the nature of his crime was of worse consequence to the community, and I thought it a duty incumbent on me to bring him to justice. I carried him before justice Ledger, where he said, he had this letter of attorney, and gave this direction to us.</p>
               <p>For Eliz. Symonds, at the Noah's-ark near Rochester-bridge in Stroud. He told me, she was to be heard of in Ratcliff-highway ; we sent a servant to inquire after her; and we had some account of such a woman; the woman where we inquired at first denied her, but afterwards said she lived in Suffolk: I endeavoured to have taken her if I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send to the Noah's-ark?</p>
               <p>Cotes. No, I did not, my lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please my lord, to ask him what this woman said to him, when she went for this money ?</p>
               <p>Cotes. She said she would come again, and that she came a good way off; but I don't remember she mentioned the country; and she also pressed me a good deal to pay the monoy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When Mr. Cotes brought me before the justice, he told him he was acquainted with this Mr. Picket, and now he observes he was not at the passing the receipt, neither does he know he passed it; I think that is something relating to this affair in my behalf; that he should say one thing before the justice, and another here.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Cotes. Did you say before the justice, you was acquainted with Mr. Picket?</p>
               <p>Cotes. I never said so, my lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner continues. On the Thursday after the Monday that this woman was at this house, in order to receive this money, she was at the Bell in Ratcliff highway; she said she was going out of town, and had a letter of attorney in order to receive 45 shillings, and could not stay to receive it, and said she should be glad if any body would receive it for her: there was one in the house, knowing I sometimes did do these things, told me of it; I went accordingly to the house, and called for a pint of beer, and sat down by the woman, and asked her what she had to say? She said, she had a letter of attorney for 45 shillings that belonged to the Swan sloop prize money, and that she could not receive it till next day; said I, if you will trust me with it, I will return it safe to you. I gave her a note for 2 l. 2 s. to deliver to the book-keeper at the Spread Eagle in Gracechurch street, to be remitted to her at the Noah's Ark at Stroud. I went on the Thursday to the gentleman, and told him; I had a letter of attorney indorsed to me by a woman; he said, let me look at it; I shewed it him, and said, if any thing is coming to the woman, she gave me this order to receive it for her: he desired me to go into the office along with him; he examined the books, and said, he judged this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175101160024"/> letter of attorney to be forged, and said to me, you shall go before the justice of peace. Where is the woman ? I told him she was at Noah's Ark in Stroud, where I had directions to send the money; he said he'd send me to prison till I did produce the woman. I begged for liberty, in order to find her ; he said no, but I must go before the justice: the justice examined me; and I told his worship the same I do here: and now I observe in Mr. Cotes's evidence, he says I said before the justice, that this woman was to be found in Ratcliff highway ; I said I had the paper from her there. The people of the house don't know her, they know me; and if your lordship pleases, I will call the woman who keeps a green stall; she will tell what passed between this last evidence and her in that house.</p>

I went and told the person who sat up with those men, it was gone, and he said he knew who must have it; he went to the master's house of those men. We got a constable and searched, and found the watch in the hay-loft, where the prisoner and the other three men were lying.

I was either in the kitchen, or with them all the time till about four in the morning, when they had done, at which time I had orders to give them some bread and cheese and small beer: The prisoner had been down in the vault, and he was so weak when he came out he could not stand; I gave him a dram of gin when he was washing himself; he fell down upon the stones with cold; he asked me, if I had any fire below? I told him, no: he then asked me, if he might make a little fire of hay or straw? I told him, no. I seeing him so very cold, let him go down into the kitchen, and I went with him. I had a fire there, but did not tell him so at first; I gave him some bread and cheese and small beer there; he pulled off his shoes and stood by the fire and warmed himself; the others had victuals and drink in another place. I once left the prisoner by himself there and went about ten yards; I was not absent above half a minute or a minute; then the prisoner came from the fire on his own accord, and in a few minutes after they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175101160025"/> all went away. I thought nothing about the watch; I sat down about an hour, and then I went and called the prosecutor up, and went to bed myself; he went down, and in a few minutes came up again, and asked me after his watch, saying, he could not find it; said I, I am positive who must have it if it is gone, for none but the prisoner had been in the kitchen. I knowing where one of them lived, I went and told him the case, and he and I went together to the prisoner in the hay-loft, where were two or three along with him; the people were up in the stable with their horses; the man went up and said something to them, and came and called me; then I went up; I told the prisoner there was a watch gone, and he must have it; he seemed to be very far from owning it; I gave orders to two or three of the men to see he did not go away till I got a warrant and a constable; we returned and searched the hay-loft, and

            . I was looking for my husband, and coming home along with Mr. Linter about 11 o'clock at night up Chick-lane, the prisoner came to us, and said to Mr. Linter, d - n you, what do you do with my wife? Mr. Linter made answer and said, you scoundrel what is the matter with you; the prisoner knocked him down directly, I saw nothing in his hand.</p>

I cried out stop thief, and murder! he turned round to me, and said, d - n you, I will not strike a woman. He ran away, then I saw Mr. Linter's face was all over bloody.</p>

I immediately ran after the prisoner, and overtook him; just before I overtook him he turned his head about, and said d - n your eyes, I'll d o for you; I laid hold on him and secured him: then the person behind came up, and told me, he had stop'd him twice in Smithfield, and once endeavoured to take his stick out of his hand. I took him to the watch-house, and when the constable searched him, he found a hat, wig, a cuff of a coat, and a pair of buckles upon him; the prisoner said he bought the buckles in the New-market, but we inquired at the place he said, and found it was not so. The things produced in court, excepting the buckles, the prosecutor deposed to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gillet. The prisoner was brought to the watch house, the 2d of this month, betwixt 11 and 12 at night; and charged with assaulting a man in Smithfield; he had a hat in his hand, and another on his head. I ordered him to be searched, we found this wig and cuff of a coat in his pocket, he was in a great many stories about the hat and wig. We had him before the alderman, and he was committed; we had the things advertized, and the prosecutor came and described the hat and wig, and cuff of the coat, before he saw them, the latter was compared with the coat and it agreed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>On the 2d of this month about 2 at noon I left work in order to go to dinner, from my master's shop in Goswell-street, into the New-market to the sign of the Cooper's-arms ; I staid there the best part of the afternoon. Meeting with two or three young fellows, they inveigled me to stay there till 8 o'clock; after that I took a walk and bought a pair of buckles, and about half an hour after 9 I went up Field-lane; I went home, my master was gone out, I desired my mistress to let me have three halfpence; I went to the New-market again, and had a pint of beer; about this time it was a 11 o'clock; as I was coming up Field-lane, I saw two men going to fight; there were three or four other men there; one of the men came to me, and desired I would hold his hat and wig, saying he'd fight the other. I took hold of them, a mob arose, and the two men went to fighting; and after that, I saw no more of the one or the other. I walk'd up and down the lane for three quarters of an hour. I went into a publick house, and had a pot of beer, having three half-pence, I did not know of before in my pocket. After that I had a halfpennyworth of cheshire cheese to some bread I had in my pocket. Coming up the lane again to see if any body had ask'd for the hat and wig, to let them have it. I can bring people to-morrow to prove me an innocent fellow; I have a very good trade and have no occasion to be tempted to such things.</p>

            , in Blue-anchor alley; one day we saw a ladder over in a man's yard, in that alley, we considered it would serve our turns to get into some window by, and about 12 at night we set out with an intent to get into Mrs. Boldridge's a pawnbroker, at a one pair of stairs window; we got the ladder, and carried it there, but could not get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who carried the ladder?</p>
               <p>Bisben. Clements did. At a room at the sign of the Shears, an alehouse very near where we lived, there was a light, in a one pair of stairs room; Clements said he had a mind to go in there, so we all consented to it.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Bisben. This was after one o'clock. We set the ladder against the wall, and Clements went up first, lifted up the sash, and went in; I went up after him and stood on the top of the ladder; Westley stood under the window, there was a bed in the room, and a woman asleep in it; Clements went on the other side of the bed, and brought 131 shirts, and gave them into my hands. I let them fall and Westley did not catch them, but they fell to the ground. There were two silk handkerchiefs hung on the back of a chair on my left hand; I took them, and we went down as fast as we could. I went away as fast as I could by Bunhill-row. They told me they took away the ladder, and put it where they had it; I met them in about 10 minutes time at the end of the court; they brought the shirts between them; we thought we should be found out if we staid there till morning, so we took the things away to Gravel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175101160027"/> lane, Hounsditch, to one Mrs. Roach who sold them for us, she brought us 15 s. for 12 of them;

            . I live at the sign of the Shears, in Blue-anchor alley. The 4th of August, about two in the morning, somebody got in at a sash-window, up one pair of stairs. I never saw the prisoners before they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Wolley. I cannot say how many shirts, ten if no more; a silver milk-pot, two silk handkerchiefs. The evidence sent for me to come to him in Bridewell, but I heard him say but little there; I was too late.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Wolley. No, my lord, Clements told me in Newgate, the milk-pot was sold to a Jew that was transported. My mother in law, and a child that had the small-pox, lay in that room that night.</p>

            . I was at my son's house about one o'clock in that very room. I set a lamp burning on the slap of the stove, on the account of the child having the small-pox. I was asleep, and when I awaked, I heard something; I looked up, and saw the sash up, and the prisoner Clements with one hand on one side the sash, and the other on the other side, with his face looking into the room, going as if he was upon a ladder. I saw his face very plain, I am very sure it was he: I said to him, you dog, what are you coming into bed to me? when I saw him go down from the window, I ran to the sash and pull'd it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that sash was not up when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Lawley. I am very certain it was not; it had not been up for seven days, because of the child being ill; then I ran into the maid's room and call'd her; and by that time my son was got up : we searched, and then missed the things mentioned. I can swear to ten shirts being lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Clements before this time?</p>
               <p>D. Lawley. I don't remember I ever did, my lord.</p>

               <p>D. Lawley. My bed had a half teaster, and it stood so, that as I lay, I saw the window; the feet of the bed was towards the window, I never draw my curtains.</p>

            . On this day 7'night I was at justice Fielding's, when the two prisoners were brought there, Clements beg'd to be admitted an evidence. We spoke to Mr. Fielding, and he said, he had admitted the other. Westley cried and begged the same, and said, Clements had got one of the shirts on his back, which were taken out of this house. So I went and took hold of it, and said, Clements, is this one of the shirts you took out of the house? He said, yes.</p>

               <p>George Pearson. In the night, between the 8th and 9th of last April, we went to bed, and had a large parcel of stockings lay in a one pair of stairs chamber near a window, I being at that time pretty full of goods, had not a conveniency to lay them elsewhere. In the morning when I got up the sash was open, and the greatest part of the stockings gone. We have shutters to the windows, but there were so many goods lay there, we could not conveniently get to shut them up, and my wife and I lay in the next room. We went to bed about 10 o'clock, and went through the room and all was safe then.</p>

She said no; I desired her to get up, she would not; said I if you will not go into the kitchen, go up into the one pair of stairs room and lie down on that bed; she did. I sent the girl up to her to see if she would have any breakfast, she said she could not eat any thing. After dinner I went up to her, and said, she must have something to eat or she would be worse; I made her some panado and carried it up: after that I sent the girl up, who gave her some more; and in the evening between 6 and 7 o'clock my husband and I went to a neighbour's house; when we came back, I sent the girl up to know if she would not come down; she sent word she would not come down that night; I went up, and when I came there I saw something I did not like. I thought to myself there must be a child born, I took up a corner of the bed, and under that was a child. I called her murdering slut, or something like it ; she made no answer, I drove her down stairs to her own bed, which was in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she made any provision for it?</p>

            . I am a midwife. About half an hour after 10 that evening I was called out of my bed to this house; there sat the prisoner in a chair by the fire; I went to look at the child; there were all things together that should come into the world. It is my opinion the child was stagnated in the birth for want of help. When I came to clean it, there were no marks of violence upon it; the child was at its full growth, nails and every thing.</p>

            . I am an apothecary. The child was carried to Shoreditch workhouse; there I viewed the body, I found no marks of violence upon it; I apprehend the child might be suffocated either in the birth or afterwards; but I am apt to think it was born alive, because there were settlings of blood interspersed all about the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it breath and yet be suffocated in the birth?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. Yes, my lord, it might.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Spires. The prisoner is my husband's daughter; she had some childbed linen at my house in her box; she had been at my house about a week before. I took the things out of the box. They were produced in court.</p>

Before the alderman he said, it belonged to one Stevens; after that he said, he was only employed as a porter to carry it into the Minories, but could not tell the house; the bag and all weighs 37 pounds; it is all stripped, and it is worth 8 d. per pound.

            . I am employed by Mrs. John and Caple Hambury, to see that nobody pilfers on the keys, &amp;c. On the 1st of January we were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175101160030"/> weighing near 100 hogsheads of tobacco for exportation. We had some that were weighed and made fast by the Cooper, and were roll'd a distance from the scale, where we were weighing. I saw the prisoner at the bar pull several times out of a hogshead, after it was weigh'd; I seiz'd him and found some in his bosom, some in his breeches and some in his pockets; in all about a pound and half; he has been a common pilferer, and very troublesom by the waterside.</p>

Then Hudson and Cooke both got up, and I gave Hudson my staff; just by the dial they met with the two prisoners, one they knocked down, the other they handed down; I took care of them: they would not tell the constable who they were, or where they were going to.

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Southal. Yes, my lord. I did, his father lives about a mile off from me: this horse had but half a shoe on one of his feet behind; we went out the next morning to see for him about 9 o'clock. I track'd him out through a hurdle, and up a little lane, to a gentleman's wood, and so to a place called Broughton ; when we came there, we traced the half shoe again, and other horses with him, till we came almost to Stone; then we met a road waggoner, and inquired of him, if he met any such horse? I did, he said; said he, you are a long way behind: said I, how far may he be got? said he, as far as Basingstoke, and there were with him a black horse with a hog-mane; then I did not try to track him till I came to Basingstoke ; and I inquired there, whether any body had seen such a horse go by? we were told there was; so we came along for London road: we kept on all night; when we came out into a lane, we met another road waggon about two in the morning, We asked him, he told us he had seen such a horse, saying it was a grey one, about the size of his own, which mine was. Said he, I met him as far off as Blackwater. We kept along all night, and the next morning happened to be very wet, they had put in their horses, and we got before them at Hounslow turnpike. The turnpike man told us no such men were gone by, for we had them described to us before; I said remember if you can, he said indeed he did not remember any such going by; I looked out at his door, and said I think they be coming, and so it was. I peep'd out at the door, when the prisoner came up on my horse; I said, how didst thou come here? I am got here before you; there was another fellow on horseback behind<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175101160032"/> him, he ran down street, and into a gentleman's garden. I ran after and catch'd him; he appeared to be a man he had taken up to carry on the road for a mug or two of drink. The other man on the black horse rode back as hard as he could, we could not catch him, he had a woman behind him, and he threw her down into a pond; she appeared to be wife to the other man, coming to London.</p>
               <p>Said I to the prisoner, how came you by this horse? said he, he had been in a pound, and was brought to me; I took him to a justice near there; the justice ask'd him where he was going; said he, to service: said the justice, how much money hast thou in thy pocket? said he, but six-pence; said the justice, thou settest out very empty; the saddle was mine.</p>

            . I was at my father's house at this time. My father went to bed this night, and I set up with my brother; my younger brother went to serve the horses about 10 o'clock. I was with him with the horses, there were this little grey one and two others, after that we went to bed about one o'clock; the dog barked, I and my brother got up again; we missed this horse out of the stable; the stable door stood open, and one of the other horses was out. We hunted about the garden, but could not find the little horse; and in the morning, we got up and went out at a little back hurdle, where we tracked him; there was a half shoe missing on his near foot behind; the ground being soft where he went out, we could track him along a lane, and by a wood and a back by way, away to Broughton to the Champway ; then we could do nothing till we got up into the fields; there we could track him again out at a hurdle; we went through Stockbridge, there we could do nothing. When we got into the field, there we could track the half shoe again; but when we got to Stone, there we supposed he slung that half shoe, for it seemed to be barefooted. Just before we came to Stone, we met a road waggoner, who told us he met them just on this side Basingstoke: saying there were two fellows, and two horses; one a black horse, a hog-mane, and short cut tail, the other a grey horse. We came on in London road to Brentford ; the moon shone very bright when we came there; when we passed the turnpike, said I, I'll step back and ask this man if he has let any such men through; I did, said he, to the best of my knowledge I have not, in about a minute I saw something like them: my father had got a little hedge stake, and jumped out of the house and hit the prisoner; and I jumped out and ran on the other side the horse; the prisoner had a man behind him; he was surprised and slip'd off the rump of the horse, and ran through the turnpike gate as fast as he could, and my father ran after him; the other man, he had got this man's wife behind him; he pushed her off, and said, I must go back, I have forgot something; I tied the prisoner's hands together and took him to a publick house, and gave him a mug or two of beer, then had him before a justice; the justice asked him how he came by this horse? he said, he was brought to him; said the justice, I think thou hadst very good friends; whither art thou going? he could not tell, then after that he said, he was going to service; the justice ask'd him, how much money he had in his pocket? he said, he had but six pence; he told him, that was but little money to go with, to enter into a service at London.</p>

On the 2d of Jan. my brother brought me home a new wig, my master paid the money for it, and carried it into the inward room, there were three or four gentlemen drinking there at that time; the wig was put on the table; this Reynolds the prisoner was in the room to wait upon the gentlemen, and about half an hour after they were gone, the prisoner went away; and in about half an hour after that, I missed my wig; the box was there in the room. We suspected he had the wig, we took him up upon suspicion; we taxed him with it, and he denied it, and just as he was committed he confessed it.</p>

Two days after Christmas-day, near 12 o'clock at night, I had just come out of an alehouse, the King's arms in the Fleet-market; I met the prisoner in the market coming from Harp-alley, and a little boy with him; the prisoner said to the boy, d - n you run, or else we are taken. I saw the prosecutor after him, calling stop thief! he got a head of the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you off of Harp-alley when you saw the prisoner first?</p>
               <p>Lingard. About 12 or 14 yards. I saw him come out of the alley; I was in the middle of the market going towards Harp-alley; the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175101160034"/> and prosecutor were both running. I overtook the prisoner and the boy; I believe the boy was about eight or nine yards from the prisoner: when they ran by the prison gate, I ran down near the side of the market houses; when he saw I crossed upon him; he turned round and stop'd; said he, what do you want with me? Said I, you have robb'd the man, and you shall go to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he run in the market?</p>
               <p>Lingard. I followed him about 100 yards or better; I overtook him just on the top of the market  the prosecutor was just after me; said he, when I had took hold of the prisoner, I am robb'd; said I, do you know the man? Said he, I have lost my hat, and this is the man that robbed me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Lingard. He said nothing for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the boy taken?</p>
               <p>Lingard. He was, but the man that took him is not here. The alderman cleared the boy, because the prosecutor could not say any thing against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner e'er a hat in his hand when you took him?</p>
               <p>Lingard. He had not, the prosecutor was without a hat.</p>

            . I was constable for the night. The prisoner was brought to me at the watch-house for robbing Mr. Lawrance of a hat; there was a boy about 14 years of age brought with him; the prisoner and Mr. Lawrance said, they knew nothing of the boy. Lawrance said, the boy was with the prisoner, when he robbed him of his hat; I asked the prisoner how he came to run? He said, he run because somebody cried out stop thief! I sent the prisoner to the Compter and the boy to Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober?</p>
               <p>Plaster. He was very sober, as he is now?</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Lawrance. Did you see a boy when you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Lawrance. There was a boy, he went out at the end of the alley with the prisoner; they ran both together.</p>

               <p>I came over from Boston in New England; I was born there; the ship I came in was then at Stoney-stairs ; I came on shore with the captain, and had been drinking with some of my shipmates, and coming away, I was running to make the best of my way to Stoney-stairs; this gentleman cried out stop thief ! and that man was in the market, and he ran and called to another man that came out of an alehouse; he came towards me and said stop, I stop'd; said I, what do you want with me? Said he, you are the man that robbed him; then said I, if he says so I'll go back to him; I told the same story at the watch-house; there was a boy taken up, whom I never saw before; the boy said, he used to go a begging for his father and mother; I have not been in London above a month.</p>

On the 23d of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our shop; she had been there about two o'clock the same day, but I did not see her. My servant went into the shop to her; she said she wanted to see some Irish linen; she agreed for a piece, at about 2 s. 2 d. per yard; she said her name was Jemmit, and that she came from Fleet-street, saying, Mr. Jemmit used to buy these things himself, but he had not been well used; she looked out different things, amongst the rest was muslin; she had different sorts of muslin cut; I shewed her a piece, which she said was too fine for aprons, so I shewed her some coarser. I left it upon the counter; when she asked for Russia sheeting; I reached some down and shewed her; she agreed for two pair of sheets and many other articles; she behaved very much like a gentlewoman ; I asked her, if she would go backwards and drink a dish of tea. I ordered my servant to do up her parcel; after I had made a bill of parcels, which she ordered me to do, to send home the goods to Mr. Jemmit a grocer in Fleet-street; she said, she hoped I would be a customer to her; so I ordered the porter to bring some sugar, &amp;c. she desired also I would send a bag for to bring some halfpence, saying, her husband Mr. Jemmit had been obliged to take much halfpence; so I must be paid in part with them; then she asked me, if I should send home the goods by that child, meaning my son, and asked if he could write a receipt; I said I'd send them in the morning by a porter, and my son with him, in order to write the receipt; she staid in my shop two hours, with a pretence to buy, &amp;c. I sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175101160035"/> the goods, according to her order; the porter and my son returned, and said, that very morning there had been two persons with goods at Mr. Jemmit's before, and that Mrs. Jemmit had not been out the day before; they brought the goods home again; it immediately struck into my mind, this woman did not give me this trouble for nothing; so I examined the muslin; it was easy for her to have taken away three or four pieces of that, it lay in so little room, and the wrapper in which they were lay open upon the counter. I missed a piece of fine muslin; it was 16 yards, which I am positive I had shewed to her, which she said was too fine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you opened the wrapper between the time she was at your shop, and the time you missed it?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Combridge. No, my lord, we keep them in a wrapper, and lay them in the counter, the counter and wrapper had not been opened between the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she desire you to give her credit for these things ?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Combridge. No, she did not, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Jemmit?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Combridge. I did not, my lord, she came in that name to me.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Why did not the gentlewoman come to inquire after me before this?</p>
               <p>Mr. Combridge. Because I did not know where to find her.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner at our shop August 23. about five o'clock in the afternoon. I heard her bargain with my mama for some goods ; I went the next day with the porter, and a man in Mr. Jemmit's shop told me to take care of the goods, and said, there had been two linen-drapers with goods ordered there, in the same manner that morning; and that Mrs. Jemmit had been ill, and had not been out for a fortnight; so we took the goods back, and I told my mama what I was told there, so my mama looked into the counter amongst the muslin, and missed a piece of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Combridge. This was about 10 o'clock, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say what her name was?</p>
               <p>Combridge. Yes, sir, she said her name was Jemmit, and ordered my mama to send the things home to the Blackamore's head, Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jemmit. I live at the Blackamoor's-head in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your wife?</p>
               <p>Jemmit. There she sits, [pointing to Mrs. Jemmit  who sat near the bench.] About the 23d of August she was very big with child, and had not been out for a fortnight or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in your shop when the porter and last witness came in on the 24th of August?</p>
               <p>Jemmit. I was not, but I was when several others came on such like errands. Two or three days after this there came a person with goods, and said, they were ordered there by Mrs. Jemmit, and to satisfy him, I called Mrs. Jemmit down; then the person said, I beg your pardon, this is not the person. I desired them all who came, to carry their goods home, for they were cheated, and bid them see if they had not lost any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never saw Mrs. Combridge till I was in the Poultry Compter; she came and desired to speak with me; she said, do you know me? I said, no; said she, you are the person that was in my house last August, that went by the name of Jemmit; said she, I am very loth to appear against you, and if you'll give me eight or nine guineas, I will not appear against you. Said I for what? I have nothing to say to you. I went directly into the chamber, and repeated every word as I do now to Mr. Woodman before she got down stairs; she did not tell me her name then, but said she liv'd in Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Woodman. I remember Mrs. Combridge's being at the Poultry Compter. I heard no conversation between them, they went into another room. I believe within a minute after Mrs Combridge was gone, the prisoner came out of the dining room, and as Mrs Combridge was going down, the prisoner told me as she has said now. But how true it was, I can't say.</p>

             at my house; I went into the west of England, and made it my business to enquire at Portsmouth. but could not hear of such a person; my sister in law went into a service, I believe at Chelsea; he came to our house to enquire for her a little before Christmas, the same year; he asked me and my wife what was become of Jenny? After a great many protestations, he was told where she was, then he immediately went away to her: he told me, he courted her for no other end but to make her his wife. I am a taylor ; he gave me orders to make him some cloaths, which I did, almost three suits; when I was measuring him, I said, are these to be your wedding cloaths ? he said, yes. I sent them to him in the county, according to his direction. I did not see him till Midsummer-day. 1748, he came to my house ; she came to him; I cannot say I heard what passed between them, he asked me, if I could take a walk with him that evening? I told him I could not, having some business to do; he and Jenny went out together, and I did not see them till 3 or 4 days after, then he called for his bill; he looked it over; then said he, does my wife owe you any thing? No, said I; then he paid me. I asked him if he was married, he said, yes; they then went to live in Round-court, at one Mr. Humphrys's  he cohabited with her there, as man and wife; I was never there but twice the time they lived there; I now live in Prince's-street by Red-lion-square.</p>
