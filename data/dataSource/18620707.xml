                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Fairey, a master slaughterman—he has a slaughter-house in Old Smithfield, and one at the New Cattle-market—on 26th May, I saw the carcases of two sheep that had been dressed, hanging up in the slaughter-house—the prisoner came in there about half-past 9—I was having my breakfast, and he looked at the carcases—one of them had the appearance of having been dead eight or nine hours, I should say—one was a very nice sheep—they did not seem fellow sheep, but quite odd—the leg of one was broken, and the fellow leg on the other was very much bruised, as if it had been crushed under the cart—the leg of each sheep was broken; I think it was the right leg; but I know the left leg of one was very much bruised—I said to the prisoner, "Are those your two sheep?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What do you ask for them?"—he said, "I have just sold them to Mr. Sayers"—he is a man about the market that purchases a great quantity of sheep—I did not see them taken away—I have seen the prisoner about the market as a drover—I have not seen him there since that—to the best of my belief; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the skins of those sheep—they were the only two sheep at our slaughter-house that day—the prisoner has not brought sheep there before to my knowledge; but I am not always there—I have never seen him bring sheep when I have been there.</p>

I was employed by the prose<lb/>cutor, on 23d June, to watch the premises—about a quarter-past 8 I saw both the prisoners and another man pass by the shop—they came back again and passed the shop a second time, and went towards Spital-square—about a quarter to 9 the two prisoners came back and looked in the window for a short time, the male prisoner standing a few yards off—the woman went into the shop, where there was a shawl hanging about three yards in the shop—she held it out with her right hand, so as to hide the persons behind the counter—the man followed her, and lifted the right skirt of his coat and put it over a piece of print—he then ran across the road to Acorn-street, where he turned his head, and seeing me behind him he threw them down and run up Acorn-street very fast—I ran after him—be was about to turn into Skinner-street when I caught hold of him—he threw himself down, and when on the ground he caught hold of my right leg. and tried to bite it, and was very violent—I stooped down to relieve myself of him, and he said, "You b—, I will scratch your eyes out"—while I had him on the ground the female pri<lb/>soner came up and called me everything she could lay her tongue to—she said, "You b—, you will kill the man"—she said, "I saw who took it; it was not him at all"—other constables then came up, and she made herself scarce</p>

We got boxing outside my door, and when I got the upper hand he went for the police. Two men came against me, and I took out this spanner to protect myself The police came out against me, and I went about three-quarters of a mile. I returned back when I saw the police, and said to them, "You have got no cause to take me; I have done nothing, only taken my own part." The policemen drew their staves. One of them hit me, and I hit him with the spanner. They both had their staves drawn before I raised my hand to them. As I could not go to the station on account of my five children, he hit me on the mouth and pulled me down. I have got six cuts on my head. He fractured my arm, and broke my finger in two places.</p>

I am single, and live with my father, at 2, Brunswick-road, Bromley—on Monday evening, 16th June, I saw Ralph and Pickering enter the yard—I was at Mrs. Sheehans' gate when they first came down, and Mr. Norman told the officers that if they went into the gate they would have their lives—Norman went in at the gate when he said that—the policemen then went inside, and Norman made a hit at one of the men—the constable then went to take him in charge, and Norman knocked Ralph down—the other constable went to help his brother constable, and the prisoner said God strike him dead, if Norman took Dick out he would have one of their b—y lives, and he went into the stable on the left and got the fork, ran over to the officers, and said, God strike him dead, he would have one of their lives before they went out of the buss yard, and directly hit the officer on the head with the fork—I was in the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi> yard all the time—I ran in as the officers ran in; me and the other young girl—that was after Norman made his retreat from the gateway—I saw some bricks thrown—I did not see Walker; he was not there at the time the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> began, but he came down the alley as the man was being taken in charge, and went into the yard as Norman was being taken to prison—Norman was then out of the yard—the prisoner ran away into Albert-street—the fork was taken away from him; I do not know who by; but I fancy it was my father who took it from him and threw it into the stable-yard—I know Bailey by sight, and have no doubt of his being the man.</p>

               <p>Providence-road—on 16th June I fetched the police—I saw Ralph come down there, take hold of Norman, and attempt to take him in custody—after that I saw the prisoner standing on the left-hand side of the gate—he had nothing in his hand the first time I saw him, but he went from the gate to the left side of the stable, fetched a pitchfork, and came hack with it in his hand—I saw Ralph run—Pickering ran to help him—Ralph was under Norman, but I could not see what occurred between them—the prisoner said, God strike him dead, before they should bring out Norman, he would have the constable's lives; and he ran into the stable with the fork pointed in this way; but somebody closed the gates so that I could not see the blow, and do not know what occurred inside—the mob outside forced the gates open, and I saw Ralph bring Norman out—I have known the prisoner by sight for six or seven years—I have seen Walker several times, but not to know him—I did not see him till the hearing at Arbour-square—the prisoner had not the pitchfork before he went into the stable; he went in and returned with it—I can scarcely say how far Pickering was from Ralph at that time, but I saw him running to his assistance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, of Montague-place, Poplar—on 16th June, between 7 and 8 o'clock, Pickering was brought to my surgery with a lacerated wound about an inch long on the back of his head, and going down to the bone—I dressed it for him—it was quite in the middle of the back of the head—it was such a wound as might be produced by a pitchfork—it was contused and lacerated—it would require a violent blow to produce it—it was not very dangerous—it has incapacitated him from duty up to the present time, but he will be fit for duty again shortly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it such a wound as might be produced by a stone being thrown at the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a small stone might produce it—whether the prisoner striking him with a pitchfork when stooping would produce it, would depend on the force of the blow and the thickness of the skull—that is the thickest part of the skull—pitchforks vary in size as much as stones do.</p>

I live at 8, Edward-street, York-road, and am a depositor in the Provident Institution Savings Bank—this is my deposit-book—I signed one of the books of the Institution when I deposited the money—I did not authorize the prisoner to receive any money for me; I never saw him before—I never gave any authority to my wife to draw out the money—I never told anybody to say that I was too busy to attend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On or about 12th June, I became acquainted with a lady, whose name not having been mentioned it is scarcely worth while to bring forward, more especially as I do not know whether she is a party to the deception practised upon me; she, in a few days, introduced me to Mrs. Dillett, and I met her once or twice. Mrs. Dillett afterwards came to my place of business in a great hurry, and asked me if I had any objections to go to her husband's deposit bank and sign his name, and she gave me his book which she had had given to her for the express purpose of my copying it. She said he wanted the money so particularly and could not leave, and did not mind giving anybody a sovereign for it. I said that I could not think of taking a recompense for it, and I started off without any intention of going to the bank, but I led her to believe I had been, and when I returned, I gave her to understand that the bank had closed, and advised her to give me a written order to receive the money. I thought the matter had dropped; when, on the 26th June, I received a letter from the friend I have mentioned, in which she stated that Mrs. Dillett would be at St. Martin's Church at 2 o'clock; I went and waited for her till a quarter-past 2; she said that she had been waiting for a signal from her husband whether he could attend, that she could see his place of business from there, and that he appeared and gave her a negative signal, and would I sign her husband's name. I said I had no proof that she was the wife of Jonas Dillett, she produced her marriage certificate, and I accompanied her to the bank and signed the receipt. To prove that there was no premeditated act of forgery, I signed the surname incorrectly. I was not asked the question whether I was Jonas Dillett till after I had signed the receipt, when I said that I was not, and immediately despatched Mrs. Dillett, believing that her husband would appear and extricate me, and even if I had received the money I should have placed it all in her hands. It will be suspected that there was an improper intimacy subsisting between Mrs. Dillett and myself, such, however, was not the case, nor anything approaching the case, so that I had no inducement to act as I did. This it a truthful statement, and I trust, when you come to look at all the circumstances, you will believe that, how<lb/>ever foolishly I may have acted, I was not intending to defraud either Jonas Dillett or the Provident Institution.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Keating, a chemist, of St. Paul's-churchyard—the prisoner was a customer of his, and I knew her as such—on Thursday, 22d May, she came there between 11 and 12 o'clock, and asked to be shown some perfumes—I showed her some, and she selected some extract of spring flowers—before leaving the shop she said that her house was much infested with rats and mice; that they had destroyed the shop ceiling, which had cost them 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to repair; that they also came into the bedroom and they could not sleep at night for them; that they even came up the bed curtains, and she was obliged to put out her hand and shake them off, and she heard them fall on the floor—she said, "Do you know, I am so afraid of them getting at my baby," and asked if she could have some prussic add or something to destroy them with—I told her we did not supply prussic acid for such a purpose, and recommended her Barber's poisoned wheat as the safest remeay—she said that they had tried that and found it of no use, and asked what other things we had for the purpose—I told her we had Butler's and Battle's vermin killer—she asked me which I could re<lb/>commend—I told her I had heard Battle's very well spoken of, and she said that she would have a shilling packet of it—we had not one in stock, so she took two threepenny ones and one sixpenny one—I told her it was a dangerous poison, and she must be careful how she used it—I said, "I suppose the children are in the country?"—she said, "No, they are with me in town"—the officer has since shown me some pieces of paper—the threepenny packets were wrapped up in yellow, and the other one in blue—these papers (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) are portions of the wrappers—we get these powders wholesale from Edwards', in St. Paul's-charchyard, or Barclay's.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. and Mrs. Vyse as housemaid—on 22d May I saw Mrs. Vyse with her bonnet on—I had seen the children that morning at 9 o'clock, the breakfast hour—they were in good health at that time—I took up the dinner about 2 o'clock in the dining-room, from the first-floor—the second-floor front is the dining-room—there are two dining-rooms—Mrs. Vyse was carving the dinner—there was cold roast beef for dinner, and rice pudding—the dining-room to which I took the dinner is on the first floor—some of the young ladies dined there, and Mrs. Vyse, who carved and helped, and she carved and helped the dinner that was for the children, and I took it up to the three children, who were on the second floor—the boy was there; his name is Charles Vyse; he is about ten years old, but I cannot state the age of any of the children—they had two girls and a boy; those were the three that were up stairs—Alice was one</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186207070027"/>
               <p>of them; the other girl was Annie—they were both younger than the boy—I took them up some cold beef and rice padding—they had milk and water to drink with it—Master Charles, the boy, ate the rice pudding at well as his sisters—I took away the things after dinner; they had a table-cloth and everything laid for them there—I also took away the things from down below—Master Charles generally goes to school after dinner, and I think he went out—the two girls were in the dining-room when I took away the dinner things; that was half an hour or twenty minutes after I had brought the things into the room—Mrs. Vyse did not go up stain at all during the time the children were at dinner; she remained down at the other dinner table—the children dined in their own bedroom, and I saw them there about half an hour or twenty minutes after I had taken the things away from dinner—I saw the two girls playing about there; that was between 3 and 4 o'clock—shortly before 4 o'clock I saw Mrs. Vyse in her bedroom, which is on the same floor as the children's bedroom—it is divided from hers by a wall—there is no door in the wall so that you can go from the one to the other; you have to go out on the landing—Mrs. Vyse had not her bonnet on when I saw her in her bedroom—I went up stairs, and on my coming down ten minutes afterwards, she was coming up stairs with her bonnet and shawl on into her own bedroom—she went into her bedroom and said, "Elisa, go to Mr. Keating's for a packet of the same powders which I had in the morning; make haste, and look sharp"—I went to Keating's, that is a very short dis<lb/>tance from the house, which is at the upper end of Ludgate-hill—I had to go through St. Paul's-churchyard—I had to wait a short time before I got the powder from Mr. Keating's, and having got it I returned to the house and went upstairs to Mrs. Vyse's bedroom—the door was shut; I knocked, but could get no answer—I knocked again, and the answer I got was, "Can't come in"—I then went up stairs—the cook was upstairs—I then went down by my<lb/>self and knocked at Mrs. Vyse's door again—she said, "Who is there?"—I said, "Eliza"—she spoke in a low manner to me, and said a second time, "You can't come in"—I then went down stairs to the shop to Miss Saunders, her sister, who was there, and who went up stairs with me—Miss Saunders knocked at the door and called her by her Christian name, but she made no answer—I think Miss Saunders knocked twice, and after that she and I forced the door open, and I saw Mrs. Vyse standing over the marble wash hand-stand with a razor in her right hand—when the door was first opened she held her hand down in this way, and Miss Saunders said, "Pray God," or "Pray, what are you doing?" I cannot say which; "Let me die with you, dear; but the razor I cannot take in my hand"—I then said, "I shall go for a doctor"—Mrs. Vyse put her hand into her pocket and took a letter out—she said that she was mad and wished to die, and that her children were in heaven—I think she took out the letter after saying that she was mad and wished to die, and that her ohildren were in heaven; but I was so confused I cannot remember whether it was before or after when she took the letter out of her pocket—she said to Miss Saunders, "Take this"—that is all the said—Miss Saunders took it—before I left the room Mrs. Vyse asked me for the powder more than once, but I refused to give it to her—I afterwards went into the children's bedroom, and found the two little girls in bed with the clothes over them—they were dressed, but their shoes were off; they seemed to me as if they were asleep—I did not touch them or speak to them, but I put my hand on Alice's face, and it was warm—I did not know they were dead; I thought they were asleep—I then went to Mr. Keating's—there was a gentleman there—I have seen Dr. Payne since—I gave the powder which</p>

               <p>I had brought from Mr. Keating's to another gentleman—the gentleman sit<lb/>ting by you (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Wood</hi>) looks like him, but I cannot swear to him—the gen<lb/>tleman I saw at Mr. Keating's went back with me to Mrs. Vyse—I am the housemaid and attended to the bedroom in which the children slept—I found there two tumblers on the washhand-stand—there was usually only one tumbler there—I only left one there when I cleared the room that morning—the children had slept there the night before—Mr. and Mrs. Vyse have a country house at Surbiton, near Kingston—I cannot say whether the three children had been brought up that morning, or only two—I think the boy had been brought up that morning to go to school—the little girls had not been brought up the day before; they were brought up on the Wednesday—there were five children; there are three alive now—there is a baby about a year and a half old, and which was at Surbiton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, and reside at 34, Artillery-place—on the afternoon of 22d May I was at Mr. Keating's, St Paul's-churchyard, and in consequence of being called upon, I went to Mr. Vyse's, on Ludgate-hill, and found Mrs. Vyse in her bedroom, dressed, and standing up, leaning over the wash hand-stand—I examined her throat before Mr. Savory came, and found some blood which was interfering with her breathing, and removed it—after about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes Mr. Savory, a surgeon, of St. Bartholomew's-hospital, and myself, dressed the wound in her neck—it was an incised wound with a sharp instrument on the right side of the neck principally, but reaching to the middle—I saw the razor—it could have been inflicted with that, but it was not deep enough, nor in the right place to prove a fatal wound—it was on the right side, and through what we term the thyroid cartilage; the hard part here—there was blood on the razor, and in the basin, but I did not particularly notice the quantity—I did not go in and see the children before I spoke to her about them—I heard something about them, and asked Mrs. Vyse what it was that the children had had—she replied, with a good deal of difficulty, "Battle's vermin killer"—Mr. Savory had come then, but I do not know whether he was in the room at the time—the difficulty appeared to me to arise from the wound—Mr. Savory and myself attended her conjointly for three days—we deemed it desirable and safe that she should remain in her own house—Mrs. Harrison, the female searcher, was placed there by the direction of the police, but she was removed by my directions, as Mrs. Vyse seemed agitated about knowing that a person from the police-station was in the room, and we thought it necessary, in order to favour her cure, that her mind should be at test; that was our only reason, and we had an ordinary nurse from the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Charterhouse-square, and am one of the assistant surgeons at St. Bartholomew's hospital—on 22d May Dr. Payne fetched me to Mrs. Vyse about 5 o'clock, and I suppose we got there a little after 5—I saw the two children, but only looked at their bodies externally at that time—they were little girls, and were lying on the bed both dead, one on her side and the other on her back—the elder was the one lying on her side; her body was quite warm, but mottled over, of a dark blue colour, livid, and the muscles of the tipper part of the body generally, especially those about the jaws, were rigid, so that those parts were stiff—the legs were drawn up towards the body, and the fingers slightly bent in to the palms—there was rigidity about the younger child, but more generally—there were similar marks on the surface, and similar symptoms, but the rigidity was more general—I made a post-mortem examination next day, and, on removing the skull-cap, the vessels of the brain were very full of blood; congested we call it—it was congested through its substance—I took out the stomach, and Mr. Hatfield had the contents to analyse—I observed the symptoms that would arise from death by strychnine—the quantity of strychnine which would cause death in a young person like this would depend upon whether it was in solution or in a solid form—I should think that in a child of the age of these a quarter of a grain would be sufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which would be the most rapidly effectual? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The solution, by far—about a quarter of a grain in solid would kill such a child as either of these, speaking generally, and something less than that in solution, I should think—I believe that a quarter of a grain in solution, would certainly kill; it would be more certain in solution.</p>

               <p>not analyse any of the contents, but I made some experiments with a portion of the contents of the stomach—I took about a sixth part of the contents of the stomach of the eldest child, boiled it with distilled water acidulated with a few drops of acid to make it soluble, filtered the solution thus obtained, evaporated it to concentrate it, and gave it to a cat, and that cat had spasms—spasmodic attacks usually attend the administration of strychnine.</p>

Edwards and Co.—I analyzed the packet Mr. Savory gave me—it was a shilling packet—it is composed of starch, sugar, Prussian blue, and strychnine—the percentage of strychnine to the whole quantity of powder is 10 per cent.—there were fifty-three grains of powder in the packet when I received it—I found twenty-five grains of powder in the sixpenny packet, and the same proportion of strychnine; 10 per cent.—the third packet weighed fifteen grains, and there was the same proportion of strychnine—the quantity of strychnine in the sixpenny and the two threepenny packets would, I should say, from what I have heard from Mr. Savory, be sufficient to destroy life in two children.</p>

I am a boot and shoe maker, of 33, Ludgate-street—I have known Mrs. Vyse some years, and have been doing business with her for three years—I had made a pair of boots for each of these two children—she was very much interested in their dress and appearance; I never saw any person so much so—I thought her a very affectionate mother—on the Monday before the Thursday when I heard of this event she came to my shop—she was very excited, and brought the two pairs of boots back—she said they were not elegant boots, which she had ordered—she stamped her</p>

               <p>feet on the floor in a very excited manner, and said that I was not to answer her—I had not served her before, so as to observe anything of the kind, but my foreman had—I had not observed anything much; but I did a little the week before, when she came in and said she wanted two pairs of boots made exactly like what she had on—she said that she bought them at Radley's, in St. Paul's-churchyard—I said, "No, you did not, ma'am, you bought them here;" but she would not give way, though I knew my own work—while speaking about them she lifted her dress quite as high as her knees, which is quite unusual for ladies to do, and said that there was a difference in the toes of her boots, and that a gentleman had told her so—she was very excited when I said that I could not see any difference—she seemed to look and stare very much on that occasion, and she opened her eyes in a very mad state, and jumped about the shop—I said that I could not get the men to work, and she stamped her feet, and said that if she were me she would horsewhip them—I expressed at the time to my foreman and shopman that I thought she was out of her mind, and that is my opinion now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, of St. Paul's-churchyard—I have known the prisoner and her husband for several years—I have been in the habit of doing business with them, and going in there from time to time—on 22d May, between 1 and 2 in the afternoon, I accompanied my wife to Mrs. Vyse's to get a bonnet—it was on the day in question—Mrs. Vyse had always been in the habit of attending to my wife personally—she was upstairs—I sent for her, and one of the assistants said that I and Mrs. Spence were down<lb/>stairs waiting to see her, and she came down—I discovered that she was in a peculiar state—she endeavoured to put off the business—she did not seem willing to attend to business—my wife first of all wanted some children's bonnets, but Mrs. Vyse seemed to say she had not got them—that struck my attention; and seeing the state she was in, I said, "Never mind, I will leave it with you, and see you again about it;" and I said to Mrs. Spence, "While you are in town, if you think of going up to the Exhibition, perhaps you had better get a bonnet for yourself"—Mrs. Vyse brought out a bonnet in a very abrupt manner, and showed it to Mrs. Spence, who made some observation about the bonnet, when the prisoner snatched it from her hand, tore out the flowers, and threw it on the ground—Mrs. Spence had made some remark about a flower on the inside, and she tore out that in the same way—all this was done in a way to attract my attention very much—her appearance dif<lb/>fered from her ordinary appearance—I looked at her a second and a third time, and tried to discover the meaning of it—she used to have a youthful, fresh appearance, but she appeared then to have a smouldering fire within, ready to burst out—she had a very staring look—I said immediately on passing out that I was very much astonished at her manner and style, so</p>

                  </hi>. I have been servant with Mrs. Vyse three years—I used to live at Surbiton—I remember the death of the daughter Florence—it was on 27th November, 1860—she was taken ill on Tuesday, and the mother was not informed of it till the Saturday—she came down as usual on the Saturday, and then I informed her that the child was ill—she knew nothing of it till she came in at the door—she remained with it night and day, till the Tuesday, when it died—it was ten days ill—she was a most affectionate mother to all her children—after the child's death I noticed that her manner and demeanour changed very much—I recollect her coming down one day in February last, while I was preparing tea—she did not appear in good spirits, she was very excited—she put the baby on the floor—she had him in her arms when she came in—she was absent for a few minutes—she came down, and without any cause that I could make out, she cleared the tea-tray fall of things and threw them into the fire-place, cups and saucers, and egg cups—she seemed very excited, but next morning she seemed quite sorry and surprised, and could not believe that she had done so—she did not remember that she had done so—she seemed to have no idea that she had done such a thing—I think she weaned the child last February—I am not quite sure if it was weaned in London after this occurrence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine and examining surgeon to the Council of India—I was surgeon to the Indian invalid troops—soon after the death of Mrs. Vyse's child, I was called to attend the other children and to attend her—I became their regular medical attendant—the death of the child seemed to prey upon Mrs. Vyse, she was the subject of a morbid melancholy on the subject, and of an idea that if she had been present she might have saved the life of the child—in addition to morbid melancholy I have also seen her subject to sudden irrational impulses; but except at those times her demeanour was quiet and ladylike, very much so—she was not remarkably quiet, she was animated and very ladylike—she was very particular about her dress and person, she always exhibited great taste—she has manifested to me almost an undue anxiety, great solicitude, about her children's and her husband's health—she was nursing her child when I was consulted on the last occasion about her—that was at the beginning of this year; she was so much deteriorated in health and strength that I recommended her to wean the child, and to partially relieve herself from the duties of her business—I considered at that time that she was the subject of so much melancholy that she ought to go out of town but I was</p>

               <p>afraid that the melancholy would be increased by the want of occupation, and so I recommended that she should partially follow her business—I entertain an opinion that she is from two to three months pregnant now, there are all the usual signs—I cannot attribute the event that has occurred to anything else than the signs I have mentioned before—I believe she was in a state of mania at the time.</p>

I am a physician—my attention has been directed to this subject for twenty years—I have written works upon it and made it a matter of study—I have been in Court during the whole of the day—I consider that the suppression of menstruation, either from the natural cause of conception, or from other causes, may under certain conditions of bodily predisposition, affect the brain—hereditary matters are of very great importance, indeed, in the consideration.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming a person, up to the period of the loss of a child, to have been healthful, and then to have exhibited fits of despondency and impul<lb/>sive madness, should you consider that evidence of unsoundness of mind, or of a predisposition to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are undoubted symptoms entitled to grave consideration—if I knew also that there was hereditary madness in the family, that would excite my suspicions—the system would be weakened by conception immediately after cessation from suckling a child; any marked deviation from the usual habits of body or mind would un<lb/>doubtedly awaken grave suspicion as to the mental condition of the party, although the evidence taken by itself would not be very conclusive, yet it would be very important combined with other facts—there is a form of madness termed paroxysmal madness, recognized by all writers; that very frequently takes a suicidal form, and very frequently the homicidal, con<lb/>nected with acts of violence, either on the patient himself or others—the patient would undoubtedly be incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, he is apparently sane and tranquil, ths insanity coming on in paroxysms from some exciting cause, and the patient often committing some serious overt act, either on himself or on others—such a state is not inconsistent with the general management of the affairs of life.</p>

The deceased young woman was my daughter—she was twenty-five years old last February, and lived at home with me, at Hendon—her name was Ann Sarah Cox—she was commonly called Annie—I have known the prisoner a long time—he used to come into our house of an evening, and of a morning—he slept there from the Wednesday week until the Saturday morning when this happened—he had been courting my daughter for about eight months; since August—on that Saturday morning, while I was lying in bed, I heard a noise—I do not remember the day of the month—it was at the end of March—the prisoner said, "Good morning"—that was before I heard the noise—I cannot say what time it was when I heard that, because I was in bed and roused from sleep—it was in the morning—I heard nothing, only James Lawrence say good morning to me, and I said, "Good morning" again—I knew his voice—I heard nothing more until I heard the noise—he said nothing that I heard but, "Good morning"—I did not hear him say anything to my daughter—I was in bed—he said, "Are you going to lie a-bed all day?"</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mill-hill, Hendon—I know the house in which Mrs. Bettle lives—I was passing that house on the morning of Satur<lb/>day, 29th March, about a quarter or twenty minutes to 6 o'clock—I was going to my work—as I went by I heard a great noise, as though something were falling from a shelf—I could not judge from where it came—I was thinking more about my work than anything else, and did not take particu<lb/>lar notice—I could judge of the direction from which it came—as I was going to work it was on the left-hand side, the same side that the cottages were on—I went on after that noise for about thirty, or from that to forty yards—I then heard a female calling very loudly from a window—I believe that was the mother of the deceased, Ann Bettle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You only heard a noise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A kind of rumbling altogether, as though some things were falling down—the noises were very momentary—it was like two things together, but was very quick, whatever it was—it seemed like two noises—there did not seem to be much interval between the two—I cannot tell whether it was one or two noises—the noise was momen<lb/>tary—I did not hear two distinct noises at two distinct times.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is at the back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Little gardens—the street door opens into the road, but the door which when open, prevents the staircase door from being opened, that is the back door—as you go into the wash-house that door goes from you—there is a door in the middle of the wash-house that opens into a front parlour; it is like a passage through, and there is another door which takes you into the parlour—the door which prevented the staircase door from opening, is a door which goes outside into</p>

I am a surgeon, practising at Hendon—on Saturday morning, 29th March, I was sent for, about twenty minutes past 6, to Mrs. Bettle's cottage, and got there about forty minutes past 6—I found Ann Cox lying on the sofa, dead—I found on the right side of her neck a hole about the size of a shilling—the skin was blackened round the hole about an inch in circumference—I mean a black ring extended about an inch from the hole, all round—the wound did not injure any of the arteries on that side—on the left side of the neck I found a severe lacerated wound—it was the same wound coming out—the hole was as large as the palm of my hand nearly—it had severed all the great vessels, and also the swallow—that would be quite sufficient to account for death—I made a post-mortem examination of the body—that would be four days after, because the Inquest was held, and they had to adjourn it—I found three shots and a piece of a yellow colander together in the wound—the piece of colander was quite close to the shot—when I went in the morning to see the body, I observed the fragments of a shattered colander against the wall, about five feet seven, or five feet six from the floor—it was hanging from a nail by a piece of thread—I had not the least doubt that the piece of colander was sent into the wound by the rebound; because it was not very deep—it was just on the external surface, where the wound came out, where it was as large as the palm of my hand—I did not see how near the deceased was to the wall—the fragment of the colander was about a yard from the copper—the copper was in a different position—I examined the rest of the body in the post-mortem examination—I found nothing else to account for death—after I had examined the deceased on the morning, I went into the next cottage, the prisoner's father's cottage, and there found the prisoner walking about the front-room, with his hand to his face—on the left side of his face I found a very severe lacerated wound, which had fractured the lower jaw, and des<lb/>troyed nearly the whole of the left cheek—a gun-shot would be the only thing to produce it—I bandaged the wound there, and sent him to the hospital—I said to him, "Lawrence; you did this yourself?"—he said, "Yes, Sir"—I said, "And you have killed that poor girl too?"—he made no answer to that</p>

Mrs. Bettle this is all your fault about this, for trying to keep this so sly from me, but I have seen this a good while, and things begin to prove true about it, as she is in the family way by <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Mann, for she told me she was going to try what he had got; so that is the truth, and this is the cause of me doing what I have done, so tell Mr. J.

So good bye all, and bless you, dear friends, I must conclude with my own best love to all, and you are the cause of this Mrs. Bettle, and you will find it out.

Cocks and Co.—the envelope that enclosed it, was produced before the Magistrate; it ought to be here—it bore the London post-mark.</p>

I reside at 14, New Charles-street, Hackney-road, and am a porter in the service of the Eastern Counties' Railway Company—I recollect, on the 26th June, receiving a parcel from the last witness—this is it—about ten minutes after I saw the prisoner—he asked me for a parcel for Messrs.

                  </hi>. From Information I received I went on 26th June to the Shoreditch station, at twenty minutes past 12—I was there when the parcel now produced was left by Messrs. Morrison's clerk—about ten minutes afterwards I saw the prisoner go to the cloak-room window and ask for a parcel for Messrs. Cocks and Co., Hertford—the parcel was delivered by the railway porter to the prisoner—he left the cloak-room, and was going down he steps to Shoreditch—when he got on the last step, I tapped him on the shoulder, told him I was a detective officer, and asked him what he was going to do with the parcel he had in his possession—he said a gentleman had tent him from the other side of the railway station, on the other plat<lb/>form, for a parcel for Messrs. Cocks and Co.—I then said to him, "You must accompany me there and show me the gentleman who sent you for that parcel"—I then took him round to the platform, into the waiting-room, and also into the refreshment-room, to see if we could find this gentleman—he said, "I can't see him"—I then said to him, "I will give you another chance; these is another train on the other side, going to start for Woolwich, I will take you there to see if the gentleman is there"—I took him there, and he said he could not see the gentleman—I then said he must accompany me into a private room—I told him I was going to ask him very important questions, he was not obliged to answer them, as they might be given in evidence against him elsewhere—I then asked him how he came to be in Shoreditch station—he said, "I came there to go to the water-closet"—I then asked him how he came to be in the waiting-room—he said that he went there to rest—I then said to him, "Do you not think it very strange for a gentleman to come and ask a person of your appearance to go across to the cloak-room for a parcel when there are porters to do that?"—he said, "No, I do not think anything of that"—I asked him his name—he said, "Henry Tolhurst"—I asked him where he lived—he said, "No, 1, St. Andrew's-hill, Doctor-commons"—I asked him what his profession was—he stated he was a linendraper's assistant—I asked him whether he was in employ or out—he said that he had been out of employ two months—this is the parcel he had—I put my initials on it—he gave a correct address—I took him to the station.</p>

               <p>there—there was a cart at his door—I saw tome quarters of beef taken out and hung upon a hook in front; in the usual war, for sale—I afterwards inquired who had charge of the cart, and found it was the defendant's servant—I examined the beef—the flesh of it was very red—it was what we term in the trade a <hi rend="italic">croaker,</hi> that is, an animal that dies without being butchered—it was dressed in the usual way; as well as any butcher would dress it for the meat market—the kidney fat was green, showing that it had been dead some time before it was dressed—in my judgment it was decidedly unfit for human food—I saw the defendant there—he said something to Mr. Scales in answer to something he said, "That is the inspector; his decision is final"—I had condemned it—I subsequently took it to the Mansion-house—Dr. Letheby did not see it there—the Lord Mayor condemned it—anyone having a knowledge of meat could have told directly that it was not good, and a person having no knowledge could have seen there was something the matter with the meat—the flesh smelt very strong indeed of physic.</p>

I am a veterinary surgeon at Woodford, of fifty years' experience—my professional services were called for upon 14th April, to tend a cow of Lady Morrison's which had lately calved—I found her suffer<lb/>ing from apoplexy; produced by parturition—parturition apoplexy we call it—I administered medicine to her three or four times—she died on 15th—I should say such an animal would net be fit for human food—the defendant is a knacker and harness-maker, not a jobbing butcher—he has not a slaughter-house that I am aware of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I live at 4, Risby's Rope-walk, Limehouse—the pri<lb/>soner lodged in the house—on Tuesday morning, 10th June, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I saw the prisoner come home, carrying her child on her right arm—she was tipsy, and went up stairs—I said, "Shall I open the door?" she said, "No, thank you, I am able to open it myself"—I lit a candle for her, and she sat on a chair in her own room, with the child in her arms—I took away my candle, and left the room—I went up at 2 o'clock, as I was frightened of the light, and found her fast asleep in the chair, and the infant quite secure in her arms—I went down stairs and went to bed—Conolly, the father of the child, called me about 5 o'clock—I ran up stairs and said, "Dear me, what is this?"—he said that she had fallen on the child—she was then</p>

About 10 o'clock on the night of 16th June I was in High-street, Shadwell, opposite the prisoner's house, No. 153—I smelt something burning as I passed the house—I looked about, and saw smoke coming out of the shutters—there were two holes in the shutters—I looked through, and saw the prisoner with this box of iucifers in his left hand—I saw him take out three lucifers, strike them, light them, and put them to the bed-clothes—the bed was burning then—I did not hear him say anything—I burst in the front door, went into the back room to him, and asked him what he was about, setting the bed on fire—he said, "I am going to have a b—y <hi rend="italic">lark"</hi>—I immediately took hold of him by the shoulder and pulled him back—the bed was very much burning, and I turned the clothes over, as the flames almost reached the ceiling—I smothered them. with one hand, and held the prisoner wish the other—he said, "I have got a bucket of water, and I will soon put that out;" but instead of throwing the water over the bed, he threw it all over me—the house is in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Bailey, who keeps the Fox and Hounds public-house, at Sydenham—on 13th June the prisoner and another man came, about half-past 11 in the evening—the prisoner called for pint of beer, which was twopence—I served him—he tendered a shilling, which I put in the till, and gave him a sixpence and fourpenny worth of halfpence in change—there was a sixpence, a fourpenny-piece, and threepence in the till at that time, but no other shilling—after drinking the beer they went away, and in about five minutes they both returned, and the prisoner called for a half-quartern of gin, which was twopence-halfpenny, tendered a shilling, which I examined and found to be bad—I marked it with my teeth at once—I told him it was bad—he seemed surprised, and spoke to his friend—I put it on the counter, and he took it up—I then went to the till—no one had been to it, or had tendered any money, between that time and the time when I put the first shilling in—I found the shilling he had given for the pint of beer was bad, and said to him, "This is a bad one too"—he appeared surprised, but said nothing—I called my husband, told him, and he went round, detained him, and sent for a policeman—I gave my husband the shilling I took from the till, and he kept it in his hand till the policeman came—I did not see him hand it to anybody—the man who was with the prisoner went off as quickly as possible—I marked the shilling I took from the till—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; I am sure of it.</p>

I live at Sydenham, and am a shoemaker—about half-past 11 on 13th June, I saw the prisoner opposite the Fox and Hounds, and heard Mrs. Bailey say to the prisoner, that she had a bad shilling—that attracted my attention—the prisoner seemed very much surprised, and said, "Is it?"—he took it off the counter, turned round to the gentleman, in appearance, and said, "This is a bad one;" and the gentleman took the</p>

On 13th May I was on duty at Rich<lb/>mond—I was in George-street, between 2 and 3 in the morning—King-street runs into George-street—I heard somebody hallooing, shouting, and making a great noise at the other end of the street—I went there, and saw several</p>

               <p>persons going down Brewer's-lane—I walked down, and saw the prisoner—he stepped on a door step—I turned my light on to him, and he said, "What do you want to turn your light on me for?"—I said, "To see who you are"—he said, "You go away from me, or I will report you, and get your coat off your back"—I walked away, and he followed me, hallooing after me "Come here," he said, "I will fight you for what you like"—he then said, "I will go to the station and report you"—he turned off towards the station, and I turned in a different direction—I walked round my beat, and saw no more of him for half an hour, and when I was near the baths, about two minutes walk from the police-station, I saw him coming towards me—he came close up to me, put his foot against mine, and tripped my feet from under me on to the ground—I was not near enough to strike him before that—he struck me with his left hand on the right eye, and closed it up immediately—when on the ground he kicked me on the nose, and laid my nose right open—as soon as he saw me getting up, he struck me with both fists right and left on each side of the jaw; and as I lay on the ground he kicked me on my mouth, loosened ell my front teeth, and turned one tooth light round—I became not quite insensible, and felt two dreadful blows on my left side, either from a kick or a hit; I cannot say which—I was covered with blood from the blow on the nose—I then heard him run away, and became insensible—I afterwards roused up, and found myself lying in a pool of blood—I got hold of the wall to crawl to the station—I met another con<lb/>stable, Redfern, who accompanied me to the prisoner's house—we knocked at the door—the prisoner came, and Redfern said to me, "Is that the man?"—I said, "Yes, that is the man who assaulted me"—we took him in custody—he said to Redfern, "I will go quietly with you"—there is no truth in the statement that I challenged the prisoner to fight—I am still suffering—I have been vomiting blood and large pieces of flesh this length.</p>

On 13th May, about half-past 2 in the morning, I met Smith in Brewer's-lane, covered with blood, his eyes closed, and his nose broken—I went with him and another constable, No. 360, to the prisoner's house—I knocked at the door, and he came down and said, "I know what you have come for; I will go back"—Smith said, "That is the man who assaulted me"—I took the prisoner—he had been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what was going on.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am in practice at Richmond—on the morning of 13th May, the prosecutor was brought to my surgery, suffering from dreadful contusions on the head and face—there was a great deal of blood about his face, which came from his nose—his right eye was com<lb/>pletely closed; his head was in a dreadful state; he was hardly recognisable—he was sent home, and on examining him I found he had other injuries—he had difficulty of breathing, and incipient cough, which led to a further examination, and we found that he was suffering from injury to the lungs, no doubt brought about by some immediate cause—he lay in danger, on and off, for four or five weeks, and my opinion was that it would terminate very badly—I continued to attend him up to the present time, and he has still consolidation of the right lung, and there is a cicatrix, an adhesion of the lung to the pleura—it seemed to me to have been caused by a kick or com<lb/>pression—there was great disturbance of the circulation, and I have no doubt that the heart suffered as well—he may be fit for duty in some months, but that is a question—he has lost flesh considerably.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> There were no external marks on the lower part of the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he recovered from the external injuries in about ten days—it would depend on the size of the instrument, whether a blow or a kick would produce external marks—if the knee, or elbow, or foot were used, or if he was stamped upon, there might be bruises; but from the elasticity of the ribs giving way, there might be no bruises, but the lungs would have the direct force of the blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated, that like the Italians, the people of Rich<lb/>mond were groaning under the tyranny of the police, who made a point of hunting him down, and endeavouring to drive him from the town, where he earned his living as a shoemaker; that the policeman accepted his challenge to fight, but not knowing how to protect his face, got the worst of it.</hi>
