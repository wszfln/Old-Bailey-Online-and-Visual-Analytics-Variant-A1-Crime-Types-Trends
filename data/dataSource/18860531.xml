                  </hi>. I am matron of an Industrial Home known as Trewint, at the Green, Tottenham—the prisoner became an inmate of the Home on lath April last—I believe she is 15 years old—there were 40 girls in the establishment at the time, they slept in dormitories—the prisoner and nine other girls slept in the same dormitory, No. 4—between a quarter and half-past two on Tuesday morning, 27th April, I was aroused by loud screaming—I went out to see what was the matter—I found the screams proceeded from some of the girls on the staircase—I went into No. 4 dormitory—I there saw clothing hanging on the wall, on fire, they were the girls' ordinary clothing, print dresses, petticoats, and other clothing; they hung up on a peg between the prisoner's bed and the bed occupied by Margaret Fox—the prisoner was not in the room—I can't say how many girls were in the room, but Margaret Fox was there—I examined the prisoner's bed, the clothes had been hastily turned back and the bed was wet where the water had gone—we extinguished the fire—I went round the dormitories to count the girls and then returned to No. 4 and saw the prisoner—I did not speak to her or she to me, she only stood, there, apparently very calm and quiet—I told her to get into bed with another girl as her bed was wet—the clothes that were burnt were only the clothes she was wearing in the day time—it had been partly extin<lb/>guished when I saw it—I ascertained that same night that the clothes belonged to the prisoner, they were hanging in their proper place, there was a peg for the purpose—on the previous Monday, the 26th, my atten<lb/>tion had been called to a basket used for collecting waste paper and kept in the bath-room—I noticed a piece of burnt paper lying beside that basket—on the Tuesday morning I examined that basket more carefully, and I found that the paper inside the basket had been lit, and the ends of a piece of rope—there is a rule in the Home that matches are given</p>

               <p>out one or two at a time to the girls who have fires to light, they were Henrietta Reynolds and Annie Wells, and the girls in the laundry who took it in turns—on the morning of the 27th, after I had been round the dormitories, I picked up an empty match box on the top landing, the same Landing as No. 4 dormitory, about two yards from the door—I was present when the prisoner was given into custody on the morning of the 27th, she said nothing in my hearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The dormitory doors were not fastened at night—the wall of the dormitory was alight and damaged, the rack on which the clothes hung was charred, the wall paper was burnt off and the wall itself was burnt—a place about the size of the palm of my hand was disturbed, actually burnt—the beds are about 18 inches apart—the rule as to matches being given out was rule of some standing, long before the prisoner came there—there had been no attempt to burn the Home before, or any threat that I knew of—the only reason why one or two matches at a time were given out was because they waste them so—when I first saw the basket my suspicions were not excited—I had no conversation with the prisoner about the fire—she never mentioned any person's name to me as having matches who should not have them—she told me that some girl had heard some other girl say she wished the house was burnt down—I can't remember which girl said it—I did not make inquiries about it except of the prisoner herself—I asked if she had said so, and she then charged it to Edith Coleman as having beard her say it—she did not sleep in a dormitory on the same landing as the prisoner—at the time the prisoner was calm the fire had been put out—the clothing that was burnt was not uniform clothing, but ordinary clothing—the girls Chamberlain and Drewitt did not sleep in the same dormitory or on the same landing as the prisoner—since the fire I have had no occasion to warn a policeman about these girls—I asked a policeman coming by the same train to keep the girls together, I was afraid of their running away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a diamond merchant, and live at 5, Belgrave Street, Euston Road—on Wednesday, 24th March, about 10 a.m., the prisoner and another man came to my house—they were stangers to me—I opened the door to them—the prisoner said, "Your name is Mr. Tabak?"—I said "Yes," and asked what he wanted—he said he was recommended by a French firm to buy some diamonds—I took him into my hall, and asked him his name and residence—he said his name was Touissant, and he stopped at the Bath Hotel, Piccadilly—I then took them both upstairs to my office, and took from a case there some diamonds, 138 carats, to show them—the prisoner looked at them through an eyeglass, and selected six or seven with a pair of plyers, 60 carats—he asked the price—I said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per carat—he divided them in two, and put them in a piece of paper, and put them in a scale—he afterwards said he wanted some large stones for a necklace—I showed him a larger parcel, 80 carats, and he took the large stones out of the parcel, 40 carats; that was 100 carats altogether—the second lot was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per carat—I put both parcels into an envelope, and wrote his name on it—he said he had got nothing but foreign money, he would go to the bank and get English money, and settle with me in the afternoon; he said they would call at 5 o'clock punctually—they did not come back that day; I got a telegram saying they would come next morning—they came next morning at half-past 9—I opened the door—the prisoner said he wanted to buy some large stones for a bracelet—I took them both up to my office—he said, "I want the two parcels that were sealed up the day previous, and to buy some other diamonds for a bracelet"—I showed him some more stones—when I gave him the diamonds he had selected the day before he put them on the table on his left arm, and he selected the other stones for the bracelet—I was sitting down at the time—while he was selecting the stones I felt several blows on my head; I was stunned—I looked round, and had a heavy blow on my temple, which</p>

               <p>blackened my eye, and I was bleeding very fast—I took up my diamonds and as I was taking them up I got a heavy blow on my hands, and this hand is paralysed—as soon as the diamonds fell on the table the prisoner took them up—he had the plyers in his hand, and they both left immediately, leaving their hats on the table and the life-preserver—I was screaming "Oh" because I was bleeding so much—my wife came into the room, and after about 10 minutes the prisoner was brought back into the hall with a policeman—I charged him, and went to the station in a cab—they took away about 180 carats of diamonds—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the paper they were wrapped in, and these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the diamonds, but there are 80 carats short—the value of these is about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is only half; I have got back 94 out of the 180.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I was struck I was seated alongside of the prisoner; I had been seated there about 10 minutes—I was struck by the other man—they did not both talk to me, only the prisoner; he acted as interpreter for the other man—the prisoner was the man that bought the diamonds, not the other man—they were both talking together—the other man ran away first; he was next to the door; the prisoner was sitting next to me to pack the stones; at the time I was struck he had the plyers in one hand and the diamonds in the other; he ran away immediately, very fast, with the plyers—they did not speak a word to one another before they ran away.</p>

               <p>I do not think Walker, but he could ask the clerk for one, and he could sell stamps—they are both there now—I don't know that they know where to find Inland Revenue stamps—the shop tills were accessible to all the assistants, but they would not take money for postal orders and stamps and put it in the shop till—my husband had to pay 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as over<lb/>due—he would not take, money out of the till—I only kept the shop books, I did not balance them every night—the shop till was balanced once a week—it is the assistants' duty to put everything they receive into the till, but the post-office is entirely separate from the shop—my father-in-law has never to my knowledge cashed post-office orders, leaving the persons to bring the orders next morning—I never heard of a Mrs. Gover having post office orders for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and my father-in-law paying her the money and allowing her to bring the orders next day—the Post-office people would sometimes let him know when they were coming down to inspect—I do not know whether 26th January was an inspection day—I did not put 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. among the post-office cash to answer for money my husband had had, he was not at home; his father put the money there—during the time the prisoner and another assistant were in charge of the post-office there was a deficiency of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know whether there was a deficiency before the prisoner entered the service—the 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. my father-in-law put in made nominally a surplus of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know whether he took the 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out after the inspection, or whether I took it out; it was taken with Thomas's knowledge, because the account was disputed—if money was wanted for change in the shop they would probably ask Thomas, or whatever clerk was there, for change—they would not ask for it without parting with the coin—my father-in-law of 76 sells stamps, and he would take money from every till in the place—my husband had access to all the tills—the Jury have to say whether the post-office money and the business money were mixed up—my husband has had postal-orders given him by the clerk without paying for them, that is how the 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made up, and also stamps and telegrams—if the prisoner was away at his meals he would be called when wanted, no one else was left in charge—he had to answer letters for my husband, but not away from the post-office—my husband and my father-in-law had the power to dismiss him—the marks on these three sheets were not made at the Hendon office; I think they show that the sheets passed before some official in London—there is no detail on any of them of how the cash was made up; that is the neglect of Thomas—when he left on February 3rd he left a box behind, which he wrote for, and complained that it was detained—he afterwards came down with an official of the Post-office—the keys of his desk were left in his bedroom, but he usually had them in his pocket—Mr. Batty came about February 11th, and when he went into the 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency the figures shrank, but I do not know what they shrank to—the cash on the debtor side had been increased to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that had not to he set aside before we began to count the cash—cash received means that we keep that amount to carry on the post-office business, if we have any<lb/>thing beyond it should be remitted to the Post-office—the accounts are connected one with the other, there is never a full stop—if there was an error in the account we might put it right without a voucher, we should correct it in a moment.</p>

I told him who I was, I did not go through the accounts with him, he said probably the stock had been wrongly taken, and I said "If that is the case you had better go to Hendon and go through the accounts with the assistant," and he went there with me next morning, and in my presence Mrs. Smart and the assistant handed him over the stock, and a deficiency of 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was ascertained—the savings bank books were then shown to him, he said he had received the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and with regard to the other two accounts he admitted having received them and that he had put the money in the till—I spoke to him subsequently about Mr. Thomass guinea and he said he had received it and put it with the rest of the money—these three sums were apart from the deficiency of the accounts which had been made up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Crowther, who keeps the Sultan beerhouse at 150, Hampstead Road—about 9 o'clock on 5th May the two prisoners and another man came in, and Hogan asked for a half a pint of fourpenny ale, and then for one of bitter six—while drawing it four or five men came in on the other side who recognised the prisoners, and they spoke together, asking if they were going to stand—amongst those other men was Plamplin—he called for a pot of fourpenny ale—Hogan paid for the pint of bitter six, I believe, and gave me a shilling, which I mistook for a sixpence and put in the sixpenny bowl by itself, I put threepence-halfpenny change on the counter—Hogan said "I gave you a shilling"—I said "Did you?"—I took the bowl and said "Yes, you did," and put sixpence more on the counter—I don't know if Hogan or the other man with him took it up—Hogan said "Put my beer there, I am going round to the other compartment to my <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> there"—I did so; Hogan and the other went round to the other men, and one of them said Hogan was going to drink his beer—they remained a little while, and then the whole party went away—some time after a detective came in, and from what he said I looked in the sixpenny till, and there saw this shilling which I had from Hogan, I believe—I saw it was bad, and gave it to Francis—this is the coin—the prisoners had gone then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at Messrs. Blydenstein and Co.'s, foreign bankers, of Threadneedle Street, London—on 18th April last I enclosed in a letter for Berlin 20 Russian banknotes of 100 roubles each—they were enclosed in a grey envelope similar to this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), marked "A"—I then put that envelope, in the presence of another clerk, into this linen envelope "B" with this statement or invoice, and addressed it, "Germany. J. Lowenhertz, Esq., 69, Baronstrausse, Berlin"—before enclosing the notes in the inner envelope I took the numbers of them in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the numbers of these three notes, 160,550, 11,038, and 41,354, are entered here, and also the numbers of these other two notes, 17,469, and 10,332—I put those live notes in the letter sent to Berlin—I put these seals on that envelope—another clerk named Wilhelm</p>

Lowenhertz, Berlin"—there would be 30 letters in a bundle—I tie the letters in bundles and wrap them in brown paper, And place them in the registered-letter bag for Berlin—I seal the brown paper with sealing-wax—it was a bag of this sort I put them in—I cannot identify this as being the one; it had "Berlin" on it—a man named Belcher, in my presence, then tied it round the neck and sealed the knot—I cannot tell whether these cuts on the bag are wearings or cuts—if there had been any on this bag which I dispatched I should have noticed it—I finished with it at 7.49.</p>

                  </hi>. I was one of the guards in charge of the Cannon Street portion of the Continental train on the night of 8th April—I saw the mails loading by the staff, and saw part of the mails for the Ostend boat put in a van; it was my duty when they were loaded to see that it was properly fastened on the outside—the off side was fastened by a pinner dropped in a slot, it was fastened on the near side in the same way—immediately behind the van was a first-class carriage, that was the only passenger carriage on the Cannon Street part of the train—we left Cannon Street at 8.14, and arrived at Dover Town at 9.57, we stayed there a minute and arrived at the Admiralty Pier about 10.1—the train at Chisle<lb/>hurst bank going up the incline would slacken about five or six minutes, I don't book the time, the head guard does that—it was a dark night, there were four compartments in the first-class carriage—I did not notice how many passengers there were.</p>

               <p>the door first to open would be the one farthest from him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a plan of mine showing how they open—one leaf would be bolted inside, the other would be capable of being opened—there is a continuous bolt with two claws, one at the top and one at the lower portion, which go the whole length of the door; that would fix one door, the other could be opened from the outside—you could fasten the door on the inside so that nobody from the outside could get in—this plan represents the distance from the end of the footboard of the passenger carriage to the end of the footboard of the van an three feet, but I have not had an opportunity of getting the exact measurement; there is a hand-loop at each end of the footboard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first-class carriage has no hand-rail, you can reach the handle of the door from one door to another, the distance would be about seven feet, you would have to walk along the footboard that distance without anything to hold by—I should not like to do that with the train going forty or fifty miles an hour, the breadth of the footboard is nine inches—the luggage van has a continuous footboard on both sides—when one leaf is bolted inside, the other leaf opens outwards—if a man was on the footboard and opened that door it would knock him off on to the rails—he would risk his life, if the door was properly secured inside.</p>

I am a carpenter belonging to the Louise Marie—I was on board on the evening of 8th April when the mails for Ostend came on board—I saw them placed in the mail room under the second-class cabin—I opened the hatches which had previously been locked—before the mails were put in I went down with a light to see that nobody Was there; nobody was there—a sailor went down to receive the mails, I stood by the hatch the whole time they were being put in, and counted them, and after they were all there I went down again and examined them—they were all right—the sailor came out as soon as the last bag was in—I shut the hatches and locked them—there is a brass plate over the lock to keep dust from the keyhole—when we got to Ostend I took out the mails—the cover over the lock was in the same trim as</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I could nut bring the keys here because the ship could not sail without them—the hatches are not taken off the ship in the day<lb/>time, not till all the mails are on board; and as soon as the last bag is down the hatches are closed—a man goes down to receive them—I went down half an hour before the boat sailed to see that everything was in order in the mail room—I first mentioned that on Saturday—I was not asked it before—George, the sailor that went down to receive the bags, is not here—no one went down into the mail room that night except George—the bags are thrown down the hatches to him—when we have many bags we open both hatches—only the hatch on the port side was opened on this night—the one on the other side was looked, and had not been opened since two journeys before—I examined that lock every journey—I did not say at the Mansion House that after the mails had been put in I locked the hatches, because I was not asked—nor was I asked if there were two keys, one for each hatch—I did not say there were two keys that locked both hatches, there is only one—it is my signature to the deposition—there is room for 150, 160, or 200 bags in the mail-room if necessary—I take them by the neck of the bag and look at the seal—as I hand them up I look at them again—I look at them as they enter and as they leave—I am able to say that all the bags were right when they came on board, I looked at the seal—there was a ladder from the second-class cabin down into the mail room by which I could get down the batches—I did not go near the hatches of the mail room from the time they were locked up till the boat arrived at Ostend.</p>

I am manager of a public-house, 111, Drury Lane—on the night of 2nd May I was in Lisson Grove and saw the three prisoners and the prosecutor, in the centre of the road—Moore went up in front of Kelly and struck him two blows on his face and felled him—Moore and Fitzgibbon picked him, up and Leach tripped him and felled him again, they picked him up and all three of them led him to the urinal—I went up and said, "What are you doing with him?"—they held his hands behind him and Leach searched his pockets, and previous to that Leach struck him—I asked them what they were doing with the man—Moore said, "What the b—h—has that to do with you?"—I tried to get into the urinal, but they would not let me, and I ran to the other side and got in that way and saw Moore give Kelly another blow, he fell and they made off—I gave chase towards Great James Street and met Sergeant Record and told him, he pursued them and I went back to Kelly and led him home—on the night of the 5th, about 12 p.m., I picked Moore out from a number of others—the other two were taken last week and placed with others, and I picked them out.</p>

On the morning of May 2nd I met Moore and, to the bent of my belief, Fitzgibbon, but he was on the other side, they were walking very fast—Donoghue gave me information and I went after them, but could not find them—I came up to the prose<lb/>cutor, but Donoghue had gone—about midnight on the 5th I saw Moore in Chapel Street and told him I should take him in custody on suspicion of being concerned with a man in assaulting and robbing a man in Lisson Grove on the morning of the 2nd—he said, "Did you see me?"—I said, "No, but I saw you just afterwards with another man in Lisson Grove"—he said, "That is all right, then"—he was taken to the station, placed with eight or nine other men of similar appearances, and identified by Kelly and Donoghue—on May 22nd, about 10 a.m., I went to Lisson Grove and saw Fitzgibbon, that is about 60 yards from where this robbery took place—I said I should take him on suspicion of being con<lb/>cerned with James Moore and another in assaulting and robbing a man on the morning of the 2nd—he said, "I saw <hi rend="italic">Johnto</hi> Moore fighting with a man that night, but I had nothing to do with the robbery; I have heard that I have been suspected of being concerned with him"—I said, "Yes, I saw you outside the Crown public-house that night with him"—he said, "Not me"—I said, "Yes, you were wearing a peak cap"—he said, "I have not worn it since my child <hi rend="italic">fell away</hi> with it just after<lb/>wards"—he was taken to the station, placed with a number of other men,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). In consequence of informa<lb/>tion I went on 21st April, about 11.30, with Sergeant Reader and Con<lb/>stables Tremblett and Kenna, to a carpenter's shop at the back of 8, Stacy Street, St. Giles's—both the prisoners appeared to have been at work at the carpenter's bench, and had planes in their hands; they had left off when I opened the door—I said, addressing chiefly Frederick Barton, "We are police officers, and we have information that you have stolen property in this shop"—Frederick Barton said "We have nothing here but what is our own"—I then said "Have you any china here?—he said "No, we have told you we have nothing here"—I said "We shall have to search the shop"—Thomas said nothing—we commenced to search, and from underneath the bench where they were standing I pulled out this box, which contained this gold watch, two silver watches, one with bow broken off, a gold necklet and cross, a coral chain, several metal chains, and various other little articles of jewellery—I also found two counterfeit sovereigns, 25 counterfeit half-sovereigns, 216 counterfeit half-crowns, 81 counterfeit florins, and 138 counterfeit shillings, and pieces of metal which might be used for making counterfeit coin—the coins were wrapped separately in paper—both prisoners were present at the time of finding—I addressed both the prisoners, and said "How do you account for these watches and jewellery?"—the elder prisoner said "They have been brought here by different persons and left"—I said "Do you know the persons who brought them here?"—he said "No, I don't"—the younger prisoner said nothing—I then told them they would be charged with having it in their possession, supposed to be stolen—they made no answer.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant E</hi>). I went with Partridge, Kenna, and Tremblett on 21st April to this carpenter's shop, and there saw the prisoners—underneath the bench at which they were working, amongst some shavings, I found this box containing the works of nine watches, the glasses of seven, the back cases of three other watches, two sets of billiard balls, and a blue box containing another set of billiard balls, and a set of glasses, without tops, belonging to a lady's dressing bag—by the side of the box, among the shavings, I found a lady's hand<lb/>bag, in which was a purse—I found a cash box, which had been forced from the top—on a shelf near by I found books and a musical box, covered with shavings, a duplex tucker, and surgical instruments—I said to both of the prisoners "How do you account for these things?"—Thomas Barton, who was nearer to me (Frederick Barton being near Partridge), replied "They have been left here by different persons, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605310064"/>
               <p>cannot say by whom," or words to that effect—the prisoners refused to give their address—I went later on the same day with Kenna to where they lived—we searched there, and I saw Kenna find a set of billiard balls and some pickles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We went into the shop at the same time practically—the search began directly after Partridge had spoken to the prisoners—the shed is 25 feet long, I should think—directly we spoke Thomas Barton walked and stood by the spot where these things were found—there were two benches, with just room enough to work between them—these things were found under the right-hand bench, where the father was working—there were only these two working benches in the shed, there might be room for more than two to work there—another man was sitting down inside, near the fireplace, he was not in working clothes; I had not seen him before—I heard Partridge ask Frederick Barton to account for the watches, and he replied "They have been brought here by different persons and left"—Partridge said "Do you know the per<lb/>sons?" and Frederick Barton said "No, I don't," I believe—the younger prisoner did not speak, but he said, in answer to me, "They have been left here by different persons, I don't know whom"—the father was close by—I am of opinion that both spoke, but I addressed my question more to the younger prisoner—I went into both the rooms the prisoners lived in, it was on the first floor; they are both bedrooms, one is used as a living room and bedroom—the landlady was there, and the daughter came in directly afterwards—a child came from school, and we got the key from her—the billiard balls were found in a drawer in the larger room, which was used as a living and sleeping room—in the same room we found a couple of unopened bottles of pickles and a number of empty bottles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw no box found, both prisoners were working at the bench to the right of the door—I heard Frederick Barton say in reply to Partridge "They have been brought here by different persons and left"—he also said he did not know who brought them, Thomas Barton was close by at the time, he made no answer—I saw Header find the black lead and other things, I cannot swear I heard him say anything to the prisoner—I will not swear Reader did not address the prisoner nor that they did not reply to him—Partridge and Header were called before me at Bow Street, and I was in Court while their evidence was given—I said at the close of my evidence "I corroborate the evidence of the two sergeants"—I meant I did as far as I could.</p>

               <p>to Bell Street; they tried to push Webber down Bell Street, but he struggled, and they got him up against the grocer's shop at the corner; the prisoner got hold of his right arm, pulled open his coat and waistcoat, and Kenealey had him on the left side pulling his overcoat open—it was all done very quickly—his undercoat was fastened—Imber put his hands in Webber's pockets, and they all four went into the middle of the pave<lb/>ment—Imber got hold of Webber's umbrella, and was straggling with him, and hit him in the face with his fist and knocked him into the middle of the road—I halloaed out and they all ran away—the prisoner and Kenealey ran down Bell Street and up Edgware Road—D 79 pursued Imber; the prisoner escaped, but 1 arrested him on 28th April, at 14, Orchard Street, Marylebone, in a house about 200 yards from the place—I said "I shall take you in custody for being concerned with two other men in a highway robbery some time ago"—I did not mention the time or the men's names—he said "I thought that was all over; I have been here nearly ever since"—he was taken to the station and identified by other officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> None of the bystanders identified him, only policemen, no one else was in the street at the time—it was raining and very foggy—I did not stop him in the street on the night of January 26th—I did not say to him two or three nights after the occurrence "Where are you going?" nor did he say "I am going home"—I was keeping observa<lb/>tion on the house—Orchard Street is about half a mile from the station—I did not meet him in the street and say "I think I have seen you before"—I never spoke to him—I may have called at his father's house twice or three times—his father said he was not at home, but if I would call in the morning I should see him—I did not call, as I kept observation on the house, because as a rule fathers do not get their sons into a house to arrest them—I could almost swear the prisoner was not there—I have not seen him half a dozen times since the robbery—I do not know where he was working—his lather said when I went there on the 28th April "You ought to have come before and you could have had him, he has been working here"—he did not say when I took him "I have been living at home, and if I was guilty of this you could have had me long ago"—he said "I thought it was all blown over"—it was well known in the neighbourhood about the other two being convicted—I did not say at the station "I don't know whether I can get enough evidence against him," nor did I say so to Mr. Cooke—I asked for a remand on the first occasion to get the prosecutor—it was police evidence on the last trial exactly the same as now—when I took Kenealey he said that it was a man named Jerry Wise who was with him—Kenealey had complained of me to the Commissioners about an inquiry which I had with him before his arrest.</p>

I am a plasterer, of 1, Leigh Terrace, Upton Manor—on Good Friday I was on Wanstead Flats, watching a fight in a crowd—I lost my watch; the chain was left hanging—the bow of the watch was broken—I gave information to the police—on being sent for I went to the police-station—I was shown this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—in April last I was living at Ormeston House, Walthamstow, the prisoner lived next door to me about six years ago, and I knew him and his family—on 16th April my servant was out, and my nephew, Jefferies, was at, home—he usually goes out about 7.20 p.m. and returns at 9 o'clock, but on that evening he returned about ten minutes after he went out, and he and I were at supper in the front parlour about 8.30—I heard a loud knocking, and he went to the dour—I heard talking in the passage, and went out and saw the prisoner—I did not recognize him at first, but I did afterwards—I said to my nephew "What does that young man want?"—the prisoner said that he had come from the coffee-shop in Selby Road, that he was in a box there, and heard two men say "We are going to have a job to-night at Mrs. Sutherland's in Milton Road," and that hearing my name mentioned he thought it right to come and let me know—I said that I was very much obliged—I then said "Why, you are young Branch"—he said "Yes"—he was asked to wait—he appeared excited, and said that he had run all the way on purpose to tell me—he then said "There they are at the back"—there is a door at the back—I went there with my nephew, and he followed—I heard no noise and saw nobody—he then came and sat</p>

               <p>down, and had a glass of beer—I said "Never mind, let them come"—he then said that he heard them again—my nephew rushed out, but there was nobody—the prisoner then said "Stop, stop, I can see them"—I could see nobody—my nephew went into the greenhouse, but there was nobody there—we then went into the kitchen, and my nephew was open<lb/>ing the kitchen door, about three feet from the prisoner, when I turned round and saw the prisoner with a revolver in his hand, pointing it at my nephew's head, and before I could scream I saw a flash and beard a report—my nephew said "I am shot, and I have lost my eye, and this boy has done it"—I rushed to the front of the house, and turned round and saw the prisoner following my nephew with the pistol again—I called "Murder!" and "Thieves!" and he went out the back way and escaped—my nephew was bleeding very much from the face—I got assistance, end he was taken to the hospital.</p>

               <p>hall opposite the stairs, the prisoner did not go there to get his hat—I can say that although I was standing at the door crying "Thieves"—when my nephew was hit the prisoner did not put his hand to his head and say "Good God, what have I done," I may have said so before the Magistrate—the pistol was 9 or 10 inches from my nephew's head—I told my nephew that I had seen two suspicious persons about the house a little while before the prisoner was sitting there, but I don't know whether he heard that—I may have said before the Magistrate "I did not tell him I had seen suspicious characters watching the house," I had seen none—I don't know which hand the prisoner held the revolver in—there has been no ill feeling between us—I know nothing about the boy.</p>

I am a builder's foreman, of Walthamstow—on Saturday, 24th of April, I was playing at cricket on a piece of ground near Musk House—I had to go after a ball, and at the edge of a pond I picked up this revolver—it was lying on some leaves, it was not wet—I gave it to Inspector Glass.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was loaded, and one barrel was discharged—I kept it more than a fortnight—I read the report in the newspaper of this case, but had not heard that the police were searching for the pistol—it was four or five yards from the path, under a tree.</p>

Have you a bad one?"—Mr. Tabra said "Yes"—I said, "I have just had one in my shop; I have a good mind to give you in charge"—Mr. Tabra sent for a constable and gave him in charge—the sixpence I had was broken, I sent it to the station; these are the pieces—I lost eight of the man that tendered the coin—the other two went on down the road separately.</p>
