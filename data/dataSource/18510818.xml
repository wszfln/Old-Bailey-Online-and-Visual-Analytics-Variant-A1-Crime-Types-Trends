About three months ago, I took the prisoner before a Magistrate—he was bound over, and was impri<lb/>soned eight weeks all but three days, and was let out at my request—when he came out I was still living in the house—I lived with him for a fortnight afterwards—he was always threatening my life, and took a room not far off—he asked me to wash his shirt, and said he would pay, me for it the same as he would any one else—he came for it on Sunday morning, 3rd Aug., about 6 o'clock—I opened the window, and he stood in the road, and asked me for it—I said, "If you wait a minute I will bring it you down-stair"—he said, "I do not want it now, by-and-by will do"—I said I would send it—he said if I did not bring it myself he would not pay me for it—I took it to him about 10—his mother was there—the prisoner said, "Bring it in"—I took it in, and placed it on a box which was standing there—I stood talking to his mother I think twenty minutes—he asked me to make a fire and cook him and his mother some dinner, that she might get back by the 2 o'clock train—I did so—I went into the back-room for some potatoes, and the prisoner followed me—his mother had just gone out at the door—he asked me if I was going to stop at home—I said, "I am not"—he said, "I will cut your b——y head off, you b——r"—there was a bill-hook lying on the floor, and he took it up and struck at me with it—I put my hands up to save my bead, and he cut my fingers all across—here are the three scars now—he struck me a second blow on the head with the bill-hook, and my head bled a great deal—he tried to prevent me, but I got out of the house, met the police, and gave him in</p>

I had frequently seen the prisoner at my house for eight or ten days before 22nd July—he always had another man with him, always the same man—I did not see that man on 22nd July, I was up-stairs—when the prisoner came on other occasions, he always called for ale; and on 19th July he wanted some cheese; I told him I bad none—he turned to his companion, and said it was a pity, for if they smelt of ale before dinner, it would be a bad example to the young clerks—the other man said it would—the prisoner turned again, and asked if I had not got a small piece—I said I had not—he knew that I was alone—on 22nd July I was up-stairs, dressing—I heard the bell ring; I came</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in the Minories. On 22nd July, I went to the Horse and Trumpeter, a little before 4 o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner came in, and with him a tall man, with mustachios—they called for a pint of ale—the prisoner poured it out, and they drank it, and chatted together, and the tall man said, "By-the-bye, I have got an appointment with Johnson," or "Jackson"—the prisoner said, "It is too late now; you can write him a note"—they then called for another pint of ale, and the tall man wanted some Stilton cheese—some cheese was brought, and the tall man found fault with it, and said it was not Stilton—the landlord said it was—there was some contention; and I said, "You cannot expect to have Stilton cheese at a house of this description"—the tall man kept continually going in and out—there was a conversation about smoking—the tall man said he often wished he could smoke a pipe—he then rang, and ordered a cigar—the waiter brought it him, and just as he was leaving, the tall man said, "I will go and choose one myself—that was after he had gone to write the letter—there was nothing else called for after that—I should say about three pints of ale had been called for at separate times—the prisoner and his companion appeared to know each other; they drank together, and chatted together—after the tall man went to get the cigar, he came in and lighted it, and took two or three whiffs—the landlord then came in, in a great agitation, and said, "Come, come!"—I left the prisoner in the parlour, and went and took hold of the landlord, and said, "What is the matter?"—I saw the prisoner again in about two minutes; I stopped him in going out—he said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "You know what is the matter"—he was given into custody.</p>

I said that is not the way to Waterloo-road—he said he was going over London-bridge to it—I asked him his master's name—before replying he endeavoured to look over the off-side—I prevented him, and he said, "Well, it is no business of yours? I shall not tell you?" I told him I should take him into custody on suspi<lb/>cion of stealing the horse, cart, and meat—he said I might do so if I liked, but I should find it all right—I took it to the station, and then found the owner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">sub<lb/>mitted that, as the prisoner's wife, her evidence was not receivable. He admitted that if it was clearly established that she was the sister of the prisoner's first wife, that would invalidate her marriage, and so admit her testimony; but he contended that that was not shown to be the case; her mere statement that she called her "sister" was not enough; nor would the reputation of relationship apply in a criminal case: the best evidence was that of the parents, in the absence of which he contended the evidence should be excluded.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">was questioned on the voir dire with a view to raise an objection to her compe<lb/>tency as a witness, she might also be examined, to remove that primd facie ground of objection, of being the prisoner's wife, by showing that her marriage was void, and did not create the relation of wife to the prisoner: that being so, the compe<lb/>tency of the witness was established to show that the prisoner had been before married. Then came the question, was she competent to prove that she was sister to the former wife? In his opinion, although seven years younger, she was competent to prove that relationship: there was no rule of law requiring that it should be established by that which would be demonstration, namely, by the testimony of persons present at the birth. The witness was then sworn, and examined as follows:</hi>—The prisoner Muzzall left me in May last—he stayed away from me a week—at the end of the week he returned—in consequence of what passed between us, I then went into the service of Mr. Thomas Var<lb/>den—I am in his service now—whilst I was living with Muzzall, he was in the service of a person of the name of Sharland, an attorney, at Gravesend; he was also in the employ of the postmaster at Gravesend—in Sept. last, Muzzall brought two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes to me, and asked me to change them—I asked why he did not change them himself—he said he had his reasons for it—I said I would not change them—about a week after, he again asked me to go to London and change them—I asked why he did not do it himself—he said they were <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young's, and he did not like to—I told him there was something wrong, or else <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young would have changed them himself—he asked me if I would change them if he told me where he got them from—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You don't mean it"—I said, "Yes, I do"—he then said that <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young had taken them out of a letter that was posted at Bitterne, near Southampton, and that it was directed to the Gravesend post-office till called for—I asked him what there was in the letter—he said, two tens and a five—I told him I would not change them, and told him to take them to <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young, and tell him to send them back to the person they belonged to—he said he should not be such a fool as that—I afterwards saw the notes in his waistcoat pocket in the bedroom; that was about a week before the post<lb/>master's house was searched—he was then at the office—they were two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes—I looked at them—they were dated June, 1850—I think Muz<lb/>zall came home about 7 o'clock that night; I do not know—it was in the evening—he came home to dinner—I told him what I had seen, and where; and when he came home at night he told me to put them away—that was the night that the postmaster's house was searched; he told me to put them away, as they might come and search his—I asked what I was to do with them; if I was to burn them—he said no, he wanted <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young to have them, and he told me to take them to <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young in London—next morning I went to London, and took the two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes with me—I took them to a house at Shepherd's-bush—I found Young there, and gave him the notes—he said, "All right"—I then returned to Gravesend—I have since been to the house at Shepherd's-bush with Peak—I pointed out the house to him—it was in Cambridge-terrace—I cannot recollect the number—a short time after I had taken the notes to Young, I saw Muzzall with two sheets of postage-stamps—I asked him where he got them—he said <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young had changed the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, and brought him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of stamps, and kept the remaining 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Tabernacle-square, Shoreditch. On Saturday, 26th July, I saw the deceased Betsy or Elizabeth Leaf at I, Luke-street, Shoreditch—I did not know her before—I found her in a dying state, and she died soon afterwards—she was senseless when I saw her—the prisoner was there—he said, "I struck her, and knocked her down," or, "I struck her, and she fell down"—he said she had produced a knife, or had a knife about her, or attempted to use a knife—I saw marks of violence on both her cheeks, more especially on the left cheek—I do not think that could hare been done by one blow—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the following Wednesday, July 30th, assisted by Mr. Davis—I found all the organs in a healthy state, except the brain—there was congested blood on the left side of the head, and considerable swelling, some marks of lividity and bruises on the right and left cheek—there was coagulated blood in both nostrils and in the mouth, and three ounces of blood extravasated on the brain on the left side, sufficient to cause death—the other portion of the brain was in a healthy state—I attribute her death to extravasations of blood on the brain, produced by violence—it might have been from a blow combined with a fall.</p>

                  </hi>. I was barman in the service of Mr. Walker, who keeps the Duke of Cambridge. I lived in one of his other houses at the west-end for fifteen months—I had been at the Duke of Cambridge about a month before the prisoner was apprehended—when I went there, the prisoner was barman—one afternoon, about a fortnight before he was apprehended, we were both in the bar, and happened to be talking about the house where I had lived before in Mr. Walker's service—the prisoner asked me if I thought my fellow-servant up there ever took anything from the till—I said I could not exactly answer the question, but I believed that the last servant who lived with me would not have been particular, if he had stopped there long—the prisoner said, "Why should we work and slave ourselves for nothing, and not be paid for it?"—he then said, "If we put our heads together, we might get a sum of money each for ourselves in a few months"—I objected to the proposal, and said it would be sure to be found oat—I ultimately agreed to the proposal—he said, "It will be sure not to be found out, for I will secrete it where no person will find it"—after long persuasion, I agreed to taking money from my master's till—there was nothing said about the share that I was to have of it—about a week after, I rather objected to its going on further—on the day after the first conversation, I saw him about ten o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing take some money from the till—he then took the glass-cloth and the counter-cloth out to wring, and put the money in his pocket—he had the money under his hand—the glass-cloth was over his right hand, and the counter-cloth in his other hand—he had the glass-cloth in his hand at the time he took the money, and he covered it over his hand directly—he went out, and returned in about two minutes—he told me he had taken two shil<lb/>lings, and he said, "I have it here," pointing to his pocket—the same after<lb/>noon, I saw him take money in the same way from the till, and he put it in his pocket in the same way, by taking the cloths outside—he told me he put the money in his pocket—the next time was in the evening; he took money</p>

               <p>in the same way—T could not see what he took—he told me he had taken money, and told me the sum, but I forget—between then and 24th July, I saw him at my master's till four or five times every day—he took money from the till in the way I have explained—I think four or five days after is commenced he told me—"I have the money all safe that I have taken; I have got it in the cellar"—about a, week after it commenced, I asked him if he could let me have a few shillings; I believe I said ten shillings; and he said, "Here is a pound for you"—he went into the cellar and fetched it, and gave it me—I was in the back-kitchen when I asked him, and from there I could see the entrance to the cellar; I saw him go, and he returned, and gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.'s-worth of silver, wrapped in brown paper—it was different kinds of silver; I believe there were two half-crowns amongst it—on the day previous to his apprehension I went out for a holiday, and on that day, about 9 o'clock in the morning, he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, wrapped up in brown paper, the same as the other—I did not ask him for it, but he said he would go and fetch it—I was in the bar, and he went down and fetched it up—he said, "That is half the money I have taken," or, "that I have got"—I took the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and went to my brother-in-law, who keeps the King's Head in Belvedere-road, Lambeth; his name is Hodson—I told him the circum<lb/>stance, and he went to Mr. Walker's—I stopped in his house while be went.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Duke of Cambridge, in Whitecbapel-road. The prisoner was my barman—I think he came into my service on 29th May—I agreed with him, as I had with the barman previously—he was to have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the first month; if I did not like him, I was to give him a week's warning—I was to give him a week's wages in advance—he had his board and lodging—when the month was up, he asked me on what terms he was going on; I said, "You shall go on another month on the same terms"—he had received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me in the whole—when he came to me, he said he had lived with a person named Clark three months previously—he said his money was nearly exhausted, he could not live on air; and if I did not employ him, or he could not get another situation, he intended to bring an action against his former master for defamation—Grapes was in my service—the prisoner would have access to my till, as all my barmen have—there was money of all kinds in the till—the prisoner got up at half-past four o'clock in the morning—after he had been there some time, I got up early one morning, and saw him take the money out of the small till—he turned it out on a small recess, and examined the sixpences and shillings all minutely, to see if they were marked—he afterward replaced them in the till—he put them all in, as far as I know—I saw him do that on two mornings—on the evening of 23rd July a person named Hodson came to me—I found him at my house about ten—I had never seen him before—I knew Grapes was brother-in-law to a person of that name—Mr. Hodson made a communication to me, and on that I lighted a candle, and took Mr. Hodson and my son, and examined my cellar—I put my band between two joists on a large beam in the bar-cellar, and found a package of silver wrapped in brown paper—I opened it, and counted it—there was exactly 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in different coins—Mr. Hodson and I went <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the station—I got the assistance of two officers—we examined the cellar—I showed them the place where I found the package, and I found another package, which I think I gave to them—I examined more minutely, and there was another package—two of them contained 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of silver, and the other 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I marked the contents of the packages, and delivered them to the policemen—they took down the marks, and wrapped the packages up again—they put the money back—the officers were placed in the cellar about four in the morning of 24th July, and they brought the prisoner to me between eight and nine—he was searched in my presence, and the officers took from his pocket a bag containing 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—I saw the three packages of silver taken from him, and some loose silver besides—the packages were opened in my presence, but I did not examine them, because they had all marks outside the packages, and they were in the same manner wrapped up—I said to the prisoner, "You have been robbing me this long time, I have found you out at last"—he said, "I have been completely inveigled into it"—I said, "Who inveigled you?"—he said, "That makes no matter"—I had missed money previous to 24th July—I had found my takings were short; and when I and my mistress went out together, which is very seldom, there was invariably from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. less than what we ought to have.</p>

I live in Elliott-square, in the Old Bailey—I was at the Noah's Ark, about half-past 7 o'clock in the morning on 19th July—I saw the two pri<lb/>soners in front of the bar—I was smoking my pipe, and Carlisle winked his eye at me—I took no notice, but presently I heard Mr. Cridland say, "You have robbed me"—I saw him try to seize Carlisle's band—his band was not in the till then; it was towards the top of the counter—he said, "You have robbed me," or, "The money came out of the till" or something to that effect—I saw Carlisle pass money to his right-hand, and pass it to Condon, and there was a sixpence dropped—the money was then put on the counter—I took the sixpence up, and marked it—I said, "It is a shame for a man to be robbed like that;" a short time before, Condon had asked me if I had any tobacco—I said I had not much, but I would give him the means of getting it, having seen him before—he said he had no money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Carlisle. Q.</hi> Will you swear that you saw me give him some money out of my hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; out of your right-band—during the time you dropped the sixpence—I saw your hands go to each other—I got the sixpence from the counter, where you dropped it in passing the money to him—I was at the door when the policeman came—I did not hand him the sixpence; I took it to the station—you did not appear to me to be very drunk; you might have had a pint or two of beer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Condon. Q.</hi> Where was I standing when Carlisle had his hand over the bar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the side of me—my back was to the door, and you were on my side—I had not been drinking with you all night—I did not hear 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of gin called for—I showed the sixpence to you both when I bad marked it—I did not bite it when the inspector asked me where it was.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 327.) I was called to take the prisoners—the landlord charged them with robbing the till—I took them to the station, and searched them—I found on Carlisle two half-crowns, two shillings, two sixpences, and two pence; and on Condon, one half-crown, three shillings, two sixpences, and one penny in different pockets of his coat, the same coat he has on now—Carlisle had the money in his waistcoat-pocket,—I got this sixpence from Mayes—it is marked by a bite of the teeth, and it is bent—Condon appeared sober—Carlisle appeared to be drunk; but it is hard to tell, because parties very often sham drunkenness—he appeared to stagger a little; but when he got to the station, he could answer the questions put to him very well, like a lapwing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Carlisle.</hi> I never had a waistcoat on; I only had this waistcoat that I have on, brought here last Thursday. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I cannot swear it was that waistcoat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Carlisle's Defence.</hi> The money found on me belonged to myself; I worked hard for it for a long time; it was my right-hand that was over the bar to get a light for my pipe; I had no money in my hand; all I had was in my right-hand, which I put on the counter; if this man marked the sixpence, why did he not hand it to the policeman when he came to the house? it is mere spite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Condon's Defence.</hi> I went in the house that morning, and met the witness and another man; Carlisle was not there then; they asked me to drink, which I did; after their pint was out, I paid for another pint, and so it went on till half-past 6 or 7 o'clock; I went to sleep, and Carlisle took this money out of my pocket; I thought I had more than the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which he had got; he said, "All right; we will have a drop of gin;" I said, "No, I have had enough to drink;" I was then talking with the witness about a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> he had had in Stonecutter-street.</p>

I said, 'I think I do, I am going to see if a vessel is going to Guernsey,' and they asked me if I was coming back again, and I said, 'Yes, as soon as I have been down, if the vessel is going;' and I found there was no vessel going; they asked me if I would take anything to drink; I said, I did not mind at no vessel was going; they said they were going to Limehouse, and we went together to a public-house, just over Tower-hill, in a narrow street; one went away, and the other asked me if I would give him two sovereigns for some silver, which I did, and soon after that the other man came in again; we had three or four pints of half and half together, and they asked me to stop for them as they were going on towards Limehouse, which I did for some little time; I fell off to sleep, and when I awoke up I did not see them, and I was that stupified I did not know where I was, and I do not know anything about the money, or how it came into my possession; I never had a key turned on me in my life." <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of No. 11, Great St. Andrew-street. On 27th July, I was in Long Acre about half-past 11, or 25 minutes to 12 o'clock, standing at the corner of Mercer-street—the prisoners came up from St. Martin's-lane, and turned down Mercer-street—when they got to the bottom of Mercer-street they stopped and looked round—I then saw Mr. Day twelve or thirteen yards from me, coming towards me and them into Mercer-street—he passed them, and then they turned round and looked at him; they followed him, and he looked round—one went up on his right side, and the other behind him—I saw them put their hands up, and take hold of him by the neck—they both had hats on—they were about 100 yards from me up the street—they were some distance from the public-house at the corner—as they put their hands on him, they all three went down together—the prisoners got up; they walked some distance, and then ran away down Castle-street towards St. Martin's-lane—I went and found Mr. Day lying on his back with his legs cocked up—his face looked quite black, and tears were running down his cheeks; he could not speak for about a minute—I helped him up, and called for a policeman—two constables and a sergeant came, and he com<lb/>plained of having been robbed of a watch and chain, and described two men dressed in black—I knew the prisoners before they were put in gaol—I have known them thirteen or fourteen months—I used to see them every night at the Dials, when I was in the police—I saw no other man in the street on this night—a man named Wallis was before the Magistrate, and was discharged.</p>

I know Kelly—I heard on Tuesday, 29th July, of his being taken into custody on this charge—on the Sunday before that Tuesday he was at my place—from half-past 1 o'clock in the day till half-past 1 in the morning he never left my company—he dined with me at about 20 minutes to 2, at my house—we remained at home till 5 in the afternoon, and then went to a friend's house, named Fitzgerald, at Smart's-buildings, Holborn, where there was a chris<lb/>tening—Mrs. Fitzgerald was there, and Mrs. Old ham, her mother—I remained there with Kelly till about 11 o'clock—we then went out together to see some friends part of the way home—there was me, Mrs. Fitzgerald, Mrs. Oldham, her husband, Kelly, and two friends—we went as far as the Seven-dials—we went and had a glass of something to drink together—we then parted with the two persons we went with, and returned to Mrs. Fitzgerald's house, and remained there till about half past one—Kelly was in my company all the time—I left him there—I heard on the Tuesday of his being taken.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 296). I was on duty on 2nd July, in St. Pancras-road, at a place called Cook's-row—I had heard complaints made about persons obstructing the footpath there, and had received directions from my superiors about keeping it clear—about 7 o'clock that evening, I saw the prisoner and another sitting on the footpath there—I said to the prisoner, "Get up <hi rend="italic">Tush</hi>, and go away"—that was the nickname I knew him by—the other person got up, and went away—the prisoner said, "I shall not get up for you, you black b—r"—I had told him several times before to get up—I had told him so that afternoon—I told him he must get up, and he said, "I shan't get up for twelve such b—rs as you"—he then got up, and put him<lb/>self in a lighting attitude—a traveller who was in Mr. Blunt's, a grocer's shop, came out, and said to him, "What are you doing? the policeman is only doing</p>

Their stores are in Castle-street East, Oxford-street, and their horses stand at Mr. Woolley's stables in the next street—on 12th July, I saw Noble, who is one of their carmen, come out of Mr. Woolley's stable in Titchfield-street, driving a cart of Messrs Fosters', which had their name on it, both in the front and at the side—he drove to Beasley's shop in Well-street—it is a milk-shop and old bottle-warehouse—I followed—he got out of the cart, took out a large hamper containing twenty-seven bottles, and put it down on Beasley's premises—his premises are entered by a private gateway, and the shop is a small projection some little way down the gateway—Beasley was at the time looking through the little window of the milk-shop—he could from that position very easily see the cart in the street, and see Noble put down the hamper in the archway; after Noble had pot down the large hamper, he went back to the cart, took a small basket out, and put it down by the side of the other—I saw Beasley at the time the small basket was put down—he was looking through the milk-shop window—Noble looked at Beasley, and Beasley nodded to him just as he was going away—Noble then was getting on the cart, when I stopped him—I said, "Where did you get those bottles from?" pointing to those under the archway—he made no answer, but looked amazed—I said, "I must take you into custody on a charge of stealing these from your master"—he said, "Don't do that; it is the first time I ever did such a thing in my life"—from the position in which the cart stood with reference to the archway, Beasley could see the name of Foster on the cart—it was exactly opposite the window; I should think six or seven yards from it—I took possession of the hampers—one contained twenty-seven bottles, and the other twelve—I took Noble to Mr. Foster's—I returned to Beasley in twenty or twenty-five minutes—I found him at home—Mr. Foster, who was with me, asked him if he had been in the habit of buying bottles of his man, and if he had bought any that morning—he said he believed Noble had left some there, but he was not in the way—I do not think Noble's name had then been mentioned—Mr. Foster asked if he had bought any of his other carmen—he said he did not know them—I asked if he had any of Mr. Foster's baskets on the premises—he said, "You are welcome to look."</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, as bottled ale and porter-merchants; our counting-house is in Brook-street. Noble has been our carman rather more than six months—we have two other carmen—they drive separate carts, which have the name of our firm on them in letters about the length of my finger—they are hot exactly similar—it was Noble's duty, when he took out articles to customers, to bring back empty bottles—when in consequence of business the carmen did not return till after business hours, I told them to take the baskets and bottles round to Mr. Woolley's stables, and we would unload them in the morning—that has been the habit for some time, whenever they came in late—that happened to be the case on the night of 11th July—when Noble came back, I desired him to take the cart and baskets to the stable, as it was too late to unload them after taking the account of what he had brought, from his own lips—next morning I was at the cellars at 8 o'clock, my usual time, and Noble was brought in custody about half-past eight by the policeman, who had been employed by our firm to watch our carmen—we had before that missed bottles; in taking oar stock we found great deficiency—the officer said, in Noble's presence, that these two baskets were what he had delivered at Beasley's—I said to Noble, "Henry, whatever is this?" he said, "O, it is a mistake, Sir"—"A mistake," I said—he said, "It is the first time, Sir, I ever did such a thing; I must go down on my knees to you, and beg of you for the sake of my wife and family to look over it"—I said, "This is a dreadful thing, Henry"—he said, "I must go down on my knees to you," he kept repeating that over and over again—he said, "I hope you will not lock me up, I never did such a thing before"—I said, "Why, you did it yesterday"—he said, "Me, Sir, Lord bless you, it is quite a mistake"—I said, "You don't know that the police have been watching you for some time, and saw you do it?"—he said, "I assure you, Sir, it is the first time I ever did such a thing in my life"—I counted the bottles in the cart, there were twenty-five dozen, and one, not including the thirty-nine which had been taken to Beasley's—Noble had repre<lb/>sented to me the night before, that his cart contained twenty-six dozens—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185108180066"/>
               <p>I have the entry here in his own hand-writing to three different customers—here is eight dozen, twelve dozen, and six dozen—after this I went with the officer to Beasley's—I have known him for some time—he carries on the business of a bottle-merchant, and has a shop where he sells milk—I had been to his premises before—there is a room some distance up the gateway which projects across the gateway—the room has three windows—Beasley was it home when we went—I believe he came up from the lower-part of the yard towards the archway—we met him—I think the officer spoke first, he called out loudly, "Mr. Beasley," and he appeared—I said to him, "Have you bought any bottles of our carman this morning"—he said, "I don't know but I believe he has left some, for I was not in the way at the time"—I said "How came you to buy bottles of a man that was our carman?"—" O," be said, "I used to deal with him when he was in business on his own account"—I said, "But you knew he was our carman"—he said, "Only lately"—I think I asked him how many times he had bought bottles of him—(I believe I first mentioned the name of Noble to him—I am certain I mentioned the name)—he said two or three times—I asked if he had bought bottles of any of the other carmen, and he said, "No, I don't know them"—when I asked Beasley whether Noble had left any bottles that morning, he said he was not in the way—the officer said to him, "Why I saw you, and you nodded to him"—Beasley said, "Saw me! why I have not been out of doors this morning"—the officer said, "I suppose you don't call this out of doors"—(we were then through the archway, just in the open air)—he said, "I tell you I have not been out of doors this morning; I have only just comedown-stairs; I have been ill nearly all night"—it was then about nine o'clock—I saw him shortly afterwards at the station—he was sent for, and the inspector said, "You are charged with receiving these bottles, knowing them to be stolen"—he said, "I know nothing about their being stolen"—I do not remember that he said anything more—I afterwards searched the stable, in company with the officer; in one of the stalls we found a sort of well with an iron grating over it, and in that we discovered seventeen bottles in some straw—I examined the bottles which had been left in the archway at Beasley's, and two of them had my name on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It is not uncommon for bottles with your, labels to find their way to other houses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—Beasley has said through<lb/>out that he had been ill that morning, which kept him from coming down so soon as usual—he told the Magistrate he had taken castor-oil—the officer said to him, "We shall expect you to attend at Marlborough-street, at ten o'clock"—he said, "I will, if I can"—I did not give him into custody; the acting-inspector did—the officer took him on his own responsibility, by the direction of his superiors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Noble.</hi> These two dozen of empty bottles are not Mr. Foster's; one dozen of them belong to his own man, who is now in his employ, of the name of Christopher. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I believe most positively that they are my bottles—two of them have my label on them—there was one occasion when there was something very suspicious in the book, where you received a quan<lb/>tity and only put down a certain number—you have been entrusted with money which has been found correct.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the public drawing-office of the Bank of England. On 9th July the prisoner came and presented this bank post-bill for payment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a seven-days' bill, and was due when presented—there was a crowd round the counter, and I requested him in a general way to receipt the bill with his name and address—he went to a desk which is there for that purpose, and a few minutes after presented it again with the address on it—it now has, "Received the within amount; A. Churchill, 3, Park-place, New North-road"—the bill is endorsed payable to Allnutt and Arbouin, and that is signed, "Henry Bolton"—it occurred to me that the endorsement was not correct—the word "Bearer" is not distinct, and knowing Messrs. Allnutt's to be a London firm, my impression was that it should have come through a banker—I conferred with Mr. Hodgkinson, the principal of the office, and he came forward and asked the prisoner if it was his bill—he said he was sent by a party to receive the money—Mr. Hodgkinson asked him by whom he was sent—he said by a person in a coffee-house, in Bishopsgate-street, and that he was desired to write that person's name on it—Mr. Hodgkinson sent for an officer, and the prisoner immediately fainted—the officer came, took him to a private room, and I left him in his charge—I had not looked at the bill when I told him to receipt it—when I received it again, the receipt was apparently recently written—it is payable to Henry Bolton, or order.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Mary Ann-terrace, Abbey-street, Bethnal-green. I am a guard to the goods train, of the Woolwich Branch of the Eastern Counties Railway. On Monday, 7th July, between 11 and 12 o'clock in the day, I was on the engine coming towards the Barking-road on the main line—I was going to a siding to fetch coke, and was going quite slowly—there are two pairs of points there, which are to move the engine from the main line to a siding—they are moved by means of a lever—as I was approaching I saw the two prisoners at the points—I saw Upton having hold of the lever of the points, holding them open—it works in an iron box fixed in the earth, with a weight attached to keep them back in their proper place—to open them you have to shove the lever over—while Upton was holding it open, I saw Gutteridge stoop down looking as if dropping some<lb/>thing into the points—they saw my engine approaching—it would have had to go over the points on to the siding—I ordered my driver to stop, which he did immediately—if we had been going at the regular pace we could not have stopped—I and the under-guard went to the point, and there found this large stone (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it was on the chair, in between the tongue of the points and the outer rail—that would prevent the points from working—it kept it half open, and must have thrown the engine off, at whatever speed it had been coming—as soon as the prisoners saw my engine coming, they made off across the line, and got over the fence—I followed them—I came up with Gutteridge standing on a heap of dirt in the field—he spoke first to me, and</p>

               <p>said, "Why don't you take the right one?"—I said he was one, and I would have the other one before long—Upton made off—he was brought back by William Harvey, the point-teller—as I was taking Gutteridge to the station he said he should not have done it if it had not been for the other—I am sure Upton was the other.</p>

The prisoner and his wife lived in the next room to us—her name is Mary Ann—on 4th Aug., between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by a noise, and then beard the prisoner's eldest girl, who is eight years old, crying, and saying, "Pray, father, do let mother come down"—the girl then came and knocked at my door; and in consequence of what she said, I and my husband went into the room immediately—I saw the prisoner's wife hanging up, with a rope doubled over the cupboard door; her feet were about a foot from the ground; her body was swinging—the prisoner was sitting on the foot of the bed, about a yard from her—her hands were up to her neck, as if to keep the rope from hurting it—my husband lifted her up in his arms, and I took a knife and cut the rope—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my husband took her into our room, and laid her on the bed—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes she recovered, and burst out crying—the prisoner remained sitting on the foot of his bed all the time—when I first went in he was stooping, as if he was undoing his boots—I think he was in liquor—I went into his room, and said he was a good-for-nothing villain to hang the woman—he said the next time he did it he would do it effectually—I said he would have done it effectually now if it had not been for the cries of his children—a policeman took him away, and the woman went down with us to the police-office.</p>

The prisoner was in our service a week—on Sunday, 27th July, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I lent her a shawl to take my child out, and she did not come back—I found the child left in the court—I missed a gown in the evening—she was taken into custody on the following Thursday, and I found my gown on her.</p>

I am a Frenchman—I have been seven years in this country—on Wednesday night, 2nd July, about half-past 1 or a quarter to 2 o'clock, I was walking through the Haymarket, towards my home, and on getting into Brewer-street the prisoner and another man came up to me, kept me by the hand, and asked me "Which way you <hi rend="italic">go</hi>? how do you do?"—I said, "You are quite strangers to me, what do you want of me?"—he kept so tight hold of me, that I could not take my hand off—I did the best I could, took my hand out, and went away—they came after me, and the prisoner gave me a Mow in the head, which knocked me down—they kept me by the coat, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and the Apothecaries Company. I have been in practice about fifteen years—Wanstall, the husband of the witness, met me in the street on 17th July last, and asked me to come and look at a child that was dying in his house—I went, and it was just dead—I had seen the child about six weeks before—it appeared quite idiotic—I examined the body on the Sunday afternoon, after the death—externally there were no appearances; internally, the chest on the left side was filled with fluid, and the left lung was compressed—there was also a considerable layer of coagulated lymph around the walls of the chest—at the right side there were old adhesions, the result of former inflammation—in the stomach I found a small quantity of dark fluid of a gruelly appearance—that was merely the contents of the stomach—it might have been something he had taken—the stomach was inflamed, and the whole track of the intestines—I removed them from the body—I found the lower portion, particularly the rectum and that part, highly inflamed, and the mucous membrane was softened—in removing the intestines a quantity of dark fluid escaped from the cavity of the abdomen—some water also escaped between the rectum and the bladder—I gave my evidence before the Coroner, and by his order, on a subsequent examination, I removed the stomach and intestines, and conveyed them to Dr. Letheby—I also, by order of the Coroner, examined the head of the deceased—that was on the second examination—I found no appearances about the brain to account for death—I have had some experience of the composition-powder since this occurrence—I had no experience of it before—Bayberry and hemlock bark are not English herbs—they are said to be astringent—I can give no opinion about them—if an enema of a quarter of an ounce composed of valerian, lobelia, and composition powder were administered to this child, it would have the effect of a powerful stimulant—I have no means of judging whether they are irritants on the human subject—it would stimulate the part to which it was applied—it would stimulate the finger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose it was applied to a person labouring under diarrhoea, would it stimulate so as to increase that or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a difficult question to answer—it is likely to increase the quantity of blood to the part, whether it would relieve the diarrhoea or not is another question—what is meant by stimulating is increasing the action of the part, and bringing more blood to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Suppose the bowels will not act, what do you do? give opening medicine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A case of constipation may be treated in dif<lb/>ferent ways—you might give opening medicine—that is one of the modes of relieving constipation—that is done by increasing the action of the intestines—it is a stimulus—if the bowels did not then act, it would depend on circum<lb/>stances whether you gave more stimulus—you must point out a case—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185108180102"/>
               <p>object of opening medicine is to irritate the coats of the intestines, and by that means expel the feces—I cannot say whether the habit of taking aperient medicine constantly would affect the coats of the stomach, and render them liable to inflammation—I know that this injection is a powerful stimulus from my experience—I have had experience of it—I have applied it, the composition-powder, the lobelia, and valerian—I consider it dangerous—I have tried it on dogs—I found it to be a very powerful stimulus—it acted very powerfully on the bowels—I got the lobelia from Mr. Stephens—it is in the Pharmacopeia—it is used by doctors, but not generally—I know of no quarrel between myself and the prisoner—I heard of a meeting at which Dr. Coffin gave a lecture—I was not present—I remember the period when the cholera was raging in my neighbourhood—I do not know that this person's medicines were very generally taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know that there was a question before the vestry as to whether they should not be administered parochially? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard of vestry-meeting being called—I was present—I am not aware that there was a question raised as to whether these medicines should be used or not—I do not recollect speaking against their being used—I cannot say what I said—when I went on the Sunday to open the body of the child, I do not recollect whether I gave notice of my intention to the prisoner—I had the order of the Coroner—an inquest had not been summoned at that time—I got the order through the constable—I did not apply for it—he gave it me—that wit before the inquest was held—I examined the lungs—the left lung was com<lb/>pressed, and wholly useless—I did not say at the time I examined the lungs that I wondered how the boy bad drawn his breath at all, and that we need go no further, for that was enough—I said, "Here is disease"—I did not say we need go no further—I did not say the left lung was literally rotten; I said it was wholly useless—I did not say I wondered he could draw his breath at all—nothing of the kind—when I was before the Coroner, I recollect Mr. Stephens wishing me to be examined at once—I was not examined until the second examination—I had then had a talk with Dr. Letheby, and gave him the contents of the stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. Has a case ever come under your practice, of a person suffering from taking this medicine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never recollect a case. The object of my seeing Dr. Letheby was merely to analyze the stomach and its contents—I have not killed any dogs with this medicine, but very nearly; it had a most powerful effect—I have used the composition-powder as an external application—my assistant applied it to his knee in a case of rheumatism, and it produced an effect similar to a mustard poultice, it was so very powerful—I administered the lobelia in water to the dogs, and also the valerian and composition-powder; about a teacup-full.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much of the lobelia did you give? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a tea spoonful, and about the same quantity of composition-powder—I mixed them together and gave them—prussic acid is sometimes administered as medicine—I gave the dog the same dose as had been given to the deceased—it made the dog ill—I treated the dog the same as the boy—a tea-spoonful would weigh about a drachm, one-eighth of an ounce.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, a graduate of the University, and have been lecturer at the London Hospital many years I have more particularly directed my attention to the subject of poisons, and their effects on the human frame. I received from Mr. Garrett the intestines and stomach of a child—I examined them, and found them violently inflamed from one end to the other—I have heard the evidence in this case, and have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185108180103"/>
               <p>heard the physical character of the child described—it would require greater care in administering medicines to such a child as that, because it would not be likely to complain of injury so readily—I believe the inflammation was the cause of death—I have heard that the left lung was compressed—persons live for years with one lung—there might have been no disease of that lung at all; I did not see it—such a position of lung exists, but it might depend upon the manner in which the body was opened—I am not clear that there was that disease of the lung of which Mr. Garrett speaks; it might not have been—I bad a small package of composition-powder brought to me by Overton—I analysed it—that which I detected chiefly was ginger and cayenne pepper; the other parts were not capable of being recognised by chemical means—if that composition-powder were introduced into the body, it would tend to stimulate the intestines; and, if repeated, to irritate—I have not examined anything similar to the enema that was administered; but I examined the lower part of the gut, and there I found part of the composition-powder, and what I suspected to be part of the enema, lobelia—I am not able to say that it was lobelia—there is no positive test for lobelia; but as far as the micro<lb/>scope would guide me, I believe it to have been lobelia—the lower intestines, which lie between the rectum and the bladder, were very much more inflamed than the others; so much so, that they were nearly disorganised, nearly in a pulpy state, in the highest state of inflammation—lobelia, valerian, and com<lb/>position-powder mixed, however it was applied to an inflamed bowel, would increase the inflammation, and it would be the very worst thing that could possibly be applied—I am not prepared to say that it would produce the ex<lb/>treme inflammation I observed—a repetition of the composition-powder would no doubt produce inflammation—I do not think a single dose would produce it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would a single dose of composition-powder and lobelia mixed cause inflammation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it would cause inflammation sufficient to kill.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose any inflammation existed, would it increase it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; and it would be a very dangerous thing to administer—I have since made experiments with this powder; I applied it in the first place to my own mouth, to see whether it was possible to raise a blister by keeping it a little while in my mouth; and it created so much pain and irritation in the course of five minutes, that I was obliged to give it up—I then tried it on the back of the hand, and found it created irritation there—the irritation would increase according to the time it was in the bowels—when given to dogs it causes blood to pass from the bowels in the course of a very few hours—in my judgment, it would have the same effect on the human frame; I see no difference between the structures—some of it was produced at the Inquest, and was tasted by persons there—all the Jury complained of the pain it produced in their mouths—lobelia is an American plant—I have had some experience in this composition-powder on the human subject also; one case was at the hospital, and the other occurred in Rateliffe-highway, where I had an opportunity of examining the body after death, and found the same appearances as in this case, violent inflammation of the whole alimentary canal—the case at the hospital was about eight months ago—in that instance it was given by a disciple of Dr. Coffin's, named Trewbridge, who lives at Spital-square—I can pledge my oath to the fact that that person had had composition-powder—I did not see it administered; but from what I observed, and the history of the case, I can say that he had taken it—I did not find any in the stomach—the patient survived—in the other instance I did find it in the stomach.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185108180104"/>
               <p>how did you try it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Alone; I have tried it with spirit as well—I have never heard that the persons who apply it say that spirit, is the last thing it ought to be mixed with—I did not hear that at the Inquest—lobelia is a medicine that may be used under certain circumstances—it is spoken very highly of by medical men of great authority—it is mentioned in medial works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity did you put on your tongue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three grains; I weighed it—I found that a tea-spoonful was exactly one drachm—I was very careful in ascertaining exactly what quantity it weighed—I used an ordinary teaspoon—I put fifteen grains on the back of my hand, that was not mixed with spirit—it is always stated that lobelia should be administered with great caution, and on the best of evidence, that many deaths have arisen from its operation in America and in this country from the indiscriminate use of it.</p>

On 3rd July the deceased came to my house between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening with two others and called for a pot of beer—the prisoner came in about twenty minutes afterwards, and went into the tap-room—there were words between him and the deceased, but I was in the bar and did not bear them, they were quarreling—my husband called on the prisoner once or twice to desist from quarreling, and at last begged him to leave the house, which he did, and Kenton followed him—Kenton came back again at a few minutes past 8—he appeared sober, he had had a blow on the left eye—the prisoner came in again about a quarter-past 8, and went into the tap-room—I followed him, I refused to draw him any more beer, and desired him to leave the house—he appeared in liquor—he said he did not wish to make a disturbance in my house or any one else's—I put my hand to his shoulder and said, "Now, Marshall, leave the house directly, I will not have any disturbance here"—he left, and the deceased followed him in three or four minutes, and I do not think it was more than five minutes when I heard a disturbance—I heard the prisoner talking to Kenton when he was there the second time, but I do not know exactly what the words were.</p>

               <p>whether there was any blood on Marshall's face or not—I do not remember seeing any signs of blood about him, I could not say positively there was not—Mrs. Kenton's father (Atley) was there at the first commencement of the quarrel, sitting with them in the tap-room—there were words with him as well as with Kenton—I do not remember hearing Atley challenge Marshall to fight—he encouraged Kenton to fight—I heard him say, on his return the second time, that he had acted very foolishly and cowardly—after they had left and went out into the road I saw nothing more of them till I went to the door, just as Kenton fell, I asked his wife to come in—I do not remember seeing a child with the prisoner—he is a fishmonger—he had a tray of shell-fish with him, which he used to call with at my house of an evening—he appeared quite drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at New Brentford. I was called to see the deceased on Saturday evening, 6th July, between 7 and 8 o'clock—I found him insensible, and his breathing laboured—there was a bruise on the left eye—I sent him some remedies, and saw him again at 10, he was then in the same state—I saw him again on the Sunday morning, he was still in the same state, and appeared weaker—he was sinking—he died on the Sunday afternoon—I made a post-mortem examination—I found he had been bruised about the upper part of the chest and face, and there was bleeding from the left ear—I removed the scalp, and found that the parts beneath were a good deal bruised—the brain was a good deal congested, and inflamed at the back part—the substance of the brain was somewhat congested—on the base of the brain I found clots of blood, likewise blood on the surface of the brain, at the back-part—I should say the cause of death was inflammation of the brain, caused by the injuries at the back of the head—a blow, or a violent fall would produce it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cowkeeper, and live close by the Hope and Anchor. I know the prisoner, and knew the deceased. On Thursday evening, 4th July, about 7 o'clock, I was at the Hope and Anchor—I saw the prisoner come out of the house and go towards home—he was carrying a fish-tray in his arm, and had a child with him—Kenton followed him out directly, and when be bad got about ten yards from the house he crossed the road and stopped him from going on, and put himself in a fighting attitude, and trod on his toes—I cannot recollect what he said—the prisoner walked on his way home, and Kenton kept getting before him and stopping him—after be had been aggravated a great deal, Marshall said, "If you let me take my tray borne I will meet you at the bottom"—Kenton followed him—Marshall went away, and returned stripped, and both met together in a fighting attitude—there were not any blows in particular, it was merely a scrambling sort of concern, and falling—they had about two rounds, and then went back to the Hope and Anchor—I afterwards saw Kenton come out, be made a scratch in the road, and said, "Now come on"—Marshall said, "I am here;" and they fought, as near as I can say, about five rounds—Kenton being the heaviest threw Marshall four or five times—they mostly fell together—at the last round Kenton hit Marshall somewhere at the side of the head, and said, "There is one for you"—Marshall made a return hit, and Kenton fell on his back, and his head came to the ground—he was picked up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 7, King-street, Bethnal green. On 14th July, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was in Nichol-street, with my daughter, Sarah Bay—I saw the prisoner at the second-floor window of the house where he worked—whether my daughter called him down or not I do not know, but he came down—they went to words—I went away, and came back again—they were then having some beer together at a public-house, and were having some words—I prayed him to be quiet—he threw me down, and went away—I got up, and went into Nichol-street—my daughter called him down again, and aggravated him to great extremes—she had been living with him for three months—he came down, and kicked her, I think, on the side—I scolded him a little—I went away—she went back, and aggravated him—I got in the way, and he knocked me down, and kicked me on the right side of the head—it bled very much—I was taken to the hospital, and was there eight days.</p>

I positively deny having used the violence to the prosecutrix, never having on any occasion entertained the slightest idea of doing her any harm, although for the last four months I have had the greatest provocation from her; she has I been to my place, swearing at me, and calling my child a bastard, and has done everything to irritate me to violence, but I never resented it; on this day they compelled me to leave my work three times, and come down; her daughter rushed on me, and the prosecutrix called me disgusting names, and said I should not strike her daughter; she held me, and refused to let me go; in the endeavour to free myself from her, she accidentally fell, and in falling struck her head against the kerb; she was very drunk, and I used no violence to cause her to fall; on the part where the injury is inflicted she has an old wound, inflicted by her husband many years ago, and since her discharge from the hospital she has been constantly intoxicated; this prosecution has been got up entirely from malicious motives.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Guy, of 39, Saville place, Mile-end, in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney. On 21st July, I fastened the house up about 12 o'clock—I retired to rest about ten minutes-past 12—about half-past 1, I heard a noise like a drawer being lifted out of its place, and suffered to fall on the floor in the parlour—the servant came with the little girl, and I supposed I must be mistaken, but I afterwards. heard a noise again, and I heard a person pass my door as I judged, and go down-stairs—I had a light burning, and I opened the door and put it out, and returned to my room—I then heard the steps a second time—I awoke my husband, which I had tried to do before—I rang the bell violently, and opened the window—my servant came down, but she was frightened and went up again, and locked herself in her room—she is not here—she had been in my service about twelve months—I ran to the window, and shouted "Police!"—I bad opened my bedroom door, and saw a man pass me—it was perfectly bright and light—that was about ten minutes past 2—when I had lifted up the sash, I saw a man crouch down on the garden wall—my bedroom looks, to the back—I saw the man partly doubled up—my attention was drawn from that object by a rustling in the ivy, and a second young man jumped up, but he made a false step and fell—he got up again, walked a little way, and jumped on the wall and ran away—the figure and make of the second man was like Gurton, but I am not positive—I had seen Dear before, but I should say he was not one of those I saw in the back garden—I then went into the drawing-room—previous to going in I heard a rustling, and when I went into the room a man was just getting through the window, who I judged was Dear, but I am by no means positive—he got to a wall a few inches below the sill of the window—the policeman pursued him—I went down to my parlour, and found it in great disorder—the cellaret-drawer had been taken out, and was on the ground, which I suppose I had heard fall—I missed a pair of salt spoons, a sugar spoon, a caddy spoon, and one small tea<lb/>spoon which was not in the plate-basket, and was not taken up-stairs—the spoons only were taken off the premises—this teapot, candlestick, and other things were moved, but they were not taken—these are my spoons.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185108180114"/>
               <p>about 2 o'clock—I threw up the bedroom window, and looked oat—I saw one man jump on the wall with some difficulty, from the bottom of the gar<lb/>den—Gurton is the man—he was about ten yards from me—it was a clear bright night—I suppose he was in my view for five minutes—I saw him make his escape—he was endeavouring to get over the wall—it is a pretty good height—he made a mistake, but the second time he got over—I have not a doubt he is the man—I had a good view of his face—I do not remember that I had seen him before.</p>

I was on duty in the main road, on the night of 21st July—I saw Dear about half-past 12 o'clock—there were two others in company with him—one of them was a person named Jordan—I have very little doubt that the other was Gurton—two of them were standing talking near Mr. Guy's house—I passed them two or three times—about half-past 1, Dear, and the same two men passed up the Canal-road, about two minutes' walk from Mr. Guy's—I still could not get a tight of the third man—about half-past 2, I was standing close to Mr. Guy's—I heard the bell ring violently—I heard the Venetian blinds rattle—I looked in the direction, and saw the sash of the first-floor opened, and the blind thrown back—Dear came out—he stepped on the weather-board, and dropped into some enclosed ground, and I having two walls to clear and a fence, could not get him—I then heard screams from the back of the house—I climbed over the wall, and found the back-door open, and the parlour all in confusion—I went in pursuit of the prisoners, and about half-past 8 in the morning I was watching, and saw Dear go into his own house—I took him into custody—I told him I wanted him—he said, "What for?"—I said, "For committing burglary at Mr. Guy's"—I said, "You are the man that got out of the window"—he said, "You are wrong this time"—I could not be mistaken in him, I knew him too well for that—at the time he got out of the window I was getting over the palisades—his leg was very near my hand, and the lamp was full in his face—this dark lantern was found in the same direction he went—I did not find it.</p>

I am a boot-closer, and live at Pan ton-street, Haymarket About 1 o'clock on Saturday night, 2nd Aug., I went to St. James's Park—I then had three half-crowns in my right-hand waistcoat-pocket—I met Knowles in a few minutes—she put her arms round my waist and held me tight for a minute or two—I pushed her away, felt my pocket directly, and my money was gone—I accused her of picking my pocket—Miller then passed and asked what was the matter—she was not near enough to have taken the money—they walked away together—I pursued and gave them into custody—they were taken to the station and searched by a female—Miller said several times that she had only a shilling and a few halfpence in her pocket—the prisoners came back with the female searcher, who produced three half-crowns, a shil<lb/>ling, and some halfpence, saying she had found them on Miller—Miller then said to Knowles, "You must have put it there, for I know nothing of it"—Knowles said, "It is no use telling such lies as that"—the searcher is not here.</p>

On the morning of 17th July I was in bed with a woman in James-court, St. Ann's-lane, Westminster—we went to bed about 2 o'clock in the morning—I had seen Manning near the door with his back against the wall as I went in, and bare no doubt he is the man—he fetched a pot of beer before I went to bed, but I would not drink any of it—I had not been in bed a minute when I heard a noise at the window; it went up, and two men came in—the room is on the ground-floor, the bed is close to the window, the prisoners are the men—Ashby came in first, and Manning afterwards; they went to my clothes on the chair—I got out of bed and said I would not be robbed, a scuffle ensued; the door was unbolted either by them or by the girl, and another man came in—I called "Police!" and they cleared out of the room, the girl went out first, they had got my clothes in their hands—I got my breeches and leggings away from them—I was not in my uniform—I missed my waist<lb/>coat, which contained three half-crowns, one shilling, a fourpenny—<hi rend="italic">bit</hi>, and a handkerchief; also my braces—I have never seen my waistcoat since—this is my handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have had it two years—I call it dark brown—I had it in my pocket when I went into the room—I have no doubt the prisoners are the men—I ran after them—I was close behind Ash by when I got out of the door, and never lost sight of him till the policeman was in sight of him, who brought him back—he said it would not be above a <hi rend="italic">sixer.</hi>

The prosecutrix was brought there—she had an incised wound on the left hand, about two inches long, and half-an-inch deep, between the finger and thumb on the outside, the wound itself was not dangerous, but the consequences might have been so from her habits, erysipelas might have supervened—any wound that irritates certain nerves will produce locked-jaw, in particular cases—there is a popular error that a cut in that part is more likely to produce locked-jaw—I dressed the wound, and she has since been an out-patient—it was inflicted with a sharp cutting instrument, such as a knife—I think it was not likely to have been done by the edge of a cup; it is possible, but not likely—I found no particles of glass or earthenware in the wound—it was a clean incised wound, without a jag.</p>

On 25th July, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I was talking to a girl in New Gravel-lane, and a young man passed by, whom I took for my shipmate—he went into Leader's house, as I thought; so I went after him—I saw Barney at the door; and said, "There is a shipmate of mine inside"—she said there was not—a quarrel took place between us, and she took hold of me by the jacket and tore it, struck me on the eye and blacked it—I had not struck her—Leader then ran out of the house, caught me by the hair, and struck me several blows on the back of the neck—I was bleeding and wounded—Burney had nothing in her hands—there was no light there—I saw no weapon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired constable, and am now in the services of the Dublin Steam-packet Company. On Saturday afternoon, 26th July, I was at the main entrance to the Tower, and saw the prisoner and two others—I watched, and saw the prisoner twice put his hand into a gentleman's right-hand waistcoat pocket, and then pass his hands to his companions, who were covering him closely—I had seen him there the day before with the same parties, and saw him put his hand into a gentleman's pocket—the main entrance to the Tower is closed, on account of there being so many visitors, and they are let in 150 or so at a time, and this occurs at the gate, where the people are accumulated—after the congregation went in, the prisoner moved away—I saw them all three in company an hour or an hour and a half—the prisoner asked me if he could get access to the Tower—I told him he could in a few minutes, but he did not go in when he could—he went away over Tower-hill, and came back in a quarter of an hour, and his two companions shortly after—he then took an orange out of his pocket, and placed his hand into another gentleman's pocket, while his companions were looking down, as if there was something to be seen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer and surveyor. on Friday, 25th, I was on Tower-hill; and in consequence of what Stebbing said to me, I noticed the prisoner standing by the sentry-box—he was then joined by another man, and I stood behind them—he then leaned on a gentleman's left shoulder, and moved his left hand towards the gentleman's left-hand pocket—I did not see him put his hand in—he remained so about a minute, then turned round, pulled an orange out of his pocket, began peeling it very violently, and <hi rend="italic">nudging</hi> his companions with his foot—his companions then came and asked me when the Tower would be opened—I said I had no idea; doubtless in a few minutes—he said he had been waiting an hour, and could not get in—I said the gate had been opened frequently in the hour—they moved away—in about two minutes the gates were opened, and the people rushed in, but those two went towards Tower-street—I spoke to the gentleman into whose pocket I saw the prisoner put his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and am the prisoner's sister; I live at 28, George-street, Woolwich. On 17th July he and his wife came to my house—he appeared very ill, and very excited—when I was removing the tray there was a radish in the slop-bason—he seemed very unhappy about it, and grasped at it—he said, "You should not drown that; it is life it is blood; you must not drown it"—he removed the bason from him, and became very faint—I took off his coat, and procured water for him—he removed nearly all the things in the room, and talked to some of them; I could not understand what he said; he frequently ejaculated, "Oh, God!—I do not know what is the matter with me! I feel very ill; I feel something creeping up my arm"—he pulled his shirt-sleeve up to show us, but there</p>

               <p>was nothing there—he said he felt it creeping through him till it came to his head—he put a dress of mine over a chair, and an apron, and then muttered to it something which I could not understand—he talked to a pair of shoes, and took them up and moved them several times—seeing him in that state, I got him into the garden—he was without his coat—he watered the garden with a mug—I gave him a watering-pot—he shuddered at it, objected to use it, and said I should not have offered him that, because it was red—he once went with my little girl to Church, her Prayer-book had a red cover, he took it from her in the Church, and told her she should not bring such things there—he complained of his arm several times—I examined it, and rubbed it for him, but could see nothing—he said he felt too unwell to go home, and wished to stay there, and lay on the floor—I said he must lie in a bed if he staid; his wife said it was not convenient to stay, but he could do so if he pleased—he said he preferred to go home with her—I do not believe he knew right from wrong at that time.</p>

On 18th June, about 10 o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing, the prisoner called on me—I was not on very intimate terms with him—I let him in—he said I was the very gentleman he wanted to see—I was engaged registering a death, and said, "Sit down; I will attend to you pre<lb/>sently"—he sat down, and got up—I saw he was excited and uneasy—after I had done my business, I said, "What is amiss?"—he said he was very unhappy, he was afraid he had offended me and Mr. Newton, his father's executor—he had not offended me, or Mr. Newton that I know of—I said he had not offended me, and what I had done, was done with the best intention towards himself and his family, and I was sorry I had not accomplished my wishes—that related to my negotiating the sale of an estate belonging to his deceased father—I said, "Have you a holiday to-day?"—he said, no; he was very ill; had been to the dock-yard, and seen Dr. Bruce, who said he must go and place himself in the hands of his own medical attendant, as it was not an illness arising from his attendance in the dock-yard—he said he wished me to go over to Deptford to see his wife—I said, "What for?"—he said he knew I could make them happy and comfortable—I said, "Is there any difference between you?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Why should I go?"—he said, he did not know, he was sure I could make them all happy and comfortable again—I asked if he had been in any difficulty—he said, "No"—was he likely to lose his situation?—"No"—I said, I did not know what good I could do by going—he still urged it very much—I said, I could not possibly go, I was going off to town, and was so much engaged hot I would take an early opportunity of going over—he said, "How soon?"—I said, "In the course of two or three days, not this week; perhaps it will be on Wednesday"—he said, it was no use; he should not be alive</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-surgeon in the Infirmary of Greenwich Hospital.

               <p>found on the heart-side a small clot of blood, and slight abrasion of the part corresponding with the line of fracture—in the breast-bone there was also some inflammation in the heart-place—the left lung was extensively inflamed—that must have existed four, five, or six days—there was also evidence of previous inflammation of the lungs—in the cavity where the left lung is con<lb/>tained, there was from twelve to fourteen ounces of fluid; that was the result of inflammation—I found sufficient evidence of inflammation to account for death—there was also an effusion of water on the brain, resulting from in<lb/>flammation, probably coeval with the inflammation of the lungs—the appear<lb/>ances were such as might have been produced by one man stamping on the other's breast—in my judgment the immediate cause of death was inflamma<lb/>tion, which might have been caused by the wounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inmate of Greenwich Hospital. On Wednesday, 2nd July, I was in a court in the hospital yard—I saw the prisoner and Cave come through the archway—Cave called he prisoner a b—y b—r of a</p>

               <p>marine—the prisoner did not say anything to him—they came past me and Cave threw his jug of tea at the prisoner, and he threw the jug as well—the jug hit the prisoner on the breast, and it fell on the pavement—I saw a form in the yard—the prisoner might be about four feet from the form—I did not see Cave pushed on the form—I do not know whether he fell or the prisoner pushed him, but I saw him on the ground—he fell face downwards, and cut his lip—I heard the prisoner tell him if he would not strike him he would let him get up—Cave got up, and struck the prisoner again, the second time, at his breast—he was a shorter man than the prisoner, and older—the prisoner threw him down again, by taking him by the coat and waistcoat, and when he was down, I saw him put his knee on him, holding him with one hand and his knee on him—Cave got up again, and they went each of them to their different wards—they went away together—I did not see any blows struck at all, no further than Cave struck the prisoner twice—I should say Cave was not equal in strength to the prisoner—I did not know the prisoner well—I never heard his name before I went to the Coroner's Inquest—I knew Care for ten years—I never had any intimacy with him—I avoided his company; he was a false man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to Sir Charles Adams, the governor of Greenwich Hospital. On 2nd July, about half-past 6 o'clock, I was in the court-yard, at the back of my master's—I saw the prisoner and a shorter man walking towards me, side by side—they were having some very high worth—I could not distinguish the words—they were thirty or forty yards from me—I saw a form in the yard—I saw the prisoner give the shorter man a sudden push—I had not seen the shorter man do anything to the prisoner before he pushed him—the shorter man, Cave, had a jug in his band; and is consequence of that push, Cave went on the end of the form, but he did not fall—something spilt out of the jug—Cave recovered himself, and threw the contents of the jug into the prisoner's face—I think he threw the contents of the jug only—I am not sure whether the jug went also—it fell, but whether it struck the prisoner, I do not know—it was a common brown jog, con<lb/>taining about a pint or a pint and a half—on Cave's throwing the tea, the prisoner pushed him down—Cave fell with very great violence; and while he was down, the prisoner kicked him on his hinder part with his right foot—I could not distinguish whether the kick was violent—Cave got up, and rushed at the prisoner, and the prisoner threw him down again in the same manner—Cave was on the ground three times—after Cave had been down the second time, he got up, and rushed at the prisoner; and the prisoner struck him in the face with his fist, and knocked him down—Cave fell upon his back; and while on his back, the prisoner stamped his foot on his chest—it was a regular stamp—he took his foot up, and stamped upon him—I had a clear view of all that was going on—the prisoner then went his way, and Cave went his way.</p>

On the night of 23rd July, at 9 o'clock, I put the prisoner on duty at post No. 2, in the dockyard, which is about twenty paces from the <hi rend="italic">Hornet</hi> shed—I relieved him at 11, and at 4, on the morning of 24th, I put him on the same post, and relieved him at 6.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor of chemistry to the Royal Agricultural Society, and live in Holies-street. My attention has been very much directed to the subject of manures—I understand guano—I have analyzed many hun<lb/>dred specimens—I received one sample from Cruikshank, and another from Captain Drury—I have analyzed them—there were two analyseses made of the sample from Captain Drury, which agree very well with each other—what I received from Cruikshank was pure guano—the component parts of the pure were, moisture, 8.71 per cent.; animal matter and salts of ammonia, 57.54; sand, 1.23; earthy phosphates, 21.06; earthy salts, 11.66—the animal matter furnishes 14.77 per cent, of nitrogen, which is equal to 17.93 of ammonia—the specific gravity is 1/65—the two principal fertilizing ingredients are ammonia and phosphate of lime—they are the most material ingredients—there is only 79 per cent, of fertilizing matter in it—the sand is about 11/4 per cent.—the samples I received from Captain Drury gave animal matter and ammonia 26.68; the phosphate, 12.58; clay and sand, 45.67; the nitrogen was 6.52, equal to 7.91 of ammonia; the specific gravity of that, in relation to water, is 2.97—the alkaline salts are 6.16; the moisture, 8.91—that makes up the hundred, leaving out, of coarse, the nitrogen; that is a separate calculation—one sample weighs rather more than half as much again as water, and the other twice as much—the impure is the heaviest—guano is a very light substance—the greater part of it is clay—there is a great deal of iron in the clay—the benefit of that is given to the earthy phosphates—all clay contains iron, except the white pure clay; that is free from iron—I did not detect any iron beyond what I should expect to find in clay—the guano was not improved; it was about half its former value, both in point of money and utility as a manure.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On Saturday, 17th May, I was en<lb/>gaged near Pickering's Wharf—I saw two barges there, the <hi rend="italic">Ann</hi> and tie <hi rend="italic">Old Soul</hi>—I received directions from Joseph Dellmott to get men to work a barge—he used formerly to be a relation of Pickering's—in consequence of those directions, I went to work with some men at 3 o'clock on the Saturday, at the wharf, unloading the <hi rend="italic">Ann</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Old Soul</hi>—we began to unload the <hi rend="italic">Old Soul</hi> at 5, and went on till 9—the bags were taken to the first-floor of Mr. Pickering's premises—about 9 we had about half unloaded the barge—I saw Pickering there at 9, and we were paid, in his presence, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, for working from 3 o'clock—I received directions from Pickering to get ten men to come to work on Sunday morning, after breakfast—I got ten men next morning, and went to work—I saw Long there—we continued to unload the <hi rend="italic">Old Soul</hi>—after she was unloaded, Pickering came—it was then past 10 in the morning—he said, "How are you getting on, lads?" and left directly—I did not go up-stairs—I was placed at the scale, to take the weights, and do what was required—stuff was put into the scale—it came from up-stairs—Long was at the scale while I was there—the bags which were brought from up-stairs were put into the scale, and were made weight according to the weight which Gibbs, the boy, gave from a book, with the number of the bag—the stuff was put in to make up that weight—the stuff came down in a basket from up-stairs—when that was done, I took the bag from the scale, and it was sewn up by two or three men, and put on board the <hi rend="italic">Old Soul</hi>—one man</p>

               <p>Pickering, as clerk—I know Mr. Long—on Saturday, 17th May, I was em<lb/>ployed at Union Wharf, Limehouse—I saw Mr. Long that afternoon—I can<lb/>not say at what time—it was before high-water—there were two barges at the wharf at that time—they were the <hi rend="italic">Ann</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Old Soul</hi>—I had not seen the <hi rend="italic">Effort</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">Ann</hi> was loaded with hay—the <hi rend="italic">Old Soul</hi> was moored to the tim<lb/>ber—she was laden with guano—when she was brought alongside the wharf, the guano was taken out—it was in bags—there was a number and weight on the bags—the number and weight of each bag was called out, and I put it down in a book belonging to Mr. Pickering, and I left it there—after the bags were landed from the <hi rend="italic">Old Soul</hi>, some of them were taken to the ground-floor, and some up-stairs—I did not notice those on the ground-floor that evening—we went off work between 6 and 7 o'clock that evening—Mr. Pickering was then in the counting-house—I did not see him on the wharf while the <hi rend="italic">Old Soul</hi> was unloading—when we left off work, I saw him come out of the counting-house to cross the wharf to go to his own house—he lives on the premises, and is the occupier of the whole wharf—he paid me that night—Mr. Long said it was Mr. Pickering's orders that we were to come to work the next morning—I reached the wharf the next morning about ten—I found the men at work—they were then putting it into the barge—I had not taken the weight and number of all of it on the night before—the men were at work in the morning when I got there—the barge had been unloaded, and while it was being reloaded I called the weights and numbers out which I had entered the night before; and when the men called out it was all right, I ticked them off—we worked that night till about five or six—I was not paid—I saw some foswill mixed with the guano, that had been taken from the <hi rend="italic">Old Soul</hi>—the colour of the foswill is something like guano—when it was mixed with the guano it was put in the bags, and some of them were put in the <hi rend="italic">Old Soul.</hi>
