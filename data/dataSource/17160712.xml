            </rs>. It appear'd the Prisoner committed this very great Offence even after he was confin'd in Newgate, for Printing and Publishing a most seditious Libel, called Weekly Remarks.

            </rs>. It was prov'd by Mr. Smith, who was appointed by my Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs, to super intend the Goal of Newgate, That the Prisoner had Leave to visit some of the Rebels; and in his Return, as he went by the Soldiers, he threw them a Shiling, and bid them drink the Pretender's Health by the Name of King James; upon which he call'd him back, and knowing him to be a Prisoner already, let him go; but told him he would take care to have him prosecuted for his Impudence. He took this Occasion to do the Soldiers Justice, who unanimously rejected the Proposal with the greatest Scorn and Contempt.

               Indicted, for a Misdemeanor, in Printing and Publishing a Libel, call'd Weekly Remarks,&amp;c. in which are contain'd
            </rs> several Expressions, highly reflecting on his present Majesty and Government. The first Evidence was Mr. Squire, who depos'd he had the Papers from Mrs. Grover, and she, That they were brought to her from the Prisoner's Sister, to whom she paid the Money for his Use, which was a Guinea at one Time, and two at another, having been told she acted for him. That she receiv'd a Letter from a Porter, in the Prisoner's Name, in which were Expressions tending to prove him to be the Printer of the said Libel. But that she did not know the Prisoner himself, having always dealt with his Sister; nor could she swear the Letter was written by him. Then the Porter was sworn, but Mrs. Grover did not know him, which put aside his Evidence. And her Daughter depos'd, That she was abroad when the Letter came to her Mother, and did not see the Porter, but confirm'd that Part of her Mother's Evidence which concern'd her transacting Business with the Prisoner's Sister for his Use. Mr. Stakehouse depos'd, One Wright came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171607120003"/> to the Stamp-Office with nine of these Papers (amongst which was the Paper in question) to pay the Duties from Mrs. Dalton, and to be enter'd, but not coming in Time it was refus'd. Wright swore he had them from one Withers, on Snow-bill, being directed there by Mrs. Dalton. Then Hawkins stood up again, and swore he was call'd, being a Porter, to Newgate, and a Man ask'd him what he would have to go to the Stamp-Office, and receiv'd 3 s. to pay for Duties, and had 6 d. for his Pains, but did not know the Man again from whom he receiv'd it. Then Mr. Squire farther depos'd, That when he took the Prisoner up, he own'd to him, that he printed the Papers under that Title, but did not that he printed that particularly mention'd in the Indictment. Squire also deposed that he afterwards found and took one of the very Papers in question at the Prisoner's House, where his Printing Press was kept. However the Evidence failing in fixing that particularly, for which he was cried, upon the Prisoner, he was <rs id="t17160712-4-verdict26" type="verdictDescription">

It appear'd very plain from the Evidence, That the Prisoner had confess'd he was concern'd in writing the said Libel with another Person, which was to be of a different Nature from any yet publish'd: That the Prisoner was seen to write some Part of the said Paper. That it came from his own Hands to the Press. And that he had own'd to my Lord Townshend and others, he wrote it for his Bread. The Prisoner in his Defence had nothing to say to the Fact, which he could not deny, but thought to bring himself off by quarrelling with what he apprehended to be uncivil, absurd, false Latin and un generous, in the Indictment; which was far from doing him Service; it being drawn up as the Custom in the Law directs, and in the Manner that it always understands.

               <p>The Council for the King having open'd the Indictment, and the Nature and Manner of the Offence, my Lord Townshend's Warrant for the Commitment was prov'd, which occasion'd some Debate between the Council on both sides; but the Objections on the Part of the Prisoner being over-rul'd, Mr. Rewse was sworn, who depos'd, That on the Day mention'd in the Indictment, Mr. Foster was committed to <placeName id="t17160712-10-crimeloc58">Newgate</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17160712-10-crimeloc58" type="placeName" value="Newgate"/>

That it was the Custom in the said Prison, both before and after, sometimes at 11, and sometimes at 12 a-Clock at Night, to put the Guard into the Press-yard, which was the Business of Mr. Ballard his Fellow Servant; and when he had done, and every thing made secure, his Master the Prisoner receiv'd the Keys, and took particular Care of Mr. Foster himself. That his Master was always very diligent in performing his Duty, and told him, he went to the Secretary's Office to acquaint them of the Necessity of a Guard, which was accordingly ordered; besides which, he was at the Charge of two Watchmen, who took their Turns every Night, who were to inspect the Soldiers, and prevent their being brib'd. That on the Night aforesaid, he being asleep in the Lodge, his Master came to him very much surpriz'd, and told him that which was his greatest Care would now be his Ruin, and shew'd him a false Key, upon which he told him, there was a Man in the Prison who had been a Servant to the City-Smith, and had him examin'd, but he denied his being any ways acquainted with the making of that Key, and his Master order'd him immediately to be confin'd. Then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171607120004"/> he and Mr. Ballard took a Link and went to Billingsgate, and enquir'd at the Dark-houses if, any Person had just gone off, or had bespoke a Passage to Gravesend, or waited for the Tide, which he saw coming in; and at last was inform'd that at the Gun Tavern there were a couple of Gentlemen who waited for a third, to go to Gravesend, upon which he went to them; but found them Dutch Gentlemen; from thence he went to Queenhithe , enquiries all the Way, without acquainting any Person of the Occasion of his Errand, and thence to Black Fryers where he was informed a single Gentleman had just crossed the Water with a Sculler, upon which he took Boat, and enquir'd at the Watch houses on t'other sides and became informed that the Person who cross'd was a Neighbour very much in Drink, but could learn nothing of Mr. Foster, and then not knowing what to do farther, came home. He also depos'd, That Mr. Foster's Room was very strong, and more secure than any Room in the Prison; and that he could make no Noise nor Disturbance without waking his Master , who lay upon the same Floor, a Partition being only between them; That the Prison was full,10 or 12 being confin'd in one Room; and that none of them were in Irons, not so much as Mr. Foster's Man. And believ'd his Master was not at all consenting to Foster's Escape, and thought if it was his Case, and had taken Bribes, he should rather have chosen to have gone along with him, than have staid to bear the heavy Load that such a Crime would certainly have put upon him. That Count Guiscard was also confined in the Prisoner's House by Order, it being thought by the then Ministry to be the safest Place, and Mr. Harvey for High Treason.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Ballard was sworn who depos'd he went to lock up Foster, and saw him come out of the Press-yard, appearing Melancholy and complaining he was tir'd of reading; and gave his Master the Keys as he us'd to do after he had put the Guards into the Press yard. That he observ'd his Master to be extraordinary careful of Mr. Foster that he should not escape that his Master had given all his Servants Charge to take no Bribes which the Rebels were very free to offer; and that he himself might have taken 5000 l in his Time if he would be false to his Trust, That when Foster was gone, he came to him like a Man distracted, knocking his Head against the Wainscot crying out he was ruined undone &amp;c. and he varlly believ'd he was not concern'd in his Escape, That Foster us'd very often to go up Stairs to the necessary House, and he always staid at his Chamber Door till he came down, knowing it to be impossible for any Person to get out above. Being ask'd by the King's Council, if it was usual for the Prisoners to visit the Rebels After they were lock'd up, he replied No And again, If Mr. Anderton and Mr. Foster had taken his Master by the Throat, could he ring his Bell or give any Notice, he replied, he might make his Black hear, who had Arms; and that in this Case they could do not further, the Keys being lock'd up. That his Master might let in the Soldiers upon any Disturbance; or the Soldiers in the Lodge might hear upon firing a Gun and come to their Assistence. That his Master attended all last Winter in the severest Season, and was indesatigable in his Diligence and Care in securing the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Revel was sworn, who depos'd he went to look up about 11 a Clock at Night, and his Master bid him make haste , and when he had done he give him the Key, That Mr. Anderson, Mr. Foster and his Master were above Stairs in Foster's Room, over 2 Flask of Wine, his Master with his Back to the Door; the other two facing it. That his Master ask'd him if all was safe, and he told him Yes, and bid him Good Night, and then he went out, and the Black that the Door after him. That being sent for after this to his Master, he said, Ah! Revel, I am undone; Pray go to the Watch and enquire, Foster's gone. That his Master was a very careful Man, and never satisfied but when up and down to see that all was safe; and had turn'd away one Mills for being drunk once on his Duty, and never would be persuaded to take him again; and confirm'd what was said of his. Diligence in the frosty Weather.</p>
               <p>Then Callihand was sworn, Mr. Ritt's Black,(having been christned) and he depos'd, That on the Night aforesaid, he went to the Press yard to Mr. Revel, and there he saw Mr. Anderton, and told them, his Master wanted to go to Bed; then he light up Mr. Anderton, and Mr. Foster open'd his Door, and ask'd Mr. Anderton to drink a Glass of Wine with him, who refus'd it then; but afterwards he saw them and his Master together. When the Guards were shut in, and Mr. Revel gone, he made all fast after him, and carried the Keys to his Mistress, and she bid him carry them to his Master; and coming down Stairs met Foster's Man, who told him he was a dry, upon which he bid him go with him into the Cellar and he would draw him some Beer, but the other refus'd it and stood on the Stairs; and while he was in the Kitchin looking for a Pot, his Master call'd him, but he could not get out; at last, his Master saw a Peg stock in, which he pull'd out, and the Door open'd which made him cry out, I am undone , Foster's gone; and then he bid him fetch the Key, and going to the Door found one in, it on the outside, and the Door double lock'd. Then he got out at Window, and found Foster's Night-Gown lying upon the Steps, which he threw into the Parlour and took out the false Key. After which he went to the Lodge and call'd Mr. Rewse. A Piece of List was found under the Latch. That all this was done and the Chain taken off without the least Noise, as he believ'd might be. That the Keys were always left in his Master's Chamber. That when his Master saw Foster's Gown in the Parlour he fell into a very great Passion with the Maid. And he believ'd him to be innocent.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Buckley was sworn, who depos'd, the Prisoner came to him and said he was ruin'd-Foster was gone, That he had taken care to have all Things fast and close just before, and had put his Keys into his own Bed-Chamber, divided from Mr. Foster's but by a thin Partition. That Foster complain'd he was tir'd of reading and was desirous to refresh himself with a Glass of Wine; and Mr. Anderton came up to him, And while they were drinking Mr. Foster pretended to go to the Necessary-house; but staying Some time he suspected him, and look'd for him; but not finding him; there, he went to the main Door, and found a List under the Latch; and then he shew'd him the true Key and a false one, and had him observe the true Key was daub'd a little with Clay, and said be suspected some body hod taken a Print off it to make another by. Then he told him the Guards were always put into the Press-Yard before that Time of Night. That he ask'd him, if he had sent to stop the Post, it being discover'd about 12 a Clock; who answer'd No; but shew'd an Advertisement, which he would have put into the News; but he told him the News would not come out till next Morning; and advis'd him to go back to his Prison to prevent the like Misfortune from any other. Then he ask'd what he should do, for he was afraid he should be examin'd upon Oath; which he believ'd he might refuse because he should be put to answer Questions that might be of ill Consequence to him; but not from any Sense of Guilt or Disrespect to any Person whatsoever.</p>
               <p>That after this, he and Mr. Stanian were order'd to Newgate, to inspect Foster's Lodging, and the Prisoner's Chamber, and he ( Mr. Buckley ) seeing a Close-stool there, ask'd Mr. Rewse if that was always in the Room, who made this Answer, That where there was a Close-Prisoner there was always a Close-stool. That after this he was applied to for Relief for some of the Rebels who were in Irons, and was told that Brigadier Mackintosh's Leg was wore to the Bone; but finding that to be false, the sorbore troubling my Lord Townshend about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171607120005"/>Mr. Stanian depos'd (being sworn) That my Lord Towshand sent for him, and told him, Foster had made, his Escape, and bid him go immediately to Newgate, and see after what Manner it was done; which he did accordingly; and Mr. Pitts inform'd him, that He, Mr. Foster, and Mr. Anderton were sitting in Mr. Foster's Room over a Flask of Wine, and when it was something above half gone, Mr. Foster went up (as be thought) to the necessary House, and his Heart misgave him and therefore he went up after him, but to his great Surprize found he was not there; and going down found the Fall of the Latch; deaden'd by a Plece of List, and a Peg in the Kitchin Door by which his Servant was confin'd who being afterwards releas'd and getting out of a Window, found his Night-Gown left upon the Steps. Then he shew'd him the Key, with the Mark of the Clay; upon which he ask'd him how any Body should come by that Key, he having it always in his Possession; to this he answered the Key was always in the Door in the Day-time. Then he the said Prisoner was sot referring him to Mr. Anderton, who, he said, told him afterwards, Mr. Foster went down Stair pretending to wash a Glass, in order to fill out some Brandy. Mr. Anderton also told him, they were both surprized at Mr. Foster's Escape, and profess'd he knew nothing of the Matter, he having said when he went down, it was to wash a Glass; and then he confirmed what Mr. Buckley had said before concerning the Close stool.</p>

               <p>Then the Council for the Prisoner made their Defence, and said, Nothing had been produced to support the Indictment, which was founded upon an obsolete Statute made in Edward the Second's Reign, upon which no Prosecution had been before commenced. That therefore this being the first that has appeared and so weakly supported, having nothing but Presumptive Evidence, which (as they said) should always be of use to the Prisoner, especially where Life was concerned, and especially where there was so many Proofs of the Prisoner's Vigilance and Care as had appeared, and should be made appear in the Case of the Prisoner before them, they humbly hoped that the Jury would think themselves obliged to acquit him, they being upon Oath to judge of the Fact by their Evidence.</p>

             and others, who all gave him the Character of a very careful, fair, honest Man.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's Black stood up again, and swore his Master sent him immediately to the Turnpike at Highgate, to examine all Passengers.</p>
               <p>Then the Prisoner said he was perfectly innocent of the Charge in the Indictment. That he had not the least previous Apprehension of the Prisoner's Escape. That his Circumstances before this unfortunate Accident, were of themselves sufficient to place him above the reach of Bribes. That he had if in his Power to let them all escape, and to go along with them. That it was even his extraordinary Care that brought this Misfortune upon him. And that since he had but follow'd the Practice of former Goalers, it would be hard if he should fall the first Victim to the Consequences of a meer Accident, the rather because he had been often rewarded by the Government for his Care and Prudence in so doing.</p>
               <p>Then the King's Council replied; and was indicted that Part of the Council's Plea on the other side, which said the Indictment on the Statute of Edward II . and put it on the Foot of the 25th of Edward III and said the Jury were to be Judges of Fact, and Presumption when strong, and when the Nature of the Case will admit of no other Evidence, is good in Civil Law, Common Law, and all the Law in the World. That Justice was to take Place in a Court of Judicature, Mercy belong'd to the Throne. That it was plain not with standing what had been said by the Council on the other side, that the Prisoner had at least been very negligent in his Duty in permitting the Chief Man of the Rebellion to escape, whose Imprisonment, they had reason to believe, might have done the Crown more Service than all the others together; especially at a Time when he had receiv'd Notice to prepare for his Trial. That it was strange that at such a Time there was not a particular Care to confine him to his Room; that his very Servant, without whole assistence he would not probably have made his Escape, and whose, Quality could be no Excuse, should not be iron'd. That he should go to drinking with the said Mr. Foster, particularly at so unseasonable a Juncture, when the Guards were all turn'd into the Press-yard, no body but himself and Black in a Condition to resist the very probable Attempts of three or four Prisoners for High Treason, especially when the Keys of the Doors, and of the whole Goal; were but in the next Room, and Prisoners of such Consequence, that no Quality or Consideration could excuse his Putting himself into their Power. That he should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171607120006"/> suffer the said Mr. Foster , knowing his Servant to be perfectly free from Irons , to go at such a Time out of the Room, at his own Discretion, without the least Observation or Regard. That such pretended Contrivances as a false Key, List under the Latch, a Peg-hole to the Kitchin Door, and other Conveniences, should be all ready at a Minute's Warning. That the Prisoner's Servants should be up in the House, and with himself all amus'd, and out of the Way just at that Juncture. That all this Liberty should be taken without Leave of the Secretary of State, having no Authority but Custom, having no Countenance in it but from the Goverment's Satisfaction in his Care and Integrity which he was to abuse at his Peril; and of which he appear'd to be very sensible: and that all this should be done without his being in the least acquainted with, or let into the Secret of it; especially a Man of his Care, his Vigilance, and his Integrity and Diligence, was wondrous strange! That it was not to be expected such a Case would admit of positive Evidence, there being none produc'd but those who were the Prisoner's Servants, and whose Places depended upon him; the most considerable of which were dismiss'd for that Night, before the Treason was committed, as Persons unqualified by their Integrity for such a Secret; but it was to be hoped there was sufficient Ground for the Indictment in a Case of this close Nature. when a Servant confess'd he might in that small Time he was employ'd in an inferior Trust have had 5000 l. for such Services. When it appeared plain the Prisoner did not use upon other Occasions to visit his Prisoners after they were lock'd up; when there was such a remarkable Neglect in not going to the Post Office to stop the Post, the most likely Method of recovering the Prisoner, till next Day at Noon; and when it appeared he was so loath to be examined upon Oath. These Considerations they left to the Jury, and when my Lord Chief Baron Bury had summ'd up the Evidence, which he did very fully, they went out, and being return'd <rs id="t17160712-10-verdict59" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>DAVID POVEY, removed from Hasson Garden near to Exeter-Exchange in the Strand, London, Operator for the Teeth, who had the Honour to clean her late Majesty's Teeth; he sells a pleasant Dentrifice, being the same that King Charles II constantly used: It makes the Teeth as white as Ivory, and preserves them from decaying, destroying the Scurvy. He hath a Cephalick which certainly cures the Tooth-Ach in a Minute's Time, beyond any Person in England. If the teeth are rotten, or uneven, and full of Holes or black Specks, he will make them smooth; even, sound, and white, so that no Person shall distinguish where the Defect has been. He sets in Artificial Teeth so easie, neat, and firm, that they need not be removed for seven Years; and they may eat with them as well as with their former, and cannot be distinguished from their natural ones. He sells a pleasant Water, that prevents any Rottenness from seizing the Teeth, takes all Pains and Imposthomes, Cankers or Swellings out of the Gums, and fastens loose Teeth, which several Persons of Quality and others know to be true. I have sold all that is printed here to most of the Kings, Queens, Princes, Nobility and Gentry in England, since King Charles II dy'd, and before.</p>
               <p>For the Good of the Publick.</p>
               <p>WHereas several Gentlewomen and others of that Sex, in this Kingdom, have contracted an evil Habit of Body, wherein the vicious Humours, at first dispers'd thro the Whole, come at length to be lodg'd in one Part or another, and many times, for Causes too long to be here mentioned, are thrown down upon the Womb occasioning a dangerous Weakness in that Part, which being neglected, at last turns Cancerous, and often proves Fatal. I cure the Diabetes when given over by all other Persons. This is to acquaint all such as may have occasion, that a speedy Relief is to be had from an Experienc'd Midwise, dwelling at the Sign of the Queen's Arms, a Gold Smith's Shop, near Exeter Exchange in the Strand, who perform'd a Cure upon a Lady at the Bath, after she was given over by the Physicians, and since has Cured several Gentlewomen and others in the City and Suburbs of London. I should not have put my self in Public Print, but to satisfy the Afflicted where they may have speedy Relief after they are given over by all other Persons.</p>
