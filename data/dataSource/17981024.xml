The property that was taken away was my own property; four pair of cotton stockings, two pair of silk, two waistcoats, an upper one and an under one, a pair of shoes, and a pair of silver buckles; six neck-handkerchiefs and a coat were taken out of the area, but not carried away, and a jacket and two pair of leather breeches belonging to my master; that is all I know of the transaction.</p>

             sworn. - I live over the prisoner's head; I was not at home when the prisoner and the deceased came home; when I had been in my apartment a little while, I heard them quarrelling about some money that the deceased had to receive, a yearly income her father had left her upon his decease; a year's money became due that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at all hear what was said about money? - A. I heard Bond say that it was his money as much as her's, and she said it was not his, her father had left it her, and she should see about that; presently after I heard Mrs. Bond cry murder, and then I heard five or six-blows, they followed one another as fast as they could; I then took the candle and went down stairs, and met Bond coming out of his own door, and drawing the door after him; I said to him, you villain, you have killed your wife; he said, he had done nothing to her, and was going to get a pennyworth of beer; he went to go down stairs, I told him he should come up, I would see what he had done, and he said, no, he should go for the beer; Mrs. Huddlestone then laid hold of him, and told him he should go up and see what he had done; she did go up, but I cannot say what situation she was in, for I was so terrified, that I did not know what I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing that caused your fright? - A. I saw Mrs. Bond lying in a heap, and a vast deal of blood about, I was very much frightened before that, for I thought he had done<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240007"/>so, though I did not know; I then went to fetch Mr. Franks, the surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when any thing was found in the room? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Bond when Mr. Franks came in? - A. The house was so full, I could not get in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long had you lived in that house? - A. I had lived there about eighteen or twenty months; the prisoner and his wife lived there before I came.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you intimate at all? - A. Only how do you do.</p>
               <p>Q. I perceive Bond is very far advanced in life? - A. He is better than seventy years old, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. He seems very infirm? - A. When he meets with any thing to take any particular effect upon him, he may.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you observed that before? - A. Yes, he is an old man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard that he has been actually out of his senses? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. However, from your own observation, you have found his nerves a good deal affected, when any thing particular has happened? - A. It cannot be expected otherwise.</p>

             sworn. - I lodge in the same house with the prisoner, in the two pair of stairs, with Mrs. Shaw; I came home between six and seven on Saturday night, and when I went up, I heard the prisoner and his wife having words about the money that her father had left her, which came due that day, and as soon as I had got into my own room, I heard Mrs. Bond cry murder, and then I heard repeated blows, I could hear it distinctly, the doors were both; what happened afterwards I do not know, for I was so frightened I was not able to stir off my chair till after the surgeon came, she was then lying in an immense quantity of blood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you lived in that house any length of time? - A. About eighteen or twenty months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of knowing whether he was deranged in his mind? - A.According to my judgement there was nothing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. FRANKS sworn. - I am a surgeon in Great Smith-street, Westminster; I was called in about seven o'clock in the evening to the assistance of Mrs. Bond; when I came into the room, she had expired; the body was lying upon the floor, in the middle of the room; finding the woman irrecoverably dead, I endeavoured to discover the cause; I removed the cap of the deceased, and with my finger I soon traced a fracture of the cranium, with a wound on the left side of the head.</p>

               <p>Q. Did that appear to have been given by a blow with the fist, or an instrument? - A. With an instrument. The next morning, about eleven o'clock, I again attended, ordered the head to be shaved, and found another fracture of the skull, on the same side of the head, about two inches from the other wound, there was a depression of the cranium, the bone had been forced inwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your opinion that those blows were the cause of the death of the deceased? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt? - A. Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you either on Saturday or Sunday discover any instrument? - A. On the Sunday morning I discovered a bill-book lying within the sender, and I give it as my opinion, that that instrument was adequate to the mischief that had been produced.</p>
               <p>Q.Did it appear to you that the wound had been given by such an instrument? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you observe the hands of the deceased? - A. The woman had a stocking on. - On the Wednesday after the Coroner had seen the body at Mr. Chippendale's, an undertaker's, I discovered a confused wound on the left hand of the same kind with that on the head, and appeared to have been given by the same instrument.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Do you conceive that it might have been possible for this woman, by any fall against the bedstead, or sharp corner of any furniture in the room, to have received these wounds? - A. Impossible; she might have had a mere simple fracture, these things are common; but something else must be superadded to cause instantaneous death.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>

             sworn. - I am a coachmaker, No. 38, Tuston-street, Westminster: I have known the prisoner twelve years, till within about a fortnight before this happened, he had frequently been at my house; he is sixty-nine years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you intimately acquainted with him? - A. I have frequently sharpened his saws for him, and he has communicated his mind frequently to me.</p>
               <p>Q. From the opportunities you had of observing his mind, tell the Court and Jury what your ideas were with respect to the sanity of it? - A. I have frequently known him so disturbed in his mind, and so perplexed, that he was like a madman at times; a little more than a twelvemonth ago he came to my house in a disturbed unhappy state, and was communicating how disturbed he was in his mind, and that he should make away with himself; he said, he was going up Millbank-row, and supposing I was to throw myself in the water, says he what will the consequence be; my wife said to him, suppose you were to put your finger in the fire, and you were to feel the smart, how would you bear that for a whole eternity; he then said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240008"/>I thank you, God bless you, and bounced out of the room in a mad freak.</p>
               <p>Q. At any other time can you recollect any thing particular taking place? - A. Yes, at various times similar to this; I followed him out of the house at that time, and he went up Orchard-street; I persuaded him to compose his mind, and go in and have a drop of purl, being early in the morning; I reasoned with him upon his disturbed state of mind. and not to go near his wife till he was more satisfied; but, when I left him, I could not get any kind of answer from him, in any measure, like a man.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to speak of his wife? - A. He frequently used to say, his mind was so disturbed he could have no peace at home; and he and his wife used to quarrel a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever explain to you what they quarrelled about? - A. No, not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you tell us of any other particular occurrence that led you to notice the state of his mind? - A. Rather less than a fornight before this affair happened, I think it was about Monday or Tuesday was a week before it happened, he came to me to sharpen a saw for him, and he communicated his unhappy mind to me, that his shirt was in a pail soaking, it was not washed for him, and he was very bad with a cold, he could hardly crawl about; I said, don't mind that, Mr. Bond, get somebody else to wash it for you; he went away, and said, God bless you, I shall not see you any more.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he uttered that expression, did it strike your mind, at the time, that it was the observation of a person frantic with melancholy and despair? - A. Yes, as it had been at various times before.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know him at all in Berkshire, at a place called Bracknell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing particular happening to him there? - A. I left that country before it happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Perhaps you know who this man works for? - A. He worked for the same master that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not continue working for that master so long as he did? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in that master's employment at the time this melancholy affair took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at all that day, or the week before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore how his mind was on those days, you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his being absent any day from work for the last fortnight? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that his wife had a little money of her own, independent of him? - A. It is a little cottage that was left by her father.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you heard him converse at all upon the subject? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard him express any discontent about her having that money? - A.There was always a controversy about it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a carpenter and builder, in Jermyn-street, St. James's; I have known the prisoner many years; in the year 1792 and 1793, he was in the habit of working for me the greatest part of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time, was there any thing led you to take notice of the state of his mind? - A. At different periods he would be away from his work, and walk about the streets like a man deranged in his senses, without any known cause; I have set him to work in a morning, and he has left it before night without any known cause.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his conduct evince to your mind that of a disordered mind? - A. At those times that I have now mentioned it did.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he worked for you since? - A. In 1794. and 1796 he worked for me, and his fits grew worse upon him, and more frequent; I employed him but a very short time, at that period, in consequence of that; since that time I have known nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You don't mean to say he was constantly deranged in his mind, but had occasional fits of derangement? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you observe any thing particular that brought on those fits upon him? - A. Many times his wife has come and sent for him, but at other times, without any known cause to me, he has gone away and left his work.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever observe any other symptoms about him than that of a gloomy melancholy disturbed man, that could induce you to suppose he did not know what he was doing? - A. I cannot say that I ever did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him intimately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course then, you had an opportunity of observing the state of his mind? - A. Yes, at times it was like the mind of a man who was not in his proper senses; he was not capable of his business at different times; there was one instance about nine years past, he attempted to make away with himself, by hanging himself in his work-shop; he was saved by being cut down in time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 29th of September last? - A. Yes, he came a little after two o'clock in the day; he stopped with me till just the turn of four o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240009"/>Q. Did you observe particularly the state of his mind at that time? - A. I saw that he was enraged about something, and was not at all like the person that he was before, from the particular motion of his hands, and of his eyes, that I took particular notice of.</p>

               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Baron HOTHAM.</p>
               <p>SENTENCE.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Prisoner at the bar, After a very patient and a very humane discussion of your case, by the learned Judge who tried it, you have been convicted of the most horrid crime of murder, a crime so malignant in its nature, that it is difficult to find words to express its atrocity. All civilized nations are agreed in punishing this great offence with death: by the law of this country, the murderer is condemned to die; a law which has the very high sanction and authority of the sacred scriptures. Even in the atrocious crime of murder, there are very different shades of malignity; your's is a case of the very deepest die, you have, in savage brutality, most wantonly dared to spill the blood of an unarmed, innocent, and helpless woman, to lift up your blood thirsty hands against the partner of your bed, the partaker of your forrows and your happiness, when she was in the act of sober honest industry; a person to whom, under the most solemn vow, you had engaged to afford shelter and protection from every harm; what could excuse such an offence? nothing short of the deprivation of reason. Most unfortunately for you, the Jury, in the discharge of the duty they owed to themselves and to their country, have found that this most horrid deed was done in found mind, and in most wicked malice. Inasmuch as your offence is of the greatest enormity in the sight of God and man, so ought your contrition and your repentance to be most sincere and most unfeigned; I most earnestly request you, therefore, to make the very best use of the very short space of time that will be permitted you to remain among us; and I pray Almighty God in the attributes of his great mercy, that the very ignominious death you are about to suffer, and the public exposition of your body after death, will expiate your high offence here, and restore you to happiness and peace hereafter.</p>

               <p>As the Law commands me, I now proceed to pass this dreadful sentence, that you,

About five or ten minutes past four, she returned again rather in liquor, and asked me what she had deposited in my hands for care; I told her, 9l. 2s. In going away again, crossing the street towards home, the prosecutor met her, and brought her back to my house, and there accused her of the robbery, which she denied.</p>

They drank together for, I dare say, upwards of an hour, to the amount of two shillings and two-pence halfpenny; the altercation between them was not much, any further than he accused her; they went out of my house together, and about six they returned in custody of the officer.

               <p>Q. What was the value of it? - A. I cannot tell, I saw him take the money for it, and then the man bought the fellow to it; the man said, he thought they were over-driven, and were not well; he said, no, they had only come from Colnbrook, and he had brought them from Hammersmith that morning, and then I agreed for the two biggest of them, and as I was driving them away, Mr. Nevitt came up upon his mare, and collared the prisoner.</p>

She said, she had it from a shop on the side of the way that Fleet-market is on, and before we came to St. Paul's, I enquired, as I came home, at the different shops, and found that Mr. Plumley had lost such an one.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I broke open the room, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Priest.) Are you in the habit of letting your lodgings or your wife? - A. If I am at home I let them myself, if I am not she lets them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable of St. Ann's: About eleven o'clock at night I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vollam. I was present when the things were taken out of her boxes, they were searched in the prisoner's presence, in the back kitchen; there was a jar of vinegar and gherkins, and a clothes-brush, and two yards of black lace locked up in her box; it was impossible for me to miss these things out of about thirty or forty thousand articles; the property is most of it here; the soap was found upon the cistern.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240019"/>Q. How do you know the prisoner at the bar stole that soap? - A. I believe either she or the man that was in bed with her did; I found a man in bed with her between eleven and twelve o'clock at night; the nutmegs were found upon the top of the bureau bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she put them there? - A. I do not know; it is impossible to swear to any articles in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the lace? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gruney. Q. This person who was with the prisoner, I believe, you had some acquaintance with? - A. He was an acquaintance of my wife's sister.</p>
               <p>Q. The only things found in the box were the brush and the lace, and the gherkins? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the only thing you have any mark upon is the brush? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you had never sold that brush? - A. Yes; I will swear I never sold one like that in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had a gentleman a lodger? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear that she had not taken that brush to brush that gentleman's coat? - A. He had a man to brush his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. But will you swear that she never did? - A. I think I could.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence, but called one witness, who had known her seven years, and gave her a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Shum; I missed a great quantity of vat hoops from the premises in Store-street; I went with Crocker to Moore's house, with a search-warrant; I found eight bundles of new vat hoops, a bundle of old vat hoops, and some tackle rope; the vat hoops are most of them marked with two T's and a W; the prisoner is a labourer under me; I pointed him out to Crocker, and told him, that is your man; I desired Crocker to take him over the way to the public-house, and I would search after the other men, but they had gone off; I then went over to Romaine; I have not the least doubt but these vat hoops are mr. Shum's property; they are new hoops, eight feet long, and have never been rivetted; they are in straight bars.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The mark you speak of is the mark of the maker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240022"/>Q. He makes for a great many other persons besides Messrs. Shum and Combe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he perhaps puts the same marks upon those he makes for other brewers? - A. He may, he works for a great many coopers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Did the prisoner at this time work for any other brewer? - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value of these? - A. About half-a-guinea a bundle.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you steal these things at different times, or at once? - A. At several times.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, but called four respectable witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

            ; then he put in two other sacks besides the fifteen that I had ordered; as soon as the miller had done delivering the flour, he went to a man with a candle in his hand, and then I came out of the garden, and for fear I should accuse a man that was innocent, I threw a stone up at the window, and spoke to Mr. Davison, the master of the mill, and then I went after the waggon; says I to Watts, the driver, you have got more sacks than you ought to have; he said he did not know as he had; I counted seventeen sacks, and when Mr. Davison came up, I said to Watts, you are my prisoner, you shall not go to London to night; Mr.Davison said to

            , why, here is a bag of Read's here that is so very different from the rest, that it must be a wilful mistake; we then went to his master to know about it; I had the waggon drawn down to the mill, and told the miller he was my prisoner; I took them into custody, and fat up with them both myself that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a good deal of flour at the mill? - A. Yes, I had forty load grinding off at that time; that, that was in Read's sack, was a sack of household, and that, that was in a sack of mine marked H. Mason, was rough stuff, in an unfinished state.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you in the mill at that time household flour and rough stuff? - A. There might be seventy or one hundred sacks.</p>

               <p>Q. Then of course Davison grinds for other people besides you? - A.Undoubtedly, he ground for

             sworn. - I am a miller; Mr. Mason called to me after the waggon went from the mill; he followed the waggon, and so did I; I found seventeen sacks in the waggon; there were fifteen of Wingfield's sacks, of Mount-street; one of the other sacks was Read's, and the other Mason's; then Mason went away to the man's master; I sent my lad to keep watch for the waggon in the night, and we found them to be household and rough stuff; Mr. Bishop ordered us to mark them. I had them under lock and key till I carried them up to Mr. Mason's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you directed either your servant Harrod or Watts to load these two sacks? - A. No; Mason's note expressed fifteen sacks, and what they had over was unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Mason more rough stuff and more flour in the mill? - A. Yes, there was some in what we call the pester, not sacked up; I did not know that there was any more sacked up than that fifteen sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if any body else had any rough stuff in the mill at that time? - A. I cannot pretend to swear, but really I think nobody else had besides Mr. Mason.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you to say very fairly, that you won't swear that no other person had rough stuff in the mill? - A. It was a thing I might not be acquainted with, and therefore I would not wish to swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are employed by a good many of your neighbours? - A. Yes, and I have two men to look after my business when I am out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there are more persons besides the two prisoners that worked in the mill? - A. Only one for the night time.</p>
               <p>Q. It has of course happened to you to have a sack of Read's before? - A.We are never without scarcely.</p>
               <p>Q.You were not present at he delivery of these sacks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it an uncustomary thing, suppose you have an order to deliver goods from your mill to Mason, to send home such sort of articles by your servants in the sacks of Read? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q.How long has Harrod lived with you? - A. Almost five years.</p>

               <p>Watts's defence. I asked him for a sack of twenty-penny, and he gave me this rough stuff, if it was rough stuff, I did not know any difference.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Have you not advised Mrs. Watkins several times to apply to the Civil Power, in consequence of the outrageous conduct of him towards his wife and family? - A. I never did.</p>

I should not have troubled your Lordship with any observations, if I had been brought to this bar by a man whose character was even commonly decent; he is a man notoriously disaffected to his King and Country; he is a man who has been guilty of murder in his own family; and if I had not more mercy for him than he has for me, I could have proved it out of the mouth of his wife and daughter. -</p>
               <p>Court. I am sorry to interrupt you or any other man in the course of his defence, but the rules of justice must be observed; it does not become the Court to hear circumstances stated so irrelevant.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable of St. John's Westmintler: On the 10th of October, about eight in the morning, I was at Kensington, and at the west end of the town: the prisoners passed me, one of them I had a suspicion of, Leonard, he had a bag under his arm, and Thompson had got something tied up in a smock frock; I let them pass me, and then followed them; I said to Burnham, you are the man, I believe, that brings fowls to town; he said, no; I told him, I suspected he had some about him; I searched their bundles, and found, upon Burnham, eight fowls, and upon Leonard, three.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not found the owner? - A. No; I have advertised them. Burnham said, that he and another man, not in custody, and Leonard, had taken these fowls from a gentleman's house, near three miles below Brentford.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to him to induce him to confess? - A. At that time he was charged with another robbery, and I believe he was induced to say so, because he thought the other prosecution would be set aside, if he owned this; but the Magistrate told him, he would give him no hope of it.</p>
               <p>Leonard's defence. We were employed by a man to carry them to the White-horse cellar; I had not been able to get any employment.</p>
               <p>Burnbam's defence. A man employed us to carry them to town; I never saw the man before in my life.</p>

            . On or about the 17th of October, the prisoner, Serjeant Bayliss, came to our office, and presented a draft for 15l.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that draft? - A. This is the draft that he presented for payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the person whose name appears at the bottom of the order an account at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It appears to me from the abstract, that the name is not the same, it is difficult to say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240029"/>whether it is Burnaby or Barnby. (Here the learned Judge compared the abstract with the indictment, and found it a sac simile.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Look at the bottom of it; there is something besides the name, I believe? - A. Yes, Lieutenant and Adjutant of the first foot guards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that regiment keep an account with you? - A. Captain Burnaby keeps cash at our house, and draws bills on our house on account of the regiment besides.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of his presenting this draft, did you pay it? - A. No, I suspected it to be a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you at all acquainted with the handwriting of captain Burnaby? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that his hand-writing? - A. No, it is not; I asked the prisoner in what way he came by it; he said, he received it from serjeant-major Seston, of the same regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. It appears to be drawn in favour of serjeant-major Seston? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From the account he gave, what did you do to him-did you secure him? - A. No, he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the draft? - A. I sent the bill up stairs to Mr. Rickaby, it was left at the office, and it was afterwards sent to the orderly-room.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you put your name to it before it left the office? - A. No, not till he was examined at Bow-street, which was three or four days after, but I am persuaded it is the same draft that he presented.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. You cannot swear that it is the same of course, not having it in your own custody? - A. No, another draft might be drawn exactly like it; it was two or three days before it was returned from the orderly-room.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you seen captain Burnaby write? - A. He keeps an account at Cox and Greenwood's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Who did you shew it to after it was first presented to you? - A. I gave it to Mr. Lucas.</p>

             sworn. I am a serjeant in the first regiment of foot guards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time when Baysiss was first in custody upon this charge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you first see Smith? - A. Sunday evening last.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after Bayliss was in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time you saw Smith, did you see him in company with Bayliss? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q.When you saw Bayliss and him together, were you within their sight, or concealed? - A. I was concealed by the desire of captain Burnaby.</p>
               <p>Q.What room were you in? - A. In the same room, in Portman-street barracks; Bayliss knew I was there, but Smith did not; I was concealed underneath the bed-cloths in a bedstead turned up.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time that Bayliss and Smith were together, could you hear what they said to each other? - A.Yes; I saw Smith come into Bayliss.</p>
               <p>Q.Tell us what conversation passed? - A. First, Smith shook hands with Bayliss, and asked him how he did, and how he should come on; Bayliss said, he thought he should be there about a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240030"/>Q. Was the room in which Bayliss was, a room of free access, or a room of confinement? - A. A room of confinement; he said, he thought he should be there about a week, or till the commanding officer came to town; Smith said, d-n my blood, if I have not been walking about these barracks for this hour, before I could come up to you; Bayliss said, please God I live to get through this, you shall never persuade me to have any thing to do with your forged notes any more; this is the first time your forged notes any more; this is the first time I ever had any thing to do with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion was it that Bayliss was confined in this room? - A. By order of the commanding officer, on account of this note; then the conversation, turned to something else, and they came and sat down upon a bench before the fire, and drapk a share of a pot of beer; after some time Smith says, this day week you were on the provost guard; Bayliss said, yes, there it was; you dated the note; Smith said, yes, it was; then the discourse turned to something else, and a little while afterwards Bayliss said, Smith was that note for 15l. that you wrote out; Smith said, yes, it was; Bayliss then asked him whether he recollected the date of the note, or not, whether he dated it the 15th or 16th; Smith said, he was not certain, but he thought it was either the 15th or 16th, he was not certain which, and then there was some conversation about something else; then Smith was seized by a constable, and taken away to Mary-le-bonne watch-house; Bayliss was asked, in the presence of Smith, whether he chose to give charge of Smith for forging the note, and Bayliss said, he did; I went and saw him in the watch-house myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. I think you said that Bayliss knew of your being confined under the bed-clothes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was a contrivance for the purpose of extracting something from Smith, in order to excuse himself? - A. That I cannot tell; it was to hear the conversation.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (For Baylis). Q. You were placed there on purpose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were put there in consequence of a promise, that if Bayliss would lead to the detection of any body else, he would receive every indulgence? - A. Not that I know of; it was the serjeant-major that desired me to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. With the approbation of Bayliss? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was in order that he might extract something from Smith, that he might himself escape? - A. That I cannot tell; certainly it was to find out whether Smith was concerned in it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Captain Burnaby here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q.Bayliss was asked whether he would not charge Smith? - A. Yes. (The draft read.)</p>
               <p>Smith's defence. I never saw that note in my life, that note was not my hand-writing, not did I utter that note.</p>
               <p>Bayliss's defence. I received the note of Mr. Smith.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not plan this contrivance for the purpose of inducing from him a confession? - A. I did it for that purpose; I waited upon him in his room, and told him his critical situation, and I likewise told him, it was very certain, tht for the sake of his family, if any body was concerned with him, it would be better to say it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Be so good as look at that draft; does that purport, upon the face of it, to be your draft? - A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the description of yourself, J.D. Burnaby, lieutenant and adjutant? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your draft? (Mr. Alley objected to this question.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What is the character of this man? - A. I have been five years in the same battalion with him; I always believed him to be as honest a man as could live.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Smith called Mr. Alexander Wyllie, who had known him from four years old, and gave him an excellent character.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How came you to walk with him as he was a stranger to you? - A. I had nothing to do, I was upon levity that day, and I did not care where I went; he took me over the bank into the fields, and when we got into the fields and he pulled out the book, he shewed me a receipt, and said, he could not read, but if I could read, I should look at the receipt; accordingly I took the receipt, and looked at it; I remember there was the name of Jones at the bottom, and a stamp; I had only read part of it, when the other prisoner came up, Burgess.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Burgess before? - A. Never; when he came up, he wanted to know our names, and what we did in the field; he took out a pocket-book, and said, he would make me suffer for trespassing on his ground; Harvey made him an answer, and said, do not be in a passion, we have found something, I will thank you to look at it; I said, I was an entire stranger, and if I had done any thing wrong in the fields, I was very sorry for it, and Burgess took the receipt, and said it was of considerable value, if the property was in the book; he then opened a book, and took out a square buckle, set with stones, wrapped up in cotton, with a piece of purple ribbon on it; he said, it was worth a considerable fight of money, and that his share-was eighty-guineas: after that Burgess asked the other man whether he could pay me eighty guineas; he said, no he could not, but he had an uncle a little distance off that would advance him the money; Harvey left me then, and went to a row of houses, but he went at the back of them, so that I could not see whether he went into one of them or not; Burgess staid with me till Harvey returned, which was in about a quarter of an hour; he said his uncle was gone into the city, and he could not get the money at that time; then Burgess made reply, and said, he would settle it; then Burgess took out three papers; he said, they were 10l. notes, but I was not curious enough to look at them; they had the appearance of Banknotes; then Burgess said to Harvey, I give this to you, which is 30l. and he said, the young man, meaning me, must give me his watch, and what money he has, and he was to keep the pocket-book, and that was to secure us all; I gave my watch and money into Burgess's hands, it was a silver watch, with a sleel chain, a seal, and two keys, one silver and one brass, a guinea, a half-guinea, and a seven shilling piece; I have never got any of it again; then there was an agreement for us all to meet at three o'clock, at a house near the lead mills; it was then as near as could be about ten o'clock; Burgess pretended to he owner of the lead-mills, and I was to go there, he told me his name, but when I came there, I forgot the name; I went immediately to the house, to enquire who was owner of the lead mills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Burgess to be the owner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find Burgess afterwards, or Harvey? - A. As near as I can say, about a fortnight after; I was in St. James's Park, and saw them both at a distance from each other, I had a ship-mate with me; I then went up to Burgess, and took hold of him, and said, he had my watch and money a few days ago; he asked me, what I wanted with him; I told him, I wanted my property from him again; I then said, I would have a constable; Burgess said, do not make any noise, and you shall have your property again. I then desired my shipmate to look after Harvey; and I went with Burgess and Harvey and my shipmate over the bridge to Lambeth, and there I got a constable of the name of Tunnicliffe, and he took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Burgess make use of any expression when you first saw him? - A. Yes; he said, d-n me, I dreamed, last night, that you would take me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure they are the men? - A. Quite positive, I knew them directly as I saw them; I saw the constable search them, and I saw two pocket-books taken from Burgess, he endeavoured to shove them under a woman in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice enough of them, to say whether either of them was the same pocket-book that had been produced to you? - A. I cannot say positively, but I think one of them was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the receipt or the book afterwards? - A. I cannot say I did, only at the Mansion-house, the Lord-Mayor read the receipt, and I saw the buckle.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the buckle at the first meeting? - A. I had, and when we were going to Lambeth, I gave it to Burgess to look at, he asked me to look it, and then he put it in his pocket, and never gave it me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, while you had it, enquire the value of it? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What was done with the receipt? - A.They kept the receipt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a seaman belonging to the Endymion? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a seaman? - A. Ever since I was fourteen years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. And how old are you now? - A. Twenty-six.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a native of this country? - A. I am a native of Harwich.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been pretty much used to walking in that part of the town? - A. No, I never was there before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240032"/>Q.You could read, you have been to school, I take it for granted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard of such things as these before? - A. I have heard very little of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw Burgess first, he was stooping to pick up something? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon its being picked up, you thought it was a good thing to have a share of what was picked up? - A. I did not say any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you mean to be entitled to your share of it? - A. I thought there was no value in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you expressed, at the time, that there was no value in it? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.And yet you agreed to take the buckle, and part with your money, though there was no value in it? - A. I said, I dare say there was no value in it.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you found it was worth 80 guineas, you thought it would be a very good thing to have that sum? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this thing being picked up, clearly not belonging to you, you very honestly meant to have your share of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Burgess did come up, the pocket-book was in Harvey's hands? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And then it was that the conversation took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The receipt expressed it to be of considerable value? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then Burgess said, naturally enough, if the thing is agreeable to what is stated in the receipt, it is of so much value, and you will be entitled to 80 guineas? - A. yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Having parted with your watch and money, and learned that you were entitled to 80 guineas, did not you part with your watch and money voluntarily? - A. I said, again and again, that I did not want any thing to do with it; I certainly did give him my watch and money.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Jacobs.) Look at that receipt, and tell us if you think that is like the receipt that was shewn to you? - A. I can swear that the receipt I looked at had the name of Jones to it, and a stamp, that is all that I can say about it; there is the name of

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I was never guilty of such a thing in my life; that man and another came and wanted to buy some halfpence, and I sold them to him by weight; I have got a witness to prove that I sold them by weight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Griffiths.) Q.Among the halfpence you took from Head, which he said he had from the prisoner, you found four shillings loose, not in paper? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then it is not an uncustomary thing for founders to purchase halfpence? - A. There is now a very great influx of halfpence; I bought a hundred weight yesterday for that purpose; a neighbour of mine bought a day or two ago eight hundred weight.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the name of your neighbour, who has bought eight hundred weight? - A. Mr. Martin, four doors from my own house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called nine witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure they were two different shillings? - A. Yes; I then reckoned the change out ready for her; I had a carpenter at work, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240035"/>I asked his opinion of the shilling, and when I returned to the bar she was gone; there was a man having a pint of beer in the house who is the street-keeper of the Ward, he rubbed it, and said it was a very bad one, and then he went after her; he has got the shilling, his name is Perry.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the shilling you received from the prisoner was the one that you gave Perry? - A. Yes; it was never out of my hand.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Frost. This is the shilling that she first offered me; I am very positive it is the same from a mark that I observed upon it.</p>

            , you were convicted of the crime of perjury at a former Sessions, which was fully proved upon you; but the judgment of the Court was respited upon a doubt being entertained whether the form of the indictment, upon which you were tried, was strictly proper. The indictment stated, that you committed the perjury in question at Guildhall in the City of London, and went no further. The Judges have taken this into their consideration, and, upon examination of all the precedents, it appears in former as well as later times, that the indictment has always laid the perjury to have been committed either in some Parish or Ward within the City of London, that not having been done in your case, <rs id="o17981024-1-punish308" type="punishmentDescription">
