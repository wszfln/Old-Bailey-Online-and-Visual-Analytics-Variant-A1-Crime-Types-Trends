                  </hi>. I am Russell's wife and live at 9, Station Road, Twickenham—about June, 1900, my husband and I applied to the Abbey Road and St. John's Road Building Society and obtained an advance of ₤600, and purchased No. 3, 4, and 6, Shirland Place, but now called 9, 10 and 11, Station Road—we have paid off about ₤250 of the mortgage—the houses became our joint property—Miss Beard became tenant of the sweetstuff shop at No. 10 with her sister just after Christmas, she having been previously in Mr. Volkman's employ—she was not regular in her pay<lb/>ments of rent—I reported to my husband that she was not a satisfactory tenant—I saw Mr. Inman, Messrs. Umberstone's traveller, who supplied goods for the shop—Mr. Inman advised my husband to get rid of the Beards, and after inquiries Trowbridge took the business at the end of March, Miss Beard having left on April 3rd—I was a party to the arrange<lb/>ment with Trowbridge, which was put into writing—this is the agreement, dated April 13th—I knew Trowbridge as Franklin, and, after he had taken the business, as Beard, but not as Trowbridge till after his arrest—[<hi rend="italic">the agreement was for a payment of</hi>₤25, <hi rend="italic">in sums of</hi>₤15 <hi rend="italic">and</hi>10 <hi rend="italic">monthly instal<lb/>ments of</hi>₤1, <hi rend="italic">and a rental of</hi>₤20 <hi rend="italic">payable weekly or monthly for the house except one bedroom and a kitchen until possession could be obtained]</hi>—I received the ₤15 and paid it into the bank—goods were ordered of Umberstone for which I paid ₤8 4s. 6d.—those goods were put in the shop and included in the purchase—after April 13th my husband and I took no part in the business, but we carried on the laundry business at No. 9—on May 5th my husband came into the kitchen with a basket of eggs—after a conversation about them he went into the ironing room and put them in at the office window—he then went out, and was immediately afterwards arrested—before that I saw him standing at the front door looking at a commotion which was going on in the street—someone came out of the crowd and took hold of him—on May 16th I read a letter from Brixton prison in Trowbridge's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Miss Beard owed two weeks' rent at 12s. oil March 24th—at the time of the distraint three weeks were owing; my husband paid her ₤1, and we allowed her to take away her bedding furniture, and her sewing machine—there was not much left, about four chairs, a table, and a couch—36s. was owing besides the fees of levying—the previous tenant gave no notice; after we had given him notice on account of his bad language to his mother and others and complaints of disturbance—we had no tenant in view—I know nothing about an " inventor " coming—my husband would have told me if he had a tenant—our interests were about equal—I made no inquiries about Trowbridge—two rooms were reserved till possession could be obtained—Mr. Erreker occupied two rooms on the top floor—he left in pursuance of. notice about April 29th—he left a bed that my husband lent him money on—Trowbridge had been making inquiries about a week before the agreement was signed—a tobacco and sweetstuff business was carried on—we do our own repairs to the premises, and my husband minded the shop occasionally when Trow<lb/>bridge was absent—he did not write cheques for the goods—I heard nothing about a counterfeit half-crown previous to the arrest—I first heard about it at the police court—I have never kept a servant—my daughter was sometimes in the shop; sometimes she would serve—I heard nothing about counterfeit money in connection with her takings over the counter—I do not know Jewell—I saw him on one or two occasions leave No. 10—in the evening—the shop was open—I have not seen or heard of his being with my husband—I went to the police station the day of the arrest—my husband handed me a letter which has nothing to do with the case and another one, and this was allowed to pass—I know nothing about the memorandum at the back " See Jewell "; I do not know the writing—it does not look like my husband's—the letter was not stopped by the police any more than the banking book was—I do not know what the other writing on the letter is—I only know Jewell's address from what I have seen in the papers—I received ₤10 after the signing of the agreement from my husband—the expression that my husband and Trowbridge were joint owners must be a mistake in the police evidence—I do not think Trow<lb/>bridge said he was joint owner of the property.</p>

I am a commercial traveller of 24, Broadway Parade, Crouch End—I first saw the prisoner on Thursday, June 4th—I met him by appointment at Broad Street Station—there was a general conversation between him and myself and my wife, who had met him about fifteen minutes before I did—she introduced me to him, and explained to him that she had married me while he had been away—a letter had come to me which I had opened making the appointment—I knew that my wife had been married before—on June 6th I got another letter from him, asking us to meet him at his place, Canning Town—I and my wife went, but he did not keep the appointment—we returned home, and found him talking to my housekeeper—I invited him in, and he remained in the house for some time,—we were on friendly terms—in the letter he had written to me he said he was making arrangements concerning his boy, who was at school in Paris, before he returned to South America—the boy was the son of the prisoner and my wife—the prisoner told me he intended to return to South America—he had left my wife in Peru thirteen years ago—on June 6th he seemed to lose his temper, and finally said he would not go to South America, and would prosecute* his wife for bigamy—he left my house about 12 p.m.—I went out with him—we went down to Totten<lb/>ham Lane—I appealed to him not to ruin his wife a second time—I per<lb/>suaded him not to go to the police, and he returned to my house with me,</p>

               <p>he remained there until the following day, and left early in the morning—we were on friendly terms when we parted—I saw him again on the 10th—our interview was then friendly—he came with the idea of asking me to separate from his wife—he professed to have property in South America, and said he should be able to make a settlement on her of ₤100 a year—we chatted this over, and my wife took down the terms of the settlement—I said, " Of course, before anything is done, you must satisfy my solicitor and myself that you are in a position to carry out the proposals you make "—I wanted him to produce proofs—he immediately collapsed, because evi-dently he was not in a position to do what he proposed—we remained friendly until he said to his wife, " I will have you dead or alive; if you don't agree to what I wish I will shoot both of you "—I said, " If you attempt violence to either Mabel or myself I will shoot you like a dog "—he remained for some little time—we had a general conversation—he left my house about 10.30 p.m.—I walked with him as far as Crouch Hill Station, where we found that the last train to Canning Town had gone—I suggested that he should come back to our house and stay there—he did so—I got up about 6 a.m., but found he had gone—on June 11th I got this letter from him—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had drawn up his will; they his wife was to have</hi>₤50; <hi rend="italic">that as he had to fay for the drawing up of the documents, and owing to other expenses he was short of money; that he would leave for South America next week, and asked for</hi>" <hi rend="italic">two quid</hi>" <hi rend="italic">till Monday next</hi>. )—my wife's pet name is Bobs—on June 13th I was at home in the evening—about 7.30 p.m. the prisoner came in—we had a conversation—we were friendly—I had sent him a postal order for ₤1—when he came in he was very wet, and I insisted upon him taking his coat off—he had no overcoat or umbrella—I said, "Take your coat off and let it be dried"—he went downstairs to a spare room and took the papers out of his pocket, and I put his coat before the kitchen fire to dry—I went downstairs and bought a bottle of whisky, and gave him about a quarter of a tumbler, because he was shivering—he seemed thoroughly ill—we had a conversation, and he said, " I have seen Pethcot to-day, and Mr. Robert Gray was there also, and I have told him unless he pays me ₤300 by Monday I will lose him his position in the Cable Company "—I knew that he owed money—I said, " You hound, this is blackmail, I will have no more to do with you, put on your coat and out you go "—I went into the kitchen to fetch his coat, and as I came back with it on my arm, he fired his revolver at me—I could not see the revolver—there was a light behind me and one in the other room, but in the passage it was dim—I was dazed, and he fired a second shot—I felt the powder hit me—I jumped on him, and jumped on his head, and tried to stamp the life out of him—he then seemed very dazed and unconscious—I went for Dr. Hare.</p>

I believed Mrs. Griffiths was a widow when I married—her—she is a distant cousin of mine—I had only known her for eight or nine years—she says she was married to the prisoner in Peru, and lived with him there—I do not think he is an Englishman, I think he is a half-caste—the first time that I knew that he had turned up again was when I got the letter on June 3rd—he did not tell me that he wanted Mrs. Griffiths to</p>

               <p>leave me and go to him—I did not offer him money to go away and leave us alone, I was not in a position to do so—I tried to persuade him to go away, and he agreed that it would be best for all parties that there should be no scandal—there were no high words between us on June 6th, he only said that he had changed his mind, and would have his wife dead or alive—he also said that on the 10th—he proposed that Mrs. Griffiths should leave me and live apart from both of us, and that he would make her an allowance—I had not seen a revolver in his possession up to the time of his saying that he would shoot me and his wife—I did not then know that he had one—he had slept at my house on two or three occasions—nobody else had occupied the room where he slept between the time that he slept in it and the 13th—he did not go to his room just before he fired at me—I always thought he was rather peculiar in his manner—I believe he has something the matter with his right arm; I have never seen him use it-he did not seem to be in bad health—his mood did not change from time to time—when he came in on the 13th he seemed rather funny, he insisted upon knowing where I had been, and I thought it curious that a man in his position should dictate to me as to my movements—he did not seem excited—he seemed ill, and his teeth were chattering with the rain and cold—we did not have any cross words—he did not refuse to take the whisky I offered him, or make any trouble about taking it—he did not accuse me of insulting Mrs. Griffiths—when he shot at me he was wearing my dressing gown—I did not see the revolver in his hand, I only saw the flash—the shots did not hit me, the powder burned my hand, and my coat was torn—I do not know if it was done by the bullets, but it was not. torn before the first shot was fired—the second bullet struck the ceiling, and Dr. Hare picked it up—my sitting room is about 18 feet by 16 feet—the prisoner was standing in the doorway when he fired—I was in the door<lb/>way of the kitchen, and about 1 ½ yards away—Mrs. Griffiths was in the kitchen then—my housekeeper fetched the policeman—while he was coming the prisoner was lying on the floor: I would not allow him to get up—I did not know if he had any more arms on him—he was quiet then—he kept lifting his head to get up, but I kept shoving him back again—he lay there until the policeman came.</p>

I live at 24, Broadway Parade, and am Mr. Griffiths' housekeeper—oh June 13th, I was in the kitchen, about 9.50 p.m.—I heard the prisoner call to the prosecutor in a very pleading way—the prosecutor, Mrs. Griffiths, and myself were all in the kitchen—the prose<lb/>cutor went towards the dining-room, and I instantly heard a shot, and then another—I went out of the kitchen and saw the prisoner lying on the floor, just inside the dining-room—I had first seen him on the Saturday after Whitsun—I had seen him about four times—he and the prosecutor appeared to be on friendly terms—I saw a revolver lying on the floor about two yards from the prisoner—the prosecutor has a revolver; the one on the floor was not his.</p>

" he said, " These people have been taking advantage of me "—this revolver (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) was handed to me by Mrs. Griffiths—I examined it; there were two exploded and four intact cartridges in it—on the landing, some way from the sitting-room, I found a bullet; it was rather battered, and I did not test it to see if it would fit the revolver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journalist of 68, Torrington Square-on May loth I left the office of the " Daily Mail " about 9.40, and I got to Regent Street about 10.30—the prisoner said something to me to this effect, " Have not we met in Nottingham? "—I looked at him and said I did not remember meeting him—I have been several times in Notting<lb/>ham, but I did not remember meeting him—we talked about Nottingham and walked on together—he said he was staying with friends in Edgware Road, and asked me to go and have a drink—I went, as he seemed a very gentlemanly person and spoke very nicely—I had some lemonade, and he had, I think, some whisky—we left the public house together, and went strolling along, chatting about various topics—I omitted to say that I had seen him shortly before in a urinal in Vine Street—we continued walking in the direction of Edgware Road, and I said, " Where shall we go and have another drink? " he said, " Now you have come so far, come to my place and have something to drink there, " and I said, " Very well"—when we got to Chapel' Street, Edgware Road, he stopped out-side a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190306220021"/>
               <p>little sweet shop and said that was where he was staying—he knocked at the door; it was opened—we went in—he went upstairs to light up and came back—I then went upstairs with him into a bedroom—he said, " We have to pass this way, " and walked over to a lamp which was there, blew it out, turned round and flung me down on the bed, and snatched my watch and chain and cigarette case and put them in his jacket pocket—he then put his hand in my trousers pocket and took out everything I had, a card case and about 8s. or 9s.—he then got up, giving me a further push, and slipped out of the room—I thought it advisable not to call out, as it might bring him help instead of for me—I jumped up and looked round the room, and struck a match—he then came back, and with the same match relit the lamp—I thought it best to be diplomatic, so as to safely get out of the house and get him out too, so I said, " You have served me a dastardly trick, how much do you want? I suppose you have taken my things for money; name your sum; of course, you know you have left me with no money, but get my things and come with me and you shall have what you want "—he said, " No, I can't get the things to-night, they have gone entirely out of the house "—I stopped talking with him, endeavouring to persuade him to go and get them—he said, " Don't think I have taken the things because I am a bad man, I am not bad at heart; I have taken them because I am thoroughly hard up; if you bring me ₤2 or ₤3 you can get them back in the morning "—I went on trying to persuade him to get them—I said, " If you only want ₤2 or ₤3 in the morning, get them now and come with me and you shall have ₤5 "—that was in order to get him out of the house with the things, so that I might give him into custody—finding he would not get the things, I said, " Very well, come along with me and we will fetch the money and come back "—that was with the intention of giving him into custody—we went out. and I wanted him to walk either to Baker Street Station or Edgware Road, where I expected a constable to be, but he would not go quite so far in either direction—we got to Marylebone Road, and he stopped outside a public house and said, " Are you going to have a drink? "—I went in, so as not to let him go—when we came out I saw an inspector and constable: I seized him by the arm and called out, " Constable, constable, I want to give this man into custody "—he took no notice, probably thinking I was trying to <hi rend="italic">fool</hi>him—the prisoner then said, " If you want to give me into custody, give me into custody; I will come down to John Street Police Station "—I told him I was going to give him into custody for stealing my things—he then said, " In that case you won't get your things back at all, and I shall charge you with having come to my place for an unlawful purpose "—I said, " Very well, let us go to John Street Police Station "—he said, " You can go if you like, I shall not "—we walked back in the direction of Chapel Street, and I left him at his door—he went in, and I said, " I will bring you the money in the morning "—he said, " Bring what you like, ₤2 or ₤3, I will not be hard upon you "—we did not meet a constable all the time; there may have been one on the other side without my being able to distinguish, my glasses being broken—I then went in search of a constable—I found one,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190306220022"/>
               <p>and he referred me to John Street Police Station—I then went to John Street Police Station, and a constable was sent with me to the house—we knocked at the door, and eventually the prisoner came down—I said to the policeman, " This is the man who has stolen my watch, I give him into custody "—the prisoner said, " Liar "—he was taken to the station—on the way he said we should find he was a respectable man, and had lived at the house six years "—I am quite certain I had my watch, chain, and card case in my possession when I entered his room.</p>

Dear Sir,—Just a few lines to remind you I saw you turn a man with a chair out of your house, which I do not think was a proper thing to turn an invalid out, but I may tell you that I saw your wife down Victoria several times, and also I have seen her in the Enterprise public house with several different men drinking, and there is one of the men I have seen enter your house several times, and do not think your wife can call herself a respectable married woman to carry on the way she does, and I must say your house is a disgrace to the street, no other woman would carry on the same way as she does, and I think you ought to put a stop to it. Not only that, she is always taking different men into the house, which I thought about informing the police, because I think your house is nothing but a house of call for men—Yours faithfully, W.

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon, of 122, Clapham Road—for about six months the prisoner was my coachman; he lived in my house—on April 21st I dismissed him without notice because there was a robbery in my house, and he was suspected—I told him that I should dismiss him for that reason, and that if he called next day at 4 o'clock he could have his things—he called and got them and went away—I did not see him until the 21st—on May 20th I went to bed about 10.30—I was awakened about 2 a.m. by an electric bell which rings in my bedroom—I have also a tube to enable me to speak to anybody at the door—I spoke through the tube and said, " What is the matter? "—a voice said, " I want you to come to a very urgent case indeed "—I said, " Who is it for? "—he said, " It is at Camberwell, but I should like to see you first "—I did not like the idea of going to a strange case, and I said, " Who is it for? "—he said, " It is very urgent, I will pay you anything you like "—I got up and put on some slippers and a dressing gown, and went downstairs—there is an inner door before you get to the outer door in the hall—the moment I opened the outer door I saw a man—I did not recognise him then, he had hair on his face—he rushed in, and the first thing I saw was his right hand put up with a revolver in it and pointed at my head—I instantly seized his hand and a struggle began; it lasted about ten minutes—he struggled very violently—the revolver was still in his hand—I was trying to wrench it from him—there was a noise, I called for help, and my i wife came downstairs—I said, " Open the front door "—when I had first seized the man's hand I advanced towards the door, and he bumped it with his back and it closed—Mrs. Fox opened it—she returned to the dining room, got a police whistle, and went to the front door and blew it—: there were two men in the street, but they did not like to come up—Mrs. Fox said, " Won't you come and help? " but they put their heads behind a pillar—I at last got the revolver from the man and threw it on to the pavement 12 or 13 yards away—I then received a terrible blow on my left temple, which nearly stunned me, and I nearly fell—four or five men were passing outside—two of them came up, and we threw the man in the front passage leading to the hall—I had not recognised him then, but while he was still on the ground my wife said, " Oh, that is William "—I then recognised the prisoner—when he first came in, his coat was buttoned up, and he had a. beard on—when I recognised him the beard was "off—next day I had a black eye—the chief blow was over my temple, and there was a great deal of swelling; it lasted for about ten days—I had some other bruises and kicks also, and the skin was torn off my back in two or three places.</p>

" my husband said, " Open the door "—when I did so, it was light, and I recognised the prisoner; he had a black overcoat on; he had no beard—I got a police whistle and blew it; our present boy fetched the police—I saw my husband throw the revolver away.</p>

                  </hi>(<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant L.\amp\S.W. Railway Company</hi>. ) I was on duty on the evening of May 29th, travelling by a special train leaving Epsom at 8.55 p.m.—after the train had stopped at Wimbledon and gone on a little further I heard shouts of " Murder "—I looked out at the window and saw the prosecutor jump from the train on to the embankment at the side of the line—I jumped out to his assistance—he was as white as death; his trousers pockets were turned inside out, and he was bleeding from his cheek, nose, and mouth—I asked him what had happened, and in consequence of what he told me I went with him to a third class compartment—there were eight men in it, the prisoners being two—he said, " Those two men, " pointing to the prisoners, " have knocked me about and robbed me "—I said to them, " You hear what this gentle<lb/>man says "—they made no reply—one of the other men said, " He is a liar, " but who it was I cannot say—I put the prosecutor into another compartment, and locked the prisoners' compartment so that they could not leave the train—I afterwards telephoned to Waterloo to have special police in hand on the arrival of the train in case of any trouble—at Waterloo I handed the prisoners over to the police there, and they were taken to the police station and charged—the prosecutor was quite sober—he was trem<lb/>bling like a leaf and looked as if he had been very much knocked about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Taylor</hi>. The train travelled about 25 yards from the time the prosecutor jumped out until it stopped—it was stopped by a gentleman pulling the communication cord—I did not see any blood upon you.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Williams</hi>. I was seven compartments away from you—it was dark, but I could see the prosecutor jump—the carriage door was not shut between the prisoner jumping out and my speaking to you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of A. C. Palmer and Co., accountants, of 7 and 8, Railway Approach, London Bridge—I was appointed trustee in the prisoner's bankruptcy on June 12th, 1902—the petition was presented on May 15th, 1902; the receiving order was made on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190306220052"/>
               <p>May 20th; the statement of affairs was filed on June 3rd; and the adjudica<lb/>tion on June 12th—the assets disclosed are ₤287 17s. 5d., and the liabilities ₤3, 242 2s. 5d., showing a deficiency of ₤2, 954 5s.—in May, 1901, I was instructed by the prisoner to prepare a balance-sheet of his business—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is carried down to April 30th, 1901, and shows a surplus of assets over liabilities of ₤958 17s.—I considered that the prisoner was then in a solvent condition, and was making money—I received the prisoner's first cash account on June 30th—his public examination took place on July 18th, 1902, and was then adjourned for him to amend his cash account—I received the amended cash account on July 26th—the transcript of the shorthand notes of the public examination is signed by the debtor—he carried on a boot and shoe manufactory at 25, Commercial Road East, and for a short time a branch at Worsley Street—at the time of his bankruptcy he handed over to me a bought ledger, a sold ledger, bill book, bank passbook, and book of counterfoils, a manifold invoice book, and a copy letter book—he did not give me a cash book or wages book—</p>
               <p>I have examined the books he gave me, and I cannot find anything to account for a deficiency of ₤2, 954 5s.—the first cash account relates to the twelve months ending May 1st, 1902—in that twelve months the wages amount to ₤5, 875; ₤2, 750 for the first seven months, and ₤3, 125 for the last five months—in the first seven months there is a large surplus of payments over receipts, and in the last five months a large excess of receipts over payments—I also found receipts omitted, and errors in casting, amounting to just over ₤700—the cheques drawn to self or bearer during the same period amount to ₤7, 559 11s. 6d., ₤3, 646 11s. 6d. during the first seven months, and ₤3, 913 during the other five months—the second cash account extends over the same period as the first—the wages for the first seven months are put at ₤2, 884, and for the last five months at ₤4, 604 3s. 6d., making a total of ₤7, 488 3s. 6d., and ₤1, 613 3s. 6d. more than shown in the first cash account—the amount expended in raw material from May 1st, 1901, to May 1st, 1902, was ₤9, 072 7s. 3d.; the wages were ₤7, 488 3s. 6d., the trading expenses ₤1, 822, and the amount realised on sales ₤16, 535 17s. 2d.—on May 1st, 1901, he had stock in hand value ₤911 13s.; at the date of the receiving order its value was estimated at ₤200—according to his cash account the raw material is 55 per cent. of the price of the goods sold—I was present at his public examination before the Registrar—he then swore that he did not keep, and had never kept, a wages book. (<hi rend="italic">Extracts were then read from the shorthand notes of the prisoner's public examination</hi>. )</p>

The supplemental account contains the particulars of the actual cash receipts and payments outside the Bank pass book, and the amended account is a copy of the Bank pass book—they are both part of one account—I have known the prisoner since May, 1901—I do not think he is much of a scholar—when I made a balance sheet out for him in 1901 he did not give me a wages book—I have met several cases where wages have been paid by cheques, drawn to self—the prisoner's book debts were ₤758 15s. 3d. in May, 1902—I have not allowed anything for bad debt? because they are all with good firms—I have never heard of</p>

               <p>bad debts being put down at 40 per cent. in the boot trade—the machinery realised about ₤50, I think—the lease of the Commercial Road premises is not worth anything—at his public examination he said that he lost between ₤400 and ₤500 in his boot beading business, but he only takes credit for ₤62 in respect of it in his cash account—in the trading account I take exception to the last five items of wages; the first seven appear to be correct—he has given me every assistance in the administration of the estate, and outside this present charge I have no reason to complain of his conduct—in making out his second account I know he had the assis<lb/>tance of Mr. Wilson, an accountant—it is only my opinion that he did not pay the wages put down in the last five months—I form that opinion because the percentage is too high—he made very cheap boots—the expense of making a cheap boot would be higher in proportion than for making an expensive one—there was not a <hi rend="italic">slump</hi>in the boot trade from the end of 1901 till the middle of 1902—if he bought ₤100 worth of goods in a particular month it would not follow that he paid for them in that month—I do not know that l0d. is the wage per pair of boots, if it were, and the boots were sold at 1s. 5d., the percentage would be 60 2-3—I do not know how many hands he employed; the labour in the boot trade is piece work.</p>

I am manager to the Fay Scholes Company—on April 20th I went to 246, Kingsland Road, and saw the prisoner—I saw the machine which we had sent, on the table, the cover was off, and the machine had apparently been in operation—246, Kingsland Road is a residence, but the prisoner used the front room on the ground floor as an office—he stated that he was a cigar merchant and caterer—there were papers about and one or two desks—his name was not up outside—he apparently occupied the house—I—told him I had come to see how the machine was running—he said it seemed to be going very well—I got there about 11.30 a.m.—he said he liked it very much—there were some little points that he did not understand as to its working, which I explained—he said he had been recommended to try a Remington, but that he had heard of our machines and preferred them—he asked me what discount I would allow him for cash—I stated 5 per cent. prompt cash—he said he could buy a second machine, and asked if we could increase the discount if he bought two—I told him we would allow him 15 per cent. on each machine if he would pay cash for them both—he asked me what I considered cash, on the nail, or thirty days—I stated that if he paid in thirty days I would consider that as cash—he did not agree to anything then, and I went back to my office—I did not have another interview with him—he came to the office again, but I was out—Mr. Rockett, on my instructions, sent these, two invoices for two foolscap Fay Scholes, ₤44 19s. 2d., less 15 per cent. cash, ₤38 4s. 2d.—when I agreed to those terms I believed the prisoner was a respectable tradesman carrying on his business—I made some inquiries about him through a trade protection company—the credit expired on May 25th—in consequence of the Credit Index Company's report I wrote this letter, dated May 14th, to the prisoner.

Weinbaum and Company, who describe themselves as general merchants, at 21, Finsbury Street—I there found one of my typewriters—I do not remember the date that I went there—it was about May 20th—the credit had not expired then—the numbers on my machine had been removed—the number is stamped on the roller rubber, it has been cut out—it has been cut out of both these machines (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the name plate, which also has the number on it, has been removed—the plate is made of aluminium—the name is still on the machine, but the number, which is the only means of identifying it, is gone—each machine has a separate number, and when that is gone we cannot know when it was last in stock—the number is also put on the right hand forward foot—it has been filed down there, but not enough to destroy it altogether—in machine No. 2 the number there is untouched—I asked Weinbaum if they had had the second machine, but I did not get it then—on May 29th I swore an information at the Mansion House—the credit had expired then—I obtained a warrant, and the prisoner was arrested—he has never paid one penny piece off that account, or offered to pay—I believed when I parted with the machines that he was a respec<lb/>table man—I made no application for payment, I dealt with it as a fraud from the beginning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner and I agreed what the terms should be in case he bought—the two. machines were absolutely purchased on April 24th, but after we had made the inquiries we applied for payment before payment was due—in a way I had a right to do that because he sold the machine before he told us he would buy it—when I left the prisoner I thought he would buy the machine, but I was not sufficiently sure to invoice it to him—if in my opinion it had been a sale I should have in<lb/>voiced it to him that night—the invoice was not sent until the other machine was delivered—I think applying for payment before it was due would incline him to send back a favourable reply, because it was said that he had bought it under false pretences—if he was temporarily pressed for money and sold the machines, that, in this case, would be a reason why we should demand payment from him—I did not make any inquiries about his business between April 20th and 24th—he entertained me with a glass of ale and a cigar—I thought it was most unusual for a seller to entertain a buyer—I was satisfied with the evidence of his business at his place—it was on the strength of what I saw that I decided to give him credit and dispense for the moment with asking for other references—I saw my machine at Weinbaum's in the front office—I do not think it was in use, it had a cover on it.</p>

Harding on November 27th, December 2nd, and April 26th—it is new wire, and exactly similar to the wire we had at our" stores—I have heard the prices and quantities—the price is a fair one, ₤58 10s. 9d., maybe a little under, but it is nothing out of the way—the address of the City office is also over the door of the stores.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a landed estate agent of Spitalfields—I have known the prisoner about fifteen years—I have not been very friendly with him—he speaks English—I have not known Potoski; he does not speak English; he speaks German and Russian, but not Yiddish—I did not say at the Police Court that he does—I spoke to him in German when I met him—I have seen the prisoner and Potoski on two or three occasions at Mr. Hart's office—they were there when an affidavit was signed—I believe the prisoner understands Yiddish—I am sure he does not understand German, because I have tried to speak German to him—I translated the document to Potoski in the prisoner's presence, after which they signed it, and we all three went round to Mr. Turner's office, who gave me the oath to translate to Potoski—he gave me the book and I kissed it—I was not swearing the affidavit, it was an oath to faithfully interpret—I interpreted it to Potoski, and I had interpreted the sense of it to him before I went there, and the other parts I translated at Mr. Turner's office—they both held the Hebrew Bible and kissed it—I used a mixture of Yiddish and German, and interpreted to the best of my ability—Mr. Turner did not show them the document and ask them if the contents of it were true—he did not say, " Do you swear that the contents of this affidavit are true, and that that is your signature, so help you Jehovah"; I said that—I do not think Mr. Turner gave me the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner understands English, but Potoski does not, and I was there to translate to him—I had nothing to do with the prisoner till Mr. Cash, Mr. Hart's clerk, asked me to interpret—when I did not know a word in German I put in a word of Yiddish—the prisoner</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">BY THE COURT</hi>. First I was sworn as interpreter, and then Mr. Turner put a further oath which was not put to me—he spoke in English for me to interpret the words, and I translated them into a foreign tongue.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The two men were present when the oath was given to me to translate, and both heard the English words and also the translation—I translated in German, but the words I did not know I substituted English, it was about half and half—Mr. Hart was their solicitor—I was present when the instructions for the affidavit were given—they were given in German—I cannot say whether Mr. Hart read this affidavit in English to him or whether his clerk did it.</p>

I never saw anything about the prisoner to ` Road—I knew the deceased very well indeed—I have lodged in her house ever since I was a little boy—I remember the prisoner marrying Miss Sibley—on Tuesday, May 19th, about 5 p.m., I saw him outside 99—he asked me to have a drink—he also asked me to go and see his home at 1, Tree in Pound Lane—he said he had smashed it up, and wanted me to have a look at it—I went round—he occupied three rooms; I went into two of them—all the furniture and crockery ware was broken up—Mrs. Cooper was there—the prisoner and I were in the yard, and she was at her window upstairs—I said, " Jack, you are a fool for what you have done "—Mrs. Cooper said, " That is quite right, Harry; for what he has done, he called me a <hi rend="italic">rotter</hi>"—she came downstairs, and said, " What did you call your mother-in-law? You called your mother-in-law a sow, didn't you? "—he said, " Yes, and I will do so again "—I said, " You will not, Jack, in front of me "—I left the house a few minutes afterwards—next day, Wednesday, I went with the prisoner's wife to the Magistrates at West Ham—a summons was obtained by her, and I went with her to Tree in Pound Lane—the prisoner was standing at his door—he beckoned us over; we went over—he asked his wife to go indoors—she said, " No, not to be knocked about again "—he said, " All right, " and she went away towards her mother's house—I said to the prisoner, " Jack, you have put your foot into it this time, she has got a summons out against you—he laughed, and said, " I can always laugh at those people by the whistle of a ship "—I then overtook his wife—I next saw him on Thursday after<lb/>noon, May 21st, when he came to our house and saw Ernest Sibley, and asked him to have a drink—I accepted the prisoner's invitation, and went with him and had a drink at the Prince of Wales—I had two halves of mild, the prisoner had two halves of stout—the prisoner paid for it—we were in the public-house about ten minutes—I came out with him, and saw the deceased going up the street—the prisoner went across the road to her and spoke to her—I do not know what he said—he was with her two or three</p>

I did not hear any words before or after the shot was fired—when the knock came at the door I was sitting farthest away from the door, and on the opposite side of the table to the door—Ernest was sitting on the same side of the door, and on the opposite to where I was—there was only about a minute between the deceased going to the door and the shot being fired—Ernest got to the door before I did—I did not notice any chopper or anything at the prisoner's house—the furniture appeared as if it had been chopped up—I said to him, " You must be mad, Jack "—he boasted of what he had done—I thought that was strange—he did not seem to be drunk or in a passion—when he asked me to go and see how he had chopped up his furniture he seemed quite quiet—he looked me in the face—he did not look as if he had been drinking, except what he had with me—Tuesday was the first time I saw him to speak to after he came hack from sea—he talked rationally, and walked along with me sober enough—when he was on the floor he seemed quite quiet as far as anything he said—he was not struggling when he said, " Let me turn on my side, Harry "—I saw him struggling with Ernest—I had not much difficulty in getting the revolver away from him—his conduct did not appear to be strange—I knew that the shot from his revolver had wounded Mrs. Sibley—it seemed strange that he should be so cool—if he had not known that he had hit anybody, and if the revolver had gone of! accidentally, I could understand him saying, "Let me turn on my side, Jack"—I was present on Thursday when Ernest and the deceased were talking to the prisoner at the door—the prisoner wanted his wife to pack his bag—the deceased said something about his having done it for himself when he lodged with her—I do not think I heard what he replied.</p>

               <p>Pound Lane—we occupy part of the house, and the Prisoner and his wife the rest—on Sunday, May 17th, we were away—on Monday, May 18th, in the morning, the prisoner called me down into the kitchen, and said, "Have you heard about our row? "—I said, "No, what is it all about? "—he said, " I said to my wife, ' I suppose you want to go and carve the dinner for the lodgers; ' she said, ' No, I don't, there is someone there to carve it'"—he said no more, but went into the yard—he was pointing to a stone cross in the yard, and saying he was not satisfied with it—he had bought it—it was to go on a grave, but I don't know on whose—I think he meant that his wife was not satisfied with the cross—he called the old lady a wicked old bitch—he said he had asked Mrs. Sibley to sleep with him before he had married her daughter—I said whatever the mother had done was nothing to do with the daughter—he made no answer to that, and I went upstairs—I saw him next day, Tuesday—he was in the yard, about six o'clock, with Rouse—I <hi rend="italic">were</hi>upstairs—I heard Bouse say to the prisoner, " You are no man "—I said, " Hear, hear, he is no man; he called me a <hi rend="italic">rotter</hi>"—I came downstairs, and said, " What did you call your mother-in-law?

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. On the Tuesday morning the prisoner apologised to me for what he had said, and said he was in drink when he said it, and was not responsible for it, and he would apologise 100 times over if necessary-he called me a <hi rend="italic">rotter</hi>at the same time that he referred to the deceased offensively—that was about 8 p.m. on Monday—he was then drunk—on the Tuesday he apologised to me in front of my father—he seemed very quiet—between 12 and one midday he came in and said, " Oh, Missis, quick, quick, I am shot; I am dying, I am dying "—my husband answered him—I did not ask him what he meant—when my husband spoke to him he only laughed—my husband said to him, " All right, old man, don't <hi rend="italic">peg</hi>out until I have had my dinner." I did not notice anything about him on Wednesday—we bolted the door on Tuesday night, and the prisoner must have gone out over the fence, because when my husband came down in the morning the door was still bolted and the prisoner had gone out—the prisoner came in by the field and over the fence because the children were mobbing him so—it was known about the place that he had broken up his furniture—he knew what he was doing, and said he meant to do it—I was in the house when he was doing it—we went down to try and stop him, he was then in the act of doing it—he used a chopper and a hammer—he was not shouting—he locked himself into the room first—when we talked to him he unlocked the door—we told him it was better to sell the things than to break them up—he said he would do as he liked, he was in his own place—I did not stand talking to him—I saw him through the door for a minute, and then I went away—he spoke in his own tone, he was not excited—the only noise was the noise of his hacking the furniture and the falling of it about the room—he began about 7 p.m.</p>

               <p>on Monday, and he must have been going at it up to 11 o'clock; it was getting very late, because the police said they would have locked him up for annoyance if it had been later, but he was not disturbing us before we went to sleep—the police went up and saw him doing this about 11 p.m.—there was a crowd outside, you could not get near the house—the prisoner asked the police to come and see his broken furniture—I did not hear what they said to him, as I was in the street then—my father lived with us—he did not say to the police, " Why don't you lock him up, why don't you take him away? "—I went for the police for protection, because I was then alone in the house—I was in the street, I heard a smash; the prisoner had thrown a kettle through the window, and I ran off for the police at once, with my baby in my arms—my husband went down to see if the fowls were ail right—the prisoner called out, " Are you there? "—my husband said, " Yes, " and the prisoner threw the kettle through the window—I was in the street—I thought he was hitting my husband, or something, so I ran off for the police—next day people were following the prisoner about and hooting him in the street—that went on right up to the time he <hi rend="italic">done</hi>the crime—when the prisoner first came home from sea he seemed a very civil man—he took his wife about, and they seemed a very happy couple—when he came home on the Thursday morning, a week previous, he seemed very nice to my idea, he was very sociable to his wife, and taking her about and buying flowers and one thing and another for her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>.

" that was when I saw all the furniture was smashed up—he said, " I do not know, I have smashed up everything, everything has got to go; my wife, " or " my old woman, has taken away the pictures, so I cannot get at them "—he asked me to look for the seaman's advance note—he appeared to be dazed; I took him to be mad—when he said he intended to have his revenge, I said, " What are you going to do? " but he seemed to be in such an excited manner, which I took to be madness, and he had this knife in his mouth, and grinned, that I did not quite hear what he said—when he found the advance note he gave a shout—he wanted me to give him ₤1 for the advance note, which was for ₤2 if he joined his ship that night, otherwise it would be void—I did not give him ₤1 because I heard he was not going to sail that night—the other ₤1 was to come off the rent that he owed—I tried to humour him, because I saw the condition he was in—it made me feel I was in a perilous position—I thought I should not be safe with him.</p>

"—he brought the knife down, he felt the blade, and said, " Ah "—he then ran out of the house—the police were outside, they saw him, and I thought that they might know that he was mad—I did not tell them what he had been doing—I thought</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner at Ilford—on the afternoon of May 28th I was called to the police station, where I saw the body of a newly-born male child; it was not very dirty and not very clean—there were no marks of violence upon it except some tape round its neck, which was wound round four times and tied at the side—the afterbirth was also there, the cord not having been severed—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mort m</hi>examination of the body—I believe it had had a separate existence, but I cannot say that it had—it was born at or near full time—apparently no attention had been paid to it at birth—it had not been washed—later in the afternoon I saw the prisoner—with her consent, I examined her—I came to the conclusion that she had recently been delivered of a child</p>

I did not go home again, I slept at a woman's house that I met that night. I returned home on Tuesday night and slept in the w.c.; I went indoors next day "—on seeing the apron she said, " That is mine."—whilst waiting to go before the Magistrate next day, she commenced to talk—I again cautioned her—she said, " It fell down the w.c. pan and wriggled about. I took it out and tied the tape round its neck. I put it under my skirt and went across the field and put it under the manure heap."</p>

"—Wilson replied, " It is all right, Miss, we have seen the lady "—there is a lady, but she is away visiting—the prisoners ran up Sheen Lane as fast as they could—I chased them as far as I could, then I went down to the corner of Sheen Lane and lost them—I saw a constable and told him—when I saw Adams coining out of the gateway he was writing in a pocket book with a pencil—they were at the gate when I spoke to them—on May 24th I was at Barnes Police Station, and picked Wilson out from eight or nine others—on May 25th I was at Mortlake Police Court, and I recognised Adams among four or five other men.</p>

I am a domestic servant, and now live at Wimbledon—in May I was living at Kingston—I was at that time out of a situation—I have known the prisoner since just before Christmas—I have been walking out with him—we said we would get married—he said he had got no friends at all—I did not know that he was married—we were talking about being married since January—I am in the family way by him—I had told him of that—when we were married we were going to take a milk business—I was going to pay ₤50 and he ₤100—I had ₤50 in the savings bank—he said he had ₤103 in the Post Office Savings Bank—on May 28th I drew my ₤50 out, and on that day met him in the Claremont Road, Surbiton, by appointment—I had agreed that I should take my ₤50 with me, and he said he would bring his money—he overtook me about 7.30 p.m.—we passed the time of day and went straight to the station—we waited about twenty minutes for a train to Wimbledon—while we were waiting he said, " Have you got that? " meaning the money—I said, " Yes "—I asked him if he had got his—he said, "What have you got it in? "—I said, " I have got it in a little bag "—he said, " What in? "—I said, " In paper money "—I had put the bag on the top of my stays inside my bodice—he said he had not got his money, as he had sent the wrong number on his withdrawal order, but that he had sent another order and should get the money, no doubt, the next day—we went to Wimbledon because he said there was a business to be let near the common—we went straight up the hill to look for the milk business which was to be sold—he pointed two or three out—they were all shut up—we did not see anybody at any of them—he said, " The common is close, " and we went for a little walk on the common—it was then about 8.50 p.m.—he wanted to know if there were not lots of bushes on the common—I said no, but there were some a long way out—he did not say why he wanted the bushes—then he suggested walking to Raynes Park Station—I said no, we should get home too late, and it would be dark, and we should not know the way—he said, " Very well, we will go back to the station "—when we got on the</p>
