On the 22nd of January, a little after nine o'clock in the morning, I received information from an officer, and missed this flannel; I went to Guildhall directly, and saw the two prisoners in custody - I saw seven pieces of flannel there, which I am certain are ours; they are worth about 23l. - they were kept in different parts of the warehouse - I had put part of them by myself the night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do not you know that at the time Crane was in your warehouse, that Saggers was not there, being ill? A. I do not know that; Saggers has been occasionally ill - I will not swear Crane was not employed part of the time of his being ill; I did not employ him - I believe Saggers has been ill for a fortnight or three weeks at a time. Crane could not be in our employ as extra porter while Saggers was ill, because he could not be there without Saggers employing him - our warehouseman is here; we have a clerk, who is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not be employed part of the time that Saggers was ill? A. He might, but it would be extraordinary - I should think it impossible; I will not swear it- he could not be in our employ unless Saggers employed him, because he always employed the extra porters; he generally does - if he is on the premises he does it: Crane never was employed by any body else, I am certain - I will swear that; nobody but myself, Saggers, and the warehouseman employ extra porters, as far as regards Crane I think I am right - Crane was never employed by any body except by Saggers; if Saggers was away we must, of course, employ an extra porter - nobody but myself and the warehouseman employed them; I will not swear Crane was never employed there when Saggers was ill, I do not think he was - the warehouseman is here to tell you; we have not two warehouses in London - we have an upper and lower room in the same house, but not two establishments; we serve customers in Cheapside, both wholesale and retail, but never send goods there to be sold retail on our account, I swear that - they could not be sent without my knowledge, unless they went the same way as these.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask Saggers to go to Guildhall, without taking him into custody? A. I did, and he went - I do not know whether it was willingly; he did not manifest any unwillingness, but I cannot tell what passes in a man's mind - I told him to go for the purpose of identifying Crane, who was in custody; he went without making any objection - the Magistrate was not sitting, and he was at liberty; he had not been taken into custody: he went again willingly, at my request, in about half an hour - he knew I had charged somebody with stealing the goods; he was examined and detained - he denied all knowledge of Crane: he has been in our employ three years - he lived in Philip-lane; I went to his lodgings, but found nothing there of ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you or the warehouseman attend to the business? A. We both attend; I do not know which of us is most employed - I cannot state any time at which Crane was employed; it must be within two years or two years and a half - I will not be confined to two years and a half; I have seen him on the premises, but cannot say when; I will swear I have seen him on the premises, my present warehouseman was then in my employ - we have been in business in London nearly three years; I will not swear to any time; I will swear it is within the last three years, but I recollect seeing Crane there, coming with a knot, and putting it aside - I know him well, and Saggers must have paid him - he always paid the extra porters; if he was ill we must have paid them; I never paid Crane.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say about how long it is since you employed him? A. I cannot tell - I have seen him on the premises.</p>

On Friday, the 22nd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180004"/>of January, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I met Crane in Whitecross-street, nearly opposite the prison wall - he had a load on his back, tied up in a sheet; I asked him where he was going with that load - he had it very loose on his head; he said he was going to Islington with it - I asked if he had got an invoice of the goods; he said No: I told him to bring them over the way to Harris' public-house, where I deposited the goods, and took him to the Compter; he did not say how he came by them, or whose they were, nor ask why I took him, but went with me directly - the sheet contained seven pieces of flannel; I inquired at different houses - I saw the prosecutors the same morning, about half-past ten o'clock; they saw the goods at Guildhall, and claimed them - I saw nothing of Saggers till I went to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>HENRY WESTON. I am warehouseman to the prosecutors. About half-past nine o'clock on Friday morning, the 22nd of January, Salter came to the door, and produced a wrapper, which I could not swear to; I afterwards saw the goods at Guildhall, and can swear to their being the prosecutors' property - I cannot say when I had seen them last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you swear these goods have not been sold? A. I can swear I never sold them; Mr. Tweedale sells goods, and occasionally Saggers and the clerk; the clerk is not here - I cannot swear he had not sold them; he is in our service now - his name is John Brenan; we have had another clerk within the last three years - our manufactured goods are never sold with a private-mark on them; other goods have been sold with the private-marks - I know of no place in Cheapside, or any where else, where goods are sold on my masters' account; we have a manufactory at Rochdale; four persons were engaged in the warehouse at this time, Saggers, Mr. Tweedale, the clerk, and myself; no other porter was employed at the time - I did not miss the goods till the officer showed me them; I could see the goods were taken from the holes - we missed them after the officer came; unless the officer had brought them we might never have missed them, our stock is so extensive; I might have supposed them sold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been warehouseman to the prosecutors? A. About three years, since they have been in London; I have some slight recollection of Crane, but cannot swear I have seen him on our premises.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was employed as extra porter must you not have known it? A. No, I am out of town a good deal.</p>

            . I live at a wine-vaults, No. 110, Fore-street, Cripplegate. On the morning of the 22nd of January, Crane came into the shop with a load on his back - he put it down on the stool, and called for a glass of gin and spruce; he asked me to help the load on his back - I did so, and asked him if it was cloth; he said it was, and he was going to Shoreditch with it; I lifted it on his back, and he went out - I have known both the prisoners for the last two years, coming for spirits; Crane was quite alone in our shop; an officer came and made inquiry - I saw Crane in custody at Guildhall on the following Monday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far is Fore-street from the White Swan, Bunhill-row? A. About half a mile - it was about half-past eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. TWEEDALE. I am certain this is our flannel; I put this piece by myself the night before, in the upper warehouse, which is part of the dwelling-house where I live - that piece is worth 8l. 15s.; the whole is worth 23l. - I believe the wrapper to be ours; Saggers said himself that it was.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate that you thought it was not your's? A. Never - it has Leach on it.</p>
               <p>Crane's Defence. I met a man who employed me; he looked like a porter, and wore a long frock coat - I met him in Cripplegate-buildings; he asked me to carry the load to the top of Goswell-road - he gave me 6d., and said he would overtake me at the top of Goswell-road, and give me the other 6d.</p>

            . I live at No. 99, Britannia-street, City-road, and am a commercial traveller; I am acquainted with Crane's person - I have been in the habit of meeting him at the White Swan, Bunhill-row. On the 22nd of January I had occasion to meet a person at the Bird-cage, Wood-street; I breakfasted at McLellan's, at the end of Wood-street, and saw Crane in Cripplegate-buildings - it was just after eight o'clock, for while I was at breakfast some hot rolls were brought in; Crane was at that time selling goods in the silk trade, and haberdashery, and I believe travelled with them - he was talking to a person in Cripplegate-buildings, and standing leaning on a post by Deacon's warehosue; only one person was with him - a short man in a fustian jacket had the parcel; Crane had not got it - the other person had it leaning on the post; I could not hear what passed because I was not near enough - they appeared in conversation, and had I not seen him in company with another person I should have spoken to him - after they had conversed together for some time, Crane took up the parcel, which had been carried by the other person, and went towards Whitecross-street, towards Fore-street - had he been going the other way it would most likely have been the same way as myself, which was up Wood-street; the person talking to him had the parcel before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not see where that person got the parcel? A. Certainly not - it was a large bundle, packed in a coarse cloth; I was the length of this Court off - I was coming out of the coffee-shop, and saw him standing by Deacon's warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first had possession of the parcel you do not know? A. No - I cannot say whether any name was on the wrapper.</p>

            . (in continuation) It was much about the size of that wrapper - Crane went towards Whitecross-street; the other man turned up towards Monkwell-street - I did not go and speak to Crane, for my time was up to be at the Bird-cage.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did you hear Crane was taken up? A. Either on the Tuesday or Wednesday following - this happened on the Friday; I mentioned this to the landlord of the house I use, the week after he was taken; I did not attend the examination; I did not know he was committed till I saw it in the newspaper - his wife having heard what I stated, asked me to come forward on the trial.</p>

             re-examined. The parcel weighed about 1 cwt.; I stopped him at the gateway of the King's Arms, Whitecross-street, nearly opposite the prison - there is no post about the spot Taylor describes, where a load could be rested on - they are all high gas-lamps; I am not quite certain of that.</p>

            . I am an officer of Walbrook. About seven o'clock on the evening in question, I received information that a window was broken in Budge-row - I was on duty; I pursued, and apprehended the prisoner in Size-lane, about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's house - I took him to the house, and then to the watch-house; I searched him, and in his hat found this writing paper, and a crooked wire, this is note paper - the wire would draw any thing out of a shop, or perhaps a gentleman's pocket, or go through a bolt hole; he gave no account how he got the paper - it was claimed by Mr. Douglass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear him claim it? A. Yes; I have been twisting this wire since I found it - I did not hear Douglass say any thing about a private mark on the paper; he claimed it as his, and said he had lost it from the window - it was loose, and not in any wrapper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you found the wire in the prisoner's hat, was it fixed to this bit of stick, as it is now? A. Yes, and the hook was at the end of it - I have only bent it in the middle.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This would hook out a quire of paper, would it? A. I do not suppose it would; the wire has been nealed in the fire - it would not make a mark unless it was dirty.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH DOUGLASS. I saw this paper next day at the Mansion-house - it is small note paper, and is mine, there are four quires and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe there is no water-mark on it? A. There is on some of it - here is, "Simmons, 1827;" he is an extensive maker - it is the same make, and the same stamp as mine; I always have mine stamped"Superfine Bath."</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have claimed it if you had seen it on the table of an inn ten miles off? A. No, certainly - I might have bought it six months before; I have taken stock since, and have not sold four quires and a half of this altogether; I value it at 1s.</p>

            . I live at No. 20, Tooley-street - I am now out of place; I lived with an optician. I was in Budge-row on the 2nd of February, and saw two men at Mr. Matthews' window, and as I walked past I heard the glass crack: that was while the two men were at the window - I walked back, and saw one man put his hand in and take out some paper; the other man said to me,"How do you do?" I saw the man who took it at the Mansion-house two days after, and knew him again - it was the same man as put his hand into the window; the prisoner is that man; I gave information to an officer who I saw in the street, and was present when he laid hold of him - I am sure he laid hold of the same man as put his hand into the window; I did not lose sight of him before the officer took him - the other man ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to say, the next time you saw him was two days after at the Mansion-house? A. Because they did not come for me to go there the next day; I saw him taken, and had never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you went away to get an officer? A. I was going home, and told the officer; I left him by the window; I found the officer about two hundred yards off; I turned my back on them to go to find the officer - I lost sight of them during that time; I mean I never lost sight of him while we were running after him - I had never seen either of them before they were at the window; I did not stop at the window - I walked on; I did not walk very quick; I was about five minutes going to the officer- both the men wore hats; the other had a red neckhandkerchief, and had got it round his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid more attention to him than to the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180006"/>soner? A. He came up and spoke to me; I observed him the most - I do not think I could swear to him if I saw him, but I saw the prisoner at the watch-house, and saw him running away; he could have got away if he liked while I was going for the officer - I am turned thirteen years old.</p>

            . I saw the paper at the Mansion-house; it appears to make up the quantity missing, as near as I can judge - I am sure about that quantity of paper was there about five o'clock, after that I cannot state; it was not in any wrapper - there was an outside quire, which is very much soiled.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does nobody but yourself sell in the shop - does not your wife? A. Occasionally - she is not here; I had been at home from five o'clock - whatever is sold is entered in a book, which is not here - it is possible for a trifle not to be entered, but I do not call a quire of paper a trifle - it is 1s. a quire; it would come to 4s. to sell retail - I have no mark on it; no doubt there are thousands of quires of the same sort.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had any of this paper ever been sold? A. No - that portion of paper had never been disturbed.</p>

            ; she lives there - it is a public-house; we have only one room. On the 23rd of January I left the room about five minutes to nine o'clock, leaving nobody in the room - my father went out at eight o'clock; the door on the stairs was fastened with a bolt - the street door was shut, and fastened with a spring lock; our room door was only on the latch - the door on the stairs opens by undoing the bolt with a wire; I went to meet a society at the Fox and Hounds, Hare-street, and returned at a quarter to twelve o'clock; I came home first - the street door was fast, as I had left it: I went into the public-house, part of the house, and asked them to unlock the street door for me, which they did; the street door leads up to our room, without going through the public part of the house - there is a private door to the house; they opened the door, and I went in - I went up to the door on the stairs, tried to undo it, and found the bolt was not there; I went down stairs for a light, went up again, and found the bolt and staple laying on the stairs inside the door - the staple and bolt had been forced off; I found no instrument there which could have done it: I went into our room, and the first thing I saw was my box wrenched open, and all my things taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any body get to that room if the street door was fast? A. They must have come through the public-house - there was no other way, except through the street door, which was on the spring lock; that might be opened with a key: I missed all my clothes out of my box - my father's box and drawer were opened; I missed two coats, worth 3l. - one of them was nearly new - two pairs of trousers, worth 2l.; I had only worn one pair twice - they cost me 36s. - two waistcoats, worth 1l. and a shirt, worth 3s.; my box had been locked - I found it broken open - the further part of the room was covered with handkerchiefs and things taken out of the drawer and boxes and strewed about; I missed a suit of black clothes and other things of my father's - I had not seen them myself; the box was open, and every thing taken out - that box was not locked before: I sent for my father, who came in a few minutes - I have seen a pair of trousers, a shirt, and a handkerchief since.</p>

            . I am a constable of Worship-street office. In consequence of information I went with Waters after the prisoners to No. 1, Scott-street, Bethnalgreen, and in the back parlour I found, hanging on a line, these trousers, which I produce, and laying on the table was a great quantity of housebreaking implements, and among them a small crow-bar - we brought them away, and went to Mrs. Honson's house; I examined the door which had been forced - it appeared to have been done by a small crow-bar; I fitted the crow-bar which I found in the room to the marks, and to the edge of the door, and it fitted exactly - it also fitted the marks on the box up stairs - Lamey, Jun. identified the trousers; after that we received further information, in the evening, from nine to ten o'clock (this was Monday, the 25th), went to the White Hart and Fountain, Rosemary-lane, and found Richards in company with about one hundred persons, and from the description we had received we took him down to the bar parlour, and told him he was charged on suspicion of breaking open the house of Mr. Lamey, No. 8, Nichol-street, Bethnal-green; I did not say it would be better or worse for him to confess - he said he was very sorry, it was nothing but distress caused him to do it, and being over persuaded by other persons; I told him we had found a pair of trousers at his lodging, No. 1, Scott-street, Bethnalgreen (I am sure I said his lodging.) which had been identified by young Lamey; he said nothing to that; I asked how long he had lived there, and he said nearly five years; we took him in a coach to the office - the landlord of the house gave us every assistance, and behaved very well. On the Monday following, the 1st of February, Burdett was brought to the office by a constable of Spitalfields parish, and having received information, I detained him.</p>

I am a Police-officer, and went with Attfield to No. 1, Scott-street; the street door was fastened - we knocked, and a person named Riches, who lived up stairs, let us in; she pointed out a room to us, which we went into - I found on the table these skeletonkeys and these picklock-keys (producing two large bunches) - I also found this crow-bar, which I fitted to the door myself, and Attfield fitted it to the boxes; the marks exactly corresponded - I do not swear it was done with that crow; I also found this lantern, covered with a piece of leather, a centre-bit, and a great quantity of other tools - I was searching in the room when Attfield took the trousers off the line; I afterwards went to the White Hart public-house, and found the prisoner Richards, in company with about a hundred persons; I am certain nothing was said to induce him to say any thing; Attfield told him he was charged with robbing the house of Mr. Lamey, No. 8, Nichol-street - he said it was distress, and he had been led into it by others; I told him we had been to his house, No. 1, Scott-street, and found a quantity of housebreaking implements on the table; he made no answer - Attfield asked him if he lived there, and in my presence he said he had lived there five years.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I apprehended Burdett on Saturday, the 30th of January, at the Frying-pan, Brick-lane - Cox was with me; we took him to Spitalfields watch-house, and searched him - he pulled 4s. and a duplicate of a shirt out of his pocket, with the name of Bradley, Brown's-lane, on it; I went there, and found a shirt pawned for 3s. - Lamey's son claimed it; I went to Bullock's, and found a silk handkerchief, which I have here; I took him to the office on the Monday following.</p>

            . I know the prisoner Sales - I also know Pelser; I remember the night of Mr. Bowles' robbery - before that I saw Pelser at the Crown, New-cut, Lambeth; we had some conversation, and I agreed to meet him at the White Lion, Wych-street, and did so; I went there by myself, and the next day I went to a house in Shire-lane, by Temple-bar - that was the day after I was at the White Lion, and the Crown in the New-cut; I met Henry Wood and Pelser at Shire-lane - Sales did not go with me then; I took him afterwards - I went to Sales' house in a day or two after I had seen Pelser; I went in consequence of what had passed between me and Pelser - I saw Sales, and he went with me to Shire-lane - that was two or three days after I had met Pelser at the Crown; when Sales and I went to Shire-lane, we met Henry Wood and Pelser there; two women came in and then went out -Pelser, Sales, Wood and I were in the room together; we shut the door - Wood said he knew of a thing as good as a gift, that he could get a great deal of wedge meaning silver; the conversation went on as to how they were to go down to the place to get it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was a proposition made to go down? A. Yes - it was made by Wood, Sales, Pelser and myself; Wood and Sales said they thought it would be the best way to go down in a gig - we had no money to pay for a gig; Pelser said he would pawn his watch to raise the money - we separated that night, to meet next afternoon at three o'clock, in Shire-lane; I went out with Pelser next morning, and he pawned his watch for 1l., at Higginbottom's, New-cut; we then went to a livery-stable in Wellington-street, Blackfriars-road, where Pelser deposited 6s., as he told me, but I did not see it; he came out and said it was all right, we had got the gig - he said so; I went from there with Pelser, to Sales' house, in Brandon-street, near the Kent-road - it is about a quarter of a mile from the Elephant and Castle- we saw Sales; Pelser and myself said we had left the money for the gig, that it was all right, and we were to meet altogether at Shire-lane, at three o'clock next day, to appoint the time to go at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at this time where you were going? A. No I did not; Pelser, Wood, and I met there at three o'clock next afternoon, but Sales was not there - Pelser and Wood lived in Shire-lane; I and Pelser went from there to get the money for the gigs back again, in consequence of what passed, and I believe at one place in the Waterloo-road, part of the money was returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were two gigs? A. Yes, at two different stables; we went to Sales' house, and he was not at home - we went back from there to Shire-lane, and met Sales at the door and a person with him who I had never seen before, named George Williams; Sales was in a passion, and we said it was put off because he did not come to his time - he was in a great passion at that, and swore very much; he said he would be d-d if he would be played with by any b-r; Wood and Pelser came down stairs, and were alarmed at his being there, and we all five went away; Pelser and Wood said they would go and try to get the gig to convince him we had paid for them - we all five went to the livery stable in Blackfriars-road; Sales. Williams and I stopped at the corner of Wellington-street - Wood and Pelser went to the stable and got the gig - when we saw the gig coming we said it was all right; Wood and Pelser drove to the corner of Rowland Hill's chapel - Sales got into the gig there: Wood and Pelser were in - I and Williams were to walk to the Flower Pot, Bishopsgate-street, where they said they would wait for us; Wood gave me a shilling, and told me to give it to a coachman that would be there and in a little time a coach came up with Edmonton and Tottenham written on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get to the Flower Pot? A. Yes, and met them there; I and Williams stood there waiting for the stage - the others waited at the corner, and said they wanted to get something which they were short of; I think it was poison; a stage came up with Tottenham and Edmonton written on it - we got on it, and stopped on the left-hand side, by a public-house on the road; I do not know whether it was Edmonton or Tottenham - the gig was at the door at the time; it was sometimes before, and sometimes behind the stage; I do not know the sign of the public-house - I pointed it out to the officers, and went in with them; I described the bar to be a round bar, and a very handsome machine in it - we got down there, and saw Wood, Pelser and Sales drinking something there in a glass; I think it was brandy and water - they got there before us; I and Williams had a pint of porter, a biscuit and some cheese - they took no notice of us at the bar - we all went outside together, and had some gin; the stage was waiting all this time - I and Williams got on it, the other three got in the gig, and we went to a house on the left-hand side of the way, with some pillars before it, where the stage stops - I have pointed out that house to Myers and Goff; we got down there - it is by a lane leading to Enfield; I think it was about ten o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180010"/>when we arrived at that public-house; the gig had not arrived - it came about five minutes after; Pelser came into the room, and said they were all ready - Sales and Wood remained in the gig; there was some joking in the tap-room while Pelser and Williams were there - after that Pelser took his seat in the gig; Sales and Wood were in it - Williams got on the step, and I ran behind; I sometimes laid hold of the gig - I should think the gig drove along three miles from the public-house; I should know the place where it stopped at - I saw it, and have not seen it since; it was a wooden gate - Wood got out of the gig, went in, and led the horse down the lane; there is a hedge on the right-hand side of the lane, and a wooden paling on the left; when the gig stopped there I had two phials given to me by either Wood or Sales, I cannot say which - I was to go down the town to a public-house Wood was to shew me, and where Mr. Bowles' servants were, I was to sing a song, ask them to drink, and to pour the contents of the phials into what liquor they (the servants) were drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know before that it was Mr. Bowles' servants? A. No - I have been told that since; I do not know whether Wood or Sales gave me the phials - they were both present; Wood told me he would describe the livery the servants wore - I refused to go, as I did not like it; I said the servants would be at home and in bed - I poured the contents of one phial out on the ground, and I believe I let the other fall on the ground; Wood said he would go and get some hay for the horse; he went, and I think Pelser with him - he returned with the hay.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time had you heard the chimes of a clock? A. Yes - at this time it was as near as possible half-past eleven o'clock; after the horse had the hay Sales said it was time to go and put away the type, which means the dog - I had not heard any dog there; Sales got a piece of liver out of some part of the gig - whether it was the pocket or not I do not know; he cut it into four pieces, cut a small piece out of each piece, and put something in mixed up about the thickness of mustard - the liver was tied up by Sales; I got a piece of string out of my shoe, as they had not string enough to tie the whole; Wood and another went to give the liver to the dog - I think Sales was the other; the dog barked very much first of all, but it was soon quiet - I could not see the house, but could see lights from the window; the house appeared about one hundred yards from the gate - they soon returned, and said the dog was quiet enough; Sales said it was quiet, and said if the dog could get any water he would go off, or burst, like a cannon - he made that observation directly, it was about half-past eleven o'clock; Sales said it was time to get the things out - he said it was time to go to work, and he began to trim a dark-lantern, which I think he had in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What things do you mean it was time to get out? A. There was a centre-bit, a crow-bar, a chisel, and this dark-lantern.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought these things? A. Williams had some in his pocket, and some Sales had in his pocket; they were all taken out - I saw them in the hands of Sales and Williams; they bid me stand by the horse, and not move - Sales, Pelser, Williams and Wood went away together, desiring me to stand by the horse and not leave till they returned; they were absent about two hours and a half, I think - I know it had not gone three o'clock; each came back loaded; as they came along I heard the tingle of something as it came along the fields, and I afterwards found it was a dial - it had two handles to it, and two of them carried it between them; they all returned together- there was a desk, four hats, two great coats, a white rug which might stand at a drawing-room door, and a decanter or water caraft; they were all packed up - I went into the gig first to help to pack them but they did not like the manner I did it; I was bundled out, and they packed the goods in the chaise; Wood and Williams got into the gig, and drove off - Sales, I, and Pelser were left to walk; the gig drove off - we kept up with it as long as we could, till it at last drove out of sight, and we stopped at a public-house on the right-hand side, as if it was in the main road - we had beer, bread, cheese, and onions there; I do not know any part of the road - I should know the house again; I have not pointed it out - I think it is about two miles from the gate where the gig had stopped; we remained at the public-house about twenty minutes, and met the gig a little below the public-house - it seemed as if it had come out of a lane below the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not overtake it? A. It was stopping about and seemed as if it had come out of a lane; Wood got out of the gig - Sales and Pelser got in; it drove off rather fast, and left Wood and me to walk - Sales was driving the gig; I walked with Wood about a quarter of a mile till we got to a bridge - I had occasion to stop behind, and Wood went as very fast; I did not see him again -I walked home as fast as I could; it was six o'clock when I arrived at Shoreditch church - I was very tired, and went from there to Brandon-street, where Sales lived; I got there about eight o'clock, and when I got into the room I found Sales, Wood, Pelser and Williams there -I was very much fatigued, and could scarcely walk; I threw myself down on the bed, and had a cup of tea brought to me - the place was all in confusion; the desk was broken open - there were papers and books, several purses and papers, and sealing-wax; there was a silver card case, which was engraved, but had no letters on it- I saw the dial, the great coats and hats, but I did not see a painting which was wrapped up in the rug.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was wrapped in the rug? A. I was to hand this rug up to them in the gig, and I could feel the glass in it; I saw the rug at the house - I saw some paintings at Sales' house, and have seen them since(looking at some) - there are no marks on these, but they were exactly like these; I have seen this bird before, and I have seen this one before - they are the very things I saw at Sales'.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Sales do any thing with all, or any part of them? A. These paintings were left alone - they were thought of little or no value; there was a box silver mounted, with a crest on it, and compasses and things in it: Sales and Williams rubbed out part of the crest -Sales and Williams took these with some other silver things away, and returned with 3l. odd shillings; Pelser went out with a great coat, and brought 1l. back - Sales gave me 1s. to go to buy two hat boxes; I brought them to Brandon-street, and took out two hats in them, one white and the other black, and was told to get what I could for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180011"/>them; to pledge or sell them, but not to bring them back; I took one to a pawnbroker's, Mr. Walmsley, London-road, where I had pawned on my own account before - that was a large white hat; I pledged it for 4s. - I pawned the other hat, a black one, for 5s. or 6s., and the woman I bought the hat boxes of had the tickets; I have since seen the same white hat - I should know it again.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the woman had the tickets, then you went back to her? A. I went back to her, and had two more boxes - I sold one of the other hats to the woman for 3s., the other was an old white one; I could scarcely get any thing for it, and left it with the woman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you taken four hats? A. Yes, but not altogether; I took out two first, and then returned to Brandon-street to fetch the other two - I bought two more boxes, and then got the other hats; one I sold for 3s., and left the other with the woman - I went back to Sales with the money; it was put together, and divided into five parts - each had 19s. 6d.; I do not think one divided it more than another - it was thrown on the table, and reckoned at 19s. 6d. each; each took up his money - the dial, desk and other things were left with Sales at the house; Sales said he had broken up the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by leaving every thing else at Sales' - do you mean the contents of the desk? A. Yes, every thing but what I have named; Sales told me Williams had taken the dial out, but it was stopped - I went to Sales two or three times afterwards; there was a book with an immense sum of money entered in it of annuities, and money, as much as 10,000l. at a time - I wanted that book to be sent back to Mr. Bowles.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to hear of Mr. Bowles? A. The name was on several papers - Sales said that was the gentleman, and that he lived in St. Paul's Church-yard; I think it was Carington Bowles; Sales said he would take care of the book and papers, he would not let any thing be taken out of the place - Sales was dressed that night in a large drab great coat, trousers, and a sort of engineer's coat; I should know the great coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Drab is not an unusual colour for a great coat? A. No, but I think I should know it if I was to see it - I should know it, for I have seen it when he has got it out of pledge: I follow the paper-hanging and painting business, and did so at the time of the robbery: I was not in employ then - I have not worked for a master, except Mr. Greenwood; I worked for myself - I have worked for Higginbottom, the pawnbroker, within three months: I hung paper for him- it may be within a month of the robbery; I had to paint and paper a room - that was not the last job I had before the robbery; the last was at the Crown, in the New-cut - I was employed there a few days before the robbery; I cleaned a house down for Mr. Webb - I owed him money, and received nothing for it; I had my dinner, breakfast and supper, which was set down against the little work I had done; I was a publican before I was a paper-hanger, and have had four houses - I failed as a publican in 1822; before that I was a gentleman's servant, and ceased to be so when I took the Castle tap in 1821 - I failed, to the best of my knowledge, the latter end of 1822, or it might be 1823; I had been in four different public-houses in that time - I went from school to be a servant; I was first with a cabinet-maker, and had 13l. a year - I left there to go to a gentleman's service.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you have been an honest man up to this time? A. I never had a stain in my character in my life; I knew I was going to do what was wrong, to rob a house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go against your will? A. I went down actually from want; I never intended to go into the house, but to look after the horse and gig - I would not have gone into the house, nor would I go to the servants; I went down with a view of holding the horse and gig - I knew I was doing wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give information of it till you were taken up? A. Yes, I told a person named Tucker that I had done it - I do not know whether he is here, for I did not know whether the trial would come on to-day; I mentioned that I was concerned, but never told an officer till I was taken up myself - I did not think I should be found out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not expect to be tried and convicted, when you were taken up? A. Yes, I certainly thought I should be convicted; it was not to save myself that I impeached other persons - I knew I was guilty; I had heard Wood was taken and hung, and I knew I was guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not do it to save yourself? A. No - I told voluntarily - I did not exactly expect to save myself; I thought it might go easier with me; I never had an idea that it would save me, but thought it might be lighter for me; I do not know exactly what situation I am in now - I am here to speak the truth; I do expect that perhaps giving my evidence may save me, but I should have told it if it would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell it before it was found out? A. I thought of course it would not be found out; if I had not been taken I do not think I should have said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your sole motive in telling of it to save yourself? A. No, it is not; every thing I have said is as true as that; I do not give evidence to save myself - I confessed openly and voluntarily - by giving evidence I hope for mercy, but do not know that it will save me - I do not expect it will save me, because I do not know what dangerous situation I am placed in; every man has a wish to save himself - I wish to save myself if possible, but I tell the truth: I am not swearing to save myself - I am speaking the truth: I know the meaning of wedge, by hearing several characters who came to my public-house mention it- I never knew type meant a dog before; I heard it from Sales' mouth - I did not ask him what it meant; I do not know that I ever heard it before; I might, but to the best of my knowledge I never did; I did not know where I was going, but knew it was about a robbery; I went to hold the gig - I would not assist in it; it was said I was to mind the gig - I certainly knew there was to be a robbery; they did not say they would give me part of the plunder, but I was to be satisfied for going down.</p>
               <p>Q. With part of the plunder? A. I was to be satisfied - I firmly believed I was to be paid out of the money they would get for the things which were taken; I never saw Wood before - I had seen Pelser several times; I was not intimate with him, but have drank with him - he used the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180012"/>Crown, in the New-cut; I had seen him there for the last five or six months - I had never seen Williams before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not agreed before you went down that you was to have a share? A. No - we never said a word about it; Wood said there were four chests of plate - no agreement at all was made for me to have a share; I did not bargain to have any thing at all - the name of the person to be robbed was not mentioned; I did not know what part of the country we were to go to - I should have stopped at the house they went to, be it whose it might; I was not a housekeeper at this time - I lived at No. 11, Hollis-street, Clare-market; I have been there about a year and nine months - I was apprehended at the Crown, New-cut, where I have done a good deal of work, and often used the house - I have known Sales three or four years or more; I frequently met him; our first acquaintance was at the young woman's he lived with - I have pawned on my own account six or seven times at the place I pawned the hat; I was in distress at the time; the coat I now have on was lent me by Drinkwater, the wardsman - he afterwards sold it me for 8s., which my brother-in-law sent me; he sent me 2l., and I bought a waistcoat - I borrowed the coat yesterday, to go to Hick's-hall, and when I came back he said I might have it for 8s.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been conversing with the officers? A. As I came from the watch-house they said, "You know there has one suffered for it;" I said I did not know it before - he has not suffered for this robbery; I never heard he had suffered - I have been living in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not conversed since you were taken up, over and over again, with the officers, as to the evidence you were to give? A. When I confessed to the officer, as we walked by Bethlehem, he said Wood had suffered; I said I thought Wood never would have told of me - that I was very sorry for it, that it was an unforeseen thing altogether, and I went, being in distress.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not to save yourself from suffering that you confessed? A. I thought it would tend to a little mercy for me - I do not fear it will go harder with me if I am not believed to-day; I fear for the situation I am in - I have told the truth; I had 19s. 6d. - I do not consider that an equal share, when the other things were left there; I had as much as either of the others had then: I would not have gone the distance for 19s. 6d. - I should not have gone to rob nearer or farther off at any other time but that night; I really should have gone with them wherever they went -I would not have gone to injure any man with any foul weapon or any thing; I did not know I was going to Mr. Bowles' - I did not rob any body; I was aware I was going to do what I ought not; I had been at work for Mr. 
               <persName id="t18300218-6-person161">Webb</persName>
             a few days before the robbery - I had finished Higginbottom's work in a day and a half, then worked for Webb - he gave me my victuals; I worked for him till two or three days before the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask for work any where else? A. When I go about I always ask for work; I think the robbery might be planning three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Then instead of going to work you were three or four days planning this robbery? A. I went to Shire-lane - all the plan was, it was said it would be the best way to go down in the gig; I was not there two hours; I have given a direct account of it - I have never heard of any reward being offered concerning this robbery; I have seen the bills since I have been in custody - I never had one - I read a little of it; Myers, the officer, had it - I did not read it all- I saw something about burglary and about 50l.; I judged it was the robbery I had been concerned in, but did not read sufficient to know, I had not an opportunity - I knew it was about that robbery, by their saying at the house that it was the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. The hand-bill offers a reward, or a pardon to any body who will turn evidence? A. No, I never saw any thing of that kind, nor heard of it; to the best of my knowledge I saw nothing of it but "burglary, 50l." - I did not see any thing about offering a reward to any person who would give evidence so as to convict the thief, nor hear of it; I thought certainly the officers would have the 50l. if they apprehended any of the persons; I did not expect any body else would have any of it - I cannot say whether it happened on the 18th or 19th; I think it was on a Monday.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 21st of October, in consequence of information, I went down to Mr. Bowles' house, at Enfield, and examined the premises; I found the pannel of the hall door completely out - I examined the lane leading to the premises; I found a quantity of hay laying there, and an appearance as if a gig had come up there - I think the 21st was Tuesday; Pye was with me - I saw him pick up a bottle, which I have; I examined it - I cannot state what it contains - it is in the state I found it, and the liquid is in the same state; on farther search another phial was found - I produce that in the same state; they were both close to where I supposed the horse had stood - they were five or six yards from each other; I am not a judge of laudanum - I produce a paper which I saw Mr. Bowles find in a ditch; it was marked as it is now, "Nux vomica, poison;" the ditch is in a very narrow lane - on one side a hedge, and the other a paling; it was about a hundred yards from the house.</p>

I went with Edwards on Wednesday, the 21st of October, and examined the premises; I have not got a bill offering a reward - I picked up the bottle; I did not go into the prosecutor's house - I saw in the lane, an impression of a cart or gig having been there, as the tire-mark was small, and from the appearance of the foot-marks, the horse had been standing there a considerable time; there was hay about.</p>

On the 19th of October, about half-past nine o'clock, I remember a chaise coming there - I do not know how many persons were in it, but three came into the house- I saw the chaise myself from the window; the persons who came in had brandy and water or gin and water - I did not particularly notice their dress, but believe there was one in a drab coat; I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of them - I have a slight recollection, but am not positive.</p>

On Monday evening, the 19th of October, two men came into the Rose and Crown tap-room, about a quarter past ten o'clock, and called for a pint of porter; our house is about two miles and a half from the Ship, at Tottenham - two men came in first, and called for a pint of porter; another one came in directly after - I did not notice their dress; I cannot swear to either of them - I cannot swear to the prisoner or to Lee; I was sitting having a pint of beer - there was a joke passed, and I said to the three men, "Oh you are only three tailors from London."</p>
               <p>JOHN WILSON. I am a constable of Enfield. I was on duty near the White Lion at Enfield, on the night of the 19th of October. On Tuesday morning, the 20th, about three o'clock, I stood against the White Lion door - three men came up and went into the house; the White Lion is on the right hand side, coming from Mr. Bowles' to London - I saw three men come up and go into Turner's, who keeps the White Lion; I went in, and saw them - I then went and met two men in a gig - the horse seemed jaded; I then went back to the White Lion to see if the three men were there, and they were gone - Turner's is a night house; the chaise was going towards London - I saw all three of the men that were in the house - the prisoner was one of them, I am positive; he was dressed in a drab coat, and a pair of corded trousers - Lee was another of them I am sure, for I took particular notice of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-exmined. Q. Did you speak to the men? A.

L. Watkins, coach-founder and plater, No. 90, Long-acre, London;" he gave me a card similar to this, as an introduction, wishing me to give him money for the bill I now hold in my hand; I then told him I would not - it had an acceptance on it at that time; he had been waiting for me in my house an hour before he gave me the card - I was down in the cellar; I told him I would not give him the money for it - he then mentioned my brother's name; my brother is inspector of pavements to St. Martin's board - he said he knew him, and had seen him several times; I told him if my brother wished for the bill to be answered by my giving money for it, he would get a note from him to testify that the bill was a legal and honourable transaction; he went away, came again next day, and brought a note from my brother; I have not got that here - I have searched for it, but did not preserve it; I have every reason to think it is lost or destroyed; the bill is the only document I have preserved; my brother knew the inhabitants of the parish so well, I was aware if the transaction was honourable he would be able to ascertain whether it was so; the note, as near as I can recollect, said, "Dear brother, I have made diligent inquiry as to the respectability of the house of Messrs. Long and Son, and saving lived so many years where they now do, I consider the bill perfectly safe, and if you wish to serve the young man I think you may do it with safety;" after seeing that document, the prisoner sat down in the parlour some time, called for something to eat, and asked me to have it cooked for him; he sat there some time - I called him to the bar, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180015"/>inquired of him the nature of the bill; he said it was as safe as the Bank - that he knew it was usual on such occasions to allow more than legal interest; I observed to him that I should not do so, I should take 5 per cent. interest, and no more - I then made a calcuation, and took the bill from him - I gave him a 30l. and a 20l. note, also from 8s. to 10s. in silver, and his lunch was not paid for; among the silver there happened to be a bad 5s. piece - he immediately said, "This will not do for me - this is a bad one;" I did not know it myself - I changed it for him: he then said he would take the remaining part in wine and spirits; he said it was of no consequence to him, as when a gentleman called on him on business it looked very respectable to ring the bell and call the servant, requesting her to bring a bottle of wine out of No. 5 bin, and two or three other names he mentioned, for a person that was looking forward in the world; thinking him a respectable tradesman I sat down about ten minutes with him in the parlour after he received the money, and he had a glass of brandy and water; I had one with him, and in ten minutes he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave the bill in your possession from the first day he came to the second? A. To the best of my recollection he did; I had no idea at the time that it was not proper - the bill has never been out of my possession, except when I gave it to James Miles, my brother, to present when due - it was out of my possession then, but at no other time; he brought it back to me, and I have had it ever since: having received information on the afternoon of the day he gave me the bill, I showed it next morning to a neighbour, and while I was doing so his father-in-law, John Rogers, came into the bar - in consequence of what he said I made application at Bow-street for a warrant, which I placed in Herring's hands; that was two days after I gave him the money for the bill; I attempted myself to find out where the prisoner was, but did not succeed - he was not apprehended on this charge; to the best of my recollection he was taken last Monday fortnight - I did not see him from the time I gave him the money for the bill till he was at the office; I have had no conversation with him since.</p>

On Sunday, the 31st of January, I left the chapel about twenty minutes before nine o'clock at night; I was the last person there - we made all the doors safe; the windows were all shut - I went there on Monday, between three and four o'clock, and discovered that the wax candles were taken out of the pulpit - the vestry door, which opens into the chapel, had the key taken out of it, and a door leading out of the vestry into a passage by the side of the chapel was open; it had been unbolted and unlocked - I think the persons must have been secreted in the chapel; the outer vestry door was unbolted and unlocked - there was no appearance of a breaking outside of the chapel; I first missed the candles out of the pulpit - I went into the vestry, and missed all the glasses and things; the clergyman's robe-box was broken open - the lock was forced off; two handkerchiefs<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180016"/>were gone out of that box, and two glass cloths - nothing else was lost out of the box: I had seen them there on the Sunday evening; a scarf was gone from the wine-cupboard - the wine and a cork-screw were taken from the same cupboard; a piece had been cut out of the side of the lock of that cupboard - I cannot say how many bottles were in that cupboard; they were not in my charge - the door leads out of the chapel altogether; there is another door from the vestry into the chapel - that door was locked on the chapel side, on the Sunday night; a person in the chapel could open it, as the key was left in the lock - I found it taken out; the two cloths belong to the chapel -Frances Harrison has a share in the chapel; I receive the pew rents, and pay them to Mr. Taylor, the agent.</p>
               <p>REV. WEEDEN BUTLER. I do duty at Brompton chapel. On Sunday evening, the 31st of January, as I came out of the vestry to go to the pulpit, to preach, I saw the prisoner close behind the stairs; it was about twenty minutes or a quarter to eight o'clock - we begin service at seven; I ordered the pew-opener to put him into a pew. On the following Sunday I found the lock of my box forced off - it was fastened by the hasp, remaining as I had locked it; when I opened it I found a silk handkerchief, in which I wrap my cassock, gone - when I searched the pocket of my cassock, I missed a white cambric handkerchief, but am not certain I might not have taken it away on some former occasion, but I thought it was in the cascock - I saw the silk handkerchief again to the best of my belief, in Woodberry's hands, but should not like to swear to it;

               <p>WILLIAM WOODBERRY. I am a constable of Queen-square. I went to the prisoner's lodging, No. 4, New-street, Brompton, on the 1st of February, about two or three o'clock - he was at home; I saw him - I was making a search there, not for this property - I saw in a box, in a paper, some pieces of wax and mould candles; I asked him where he got them - he said they were given to him; I found nothing else - I went to him again on the 8th of February, hearing of the robbery at the chapel; he was not at home then - his wife was; I found some pieces of wax and mould candles, two wine-glasses, a tumbler, a cork-crew a silk handkerchief, a glass cloth, a wine-bottle, with a little sherry left in it, and an ink-bottle; I took his wife into custody, and brought her to the office - I saw the prisoner the same evening, about half-past seven o'clock, at the corner of York-street, Westminster - his mother fetched me to him there; he said he was come to tell the truth - I had not spoken to him, and neither made him any threat nor promise; I said I would take him before the Magistrate, and as we were going towards the office, he said he was guilty of going to the chapel with a young man named Chitty - I had not said any thing to him about the chapel.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not told his wife, and told her to tell him it would be better the whole truth should be told? A. No such thing; he said he was sorry for what he had done - I then took him before the Magistrate, as he said he wished to tell the Magistrate; no examination was gone into that night - I told the Magistrate he wished to confess something; the Magistrate told him he would advise him not to state any thing - he was not examined, as there was no clerk there, and what he told the Magistrate that night was not taken down in writing, but it was next day, when he made a similar statement - he told the Magistrate that night, that he did go with Chitty; that Chitty came and called him two or three times that night, and he went out with Chitty, went into the chapel with him, and went into the vestry, drank some wine, and Chitty had told him if he would go in with him, he should have a good fire and a glass of wine - that he was so frightened when he was there that he spilled the wine over him, and that these glasses and things were given to him by Chitty; they were were not produced that night - he knew I had them; that is all he said that night, except that he was very sorry for what had happened - he was examined on the Thursday following, and the witnesses also; he made a statement that day to the Magistrate, which was taken down in writing - (looking at it) this is Mr. Gregorie's (the Magistrate) writing; I heard him examined - (read).</p>

             (in continuation.) I found a knife at his lodging; I went and examined the vestry on Tuesday, the 9th, and seeing the lock of Mr. Butler's box had been forced open, I put the knife against the impression left inside the box, and it answered the size of the knife exactly - the mark agreed with the width of the knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is a very common kind of knife? A. It is; he said Chitty had given him the things - I went to his lodging first on the 1st of February, saw the wax candles, and inquired about them; he said they were given to him; I saw the glasses there that day, but did not ask about them, because I knew nothing of the robbery of the chapel; I did not mention to him about the glasses: he might know I had seen them - they were in a cupboard which I opened, in his presence; he could have made away with them between the 1st and 8th of February if he had chosen; he was at large those seven days - I only found a few pieces of wax candle on the 8th; he said Chitty gave him all the things - I have been looking for Chitty ever since, but cannot find him.</p>

I know these things - these glasses were left in the chapel; they have been there for years - I have had the care of them about eight months, and have no doubt they are the glasses, and this cloth has the B. picked out - the C. is left; here is the mark where the B. has been - this tumbler is a remarkable one, more so than the glasses; I believe them to belong to the chapel, but the cloth certainly belongs to the chapel - it is inked with the gentlemen wiping pens on it - I have seen Mr. Butler with a handkerchief of this kind.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. That is an extraordinary tumbler? A. It is a thick common glass, very clumsily made; the wine-glasses are not an uncom<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180017"/>mon pattern - we had only two glass-cloths; I do not mean that there has been no more since the chapel was built - the old ones were allowed to the vestry-woman; these were new last October - there is no date on them: the chapel was repaired thirteen years ago, and they had new vestry linen; I have belonged to the chapel thirty-six years, and been vestry-woman eight years - the woman who was in the vestry before had the place fifteen years before she died; she was ill sometimes - she used to attend off and on; what she disposed of I cannot tell - I do not swear to the candles.</p>

            . I reside in the parish of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington. The prisoner lived in my service for about twelve months - I discharged him three weeks before the 1st of February; he was my <rs id="t18300218-9-deflabel57" type="occupation">groom</rs>

On Monday, the 1st of February, I came down stairs about nine o'clock in the morning, and discovered that two sideboard drawers, one containing plate, and the other which money is at times kept in, had been forced open - all the spoons were stolen; I had used one of them at half-past twelve o'clock the night before, and the sugar-tongs; Mrs. Scott kept the key of the drawers, and put them away - I stood at her side, and saw her put the spoon into the drawer, and saw there were others in it; I saw her lock the drawer - I cannot speak to the state of the house that night; I usually examine the doors but on this night omitted to do so - there are four doors' a person must have come through to get at this parlour; I missed ten table, sixteen dessert, seventeen tea, two mustard, and four saltspoons, and the sugar-tongs I had used; there was other plate on the sideboard - one of the spoons was left on the parlour table; I lost a silver watch out of a stand; it was a very common one, worth about 15s. - I lost a razor, and have since discovered that I lost a musical snuff-box- the value of all the things is about 22l. or 23l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you or Mrs. Scott go to bed first that night? A. We both went up together - I have only one maid-servant; I do not rightly know Chitty - he acted for the prisoner when he was ill; there was a degree of shyness about him that made me suspect him; he never came up stairs - I do not know him by the name of Chitty; I do not recollect describing his person to the officer - the maid-servant knew him; I knew the prisoner lived with a gentleman named Vale, but did not trouble to go for his character; he was known down the mews - he was ill when in my service: I rent the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>CAROLINE DOMINICO. I was in Mr. Scott's service till the 3rd of February - I was in the house on the 31st of January; the two middle doors were merely shut too, but the outer door was bolted and locked, and one middle door also; the house was made safe that night - I was up first in the morning, about half-past six o'clock, and in coming down stairs I did not discover that any body had come in, till the boy belonging to the stable came in and told me - that was about seven; I then found somebody had broken the middle door open - that leads into the long room; I know that door was shut and locked the night before - it was broken open; there were marks on the door, and the lock was loose - I had locked that door myself the night before; I know the door leading to the mews - that was both bolted and locked on the 31st of January - that is the street door, and was found forced open; it is an outer door - the stable boy found it open; it is an outer door - I let the stable boy in by unfastening the kitchen door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the young man who came while the prisoner was ill? A. Yes, by sight - he was three days at the house; he went by the name of Chitty - he only came into the house for the knives and boots; I suppose he is about eighteen years old - the prisoner was ill, and obliged to go away.</p>
               <p>JOHN DOMINICO. I live with my mother, at No. 5, Exeter-place, Chelsea. I was servant to Mr. Scott, but did not sleep in the house - I went to the house about seven o'clock on Monday morning after the robbery; I went through the stable door, which I had the key of, and let myself in; it is an outer door into the mews - I found that locked; I then went through another door into the garden - that is never locked; the stable is detached from the house - my sister, Dominico, let me into the house, through the kitchen door; when I got into the house I got a candle, went up stairs, and found the door leading to the long room broken open - I had found the door leading to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180018"/>the mews unlocked and unbolted; the bolts are inside - that door had not been broken at all; it was shut too.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are two outer doors, by which you may get into the house? A. Yes; one of them I found locked, as it had been left, and the other open - a person must have been inside to open that; the door that was broken is inside the house - it is the second door from the mews, and not an outer door.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Slater. I heard of Mr. Scott's robbery - I have known the prisoner about three months; I saw him on the 31st of January, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, at the back of Mr. Scott's stable door, in the mews; a young man was with him who I knew by sight - he went by the name of George Chitty; I saw the prisoner go to Mr. Scott's door which enters into the shop, I believe; it is one of the doors of the house - he put his hand to the latch of the door; I heard the latch rattle - he found it bolted; he did not open it - he came from the door to my stable, and stood talking to me for about two minutes; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe what became of Chitty? A. He went with him out into the street; he was just by while the prisoner was talking to me - I do not remember that Chitty spoke to me; he is about eighteen years old; I have not seen him since.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 1st of February I went to the prisoner's lodgings with Mr. Scott, with a warrant to search the place; I found the prisoner there - I told him there was a suspicion that Mr. Scott had been robbed, and I had come to search his place, to see whether he had any plate or any thing; I searched, and found neither plate nor money, but a few shillings - I found nothing belonging to Mr. Scott; the prisoner said he knew nothing of the robbery, and I went away; I went again on the 8th - he was not there then, I only saw his wife; I was searching for other things, and during that time I saw his wife go and hide something under the head of the bed; I then went and searched there, and found a purse with eight sovereigns in it - I did not see the prisoner then; I saw him about half-past seven o'clock the same night, at the corner of York-street; I took him before a Magistrate, according to his own wish - Mr. Gregorie was the Magistrate; he told me he had come to tell the whole truth, and it was his mother's wish he should go and speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you when he was not before the Magistrate? A. Yes, after he came from before the Magistrate he told me the same as he had told the Magistrate - I had not told him it would be better or worse for him; he said he had been to Mr. Scott's house with Chitty, and that he stood in the coach-house - that he went out from his own house at a quarter past eleven o'clock, and stopped in the coach-house while Chitty went into the house; he said he did not see the things Chitty had taken - that he returned to his own house at two, and the next day Chitty brought him ten sovereigns as his share; I asked where he got this canvas bag which the sovereigns were in - he said it was made by a young woman. I went to Mr. Scott's house on the 1st of February, and found the middle door had been broken open, either by a chisel or crow-bar; that is the door which leads into the long room - I examined the sideboard, and found the top of it had been lifted up, and the drawer drawn out; the bolt had pulled away the veneering.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He had told his story before the Magistrate in your presence? A. Yes - there was a good many people about when he told the story to me; I do not know whether they heard it - we did not talk out loud.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he happen to tell it over to you again, when you had heard him tell it before the Magistrate? A. Because I was putting questions to him about where he sold the plate; he begged me not to lock him up, and he would tell me the whole truth - I have told you word for word what he said; he said he waited in the coach-house and had not been inside the house - I mentioned this robbery to him on the 1st of February; he could have absconded between that and the 8th - Chitty has absconded; I know that now - I have been an officer twenty-eight or twenty-nine years; I have done all I could to find Chitty - I did not look for him till he said he was with him; I found none of Mr. Scott's property at the prisoner's lodging.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you present when he was examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes; he told the Magistrate the same as he told me, as near as could be, within a few words, but not at the time of the examination; when the witnesses were examined he denied it, and said he was innocent - what he said was the evening before, when he first gave himself up; that was not taken in writing - he was examined on the Thursday, and said he was innocent.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not state to me that he told you the same story as he told before the Magistrate? A. Yes, that evening, when he desired to be taken before the Magistrate; our chief constable heard every word that passed, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the officer came to my mother's, he said I had better tell the truth how I came by the money, as my wife was in custody, or else it would be worse for me, and I told him Chitty came to me, gave it to me, and said if any thing happened I was to say I knew nothing about it.</p>

In consequence of something I heard, I and Thomas, the officer, searched the prisoner's room at my house; the officer found 4l. 18s. 6d. in the fire-place - I never knew of the prisoner dealing in straw, or being any thing but a soldier.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you any other soldier lodging in your house? A. His comrade, Carter, lodged in the same room; he is still in the regiment, I believe - he left me directly this turned out against Currie; the serjeant took them both away - the prisoner had the key to lock the room whenever he chose; the chests were not locked - he had no business in the part of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180020"/>house they were in; he would pass that landing to go to bed - I have also a female lodger who would pass the place. I am not a manufacturer of plait; I have lately lost my wife - she had nothing to do with the business - the letter G. is my own mark; it denotes the price I bought it at; I have bought thousands of bundles at that price in my life - I put it away for the Spring trade, and did not miss it till I found it was all gone; it was all safe the beginning of October - some was marked G. and the rest E.; three bundles here have not my mark on them -I had two of them from York-street, and the other I brought from home; I believe them to be the quality I had from the manufacturer, but these two have been untied, and then the private mark would drop out; the prisoner was billetted on me till he was apprehended - he was very troublesome in the house, and went to the next house, because my wife would not let him have salt and things three or four times a day - he did not take me before a Magistrate, it was my servant.</p>
               <p>GEORGE STROUD. I keep a straw bonnet shop, in Milner-place, Lambeth. The prisoner called on me about three weeks previous to his apprehension, and offered some plait - I bought a small quantity of him for 8s.; it is here - I gave it to Mr. Austin about a week after; I am sure it was the same - I was about ten minutes making the bargain with him the first time; he came again next day, but I did not buy of him - he had some more plait; I do not know what quantity - what he brought the first time was in a red handkerchief; he had some in a handkerchief the next time, but I do not know whether it was red - it was tied in a handkerchief and put into a knapsack; he told me he had got more plait to sell me, and asked 10s. for it - I then asked where he got it: he said his sister and mother who made it sent it up to him from the country - I said, being a stranger to him, I should like to have some further account of it, as he asked me considerably below its value; I asked where he lived - he said in Oxford-street; he was in soldier's clothes - I asked where in Oxford-street; he said that was a matter of no consequence, if I had any doubt of him I had no occasion to purchase it - I then told him I had no reason to doubt him, but he asked me so much below the value, if he could prove to me how he came by it, I would give him 2l. for it - he had asked 10s.; I thought it worth full 2l. - he made some answer; I asked if his serjeant knew he dealt in straw - he said he did; I said if he would take me to where he lived, or to his serjeant I would purchase it, but that he also declined - I would not purchase, and he left; this interview lasted full twenty minutes - I have not the slightest doubt of his being the man; I did not see the private mark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you keep an open shop? A. I do; my wife was present on the first occasion, and my brother on the second - they are not here; they were not required at Bow-street - I have not been long in the trade: I stated to him on the second occasion that I was a large dealer, and knew every one in the trade; that was not the case - I do not consider myself a very good judge of plait; I gave him 8s. for two bundles - he was in his undress with a cap on, and was a stranger to me before.</p>
               <p>MARY BROWN. I live with my father, a bonnet cleaner, in Litchfield-street. The prisoner came to our shop to offer plait to my father for sale about three weeks ago; I was present - he bought none; the prisoner was in the shop five or ten minutes - I had never seen him before, but he is the man; he was dressed in regimentals, and had the plait in a red handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not seen other soldiers at your shop? A. No; he did not speak to me - I am positive he is the man; he was in his undress.</p>

            . I live at No. 47, York-street, Westminster, and keep a straw bonnet shop. I have bought plait of the prisoner; I am certain he is the man - he came several times; the last time was about a month ago- I have seen him four or five times, but did not purchase every time; the quantity altogether came to less than 1l. I have not the slightest doubt of his person - he was alone; he had it once in a white wrapper; I do not know what it was in at other times - I asked where he got it; he said he was a native of Dunstable, that his friends sent it to him, and he could serve me as cheap as the dealers as that was the case; that satisfied me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that at the first or a subsequent time? A. I cannot be certain whether I bought any of him first - I always buy of dealers; they call at the shop - his being in soldier's clothes was the reason I asked him about it; I gave Austin what I had left - the rest was manufactured; I gave him 4s. for each bundle - I delivered up two bundles.</p>

             THOMAS. I am superintendant of the Police. I apprehended the prisoner - he was not searched; I searched his clothes which were at his lodgings; I have a handkerchief which I found inside one of his jackets, and inside the handkerchief are some small particles of straw not large enough for plait; I took him on the 28th of January, in St. James'-park, at the military station.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to JOHN AUSTIN. Q. Besides the person you have named was there a boy and a man lodging in your house? A. There was a little boy eight or nine years old and his mother, but no man.</p>

            . I was in the parlour behind the shop, sitting opposite the door; I saw the prisoner come in, and take something off a small table - I had shortly before that told the young man to take these cravats from the door; I saw the prisoner take them from the table, and go off with them; I could see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180022"/>what he had got-he was brought back by Mr. Griffin and a ticket-porter; the property is worth 4s. 6d.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HUGHES. I am shopman to Mr. Griffin. I saw the prisoner come into the shop, take three cravats, and instantly gave an alarm; Mr. Griffin went out - I followed him, but before I overtook him the prisoner was in custody; I recollected his features, and am quite certain of his person - he had run half-way up 'Change-alley; the things have not been found.</p>

            . I am a ticket-porter. I heard a cry of Stop thief! the prisoner was coming towards me, running fast. and I stopped him; I did not observe any thing with him - I took him into the shop; Hughes and Mrs. Griffin immediately said he was the person - he said he was no thief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I could have got away, could not I? A. Not from me - you made no resistance.</p>
               <p>SARAH TOWNESEND. I live in Coppice-row. I was at tea at Griffin's; I saw the prisoner stoop down, come in, and take the property off the table - previous to that three boys came in, one with a petition, another to ask for tape, and a third to sell pens: while the one was offering pens the prisoner came in - I am confident he is the man: as he took the bundle his eye caught mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How far was you from the person? A. About six yards.</p>

The constable of the night told the prosecutor to go and see what he had lost; when he came back he brought this with him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>"You shall get your money before I remove my goods; but I wish to see if my things are all safe;" he said he would not let me see my things till I paid the money; I went again with a porter, and paid the prisoner's wife the money - she then took a key, and opened the door: I saw my trunk broken open, standing on two chests, and the articles stated were gone from it; the pocket-book, which had contained the duplicates and a promissory note, was laying on the trunk - the prisoner came in while I was there, and I said to him,</p>
               <p>"I have been robbed - what a cruel thing it is;" he and his boy then bundled out my things on the pavement; I then taxed Mrs. Abercromble with stealing my property - she said, in the prisoner's presence, that she had not stolen it, but she knew who had; I have never found my property; I have searched respecting the property to which the duplicates had belonged, and some of them had been taken out of pledge.</p>
               <p>GEORGE STEVENS. I am a messenger at the King's Bench. I was employed by one Gonnell to go and put the prosecutrix on board of a steam-packet, on the 21st of June; when I went to the prisoner's house I saw a person, who I believe was Mrs. Abercrombie - she refused to let her take any thing away, because the rent was not paid; after some conversation they agreed that I should take a trunk away provided I lent her 5s.; after they had settled, and parted friends, the prosecutrix opened a trunk full of woman's apparel, and said there were papers in it of value, and wished them to take care of it, which they promised they would do.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not they tell her they had no more room? A. No - I heard her say they were welcome to make use of any of her clothes, if they would take care of her trunk; I did not hear them say they must put it into the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he did not know what she had left? A. Yes, but believed what she left she got.</p>

On the 8th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the shop - the prisoner came in and asked to look at some ribbon; I showed her the drawer - she desired me to cut three quarters of a yard off one of them; while I was doing that I saw her take a piece from the drawer, and put it under her shawl, then under her handkerchief, and then under her shawl again; I went and told Mr. Sewell - he sent the next witness to conduct her to a passage; this ribbon was dropped in the shop, eight or nine yards from where I had been serving her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons were in the shop? A. I should think fifty or sixty - I did not take her at first, as I waited to see if she took it away; Mr. Sewell was at the bottom of the shop -I put away the drawer, and left her with the ribbon while I went to him; it is possible she might have gone off, but there was a young man in the shop; she was five or six yards from the door when I served her - I should not have seized her without telling my employer; if he had not been there I should have told the young man.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GUYTHER. I attend in the shop, but do not serve; it is my business to attend the customers when they come in; after Mr. Sewell told me of this I went to the prisoner, and begged her to come to another part of the shop; when she had got six or seven yards I saw her shifting something, and this ribbon fell from her person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there many persons about? A. Yes, the shop was full; the place where she dropped the ribbon was further from the door than where she had been served; she came further into the shop when I begged it as a favour - I do not know what part of the shop Mr. Sewell was in; he came to me in the middle of the shop - I do not think it possible for this ribbon to have hung to the prisoner's person - I never knew such a thing.</p>

I lived in Grand Junction-terrace for eleven months; the prisoner became acquainted with me the beginning of July - he had been butler in a gentleman's family, but was out of place; we were asked in New Marylebone church, and were to be married on the 25th of August -I gave warning to leave my situation, and left it on the 24th of August, which was Monday - a fortnight before that I had gone to his lodgings and drank tea with him and his landlady, at No. 10, Adam-street - I had my watch in my hand, and laid it down on the table; he said, what a dirty ribbon I had - he put another ribbon to it, which he had ready in the room; he said,</p>
               <p>"Why do you always carry it in your hand?" I asked him to have the goodness to put it into his pocket till I went home - he went home with me that evening, and I forgot to ask him for it; on the Sunday before I left my place, we were at a tea-garden together, and I asked him for my watch - he said he had left it at home, because he had worn it till the ribbon was very dirty; I said, "Never mind, I am going to leave to-morrow evening;" I have never had the watch since nor seen it. On the Monday evening I left my place, and went to his lodgings between eight and nine o'clock; we went, took a walk together, and I expected to be married the next morning - we returned home about half-past ten, and he asked me to lend him nine sovereigns to go and fetch his clothes from the tailor's; I lent them to him, and 1l. 4s. besides to buy some other things for the next day - he had all the nine sovereigns at the same time, and they were to get his clothes; he went to bed about eleven o'clock; I slept with his landlady - I got up at half-past eight the next morning, and he was gone; I never saw him again till yesterday week, when he was at the office for a spoon - I never intended he should keep the watch or the money; I cannot tell whether he slept there that night, but he was gone when I got up - I waited till eleven o'clock, and then went to Harley-street where he had lived; he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180025"/>been there, and taken away his box - I have never got my watch nor my money again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give me the watch to get a new ribbon? A. No; I counted the nine sovereigns into his hand to get the clothes - I asked if the tailor could not wait until the next day; he said I should be tired, and he should like to take it that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he inquired if you had any money? A. Yes; I told him I had saved a little while I had been in service.</p>

She gave me the money and the watch - I had carried the watch about a fortnight, and the night before we were to be married, she counted the nine sovereigns into my hand, and asked if I would have any more - I went out in the morning to get my clothes, and got drinking from one house to another; I got intoxicated, fell asleep, and lost the watch and great part of the money - I had lived with Admiral Digby and Mr. Dodswell.</p>

The prisoner came in on the day in question, and called for a pint of porter, which the servant took to him in the parlour; he stopped there till the rest of the people were gone from the parlour; there was a bagatelle-board in the parlour, which was shut up, and I had seen the balls safe about half an hour before he went into the room, when the board had been moved - the prisoner left about six o'clock in the evening; I had heard the board moved, and as soon as he was gone I sent my servant to look for the balls - I missed eight balls, and I believe these to be them; he was found in another public-house, and these balls were found up the chimney - other people had been in the room after I saw the balls safe.</p>
               <p>JOHN DAVIS. I am a headborough. I was sent for to take the prisoner that same evening, a little after seven o'clock; he was in the parlour at the Phoenix tavern - I found nothing on him, but in the fire-place, up the chimney, I found these balls concealed.</p>

               <p>MR. CRESWELL conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BROWN. I am constable of Hackney. On the morning of the 20th of January I was coming out of a gravel-pit, where I had been employing some men to clear the snow away; I saw Field with a flag basket on his shoulder - I went and asked what he had got; he said what was that to me; I took the basket down, and took him to the watch-house - I found in the basket two parcels of nails and some gimblets, and this saw was in his left-hand pocket; while we were in the watch-house Hensey came in with a sack; this bag was round Field, fastened with a gimblet. I took Hagger, I think, in about a fortnight afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who is Hensey? A. A man who was at work with me that morning; he is on the parish - this was about nine o'clock - when I saw Field he was alone; I had been after Hagger every night for about a fortnight - I might have seen him in the course of that time fifty times, or I might not see him at all; I will not swear that I did not see him a dozen times, but not to my knowledge; I at last found him in Charles-street, Dalston - I cannot recollect exactly the day; it was the latter end of January, or the beginning of February - it was about two o'clock; there are six little white houses, and the one I found him in was the last but one; I do not think it has any number; no one was with me at the moment I took him - Hensey was not the person who gave me the information: I had been in company with several officers during the fortnight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any person with you when you took Field? A. All the men were coming out of the gate at the time - I knew Field.</p>
               <p>JOHN HENSEY. I am a ground-workman. On the 12th or 13th of January. I think it was, I saw both the prisoners - Brown took Field into custody; I was a distance off, and saw Hagger come round a corner, and as he turned he saw Field in custody - he dropped this bag near Mr. Burgiss' ground, and ran away towards Walthamstow - I took the bag to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who do you work for now? A. Mr. Gardiner, opposite the Peacock, at Hackney; I have seen both the prisoners four or five times before - Field was by himself when Brown took him; if Hagger had kept the bag on his shoulder he might have passed me without my noticing him - I never spoke to him before in my life, to my knowledge; I have spoken with him since- he said before the Magistrate that I asked him to give me 5s., but I can take an oath against it, for I had two witnesses with me when I was talking with him, three nights after the robbery; the reason I did not take him was, because I have children of my own, and did not like to have any thing to do with it; I told him he had better get out of the way, for if any thing happened I should have to come against him - this conversation took place at the White Hart, Horusey: I knew him when he was ostler at Stoke Newington - I had seen him as I passed, feeding the horses; I might have seen him twenty times, but I never drank with him - I had seen him at the White Hart, and thought that a likely place to find him, but I did not appoint to meet him there; a man named Mills was there - he lives in Union-street, Stoke Newington, and was formerly a bricklayer's labourer; I do not know what he is now - he had been at work with me the day I saw Hagger drop the bag; upon my oath I did not go with a view to get money out of him, but to tell him to keep out of the way.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked them up in the road, and went along with them a quarter of a mile, and then took them down to the house - he came in the morning, knocked me up, and said he wanted the coats; I said I had two, but I had not stolen them.</p>

This property was taken from his stable on the 19th of January; I had locked the stable the night before, and all was secure; I went at seven o'clock the next morning, and found the door broken open - the lock laid inside, and the property was all gone; I suppose the amount of the loss was 20l. -I know nothing of the prisoner; the harness was all taken at once, and it would require two men to take it.</p>
               <p>LEWIS BEACHEM. My father is a saddler, in Whitechapel-road. The prisoner brought some harness to his shop on Thursday morning, the 21st of January; he offered it for sale - he said he had brought some odds and ends, and wanted 1l. for it; I saw the crest on the blinkers and sent for the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What did he bring? A. A pair of hames and some other parts of two harnesses; my father asked where he got it, and he said he received it of a man named Wells.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BURGESS. I am an officer. I took him into custody - this is the harness.</p>

               <p>MRS. JOHNSON. The prisoner lodged at my house, and he was not out one night, I can safely say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What night do you speak of? A. He slept at my house on the Wednesday night before he was taken - I have only two persons in the house; I see them to bed every night, and shut the door - the prisoner was not one night out; ten o'clock is about my latest hour for going to bed.</p>

            . On the 26th of January the witness informed me he had taken two fowls from the brickkiln, one was half dead and the other quite dead - I said I would take them back again, and did so; we patroled the road till four o'clock in the afternoon, when these two lads came across from Highbury - Crew went down to a clump of bricks, and Adams went on; I saw Crew take the live fowl, kill it, and put it into his apron with the other dead one - he jumped over the ditch, I jumped over it too, and took him with the two fowls; I gave him to the witness, and I took Adams with the two turkies, which were both alive - I found this barley in the prisoners' pockets to entice the fowls; these are the turkies.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are sure it was "to entice" - do you expect to belong to the new Police? A. No, I would not belong to it; I do not know the prosecutor - Adams told me he stole them from there; if I had had the fowls under my care I should have known them - one of them was blind with one eye.</p>
               <p>Adams. I told him I had to carry the turkies for a gentleman to Islington. Witness. He told me, when coming across the fields, that some gentleman in a white rough great coat had given him 9d., and part of a pot of beer to take them to Islington, but afterwards he said he brought them from Hornsey-wood house.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERKENHEAD. I can swear to these turkies, but I did not know these fowls.</p>

               <p>Crew. This young gentleman said at the office that he could swear to one of the fowls. Witness. No I did not.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 23rd of January, I saw the prisoner go from the tap-room into the yard - he was gone a considerable time, and I waited to see if he would return; I then heard a noise, and went and saw him taking the leg of pork, as it appeared to me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180033"/>between his teeth as he was creeping out - I took it from him, and he begged me to say nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know how long he had been there? A. From the morning, and this was about half-past six o'clock in the evening - I think he was sober; the pork was in front of him - it weighed 23 lbs.; he could get out that way - the door was not fast; after I took the pork he went into the tap, but did not remain there two minutes - he then went away; he did not call for any porter after that; I saw him go - I did not take him at that time, because my master was busy: as soon as he was at leisure I told him of it - it might be two hours after.</p>
               <p>GEORGE LAYTON. I went with the officer, and found the prisoner in bed at his lodgings, in Church-street, Staines - he came down in his shirt, and I said he must go with us; he said, "What for?" I said he knew what for - he then said he supposed it was about the leg of pork; he said he was sorry for it, and hoped I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KING. I am a constable, and took him.</p>
               <p>MR. IVESON. He has frequented my house for some time, and I knew him as coming there frequently - I imagine he was sober; I had seen him two or three times in the day, and knowing him I sufferred him to lay on the settle.</p>

            . On the 23rd of January I lost a shawl, a cap, and two pieces of lace - I am out at work from half-past six o'clock in the morning till eight at night; I leave my mother-in-law in care of my place and children - I had seen these things on the Monday. and missed them on the Sunday afterwards - I have known the prisoner ever since August last.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH FREEMAN. The prisoner sent my mother out on an errand from the prosecutor's house on that Saturday - she then told me to take up the baby, light a candle, and play with him - she then went down to the yard, as I thought; I heard somebody at my sister's door - I went into the passage, and inquired who was there; no one answered - I then opened my mother's door, saw my sister's door open. and the prisoner near her bed-side; she said, "Lork, Betsey I thought your mother was here;" I said, "You know very well she is not, you sent her out on an errand;" we then both came into the room together, and she told me to go and lock my sister's door - I went to lock it; the key was not in it - I took the key from the nail, locked the door, and came in again.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH FREEMAN, SEN. I am the mother of this witness, and mother-in-law of the prosecutrix. The prisoner asked me to go into Brick-lane for her - I was washing a gown at the time; I might be gone about half an hour - I delivered my message, and she was to go in the evening to the place for an answer; when I returned she said, "Your daughter's door was open;" I said, "It was not when I went down stairs."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do own to taking the things. but not with an intent to steal - this witness has pawned many of my things. Witness. Yes, but I always fetched them out again.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MILLAR. I am an officer of St. Luke's. I took the prisoner - she said she knew nothing at all about the robbery; she afterwards gave up the duplicates out of her bosom.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did she not say she would take 6d. per week if I would give it her? A. Not in my hearing.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM CULLUM. I am a carpenter, and live within a short distance of Mr. Brett. On Thursday, the 21st of January, I was going home about twenty minutes before six o'clock in the evening, and going down the hill two young men passed me; one of them had a bundle - I said to a person who was with me, "I think they have some linen, let's go after them;" we did so, and I saw one of them throw a bundle into a garden - they then ran off, and I pursued - I told the man with me to take care of the things; I called Stop thief! a gentleman's servant ran out and another person - I was out of breath, and I said to them, "There go the thieves! you go after them," and I stopped to get wind - they pursued; when I got wind I went on, and met a young man bringing the prisoner back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not dark? A. It was dark - the prisoner is one of the two who ran off - I cannot say which had the bundle; the person I saw with it was about ten yards from me, and the other was about five yards behind - when I lost my breath I think they were twenty yards from me; it is a straight road - when the other persons came out I lost sight of them; I suppose I lost sight of them for about ten minutes - it is a public road; it was at Crouch-hill, Horusey - I did not see any other persons on the road.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN WRIGHT. I was with the witness, and saw two men, one following the other - one had a bundle, which he flung over a hedge; I went after it - it contained the articles produced; I cannot tell how far that was from Mr. Brett's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who those persons were you cannot say? A. No; I gave the things to Applegate, and he gave them to the constable.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What happened previous to the cry of Stop thief! you do not know? A. No; when I first heard it I did not see the persons I intended to stop, but I saw the prisoner and another run, and followed - it is not a very populous neighbourhood; I saw no persons running before them - I might meet three or four.</p>
               <p>JOHN APPLEGATE. I heard Stop thief! called as I was at work in the stable - I did not go after any body, but saw Wright looking for the things; I said, "What are you looking for?" he said, "There are some things thrown over, and the thieves have run up here;" I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody - I took the things of Wright, and took them to Mr. Brett's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were the things till you took them to Mr. Brett's? A. I was at work at my horses - I locked them up in my master's saddle-room till I took them to Mr. Brett's.</p>

               <p>JOHN LOWDHAM BRETT re-examined. Q. What was done with the bundle? A. It was left in my house, and delivered to the constable by a servant - I believe there was washing at my house on the 23rd; I believe I saw some articles hanging out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you take notice of every washing day? A. I took notice of that day - I only know these things by the mark; some things were stolen- if another table-cloth had been brought in with the same initials, I should not have sworn to that: I know these were set apart as those which had been stolen - I sent a servant to see if there were any missing from the garden, and there was.</p>

I saw the prisoner take a piece of pork from his shop, on the 16th of January; she came and asked the price of it, and took it in, as if to be weighed, but instead of that she put it under her cloak, and went out at the other door; I took her with it, and she let it drop.</p>

            . I am a machinist. On the 28th of January I was at Mr. Cole's, in Cow-cross, and saw some steel, which I thought I knew as coming from Mrs. Wilmot's; I went out with Mr. Cole to Peter-street, and met Davis, who asked him for the money for the steel- he said he had no change, but if he would go to the sale he would get change and pay him; we went on, and I said to Davis, "That steel came from Mrs. Wilmot's, and she will not sell things to me; if you can purchase any thing at a reasonable rate, I will have it of you;" he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180035"/>"I can get you any thing you want," and used some phrase - he used the word prigged, or something to that effect, meaning that he had got it clandestinely; I could not swear that he used the word prigged - I saw Mr. 
               <persName id="t18300218-64-person457">Wilmot</persName>
             the day after this - I saw Davis on the 2nd or 3rd of February when he came to my house with Blount, and told me to go to Blount's premises: I went first, and told Mr. Wilmot of it - I then went to Blount's; I saw part of a press, and made part of a bargain - Blount produced a key out of his pocket, and said, "We can get what you want." or something of that sort, and he asked me if I should like to have a range; the two prisoners brought the press down to my place - Mr. Wilmot was there, and they were both taken that evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. When did you see Davis first? A. On the 27th of January; I did not see Blount till about the 2nd of February; I am a machinemaker, but I deal in all kinds of mechanical tools - I am not a friend of Davis'; I never spoke twenty words to him before this - I said Mrs. Wilmot would not let me have things, because there has been a dispute in the family, and the shop was shut up; I cannot tell why she would not deal with me; when Davis uttered the word it gave me a suspicion that he got them wrong; I did use the word prigged before the Magistrate, but I was not quite certain that he used it - I should think every one understood the word, but whether he made use of that word, or words to that effect, I cannot say; I would have told you before if I could have recollected the word - the word prigged is not an invention of my own; he gave me to understand that the thing were got dishonestly - it was Davis that said."I can got you any thing you want," or something of that kind; Blount showed me the key, and said, "This is the thing that will do it - at any time we can get you what you want." or something of that kind, and turned round a little bit of a corner; he showed me a lantern; that was the first thing Blount said - I had known Blount previously to that morning; when they came to my house, and said I was to go and see the press no other conversation passed, but that I was to go and see it; when I went there he showed me the key, then the lantern, and then the press; I understood by the key and the lantern that they were for bad purposes; I had been to Mr. Wilmot's before, to let him know - I do not know what you mean by any person's hand being held up, and a mark being made in it - I never saw any thing of the kind; I did not hold up my hand to Davis, and say "Is there not something else belonging to it;" I did say the press was not perfect - I did not say when the piece of steel was produced, "This is a piece of steel belonging to a press - where's the press, and I will buy it of you;" there was some conversation relating to a press on the 27th of January; and I mentioned to Mr.

               <p>Q. Was it the press that you knew had been stolen on the 27th of January, or the steel? A. The steel: there was not a word mentioned about the press on the 27th - I did not know the press was stolen till the 2nd of February, when they came to me about buying it; the answers I have been giving you were about the steel, not the machine- I knew on the 2nd of February they were going to take the press; I do not know whether they took it that morning - I never saw Blount in my life till the 2nd.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen either Davis or Blount before that day about purchasing the machine? A. I saw Davis on the 28th of January, and he told me he could get the press to sell, but he had not got it - I understood that he meant he was going to steal it, and I told him he might come down to my place, but that was to detect it; I told Mr. Wilmot on the 29th that these things had been taken out of the shed, and that the press would be taken out - I live in Fetter-lane, and am quite sure I never dealt in these kind of things, and no person can say I have.</p>
               <p>JAMES ISAAC. I am a Police-man. I took up the prisoners on the 2nd of February; the witness had given me the information that afternoon - I found this lantern in a dust-hole, but no key; Blount said he had never been to Mr. Wilmot's.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILMOT. I am the son of Heurietta Wilmot; I have assisted in her business since my father's death- the press was on her premises about a fortnight before Christmas. On the 2nd of February I knew it was gone - Clapperton told me that the shed had been broken open, and the press was for sale; I went to his house, and saw the prisoners bring the press - I have a brother named Charles; he told me on the Friday that Clapperton had mentioned such a thing to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then no information was given to you till the 2nd of February by Clapperton? A. No - my mother manages the business; she has administered to my father's effects - the shed is shut up now.</p>

            . On Tuesday, the 2nd of February, we had information of this robbery, from Clapperton; we went to the shed, and waited there to see if we could see the prisoners come - we waited till about six or seven o'clock in the evening; we then saw Davis go up Backhill - he went on towards Clapperton's house; Clapperton met him, and we followed them down to Blount's, and took them - we went to Clapperton's, and got the press.</p>

               <p>CHARLES WILMOT. Clapperton told me on Friday, the 29th, that he had an idea that the shed had been opened, and some things were taken from it that were very near the door; I made a guess that it was the steel, and he said Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then all you knew was what Clapperton told you? A. Yes. I live with my mother; I told her when I went home - I did not go to the shed till the 2nd of February, and then these persons were planted there to take the prisoners.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know this press? A. Yes: it is my mother's - it was in the shed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is there a kind of stone step in the cell? A. No - the cell is not very dark; there is no window, but a grating in the door - they appeared strangers to each other.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BLACKMAN. I am inspector of the Police, and was on duty. All drunken persons are searched when brought to the cell; there was no instrument on the prisoner - there is a projection in the cell, where two iron bars are put to throw light in; it is a kind of cill, about three feet from the floor - it is stone; I found blood on that, as if the man's head had fallen against it, and the blood was traced from that stone, to where the deceased was sitting - I have no doubt but his head had fallen against that.</p>
               <p>JAMES DANDO. I am a tailor, and have known the deceased for the last twenty years. This accident was on a Monday; I saw the deceased at the hospital on the Monday after - he was in bed, and very ill; he was very low in spirits, but said nothing as to whether he expected to recover - he died about three weeks after.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of St. George's-hospital. I saw the deceased between one and two o'clock on the morning of the 5th; he had received a severe lacerated wound on the head, immediately above the left brow; the bone was exposed to a considerable extent - I could discover no other injury; I attended him till he died, which was on the evening of the 30th - the wound in the head was entirely the cause of his death; I should think the most probable cause of the wound was falling on the stone cill described by the witness - the blow was a severe one, but I cannot form an opinion whether he himself might not have caused it, by stumbling against the cill, or by being pushed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with him at any period when he considered himself in extreme danger, and conscious of approaching death? A. He repeatedly asked me if he was in danger; I continually told him he was in danger, from the time of his first coming in - he was a very well disposed man, and seemed to conduct himself very well, and to believe what I told him; his danger had been fully explained to him, not only by myself, but by Mr. Keith, the surgeon of the hospital, in my presence; I do not recollect that he communicated to me how the accident happened after he was aware of his danger - it was immediately after he came in.</p>
               <p>JAMES DANDO. I saw him on the Sunday after the accident. and again that day fortnight - he told me how it had happened at my first visit, but not afterwards.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 8th of January the prisoner pawned two wine-glasses; I asked how she came by them, knowing her to be a charwoman - she said she had been in better circumstances, and had kept a better house than Mrs. Harben, and that they belonged to her - the other articles were pawned at my shop, but I did not take them in.</p>
               <p>MAURICE NICHOLAS. I searched the prisoner on the 16th of February, and found three duplicates on her, which correspond with this property - one is for two glasses, pawned on the 8th of January; the others are for two towels on the 7th of October, and a tumbler on the 26th of September.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HOWS. These tickets belong to the articles I have produced; I have the counterparts on the goods - we put the duplicate inside the glasses; the towels are not pawned in her own name, but the glasses are; it is a name she formerly pawned by; we knew her by both names.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These things do not belong to Mrs. Harben - I bought the two wine-glasses in Oxford-street.</p>

On the 15th of January one of my tenants gave me information - I went to one of my houses in Mill-yard, Mill-alley, Whitechapel, where she lodged, and found the prisoner before the street door, with a bundle in her apron; I sent for an officer, and found in her bundle two pillows. a sheet, and a blanket - she had no business in the room, for I had the key: I asked what she had to do in the house - she said somebody told her to go and take the property out of the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. While I lodged with you did you find any thing wrong in me? A I received no rent, and told you to leave the room; that is the only fault I have to find.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he do when he first got into the coach? A. He was impudent, and said he should like to kiss the old lady, or something; the door was shut, and the coach drove on - it went slow, as it was up hill; he took my purse two minutes after he got into the coach, and got out directly - I do not know whether he stopped the coach, for I was terrified; if it did stop it drove on directly- when the toll was demanded at the turnpike, I told the toll-man I was robbed, and refused to pay; the prisoner drove on - I wanted to get home: I never saw him before- the robbery made me know him, for I trembled liked a leaf: he was dressed in a light coat and buttons as a hackney-coachman; a man whom he called his brother was on the box with him, driving; I was going to Lower Islington - when I asked the fare at the stand, which is near Oxford-street, they said 3s.; I saw this chariot, and he refused to take me under 3s.; I told him to take me as far as he could for 1s. - he took me to Battle-bridge; I gave him 1s., got out, and told him if he would take me home I would give another one - he said he would; I went into a public-house, changed half a sovereign, and had half a pint of porter - the prisoner and his brother had a glass of gin each; I pulled out my purse to change the halfsovereign, and he took the change under pretence of looking at it, and put it into his pocket; I was ill, and too timid to say any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180038"/>Q. Did you get into the coach again? A. Most assuredly - he said, "Old lady, I will take you;" I got in- he drove half way up the hill, and then stopped; he came first on the left side, then on the other, and said he wanted something out of the chariot - I said, "This is not a stage; what do you want?" he felt about me - he knew my money was on my right-hand side; he went round to the other door, got in, and sat by my side - I felt him take my purse; he jumped out immediately - I did not know what to do; I had been laid up for five weeks with the rheumatic gout, and could not walk - the coach went on, and I came to the turnpike - the prisoner came, and asked me for the toll: I told him I should not give any thing, I had given enough; but I did pay it - the prisoner took the sixpence; I told Mr. Bury, who kept the gate that I had been robbed, but said no more, for I thought I was in very bad hands, and the sooner I got home the better - he drove me to Norfolk-street instead of New Norfolk-street, where I live, and sat me down in the middle of the street, in the middle of the snow, and left me there - that is two or three streets from New Norfolk-street; the person, he called his brother, was still with him - I saw the watchman coming up; the chariot drove down to the end of the street, which is no thoroughfare - the watchman said, "You are left in a distressing situation;" I said, "Never mind me, stop that chariot," and he tried. but said he could not - the watchman took me home; I did not see the prisoner again till Saturday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you in any business? A. I have a husband who supports me - he is <rs id="t18300218-70-viclabel380" type="occupation">in the surveying line</rs>

               <p>Q. How had you been employed that day? A. I had been very busy with my daughter, who had been laid up; I do not know why I am to say where she lives to bring her into trouble; she is young and blooming - I had been on business with her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far does she live from where you took the coach? A. I took a cabriolet for her in Rathbone-place, and walked to where I took the coach, which was at the stand near the New-road - I had gone out to receive the money; I was not in a public-house before I went into one with the coachman; I had fetched a trunk from Seymour-street, and had half a pint of beer between me and my daughter - I do not know the name of the public-house - I bought some boots in Seymour-street -I dined at home that day, and had no more than I usually have, a pint of porter - I am frequently very ill; it is always attended with sickness - the prisoner never tried to kiss me; he said, "Old lady, I should like to kiss you;" I turned a deaf ear to that; that was after I had been to the public-house, at the time he took the purse -I distinctly felt his hand in my pocket when he took it, and I tried to binder him with my band, but was too feeble - I was too weak to cry out - I was unfit to be out of doors; my daughter wished me not to go, but I was anxious for her sake - I was afraid she would not be treated well on the road; I placed her in a cabriolet, paid the man, and told him to take care of her - I took the number; she was going to her destination - she dined with me that day; she is not here - I should have gone home in the Omnibus, but there were none at half-past ten o'clock; I left home abont six, and took my daughter to Rathbone-place.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you engaged for four hours and a half? A. We had to walk; it is a long distance, and my daughter had a trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told the man at the turnpike you had been robbed, did you not say who had robbed you? A. I spoke of it, but I thought the gate-keeper might be as bad - I knew I had a husband at home; and when I got home he said, "Good God! what an hour to be out;" he had advised me not to go out - he was not pleased at this.</p>
               <p>Q. When you arrived in Norfolk-street were you not in such a state of intoxication you could not walk the rest of the way? A. No, the watchman will tell you the same; I was stupified with fear - I have no power with my right hand, having the gout in it; I received the money at No. 71, Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, after all this, is it true you paid the coachman 3s.? A. He paid himself - I gave him no money, except 6d. to pay the toll - I was a helpless woman, and thought it much better to go to my husband; I did not take the number of the coach - it was my daughter that took the number of the cabriolet.</p>
               <p>Q. After the man left you alone in the coach. why not put down the glass and say you were robbed? A. Islington is not a very thronged place; I thought he should drive me to my own door - I did all I could to have him detained when I got out; two watchmen came up - I was placed in the snow; I told them to follow the chariot, and it very nearly turned over.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You set out about six o'clock to walk with your daughter? A. Yes; I walked all down the road to Seymour-street, Euston-square, where I bought my daughter a pair of boots - I then went to Rathbone-place, and put her into a cabrioet at half-past eight o'clock - we had staid a little time in Rathbone-place; I called there to pay a sovereign.</p>
               <p>JAMES BURY. I keep the turnpike at Islington. On the 3rd of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I remember seeing a yellow chariot driven by the prisoner - I knew him before, having taken toll of him many times; his chariot is No. 226 - when he got to the gate I knocked at the door, and asked for 6d. for the toll two or three times - nobody answered; I then opened the door, and saw the old lady Thompson sitting on the left hand corner of the chariot - I asked for the toll; she said she would not pay it, that she had been robbed - she did not say who by; the coachman got off his box, and came to the gate - there was nobody with him at the gate; I asked for the toll again - Thompson said she would not pay it; the coachman said she must, and in about half a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180039"/>minute he paid it himself - I cannot say where he got it from; he gave it to me, shut the door, and drove away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prosecutrix appear to have been asleep? A. No, I could not see what state she was in - she sat up in the corner; she did not name the prisoner as having robbed her; if she had I could have called the watchman - there is one near the Angel, and another near the toll-house; it was between eleven and twelve o'clock at night - there was nothing to prewent her giving information; the chariot door was open- she came to me on the Friday evening, at the Highgate gate - she was alone; she said nothing about her busband's insisting on her prosecuting.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of Thursday, the 3rd of February, I was on duty, and saw Mrs. Thompson sitting in the snow in Old Norfolk-street - a chariot brought her there; I did not see the coachman, but heard his voice - I saw the chariot come down nearly to the bottom of the street; I told him it was no thoroughfare - he instantly said, "Then I must turn round;" I came up to Mrs. Thompson again - I had not seen the coachman set her down; she then said,"Stop the chariot, I am robbed;" I went out into the main road, and the chariot got away - it drove very fast; I went about two hundred yards, but could not overtake it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long is Old Norfolk-street? A. I should think about one hundred and twenty yards; I saw Mrs. Thompson sitting in the snow before I saw the chariot - I led her home; she walked.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you account for her sitting in the snow? A. No; I went very close to her, but smelt no brandy - she seemed much agitated; she spoke to me first, and said"Stop the chariot, I am robbed;" I had come in at the bottom of the street - the chariot came down to the bottom, and then I saw her sitting on the snow; it was after the chariot turned that she spoke to me - I saw the chariot coming down the street before I spoke to her - there was a watchman with me, named Element; he was not before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any money for coming here? A. No - I have drawn 1s. from the constable last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that is all - be cautious how you answer - how much have you had? A. Two shillings, no more - I had them from the constable Willsher- one last night, and one the day before; I asked him for it, because I wanted it - I had one on Monday, and the other yesterday; that was at Clerkenwell - I did not refuse to go in at Clerkenwell until I had it; I cannot tell whether it was before or after I gave my evidence -I think it was about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not make it a condition on which you went before the Grand Jury, that you were tohave 1s.? A. No; the officer desired me to attend - I brought Mrs. Thompson with me part of the way; I went to her house once before that, and had a glass of rum, but no money - she gave me the rum; I did not ask her for it - I have received no money from any body, except the 2s.; I have eat and drank - the prosecutrix was sober; she seemed very much agitated, and trembled - I cannot say she had been drinking; I swear she appeared sober - she was much agitated at losing her money.</p>
               <p>Q. If you followed the coach two hundred yards, why not call out? A. It drove away, and got out of my sight- when I came to the top of the street it was gone; I did not say I saw it for two hundred yards, but that I followed it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you got to the main road, did you see the chariot? A. No, it was gone away.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How do you know it went fast? A. It went from the top of the street to the bottom; that leads in to the Lower-road, which is lighted with gas; I could see two hundred yards, and more I should think; I was not with the prosecutrix a minute before I went to look after the coach - I did not see it turn the corner, and do not know which way it went.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it went fast? A. I went from the the top of the street to the bottom; the next turning is King-street, which is about thirty yards - I cannot say it did not turn down there; I did not tell the Grand Jury I saw the coach for a considerable distance.</p>
               <p>MRS. THOMHSON re-examined. When the chariot came up the street again it was almost turned over by the furious driving - when he drove through the turnpike he used an expression to the man; he said, "The old b-r had like to have taken me into -" some term, meaning the prison.</p>

On the 16th of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I had dined with some friends, and was walking home; I was rather intoxicated, but not so much so but what I could walk - I was sensible enough, but had drank wine rather freely; the prisoner and another girl met me - they came up to me in the neighbourhood of Great St. Helens; I was induced to walk with the prisoner - I did not go into any house with her; we went into a passage - I do not know whether it was a thoroughfare; it was in Great St. Helens, I think - I do not think I could find the place,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180040"/>for it was very dark; I was never in that spot before - soon after I had been with her there she left me, and I discovered that I had lost a 10l. note; she left me abruptly; I had given her 1s. 6d., all the change I had; it was in my trouser's pocket - the Bank note was in a different pocket, I am quite sure; I also gave her a silk pocket-handkerchief, and a pair of gloves - if I had had more change I would have given it to her; I discovered that the note was gone in less than five minutes after parting with her -I think I was in the passage leading to Devonshire-square when I discovered the loss; I had not lived in the neighbourhood above a week - I went to the watch-house, and described the woman I had been with; two watchmen went and found the prisoner - I had received the note the previous day from a friend, who lived at St. Paul's coffee-house; I got the number from my friend, told it to the officer, and it tallied with it - my friend has left town; I was sober when I got the number and date from him; I had dined in Leadenhall-street - I do not think I spoke to any other woman unless it might be in passing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What employment have you usually filled? A. I am here on commercial business - I am a stranger in London; I have not been in town a month at a time - I received the note that day between four and five o'clock; I dined at six and lost the note between eleven and twelve; it was loose in my pocket; I left my friend's house about eleven, and met the woman between eleven and twelve; I cannot give the time nearer- I am positive I did not go into any house with her, or any other woman; I am certain my silver was loose in my pocket - I knew before I went out that I had that change in my pocket, and had no occasion to touch it afterwards.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PETCH. I am an officer of Bishopsgate. I saw Mr. Gordon at the watch-house last Tuesday night, about half-past twelve o'clock - he had been drinking, but still spoke very rational; he stated that he had been robbed of a 10l. Bank note, and had been in company with two females, whom he described - I went and apprehended the prisoner by his description, in Webbsquare, in a lower room on the ground floor, with another female; I searched under her pillow, and found her pocket and a silk handkerchief - my brother officer found a pair of gloves; I likewise found a 10l. note, a sixpence, and some halfpence - she said the gentleman had given her the 10l. note, and that she had seen him to the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she say he had given her the silver wrapped in a paper, which she discovered, on coming to the light, to be a 10l. note? A. She did not say so to me - she told the Lord Mayor so, and said he had promised to meet her the next day, and she meant to return it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DICK. I am an inspector of Bishopsgate ward. Petch's statement is correct - I have a pair of gentleman's gloves found at the prisoner's: the prosecutor said she was not satisfied with 1s. 6d., and he was induced to give her the gloves and handkerchief.</p>

On this night, at half-past eleven o'clock, I met this gentleman very tipsy - he parted the young woman and me, and said, "I will have you, can you go home with me;" I said I never took any body home - he said he had very little money, but would give me his handkerchief; he took it off, and tied it round my neck - I walked with him for near an hour; he said if I would see him to No. 8, Devonshire-square, he would give me 1s. 6d. - I saw him to the door; he pulled off his great coat and hat, and offered them to me to go home with me - I refused; he said could I meet him next day - I promised him, and when I got to the gas-light, the young woman said, "Look in your hand, and see what you have got;" I found it was a piece of paper, and was going to throw it away - she said, "Don't throw it away;" on looking at it I found it was a 10l. note: I should have returned it to him when I met him the next day.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said there was none missing? A. Yes - Mrs. Jupp said to me."Are you sure there is one gone," and I said perhaps not, but I went to the door and took down the loop to which it had hung; it had been pulled down, and the loop was left - I did not say it would not do to detain him, as there was no umbrella missing.</p>

I had my child in my lap by the parlour fire on the evening of the 1st of February, and heard a footstep in the shop - I turned my head, and saw the prisoner reaching his arm to the end of the counter, where part of a cheese stood on a jar of pickled onions - I followed him to the door, and called Stop thief! Woodgate, the officer, pursued, and took him about fifteen yards from my shop - I did not lose sight of him after he turned from the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was there any cheese on the counter besides this? A. No, that was all we had; I had seen the cheese not five minutes before; there is a glass door to the parlour - it has no curtain, I had had the prisoner pointed out to me several times before, as a very suspicious person - I knew him again; he is a remarkable man - it was a double Gloucester cheese. I believe, and has a taster at one end; I did not tell the Magistrate, I did not know what cheese it was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. I believe the prisoner was taken in by you from charity? A. Yes - he came from Leamington; his money was gone, and I took him in: I did not then know where his relations lived, but I have ascertained since, and have seen them - they gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>JOHN BENZY. I am a baker.

            . I live at Fulham. I was standing at Mr. Metier's gate, on the 14th of January, and saw the cart of onions drawn by a donkey - the constable had charge of it; it was between four and five o'clock - there were four sacks of onions in it, and some loose; they left it in our place till the next day - it was put in our cart-house, and a waggon was put against the gate that no one could get to it; Kirby drove the cart - the next day they were taken away; I noticed two or three pieces of board in the cart on the 14th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you know the prisoners? A. Yes - it is part of their employ to go about the country, and buy bones, onions, and other things.</p>
               <p>MR. DEADMAN. I cannot swear to these other two boards, but I can to this one with the notice in it; here are some of the onions from the cart, and some from my stock- there is not a question, but they are the same sort; I do not know any man who grew such.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you grown that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180046"/>kind of onion? A. Two years; I bought the seed at a seed shop in London - I bought all they had.</p>
               <p>JAMES SMITH. I took the prisoners, and have had the onions ever since; these are part that were in the cart - these were taken from the bulk: and these are the boards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you take the prisoners? A. Kirby I took at home, and George Abbott on the 16th- the other two I took at the Cock and Magpie, about three weeks after.</p>
               <p>EDWARD EDGSON. I assisted in taking the prisoners.</p>
               <p>JOHN SENDALL re-examined. Q. Why did you not have them taken when you saw them? A. They took the cart, and allowed Kirby to go, as he said he would send his master for the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know whose cart it was? A. Kirby said his master was Pendred - that he and Abbott bought them at Croydon, and he saw them; I said, "Your donkey could not draw them from there;" "Yes he could" he said.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How many shopmen have you? A. Two; they put money into the till, and take change out - I am not in a large way of business; he had served the last customer, and given change for sixpence - there was about 2l. in the till.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA CLEMENTS. I am an inspector of the Police. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, and said he was very sorry for what he had done - this money was delivered to me by his master; I went and searched the prisoner's box - I found some other things, and some money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say he said he was sorry for what he had done? A. Yes; his master did not say if he would tell he would forgive him.</p>

               <p>JOHN PEARCEY. I am a watchman, of Anderson's-gardens, Bethnal-green-road. On Sunday night, the 24th of January. I stopped Higden with a basket and a bundle, a little before twelve o'clock; I asked what he had - he said it was his own, and he was going to Haggerstone; I took him to the watch-house, and asked what he had in the basket - he said wine, but what was in the bundle he did not know; I opened it, and found these other articles in it - I asked where he got them from; he said from his brother-in-law, who lived with Mr. Somes in Mile-end-road - I went there, found Willis, and asked if he had seen his brother-in-law the night before; he denied it, but after some time he said he had, and had parted with him at half-past nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was there any other conversation with Willis? A. Not at that time; Higden told me where he got them - I could not have found it, but for him.</p>

On Monday, the 25th of January, the witness came to me, and I called up Willis - I said he had robbed me of some wine, which he denied; these two bottles I can positively identify, but not the other three, though I think they are mine - I know these two by the marks on the corks; these trousers, found in the bundle, are mine -I cannot swear to this shirt; Willis slept next the stable, and the wine was kept in a locker in the servant's room -I never gave Willis liberty to take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you take upon yourself to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180047"/>swear you have lost a single bottle of wine? A. I will swear to these bottles, on account of the marks of K. &amp; Co. which I suppose is the wine merchants - it was made a present to me; I mixed five bottles of this sort; it is Madeira - it is impossible I can swear this is Madeira without tasting it; Willis was my <rs id="t18300218-93-deflabel515" type="occupation">footman</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you told the whole of this story? A. I believe I have - I did not go out of the road at all; I live at Hoxton - I do not work so late as that; I had no halfpence about me, and gave her none - I cannot say why she cried Murder! I had my hand on her, trying to keep her down, and more were fighting me; I do not know that there were any halfpence found on her - there were three penny-pieces; they had not been in my pocket - we were not walking arm-in-arm- I felt her hand in my pocket, drawing out the money, at the corner of the turning, when she introduced my hand to her person; I did not give her the three penny-pieces to do that - I do not know whether I was at the sign of the Hare on the 8th of February. I deny, on my oath, calling on the prisoner's father - he came to my house on the Monday night, and asked if a carpenter lived there, and said he had a job for him; I did not ask 30s. to let her go - I had money offered me; and at the office a young man pulled out money and offered me; I do not know one Mautz by name- I went to the Hare on the Monday; no money was offered me there, but I have had it offered by him - Chapman and another person were with me at the Hare; I did not say "It was not the prisoner took it, but I believe her name is not Susan Jones" - Chapman and I did meet at the Green Dragon on Tuesday; I will swear I did not ask a man there to pay 30s. into the hands of my principal witness, and then I would have the bill thrown out.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHAPMAN. I am a carpenter, and was with the witness - three girls came up: one of them kept me behind, and the other two walked on; the prisoner was one: she was detained by my mate - I did not see what was done, but he called out that he was robbed, and I ran up - the prisoner wanted to get away, and he held her down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it a light night? A. Yes - there were a good many people round; the witness cried out for the watch, and she cried Murder! I do not know which cried out first; he had had 25s. paid him by his master at the King's Arms - I do not know any thing about money being offered him but what he told me; I saw no money offered him at the Hare or the Green Dragon - he said they had been trying to make it up, and he would have nothing at all to do with it.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN WOOD. I am a watchman. I heard the call and went up; I found the prisoner, the two carpenters, and some women - the prosecutor had the prisoner down; I collared him, and asked what he was doing with her - he said, "I give you charge of her - she has robbed me of part of my wages;" I said, "Let her get up, and we will overhaul her" - he said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use - she has given it to another girl;" she got up, gave me three penny-pieces, and said  that was what he had given her for a certain purpose; in going to the watch-house she ran up a passage, and the patrol took her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she appear to have been illused? A. I thought so at first. I think the cry I first heard was of a female; she gave up the 3d., and said that was all she had.</p>

            . I am an odd-boy to Lord Ellenborough. On the 3rd of December I was coming from Roehampton to town, with a cart, and some hay in it; I left four trusses of hay with the prisoner, at the Old George, in the Brompton-road - he gave me some liquor to drink, and said at any time if I left hay with him he would give me something for it - I received 1s. a truss for the first two trusses, but nothing for the last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you steal the hay? A. I brought it from Roehampton; I saw the man taking the hay off the cart - I did not try to prevent it, nor ask for it back; I knew I was doing wrong - he gave me nothing for the last trusses; I had 1s. for the first - I thought it was not right; he is ostler to the inn-keeper - I did not pull the hay off the cart; I took the shilling for the hay - I dare say I expected to get 1s. for the last hay; they were tied up as trusses, but had not been weighed; I do not know how much there is in a truss.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure there were ten trusses? A. Yes; I pitched them up one at a time - a truss of hay has two hands, and a bundle has only one.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180052"/>JOSEPH WIGGINS. I am servant to the prisoner, at the George - he ordered me to take two trusses of hay off the cart on the 3rd of December; I do not know what was done with them; I believe they were put into the yard - I did not see them any where else afterwards; Mr. Ball keeps the yard, but the prisoner has the stable - I do not know whether he rents it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not customary for gentleman who send their horses along a road, to leave a bundle or truss of hay to feed them? A. Yes, Lord Durham does it for one; this was taken openly - I have seen Lord Ellenborough's horses fed with hay that has been left; I have given it to them - that carter was in the habit of borrowing hay to feed Lord Ellenborough's horses, and I believe they have taken it to pay themselves - I never saw any horses eat the hay that was left belonging to Lord Ellenborough but his own.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What man in Lord Ellenborough's service did you know to borrow hay of the prisoner? A. Kennedy has several times - I cannot tell whether a truss of hay is worth 2s.; I do not mean that they were put in any place for Lord Ellenborough's horses - they were only put into the yard: Kennedy said, "Here are two bundles of hay - I will leave them till I come back."</p>

I have taken this plan to mention it to prevent any person from hearing the conversation; a few moments conversation with you would be advisable, away from the house. - I am Sir, your most obedient.</p>
               <p>WM. SHUTTER, Corporal.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Haurum.</p>
               <p>against the Staute, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2nd COUNT, like the first, only calling it a threatening letter, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3rd COUNT, like the second, only stating that he did deliver a certain letter demanding, with menaces and without any reasonable or probable cause, certain money, with intent, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>MORGAN ORAM. On the 6th of January I went to the 2s. gallery at Drury-lane theatre with two little boys - there was a very great crowd at the door: the prisoner was there - he called out to another soldier, "Houston, this person has assaulted me;" I said, "It is false if you say so; any more than being pushed against you, which you know was the effect of accident, the crowd being so great"- I was then holding the youngest boy with my two hands to prevent his being hurt in the crowd; the other boy was further on - the other soldier turned round and said,"Never mind now, stop till bye and bye:" after a little while, he turned round again, winked at the prisoner, and said "Keep your eye upon him;" this was before the doors opened, and just as the doors opened he said, "Take off his excommunication;" the doors opened, there was a great rush, and the little boy cried out - I said to the prisoner, "Do take care, and don't hurt him;" he immediately took him up in his arms, and said he would take him into the theatre - I took some money out of my pocket to give the prisoner to pay for the boy's admission and in my confusion I gave him the 6s. 6d., which was all I had in my pocket - when I got to the pay-place I told the eldest boy he must wait there while I went back for some more money, as I had given it all to the soldier, or had dropped it - the prisoner took the little boy into the theatre, and I went back for more money; in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes I went back, and took the elder boy into the theatre - I looked for the prisoner, on account of his having the child, and saw him about half way down the gallery, sitting by the side of the little boy - the gallery was so full I could not get near him at all, but I called to him, and told him to take care of the boy till the play was over; which he did, and when it was over, he brought him to me - I gave the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180053"/>something, but I am not certain what it was, "I was so agitated from the threats he had made use of in the first place - he did not make use of any then; I took the two boys home to the City - nothing else passed between the prisoner and I on that occasion; I have no idea what I gave him - it was a little change; on the Friday following the prisoner brought me a letter to No. 6, Tavistock-street, where I live - he had not known before where I lived; the little boy will state how he came to find me out - when the prisoner brought the letter he said, "Take it, and read it, and come away from the house; I want to speak to you"- I read it, and the officer has it; this is the letter - I went up Charles-street with him, and he said the serjeant obliged him to come to me for some more money, as the paltry sum I had given was not enough - I said it was a shameful and a scandalous thing to come to me for money when he knew he had no charge against me, but being pushed against him - he said he knew that, but he was obliged to come, as his serjeant would not be satisfied without my sending him a couple of sovereigns - I said it was a very hard case indeed, as I had not so much money by me - I had not above a sovereign and 1s. 6d. - he said he could not help it, if I did not send more he should he obliged to come again; and under the threats be made use of, I took out the sovereign and three sixpences, and gave him - I said that was all I had; he said he would try if that would satisfy the serjeant, and walked away with the money. On the Friday following a little boy brought two letters, one inclosed in the other, nearly to the same purport as the other was - I went out, and found the prisoner in Charles-street waiting for me; he said he was sorry, from his heart, to have to come to me, but his serjeant obliged him to come to get some more money - I said it was a very great shame that he should come in that way for money, when he had acknowledged, the last time he saw me, that he had no charge against me; he said he knew that, but his serjeant obliged him to come, or else he would report him, and he should get flogged - I said he had extorted money from me, and he wanted to extort more - he said he should be sory to do that, but he had had a long walk, he had just come off duty, and he hoped I would give him something - I offered him 2s. 6d. which had been marked; as I had in the mean time told my landlord, who had told a gentleman of it, and this plan had been arranged - the prisoner refused to take the 2s. 6d.; Mr. Tate came up, and took him into custody - he was very much confused, and begged to be let go; Mr. Tate gave him to an officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What was the cause of our first interview? A. It was quite accidental - I was pushed against you by the crowd, as any other person might; and that would not have happened if you had not turned almost facing me.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you give me? A. Six shillings and sixpence, to pay for the boy, because you took him in your arms - I did not know I gave you the whole 6s. 6d.; I told you to pay for him, nothing else; I certainly said I would see you after the performance, to take the boy home, or words to that effect - when you brought the boy I gave you something, I do not know what.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, on your examination, deny giving me any thing but the 6s. 6d. at the theatre, and the 1l. 1s. 6d. in the street? A. I could not recollect every circumstance.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say you had not given him any other money? A. I believe I said I could not recollect the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the play was over he gave me 10s. in a paper. Witness. I cannot say what it was - I do not recollect putting it in paper; I believe it was in paper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you mean by saying you would see him when the play was over? A. To take the little boy of him - I do not know what I gave him, it might be a few shillings - I cannot swear whether it was less or more than 10s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he gave me the 6s. 6d. he said, "Take this, I will give you more after the performance is over, but do not expose me. Witness. I did not say such a word; I said I would see him when it was over, when he was at the pay door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say you would bring more money? A. No, I do not know what I got when I went home - but whatever I gave him was in consequence of the threats he made use of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the examination I asked him what money he gave me when the performance was over, and he said none. Witness. I believe I said I could not recollect.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you deny giving him money at the end of the play? A. I believe I said I could not recollect; the push was quite accidental, and not in any indecent manner.</p>

            . My father is a deputy seacoal meter. I went with the witness to Drury-lane theatre on the night of the 6th of January; I saw the prisoner in the street, standing near the door - I heard him say Mr. Oram had assaulted him; Mr. Oram said it was false, it was the crowd pushed him - the prisoner said he had assaulted his person, to the best of my recollection - Mr. Oram was rather behind him; the prisoner said to another soldier, "Come out;" the other said, "Never mind;" the prisoner then said, "Houston keep your eye upon him" - we went into the theatre when the door was opened, which was in about half an hour; I went up stairs rather before Mr. Oram - when he came up, he said he was afraid he had lost his money; I said, "Have you had your pocket picked?" he said he must go back, and get some money; I waited for him - the other little boy is my brother; Mr. Oram came back in about ten minutes, and paid for me and himself - the prisoner took my brother in; I did not take notice how he got money to pay for him - after the play was over the prisoner brought my brother to Mr. Oram, who had waited for them, and Mr. Oram told me to go down and wait for him - he came down with my brother, and joined me; I know of nothing else.</p>

            . On the 15th of January, about half-past three o'clock, Mr. Farrow, of Tavistock-street, who is Mr. Oram's landlord, told me of this circumstance - I stood with him some time, and a boy came into the shop; Mr. Farrow said, "Here is a note on the business I spokeabout"- I said I knew what soldiers were, and I advised Mr. Oram to go and tender the prisoner some marked money, and I should follow, to hear what he said - I followed him, and saw the prisoner join him near the end of Bow-street, they walked up Bow-street, and turned down a passage into Long-acre - I was as close behind them as I could be, without treading on their heels, and could hear their conversation from time to time - I heard Mr. Oram say it was a most false accusation; there was no ground for it, and it was very unjust that he should take the steps he did - the prisoner said he was sorry from his heart or soul, but he was obliged to do it - he did not believe him guilty of the charge, but was compelled to it by the serjeant, (I think;) I followed them into Longacre, and being fearful they might turn down a court, I took the prisoner, as I knew Oram was a timid man - I had seen Oram before this - I should observe, I had seen Oram offer him 2s. 6d., and the prisoner said it would not he worth his while to take so small a sum, as he had come a considerable distance - I took the prisoner, and brought him to Tavistock-street - I was very much excited at the time - a Police-man was sent for, and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long have you known Oram? A. I should think eighteen months, or nearly, from seeing him at Mr. Farrow's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This gentleman, when on his oath at his examination, said he had known him eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ROBINSON. I am a Police-man - I took the prisoner at Mr. Farrow's from Oram; he said that he had taken improper liberties with his person at the entrance of the 2s. gallery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did Oram say? A. He said he had come to the house under a pretence of accusing him of taking improper liberties with his person, to get money, and he desired me to take him to the watch-house - the prisoner said, on our way to the watch-house, that the prosecutor had taken improper liberties with his person at the entrance of the theatre, and he confessed he had received some money - I believe he said 6s. at the entrance of the door, then 10s., and then a sovereign, and three sixpences.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where you present at the examination? A. Yes - Mr. Oram certainly did deny that he gave you the 10s.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police, and was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in; this letter was delivered to me by Oram -I went up the same night to the riding establishment in St. John's-wood, where I understood the serjeant was, and I took him before the Magistrate the following morning, but it was Corporal

            ; he corroborated the statement of the prisoner, as to what he said took place at the entrance of the theatre - I heard the prisoner say Oram gave him 6s. 6d. before he went in, and when he came out 10s., wrapped in paper; but Oram denied giving him the 10s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night in question, I was at the theatre door, and was insulted by Oram; he gave me this money not to expose him; there was 6s. 6d., which was just sufficient for him and the two boys; he told me when the performance was over he would see me again; I brought the boy out, and he handed me the paper with 10s. in it; he put out his hand, and shook hands with me, and in a low tone of voice he said, "Here is 10s., don't expose me;" I saw no more of him till the day he gave me the 1l. 1s. 6d.; on his examination he denied giving me the 10s., and therefore must be allowed to be a perjured man, which I hope your Lordship will allow me to have the benefit of.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER HOUSTON. I am a corporal in the Light Dragoons, and was at the theatre - I heard the prisoner say Oram had insulted him, and he had his hand on Oram's shoulder; I was about a yard in advance of them; the prisoner said, "Come out;" I could not get out, but I saw Oram tremble like an aspin-leaf - I said, "Keep your eyes on him;" in a few minutes the doors were opened - I saved a place for the prisoner - I said, "Where is Oram?" he said, "He is safe enough, he gave me this boy as a pledge, and he gave me 6s. to pay for the boy and me, and 2s. 6d. to drink;" after it was over, he said, "He has given me a cartridge;" we went to a public-house, and opened it, and found 10s. in it - in going down the street he said, "I was obliged to borrow money for my admission, and I have no more money on my person than this;" I never desired him to go to Mr. Oram, and get more money of him, nor ever had a moment's conversation on the subject, till I was brought a prisoner to Bow-street - I did not know Oram's name till I heard it before the Magistrate - I did not say, "Take off his excommunication."</p>

A gentleman stood at his door, next door but one to Mr. Middleton, and as I went by I asked him if he had lost any thing, as I had seen him go to several shops; the other two had separated from him, when I disturbed them from another shop.</p>

               <p>RICHARD ADAMS. Baynham was in my service. I never sell meat without weighing it; he gave me no account of this meat - Stevenson had lived with me for six weeks, three weeks before this; Baynham lived with me at that time - Stevenson knew the custom of my trade very well, and knew the other had no right to give him meat, or to take any away without paying for it - I cannot swear to the meat, but believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Baynham's Defence. I allowed master 3s. 6d. for it, which I thought the full price - I did not weight it, as he was a poor fellow out of place; the boy saw me put the money on the desk for it.</p>
               <p>Stevenson's Defence. He let me have the meat, and said he would pay master for it.</p>

Last Saturday evening, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Long-acre, with an umbrella - I was carrying a bedstead, and told Dowding, who was with me, to stop him- he struggled with him very much; I put down the bedstead, and helped to secure him - I took the umbrella from him, and asked where he got it - he said he should not tell me; he was taken to the office, and told the Magistrate that he had given 6s. for it in Waterloo-road - that was not taken down; he was coming towards Newport-market, from Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How long was it before he was taken? A. Not a minute; I was about fifty yards from him - I did not hear him at the time he was taken, say he had bought it; I asked him to let me look at it - he said he should not.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DOWDING. I stopped the prisoner last Saturday, at seven o'clock, and asked where he got the umbrella from; he would not tell me - I endeavoured to get it from him: he struggled very much - he did not say he had bought it; I took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean by struggling, his refusal to give up the umbrella? A. Yes - he did not tell me he had bought it in Waterlon-road: he would not satisfy us how he came by it - he did not try to get away.</p>

No, my business is mostly in sticks; I had three or four dozens of this particular sort - I only know it by its being my own make; I have not sold many of this description, not one within the last month - I only know it by its make and general appearance; it was brought back by a gentleman on the 13th, between four and five o'clock, and left on our counter; I was not out of the shop that night: I have not another to match it in the shop; my sister acts as my shopwoman.</p>

On the 18th of January, about nine o'clock in the evening, when I did my horse up, I saw this harness safe - I missed it next morning when I went to the stable - I could see no foot-marks about - I had double locked the stable, and found the lock broken off - I afterwards saw two pairs of traces, two bridles, one with a bit, and one without, a collar, martingale, and a pair of driving reins - I have not recovered above a quarter of what was taken.</p>
               <p>LEWIS BEACHEM. I am a saddler, and live at No. 56, Whitechapel-road. - On the 21st of January, about half-past four o'clock in the evening, the prisoner brought this harness for sale in a bag; I asked him several questions about who he lived with; he said a person named Alder - we asked where he got it - he said his master was like other people, poor - we had seen a bill describing the property, and sent for an officer - he afterwards said he had it from a person named Wells - that was before the officer came - he also said in the officer's presence that he received it from Wells - he said Wells trusted him to sell it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is yours a public-shop? A. Yes - there was a bill in my shop, offering a reward for the property, but not in my window - I had seen one posted near Whitechapel-church, offering twenty guineas reward, and describing the harness - I am positive he said he had it from another person, besides Wells; my brother was in the shop, and can corroborate what I say: he did not mention any name - he said his master was poor like other people, and he had brought it for sale, being the property of his master, and said his master's name was Alder; I was examined on his trial on Thursday; but was not asked whether he said he brought it from anybody but Wells - I did not mention about his saying he was sent by his master, who was poor, like other people; the Judge asked who he said he had it from - I told him Wells; you would not let me say any thing more; when I was going to mention it, you said I might go down.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you not asked several questions after that, both by me and the Judge? A. I do not recollect any.</p>

No - he said this when he came out of the shop - I believe he said the same in the shop - Beachem and his brother were there, within hearing; they made no observation in answer to him - I was not in the shop two minutes; I have searched for a person named Wells, but cannot find him - a man answering his description has absconded.</p>
               <p>HENRY PARNELL. I am stable-keeper at a public-house in Mile-end-road. On the the 21st of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the tap-room alone: he threw a bag into the first box, in the tap-room, and soon after Wells came in - I have seen Wells once or twice before; they spoke together, what about, I do not know - I could not form an opinion what was in the bag - it seemed as if there was a good sized bundle in it - I left them in the house, opposite the bar.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW CHAMPKEN. This is the harness, this is master's crest on it; the same as is on my button; and here is the roller which I cut off, before it was lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your master circulated a bill, offering a reward for the property? A. Yes - it was found three days after the robbery - the bills were about the neighbourhood the prisoner took it to - the crest could have been taken off in a minute, if he chose; the appearance has not been altered in the least - this is rather the worst part of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was given to me, by a man named Wells, who asked if I could sell it for him - I told him I would try - I went along Whitechapel, into Beachem's shop; I told him I had it from a man named Wells, who asked me to sell it for him - I never saw the harness till I turned it out of the bag in his shop - Beachem showed me a bill, which he had in his window, and said "This is the very harness I have been looking for" - he called the street-keeper, and gave me in charge.</p>

               <p>JAMES TALLY. I am nearly eleven years old; I go to church, and believe persons who tell lies will be punished in the next world. I was standing by the Old White Horse Cellar, against the lamp-post - the prosecutor was two yards from me; two boys were together - I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take the handkerchief out - he delivered it to the other boy; I sweep a crossing close by the place - I told a gentleman what I had seen, and he informed Mr. Strathern; two men laid hold of the two boys, one got away, and dropped the handkerchief on the ground - the prisoner was detained; I am sure he is the person who took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me near the gentleman's pocket? A. I saw you put your hand into the gentleman's pocket, and take out a handkerchief; you delivered it to the other, who dropped it.</p>
               <p>JAMES FISHER. I am a Police-constable. I was called from the opposite side of the way; a gentleman had Smith in custody, and gave him in charge for stealing the handkerchief; he said nothing to it - I asked if any body had seen him do it, and Tally said he had - I have had the handkerchief ever since.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been on an errand for my master to Knightsbridge; I came Piccadilly way home - there was a crowd assembled at the coach office; I was passing through, a gentleman laid hold of me, and said I had stolen his handkerchief - I said I had not seen one; he gave me in charge - the gentleman then said, "I cannot swear I saw him near my pocket, nor did I feel any thing, but I have lost my handkerchief;" he had it then in his hand - the gentleman who took me laid hold of another lad, and let him go; as we went to the watch-house the Police-man told the lad he would get more by prosecuting me than if he was sweeping the crossing - I ask the prosecutor if he did not say so.</p>
               <p>JAMES FISHER. On my oath I did not make use of those words, or any thing to that effect.</p>
               <p>MR. STRATHERN. I did not hear the officer say any thing of the kind to the boy.</p>

            . I am a constable of Paddington. About seven o'clock on Friday morning I was called up by the night-patrol, who said he had discovered a quantity of fowls under the hay-stack in a meadow close to my garden; he asked if he might stand in my stable to watch who came for them, and pointed to the prisoner, who, he said, was waiting about, and had passed him two or three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180061"/>times near the spot - I gave him leave, and asked him to give me a description of the prisoner - I went out to look for him, and directly I got outside my garden-gate, the prisoner stood about a hundred yards off; he made off to the back of some buildings; I lost him, and found him concealed behind a wash-house; I went and asked him what he did there; he said he came to case himself; I said that would not do, he was my prisoner - he said, "I know you, and you know me" - I said, "That don't matter, you must go with me" - he said he would not - I collared him; he got from me two or three times, and made across to some new buildings, and then back to the meadows; we had several struggles; he wrestled my staff out of my hand; at last White came up and secured him - he said, "What do you want of me?" I said, "You know better than I do" - after he was in custody I and Chapman went and fetched the fowls to the watch-house, and counted them in his presence; there were thirteen fowls and three geese; we took his shoes off, brought them to the hay-stack, and the print of the shoes in the snow, both going to and coming from the stack, corresponded with his shoes; it was very severe weather; the shoes are nailed, and correspond with the nail-holes in every respect - we took him about half-past seven o'clock - I first saw him soon after seven - there is a path across the meadow - I took him into the meadow, which he had run into; I found the impression of every nail in the snow.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say at the office, that I was only twenty yards from the hay-stack when you took me? A. I said a hundred yards: you were behind the washhouse, not in front - when I first saw you, you were about a hundred yards from the stack.</p>

            . I am the night-patrol. On Friday morning, a few minutes before seven o'clock, I saw the patrol - I went to the stack and found the poultry, a basket, and a pickaxe in the basket; some of them were in a basket, and some loose; I watched to see who would come for them, and in a quarter of an hour the prisoner passed me, while I stood by the watch-box, about forty yards from the haystack - I looked after him, saw him return, and described him to Freeman; he would have liberated him. if it had not been for me; he was scuffling with him - we took him to the watch-house, and took off his shoes - I went to the haystack, and compared them with the foot-marks; the snow had rather drifted near the stack, and we could not match them there, but as far as the snow remained in the way to the stack, I found marks of the shoes, and the prints of the nails corresponded exactly - I saw nobody else lurking about; he was detained till we found the prosecutor, who swore to the poultry.</p>
               <p>GOULD KNIGHT. I am a Police-constable. I had the prisoner in my custody for stealing a fowl on the 1st of January, and know this pick-axe was in his possession then, for I took it from him about two o'clock in the morning; it was in my possession for a week, and then returned to his wife at the door of my house in East-street, Manchester-square; she lived in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove with the prisoner - I am quite sure it is the same axe; it is a peculiar kind of one; I know it by letters on it, and the basket very much corresponds with one he had, but has been fresh bound since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My wife sold the axe; it was not in my possession; it is not likely I should go by the witness, when I saw him turn up the road, and go right to where the property was concealed - I went right up Black Lion-lane; it was eight o'clock.</p>

            . I live at Orchard-house, Blackwall. I know the prosecutor's house, on the other side of the water - I am the wife of Hook, who was tried for this offence last Session. Beadle came to my door on the 16th of December, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and asked if Master Hook lived there - I asked what he wanted - he told me he had brought his boat home, and that he was home before him; my husband kept a boat - I went out and saw it was my husband's boat, and told him he had better haul it in alongside the other boats, which he did, and came ashore - I saw twine in the boat in the course of the day; there was a large quantity - my hus<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180062"/>band was not at home; Lucas came to my house a short time after - he and Beadle then staid at my house, and spoke about the twine; I asked where they had left my husband - they said at Rotherhithe; they said they were glad the twine had come home safe - Lucas said so to Beadle; my husband did not deal in twine - he is a fisherman - when my husband came home they were in conversation together, and had a little money to divide among themselves; the twine was brought ashore, and put into our house; it was not removed from there before they divided the money; they went away, and returned next morning, the 17th, fetched a horse and cart, and took away the twine - they all three assisted in loading it. and my husband took it away in the cart; he has been transported for this offence; Beadle came down next day (Friday), and said Lucas had sent him to see if there was any money - I met him, and told him my husband was not at home; on the Monday he came down again, alone, to see if there was any money - he said he had come from Lucas; my husband was not at home: on Tuesday the officers searched our house - the twine had been all removed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where it had gone to? A. Yes, to Limehouse-cut - it was sunk under the water; I saw it there; after the officers were gone Lucas came down, and asked my husband, in my hearing, if it had been got rid of- my husband told him he had chucked it away, and would not have any thing more to do with it, and would not tell him where he had put it; Lucas was quite in a rage, and was very much dissatisfied; next day Beadle came, he said Lucas had sent him, and told him not to be afraid of speaking, for he would not be ranked in such a manner; my husband was taken about nine o'clock the same evening; the twine was found two or three days after - I went to Lucas, and told him my husband was taken; I found him at his lodgings at Rotherhithe - he told me not to fret, he would do his endeavours.</p>
               <p>Lucas. I was never down at Orchard-house with Hook.</p>
               <p>Witness. He was - what I have said of him is true; he has been taken up, and discharged since my husband was convicted.</p>
               <p>Lucas. Since that she has said if she could transport me as well as her husband, she would do it, as well as laid in her power. Witness. Never, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Beadle. She offered to sell some of the twine. Witness. I never did in my life.</p>

            . I am single, and live with my father, in High-street, Poplar - he is a warehouseman. Hook came to hire a cart of my mother, and asked my mother if I might go down to Orchard-house, to tell his wife he wanted her; I went, and saw Lucas and Beadle there, at dinner - I saw no twine there: Mrs. Hook asked me to go and get a pot of beer, and when I brought it she asked me to stop dinner; I said I had dined; Lucas said I had better have some - I know nothing more; this was the same day as Hook had the cart, but before he had got it.</p>

            . I live by the Orchard-house, which is by the water-side, at Poplar, near the iron-bridge - I saw the prisoners at Hook's house on the 16th of December, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and about two in the afternoon I went there again, and they were sitting by the fire, with Hook, drinking porter - Hook asked me to drink, which I did - I went there again the following week, and saw Mrs. Hook and Beadle, in conversation; he said he had come from Lucas, who had told him not to be afraid to speak out, he would be rent in no such manner - Beadle said he had had no victuals for two or three days - she gave him some bread and meat, and asked if I had any money; I said, only 2d., which I lent her - she put a halfpenny to it, and told him to get a pint of beer with it as he went along - I never heard any thing about the twine from the prisoners - on Christmas-eve, when Hook was in custody, I went to the Thames-police, with Mrs. Hook, and saw a great quantity of twine - Mrs. Hook asked me to go over to Rotherhithe with her; I went to Mrs. Knight's, where Lucas lodged - he came in; Mrs. Hook told him her husband was taken - he told her to never mind, and not fret, for he would work his hands to stumps to support her and her family; he then said, "Never mind, if he don't say any thing, he will be cleared; and I will work to get him a counsel to defend him." - Mrs. Hook asked me again, to go to the office with her, at the last examination but one; I went, Lucas was then in custody, he sent one of the officers to say he wanted to speak to Mrs. Hook; she did not like to go, and I went to him, and told him Mrs. Hook could not come, and if he had a message I would deliver it to Mr. Hook; he told me to ask Mr. Hook if he had said any thing - I went to Hook, returned, and told Lucas that Hook said he had said nothing - he said, if he had not, they would get clear; and he would suffer the rope to go round his neck, rather than say any thing himself.</p>

            . I am a Thames-Police-officer. On the 23rd of December, at ten o'clock at night, I was at Bow-creek, Poplar, and took Hook on suspicion of this robbery - I took a quantity of twine that day out of Limehouse-cut, it was sunk under the water; I dragged up 2cwt. - it was afterwards claimed by Mr. Newman, and I took two coils from Lee-bridge; I found that in the house of Wicks.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JUDGE. I am a Thames-Police-officer. I was in company with my brother officers, and saw the twine found; here is a sample of it - I do not know whether the prisoners or Hook were acquainted with Wicks.</p>
               <p>Mr. NEWMAN. I saw the twine at the office - this is part of it; I am sure it is the twine stolen - it was sworn to on the last trial; I know it to be my manufacture - it was kept locked up in my warehouse which was broken open.</p>

I left home on the 18th of December, and left our pigeons about I believe - I returned on the 21st, in consequence of what my son said; I looked into the dove-cot, and missed the pigeons - there was a hole forced through, quite large enough for a man to get through; after missing the pigeons I went to Mr. Calis' house, and asked if he had bought any pigeons - he said Yes; I said, "Of whom?" he said, "What is that to you?" on the 5th of February I went there, on the day the shooting was, and saw about a score of pigeons, which were shot, and were dead - while the shooting was going on I had three pigeons come home, one of which I knew;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180065"/>it had a feather broken in its tail, as if it had been shot - in consequence of what I afterwards heard from Calis I had him and the prisoner taken; Calis was discharged -I had pigeons like those I saw dead in the hamper at Calis', and one I particularly knew.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many pigeons did you lose? A. About fifty - I have the live pigeons here which came home, and which I particularly speak to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How many pigeons had you? A. About fifty; I believe I had seen them a day or two before the 18th of December - about the 16th; there was about the usual number; I returned on the 21st, and missed them the same day - I did not ask Mr. Calis to let me see them till the 5th of February; I had seen him two or three times in the time, and said to him, "Mr. Calis, you have bought a lot of pigeons?" he said, Yes -I said, "Of whom did you buy them?" he said, "What is that to you?" the three pigeons came home on the 5th of February, in a direction from Mr. Calis' - they do sometimes wander; this pigeon, whose tail is shot, came in that direction - I can swear it is mine; I never caught it till last night - I can swear this is the one; I do not know any thing particular about it - it is a common sort of pigeon.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. When did you hear there was to be a shooting-match? A. On the 4th of February - I staid at home on the day of the shooting, to see if any of the pigeons came home; I heard firing in the direction of Calis,' at the time the pigeons returned - I have no doubt of this pigeon being mine; I have occasionally fed them - the one I noticed in the hamper was a very remarkable one; as soon as I saw it I said, "This is mine, and I will swear to it" six or eight persons then got up, and forced it from me - they would not let me go out of the room with it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the one that is alive, like one of those you had in your dove-cot? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CALIS. I keep the Black Horse, but I never had a shooting match there before in my life. I bought four dozen pigeons of the prisoner at the bar, but only two dozen were shot at - I gave 6s. a dozen for them; on the 21st of December he came to me, and asked if I was going to have a shooting party - I said Yes; he said, "I can get you some pigeons cheap from the country;" I might have seen him at my house, and have drawn him beer - I was in the house before on the day of the shooting; the pigeons which were killed were put into a hamper - I had no other pigeons but those I bought of the prisoner; two dozen of them had got out, or had died; Jeffcoat saw the hamper in which the dead pigeons were, and they were part of what I bought of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You said two dozens of them died? A. Yes, or got away; I should think a dozen got away - Mr. Jeffcoat had been at my house, he drank tea, and supped; had he asked to see the pigeons I should have said, "There is the key, you may go and look at them."</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did not he ask if you had bought any pigeons? A. I do not know that he did; he might say so, and I might say "What is that to you?"</p>

            . I am thirteen years of age - I know the nature of an oath; it is a sin to swear falsely. I remember my father going out in December last - he had fifty pigeons - I used to feed them sometimes; about two days after my father was gone, I saw the dove-cot; it had a hole poked through the tiles, and the pigeons were all gone - I had seen them safe two or three days before - they were not fed every day; I believe this one to be my father's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How many of this description had your father? A. No more like this; they had more white about them - there was one of them very particular.</p>
               <p>JAMES HITCHCOCK. I live just by the prosecutor. On the 5th of February I was in his yard; I heard firing in the direction of Mr. Calis' - I saw two pigeons come in a direction from there; they alighted on the dove-cot, and went in at the holes - there was a brown one feeding there, which he said had come home before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. If you had heard nothing of the prosecutor losing pigeons, should you have thought it unusual for pigeons to come there? A. Yes, unless they had been born and bred there; I have kept pigeons, but do not now.</p>

On Tuesday, the 16th of February, I was at the door of the Magpie and Stump, at New Brentford-Vincent came and asked me if I wanted to buy a bargain; I asked what it was - he said he did not rightly know, but he thought it was a swine - I asked where it was; he said a man belonged to it up the market; I asked if I could see the man - he said he did not think I could then, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180066"/>at nine o'clock in the evening, if I would meet him there, he would take me to the man - I went at that time, and Vincent came and said the man was over at the market place - I went with him to the Butts public-house, close behind the market, and saw Thomas whom I knew before; I asked Thomas what he had in the sack - he said a pig; I asked what he wanted for it - he said 12s. - I said,"Let me put my hand into the sack, and feel if it is a pig;" he said, "Weight it first, and then you may put your hand and feel;" I did so, and then I said, "Now tell me the truth where you got this pig;" he said, "The whole truth of it is, I got it from a farm close against Feltham church-yard;" I did not know the farm at that time, but I have been there since - I said to him, "Bring the pig along then down to my house," and they both brought it; I locked them both in my room and bolted the door, but as there was only my wife in the house, I did not like to leave them there, so I said "I have not the money in the house, but if you will leave the pig, and go and get a pot of beer, I will come and pay you for it; but mind, I shall only give you 10s. for it;" they went - I told my wife to lock and bolt the door, and keep the pig inside; I went, and got the officer - we went, and took the prisoners at the public-house; the next morning I went to Feltham, and at last found Mr. Brumbridge - he came, and owned the pig.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Did you see your watch go? A. No; it was about ten o'clock at night; there was a good light - I had been at a dinner; we sat down about four o'clock - I was sober - it was the licensed victualler's dinner - there were a great many persons; there were four or five turning off the steps, and the moment I turned, these persons rushed round me, and the watch was taken; I know I had it; as I came along I had my hand on the seals - when the rush was made I recoiled, supposing I was the intruder - the prisoner was secured struggling across the street, and I was then sensible the watch was gone; I followed and secured him; the watch was taken up and lodged in the hands of Mr. Bleadon.</p>

On the 15th of February I lost a handkerchief from my coat pocket, about five o'clock - I do not know the street I was in; the officer told me, and I missed it; it was in the officer's hand; I cannot say exactly when I had had it; I saw the prisoners at the time, but I had not seen them before.</p>

               <p>Smith's Defence. I was going to East Smithfield with some work, and was taken by the side of this gentleman.</p>

I lost two pairs of stockings between the 18th and 22nd of January; they had been in my possession on the 18th, and the prisoner left my father's service on the 22nd - I have seen them at Guildhall, they had the letter B. which the laundress had put on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The laundress put it in? A. Yes - I had bought them on the 5th of January; the prisoner had been two or three months in my father's employ: she had given notice to quit; she had not left her address with me - I had paid her her wages - we had a character with her; the initial of her name is the same as mine; I have two sisters.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you an opportunity of searching her box? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BLUNDELL. The prisoner was in my service from the beginning of November till the 22nd of February - I received information that she was gone to live in Fetter-lane, and I went there with an officer; I found two pairs of cotton stockings in her box, which was enclosed in a trunk - she gave up the key of it; I had a pair of stockings with me, and those I found corresponded with them; she said they were her own, but did not say where she got them; she said at Guildhall that she bought them and marked them, and her name being Baines, she had marked them with the letter B. - here are the stockings, and this is the pair I took with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean there were no other things in the trunk marked with B.? A. There were other things marked, but not in the same way; this is done by a laundress - I did not see her do it; it is just run with a needle and cotton, and the other articles were marked in the way a sampler is - these are marked with red; I do not know what colour her other things were marked with; there might be stockings marked with B. for what I know - I saw a great many stockings marked with B.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said you found these stockings marked with a B. - that she said she always marked with a B., and you say they were not marked in the same way? A. They are marked in a more temporary way.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there a B. on the prisoner's stockings? A. There might be; no doubt there was, but I did not take particular notice; there was a difference between these and hers.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know there was a difference, if you paid no attention? A. They might be marked with a B. but I did not take particular notice; all that I looked at were marked 
               <persName id="t18300218-152-person1044">B. </persName>
            - I cannot swear they were not marked with red; they were of a different texture - the prisoner had given notice to quit - I had not quarrelled with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make a charge against her, and she said she would not stay in the house? A. No. My cook afterwards gave me warning to quit; I did not ask the prisoner to take the cook's place; the cook's name was Simmonds - I had no quarrel with her, I do not know whether my wife had - I have not been speaking to any of the witnesses who are to give the prisoner a character, to my knowledge; I have not, to my recollection - two or three persons have come to me to request me to be as lenient as possible - I have spoken to a man named Hilditch; I have not endeavoured to prevent his coming forward - I told him she had been guilty of a theft, because Mrs. Hilditch had recommended her into my family; - it was a fortnight after she left before I went to search her trunk, but I did not know of it before.</p>

I went with Mr. Blundell to the prisoner's room, in Fetter-lane - she presented the keys of her box; I said, "You had better open it yourself;" and she did - we found two pairs of stockings in the box; Mr. Blundell looked at them, and mentioned the slight way in which they were marked; there is only one pair marked - he made an observation on the marks of the others in the trunk; on the size of the letter - the other stockings were marked with a small B. - I considered some of them were marked with red, and some with ink.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She gave up her keys the moment you asked her? A. Yes - it would not take half a minute to take out this mark.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the watch in Bishopsgate. About two o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 26th of January, the prosecutor said he had been robbed of a pocket-book, containing 50l. in Winchester and Bank of England notes; and his purse, and that he had been at that public house; I told him to come to me at eight o'clock in the morning, and I would accompany him to the house to ascertain who had been there - as he did not come at eight o'clock I went by myself to the house - I asked the landlord who had been there, and he could not give me any account - he said he had no doubt he should know the persons if they were brought before him; I went with my brother officer to Rose-lane, Spitalfields, and went into a room on the ground floor, in a house near the top - I found Allen, Relf, Magnus, and Flemare and Lewis who was in bed with another woman; I told Allen I wanted to speak to him - he came out and asked what I wanted; I asked if he had been at the Rose - he said he had been at a public-house; I said I supposed he knew what I wanted him for - he said, "What, for the man that was robbed last night;" I said Yes - he asked if I was an officer, and desired to see my authority; I showed it him, and then told my brother officer to go in and search the room - he called me in; there was nothing but a bed in the room - he placed his back against the door; I searched and found this pocket-book in the bed - it contains every thing but the money - I asked how they came by it, and they all said they knew nothing about it: I took Allen and Relf into custody, because I heard they had been at the place over night - I took them to the Bell and Crown, where the prosecutor was, and he owned the pocket-book; I then went back to the house to get Magnus and Flemare, but they were gone - I brought up Lewis, and two other women, whom I found there, and before the Magistrate, Lewis said she rented the room; we then took them to Worship-street- I went to the Rose, and took Rogers; Lewis said Allen had given her the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And you found Allen in the room with her? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Allen. he came and said he wanted me, and said,"Were you at the Rose?" I said I was - he said, "There was a robbery committed there;" I said, "I am innocent"- I had no objection to go with him. Witness. He mentioned the robbery first, I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DICK. I went to the house, and we found all the prisoners there but Rogers - I heard my brother officer tell Allen he wanted him; Allen said, "What, for the robbery at the Rose?" - he said Yes; I said,</p>
               <p>"I have known you from a boy, if you act well I will not ill-use you" - I had agreed to meet Relf in Bishopsgate-street; I went there, saw him meet the pot-boy, and speak to him, and as soon as he saw me he set off - I could not follow him, but I met my brother officer, went to Rose-lane, and took them there; I afterwards went to the Rose, and saw Rogers- I called him out, and asked if he knew any thing about a purse - he said Yes, it was a skin purse that Allen gave it to him, and they burnt it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you in the room at Rose-lane before the officer was? A. We went together - I knocked; the door was not opened, and I pushed it open - I went in; the room was very dark, but I looked round, and saw Allen.</p>
               <p>Allen. Q. You say you was with the other officer when he asked me if I knew any thing about the robbery? A. No; he said, "I want you; I suppose you know what for?" and you said, "What, for the robbery at the Rose?"</p>
               <p>Allen. When the knock was at the door it was opened - Relf was brushing his shoes; he had not been there five minutes - he asked him where Allen was; he said, "There, by the fire;" I said, "Do you want me?" when they got me outside they said there was a robbery last night, and they wanted me - I said I had no objection to go with him. Witness. I am quite sure he first mentioned the robbery.</p>
               <p>Relf. Q. Did not I tell you, if you thought there was any thing, to go in and search? A. Yes, you did.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TURNER. I am landlord of the Rose. I believe all the prisoners were there that night, in company with twenty more, except Lewis; they were there the greater part of the evening, but I did not know any of them by name - I saw the prosecutor come in tipsy, about half-past nine o'clock; I had only been in the house six days - the prosecutor sat at the end of the tap-room; I saw no one near him - he went to sleep after taking a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Allen. Q. Was he not tipsy? A. Yes, very tipsy - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180072"/>could hardly get the money to pay for the beer; I stood I suppose, ten minutes before he gave me the shilling, and I gave him the change - they all went out together; they all knew of the robbery before they went - the prosecutor first said he had lost 14s., and then 25s.; he then clapped his hand to his side pocket, and said he had lost his pocketbook and all his property; it was then ten minutes before eleven o'clock - I said, "Upon my word I think you have not lost any thing, as you give such different accounts, but you can go to an officer, and come to me in the morning."</p>
               <p>Allen. Q. Did not I go away at a quarter before ten o'clock? A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Magnus. Q. Did you not get me to assist in moving your goods up and down? A. Yes, for two or three days.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then he did not come in with the others? A. I do not know that he did, but he was there - I thought he seemed to be industrious, and I asked him to assist me - I let him have 5s. to start him in business to sell oranges, lemons, and clothes.</p>
               <p>JOHN GARDNER. I am pot-boy at the Rose. I saw the prosecutor there asleep - Allen was by him at one time, and Rogers was near him at the same time; I do not know that they sat there all the time - I was in and out of the room; I saw them once or twice - they might be near him five or ten minutes; Flemare was sitting opposite him, singing all the evening - the others were a good way off; Relf was near the door - I saw Flemare go out once, that was all; Magnus was just by Flemare -Lewis was there in the evening while the prosecutor was asleep - I suppose she was two or three yards from him, and not at the same table; I heard him say he had been robbed of 14s., and then of 25s. - he then put his hand to his side pocket, and said he had lost his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Allen. Q. Did you see me touch, or take any notice of him? A. No, you were sitting by him - I did not see any of them touch him.</p>
               <p>Relf. Q. Did you see me near him? A. No, you sat at the further end of the room,</p>
               <p>Magnus. Q. Was not I there with a few oranges? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see one of them the next morning? A. Yes, I saw Relf, as I was going for some sugar, and he asked what time the soup would be ready - I told him at twelve o'clock - I left him and two or three more talking.</p>
               <p>Flemare. Q. Was I sitting near the prosecutor? A. No, you were sitting opposite, and went out about two minutes before the rest; Allenwent out at a quarter-past ten o'clock, and came back just as all the rest were gone - he said he had been to get some money to have something more to drink.</p>
               <p>JAMES SHUTTLEWORTH. I am a bricklayer. I went to the Rose about eight o'clock, and sat there till half-past nine; I saw the prosecutor come in, and have some beer, and bread and cheese - I went out, and came back five minutes after ten; I saw Allen sitting by the side of the prosecutor, and Rogers near him, but a girl sat between him and the prosecutor - Lewis was there when I went about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see Lewis do any thing with the prosecutor? A. No, nor near him - there was another female with her.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the watch. On the night of the 7th of February I took Flemare from information - I put my hand on his shoulder, and said, "I want you;" he said, "What for?" I said,</p>
               <p>"If you will come with me, I will tell you" - he walked about one hundred yards, and then ran from me; he was stopped and I took him to the watch-house - he admitted that he was at the Rose on the evening of the robbery; I could not find him before.</p>
               <p>Flemare. Q. Was I not in liquor? A. I did not perceive it if he was - it was at half-past eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM EDWARDS. This is my pocket-book - I had two purses. one a canvas one, and one was the dried skin of a bullock's heart.</p>
               <p>Allen's Defence. I saw the prosecutor come into the tap-room at the Rose - he looked about, and went into the bar; I went to get my pipe filled, and saw him there - he had some bread and cheese in a plate; he came into the tap-room, and sat down at the further end - Relf sat five or six yards from him, and Rogers by the side of him for about a minute; Magnus was sitting there, and Flemare was singing songs - I saw two or three women there, but not Lewis; one of the women shook the prosecutor- I took no notice; she had a plaid cloak, and a white Leghorn bonnet on - in a few minutes I saw her take his arm, and then lay it down - she then went out; I went to light my pipe at the gas, and saw a kind of skin lying - I said to Rogers, "Put it on the fire, it will make a blaze;" I was not half a minute by the prosecutor, and know nothing of the transation.</p>
               <p>Relf's Defence. I came out of the Rose with the prosecutor - he said he had been robbed, and would go for an officer; I went home to bed, and went to Rose-lane in the morning - I suppose the officer watched me; I went to get a brush to brush my clothes, to go after a situation.</p>
               <p>Rogers' Defence. I was in the house most of the evening - the prosecutor came in at half-past nine o'clock; I was by the fire - there were a great many people, and we sat down to make room; I sat near the prosecutor - there was, I believe, one person between us; Allen picked up a purse, and said to me, "Put that on the fire to make a blaze;" I did so.</p>
               <p>Magnus' Defence. I know nothing of it; I went the next morning to get my bag and basket, and was taken.</p>
               <p>Flemare's Defence. I went and had a pint of beer, and on coming out I saw a journeyman baker, named Green- he asked if I knew where to find Relf; I said I might find him, and the next morning I went towards the Rose- the man came out and said Relf was not there; I went to Rose-lane, and saw Relf go into the house - I went and told him Green wanted him; I was there smoking my pipe when the officer came.</p>
               <p>Lewis' Defence. Allen gave me the book that morning - had I known to whom the book belonged, I had plenty of time to have got away; it was ten minutes before the officer returned and took us.</p>
               <p>Allen. If you will allow me to be evidence on the Crown side, I will disclose it all - I know all about it, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180073"/>I am not guilty of the transaction myself, nor do I believe any one at the bar is.</p>

               <p>JOHN WILLIAM HARRISON. I went to Mr. Simmons' house - I found these glass salts and pin-cushions - I asked the prisoner what he had done with the other things; he took me to Turner's house - he said his brother gave them to him; Mrs. Owen's son gave the prisoner to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday evening I was forced to go for relief, and while I was there a person brought the officer to take me; I said the things were at my place, and my brother had left them to take to a person in St. John's-square - I took the officer to the place.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How often had he it from you to try to dispose of on commission? A. I have been to sell it three times, and my son several times; he never had from me - I received the letter on the 6th, but he was not apprehended till Monday, the 8th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not come to you on Monday, the 8th, in person, tell you he had been robbed, and put down four sovereigns, which he had borrowed to pay you? A. He did not put down any money; he said he had four sovereigns, if I would take it, compromise it, and make a debt of it - I refused; he had appointed to meet me by letter at the White Hart, and offered to pay four sovereigns - he said he had been robbed; he did not show me his pocket - I had an officer, and he was apprehended; I understand four sovereigns were found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The horse was in a stable? A. Yes, at Newman's, in London-wall; I should never have trusted him to sell it for me - he had said he would come directly, after drinking some rum and water with me, and he never came; I never authorized him to sell it, only to find a customer - he attends the market for that purpose.</p>
               <p>JOHN JACKSON. On the 5th of September I was showing the horse for sale in Smithfield; the prisoner came and informed me the horse was sold, that he had made it all right, and settled with the governor - this was between six and seven o'clock; I was in the market - he said he had settled, and would make it all right with the governor; the horse was in the market - he took off the saddle and bridle, gave them to me, and told me I was to take them home; I have never seen the horse since - I did not see Mr. Wynn till next morning - I then told him of this; I saw the prisoner at Guildhall on the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At the time he told you the horse was sold, was it not in your possession? A. Yes, and the purchaser was present as far as I know; there was a man who said he was the purchaser - the prisoner took it away with a halter; there was nothing to prevent his taking the saddle and bridle - he had the horse out of my hands eight or nine times to try to sell it, on three different days; I always led the horse about, and he brought gentlemen to look at it - he sometimes rode upon it; I did not lead it then - he has rode it about three or four times</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know where your master was, when he took the horse away? A. There were two persons with the prisoner; he did not say which was the purchaser - neither of them said they had bought it: they went away together - I was not to sell the saddle; he said he had settled with the governor - my master was at the Greyhound</p>
               <p>JOHN FORRESTER. I am a constable. I apprchended the prisoner at the White Hart, Giltspur-street; Mr. Wynn was with me - he said he had four sovereigns to pay; Wynn gave him in charge; I found four sovereigns and a duplicate on him - he said he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not go to the White Hart expecting to meet him there by his appointment? A. Certainly, from what Wynn said.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WYNN re-examined. I had seen the prisoner once before; I am well known at Hackney - the letter was directed to Hackney; I live in the Hackney-road - the bridle and saddle did not belong to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I could not direct the letter right; I did not know Mr. Wynn's address - I leave my case entirely to your consideration.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHURCH. I lodge with the prisoner, at Mrs. Coker's, Brackley-street, Golden-lane. On the 5th of February, about one o'clock in the night, I saw him in Beech-street, Barbican, about three hundred yards from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180075"/>our lodgings; I found him laying on the pavement, and said, "Halloo old chap, what do you here?" I looked at him, not knowing him, and saw it was him - I lifted him up: he was very much intoxicated; his breeches pockets were torn down - he said he had been robbed, and in the morning his landlady lent him another pair of trousers while his own were mended; there was nothing to prevent his running away - he came home regularly to bed at night.</p>

My husband is a town-carman. -The prisoner has lodged with us above twelve months, and conducted himself remarkably well - I saw him on Saturday morning, the 6th; his trousers pocket was ripped down to the thigh - I asked how it came to be done; he said he did not know - I lent him four sovereigns on Monday morning; he said he had been robbed of some money not his own, and he wanted to make up all he could for the gentleman, and had pawned a coat to try to make up some more.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you speak to Wright, and desire to know whether the things were silver? A. Not to the auctioncer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I think you are a Lancashire person? A. Yes; on my first entrance there were about ten persons in the room, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear when you asked whether the tops of the glasses were silver, that he did not say they were German silver? A. It was the top of the large one - he said it was silver: he did not mention German silver till afterwards. (The dressing-case was here produced.) I am not twenty-one years old; I believe this is the box, but do not know it to be the same - I am not able to say whether it is worth 35s.; this is the top which he alluded to; I bought it after he represented it as silver -I swear positively that he did not say it was German silver; my friend said his handing over the 10s. would make no alteration whatever, but it might have some influence with the Jury - I was told the prosecution should not cost me a farthing, it should be done at the City expence. I did not hear any thing said about the other two boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you wit enough to know if that top was silver, it would be worth all the money offered? A. I should think not - I should have tried the weight of it before I could judge the value; I will not swear I have not said I did not wish to prosecute, but do not think I used that expression - I do not think I said a word to Wright about the dressing-case before I purchased it; I suppose he was two or three yards from Duggan when I had the conversation about its being silver - the shop is very dark; Wright could not see Duggan, nor Duggan see Wright, at least I think so; I mean to say Wright could not see the transactions of Duggan, so as to be able to see the articles which were showing round.</p>
               <p>MR. MIREHOUSE. Q. Wright was in the pulpit? A. Yes, acting as auctioneer, and Duggan as servant; Wright was near enough to hear what Duggan said, and then he enlarged about it - I bought it in consequence of what Duggan said.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you speak to Wright respecting it, and tell him it was not silver? A. After I bought it I did; he said he was answerable for the acts of his servant - I never heard him say it was silver.</p>

            . I was present in the shop on the afternoon in question, when the dispute took place between Mr. Walton and the auctioneer, but not when the box was put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180076"/>up - I had been in the shop a minute or two, when the prosecutor said to Wright, "Now mind you have stated, all the tops of the glass-stands in the box are solid silver;" he said that to Wright, and Wright said, "Oh, no" -Walton replied, "Why. you represented them to be so, and that induced me to purchase the lot" - Wright then said,"I only represented them as German silver" - I do not know what German silver is; I believe there is a distinction between German and common silver - Walton said, "If they are not as you have represented them to be, solid silver, I am taken in, and you must therefore refund my deposit"- Wright refused to return any money, saying the goods, were in fact what they were represented to be, German silver - finding he could get no redress from Wright, he turned to Duggan, and said, "Why, you represented that the articles were solid silver;" Duggan began to laugh, and said, "Oh, no, Sir, they are silver mounted" - Walton told Duggan immediately after, that he had not only stated them to be silver, but had guaranteed it - I understand the conversation to refer to all the tops distinctly.</p>

I am not at present in any regular business, and have not been so for several months - my mother was a laundress and mangler; her business came into my hands at her death; but I have since disposed of it - I held the concern about four months, and mangled - I have done nothing since - I have money to live on - my mother died about ten months ago, and I came into a little property - about seven years ago.

            , a dealer in fancy trimmings, and was seven years with him; I have followed the same business ever since I was fourteen years old; I never kept a shop - nobody employed me to go to this auction; I went to give evidence on this case, and was bound over by the Magistrate - I had looked into the auction-room, as other people do, to kill time, seeing respectable people there; for the last seven years I have lived with my mother, and conducted her mangling business - I am sure Walton charged Wright with representing the articles as silver, and Duggan also, both of them; I have been at the extreme end of the Court, and did not hear Walton's evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state before the Alderman that you heard nothing that Wright said? A. I do not remember answering such a question - I am sure I never stated to the Magistrate that I did not hear Wright say any thing; I did not distinctly understand the question before - I did not hear Wright represent any of the articles as silver.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long will you swear you have seen either of them at that shop? A. A long time back, but not long at this time, because the place has been shut up once; it has been a trunk-maker's since, and then it was re-opened - it has not been re-opened as an auction-room above two or three months, but had not been an auction-room for twelve months before.</p>

            . I know the auction-room in Cheapside, I believe it is No. 19. I live in Howland-street, Fitzroy-square; I was at the auction-room on the 26th of December, and saw the prosecutor there; I do not recollect seeing Curtis there; there was a dressing-case put up for sale - this is such a case; I cannot swear it is the same - I heard Mr. Walton bid for it; I did not hear any thing pass on the subject of the tops - I was there half an hour before the case was sold; I do not know at what time the prosecutor came in; I did not see him pay any thing, as there were persons standing between us; I heard Walton say to Wright, "Are the tops silver?" or to that effect - I cannot be positive to the words; he replied, "I don't represent them as solid silver at all;" that was the first I heard; Walton and him seemed to have a dispute about it - I do not know what was said; I had bought six goblets, and had a very fair bargain.</p>
               <p>MR. MIREHOUSE. Q. Then there was a dispute? A. yes, but I did not hear what was said; I heard that he did not sell the case representing the tops to be silver - what had passed before I do not know; I heard nothing about German silver.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. If Duggan had said before it was sold, that the tops were silver, must you have heard it? A. Yes; I was close to the place.</p>
               <p>SAMPSON GENESSE. I know the auction-room in Cheapside; Mr. Martin is the proprietor of it - I am clerk there: Wright is an auctioner, and has a commission for what he sells - Duggan is the same; I was there the whole of the morning in question - I saw Mr. Walton come in; no observation had been made by Duggan on the subject of the tops being silver; if it had I must have heard it - Mr. Walton paid a deposit to me of half a sovereign; he came to me in about five minutes after, and asked if the tops were silver - I said they were not; he said he understood they were, and wished for his 10s. back; I said they were not mentioned as silver, and I should not return the 10s. - if I had he would have been glad to go away; he went out, and came back with a respectable person, whom I do not see here - he then wished for his 10s., and I said we would not give it him; I suppose the regular shop price of an article of this description would he about 50s.; it is rose-wood - it is cheap at 35s.</p>
               <p>MR. MIREHOUSE. Q. Had you heard 38s. bid for it? No; I am paid so much a week by Mr. Martin - he is not here - I did not interfere till the article was knocked down; the room was full.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you sure you heard all that the other persons heard? A. Yes; if such an observation had been made I must have heard it - Mr. Martin lives in the Haymarket, and has two auction-rooms; he has broken the bone of his thigh.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is your desk from the pulpit where Wright was? A. Close by the side of it; Wright could not have made any declaration from the pulpit that the tops were silver, without my hearing it - he never made a word of such a representation.</p>

I am a judge of such articles as this - the lowest price for putting together the materials would be 10s. - it is made of rose-wood, and the inside is cedar; the value of the materials wood be 6s. or 7s. - the veneering. lock, and brass, would be 7s. or 8s. more; the French polish, about 2s.; the lining, about 1s. 6d. or 2s.; it would be about 20s. altogether - I think the maker would sell it for 35s.; I am sure there could not then he more than 6s. profit to the master maker - I never made such a thing for less than 10s., and I have had 15s.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HASSELL. I am a cabinet-maker. This witness was my apprentice, and is a good workman - the lowest I should sell such an article as this (and that is a sacrifice) is 28s. or 30s.; I had 30s. from Mr. Jupp, and that is a sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you in the habit of making them? A. I have ever since 1790; I served my time to it - we call the tops of these Birmingham metal; they are plated - there is nothing but the standard silver, and these; these are like other plated articles.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is there a shop in Holborn for the sale of German silver? A. Yes, Mr. Edwards' - I do not know whether that is Birmingham metal washed with silver.</p>

On the following day he came again for four lengths more for the same persons; they measured about nine yards; I let him have them - that was worth 8l. 2s.; he was not taken up till the middle of January - I saw him at the examination at Guildhall; I saw Brown and Sams about a day after, and told them what had passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have the kindness to state the exact words he said the first time he came? A.

               <p>Q. Did not they direct that no cloth was ever to be given for them without a written order? A. We often gave this man cloth on their account without a written order; there was no order not to deliver cloth without - he did produce a written order sometimes, but not for one article in twenty; Messrs. Dawson and Williams have no other partners.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BROWN SAMS. I am in partnership with Mr. Brown - we are tailors, and deal with Messrs. Dawson and Williams. The prisoner was in our service, but had not been employed by us for six months previous to the 23rd of October - he had left us for more than six months; I had no knowledge whatever of his going to get these goods on our account - we should not have employed him in our business after the time we discharged him; he brought some goods to me on the 24th of October, and asked me the favour to cut out from one of the lengths a coat for himself - he did not tell me where he had got it, nor did I know - it was to be applied to his own use.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For what you know it might be the cloth mentioned in the indictment? A. For what I know.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the 24th of October he appears to have had two yards and a quarter of blue cloth from the same persons - did you authorise him to go for that for yourself, or did your partner? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>JAMES MARTIN re-examined. He came on the 24th for four lengths of two yards and a quarter each; they were blue Oxford mixed and brown - he brought a pattern-card, and pointed out the patterns for all of them.</p>
               <p>MR. SAMS. I did not know of his getting these articles, and never authorized him to get them; when he came to my house he asked me to cut a coat from the Oxford mixture - he took the whole away, and never intimated that he had got them on our account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For aught you know they may or may not be the property included in this indictment? A. I cannot say - I am convinced Mr. Brown did not send him- I am sure he did not; Mr. Brown was at that time an invalid - he was not confined to his bed; he was in the house, but not doing business - I was not with him all the day, but am convinced he did not send him; I know it, as far as it is possible for any one to know the actions of another - I did not ask him if he had sent him: I can swear positively, of my own knowledge, that he did not - he is unable to walk now; I act as foreman - nobody besides myself takes orders except Mr. Brown, and he has been unable to attend to business; I do not mean to swear he was unable to go into the shop that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the prisoner at your house before he was in possession of the cloth? A. No - I saw him with the cloth on the morning of the 24th, not the 23rd- I was at home part of the day on the 23rd, but not all day.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS addressed the Court and Jury on behalf of the prisoner, and called two witnesses, who deposed to his good character.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutrix had accosted him and must have slipped the property into his pocket, in order to extort money from him.</p>
               <p>COURT to JAMES TARR. Q. Did he deny he had taken it? A. Yes, and said it had been put into his pocket, but after that said he would leave his hat to settle it - he said they had been walking together.</p>

            . I am in Mr. King's employ, in Hosier-lane. I know the prisoner's father by sight -I went with the officer and the prisoner to Phillip-street, Kingsland-road, on the 18th of January - I understood it to be where the prisoner lodged with his father; I saw the officer find several articles which I knew were Mr. King's - here is a tin mail-horn, a coffee-pot, and other things; we left the prisoner outside with a boy, while the officer and I went in - the prisoner told us where his father lived; we knocked at the door, and asked if a person named Kneebone lived there - we went in, and saw the prisoner's mother; I did not hear him say any thing respecting these things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were any of these produced on Friday? A. Not to my knowledge; the articles were all found on the same day, but some were taken in London and some in the County - I never sold him any thing; I cannot say when these were missed - we have so many we cannot miss any thing exactly; I know Kirk - I have seen him here; this coffee-pot was standing on my desk a few days before it was missed - we have a great many in the warehouse, but do not keep goods where this stood; I know this by the top - it is made in a particular way; I do not suppose we have sold above two dozen like it - we have a stamp for this top; it is strack up by one blow, almost all others are worked up by hand - this mail-horn has a mouth-piece stamped with a die; I did it myself - I have not sold them, nor do I know whether they have been sold; I did not say on Friday, after I left this Court, "I will nick him now- he beat us on Friday, but I will nick him on Monday;" the prisoner's father is not accustomed to come to the shop - I never saw him there; the prisoner has a brother who works for the prosecutor, and lives with his father.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY to JAMES TOTTERDALL. Q. Did you see a horn in the prisoner's pocket? A. Yes, one of this description.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When did you see this? A. On the 13th of January - I did not tell my master of it till the 16th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How had he the horn in his pocket? A. If was standing upright in his pocket; I saw a little bit of the top of it - I did not know he had stolen it; I did not know but he had bought it of the warehouseman, as they were about on the Saturday - when my master mentioned about the tea-pot I told him this.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PIKE. I am an officer. I went with the prisoner to his father's house - I did not know he lived there before; I found these articles, and a great many others - the prisoner said nothing at the time; he was very willing to show us the place.</p>
               <p>MR. KING. I make such articles as these in my business: the prisoner was in my employ - I indicted him last Friday for some things taken from Islington; these were taken from London - he has a brother in my employ; I sell nothing at Islington - the goods are made there, and brought to Hosier-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You may have sold these articles? A. I cannot say - I have two or three shopmen, and seven apprentices; the shopmen are not here.</p>
               <p>JOHN JORDAN. I am in the prosecutor's employ. I know this horn by the mouth-piece - it is the way he makes all his; it is the general rule in his business to mark the goods - I made this coffee-pot myself, and can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How many dozen of that description have you made? A. Perhaps one hundred dozen; this horn is made in the same way as all the horns he sells.</p>

               <p>CHARLES SHARPE. I am a clerk to Mr. John Hodgson - he is a tobacconist in Budge-row.

               <p>JAMES AGAR. I paid two bills on the 6th of January to the prisoner, I believe, for his master, amounting to 1l. 0s. 7d. - he gave me these receipts.</p>
               <p>MR. GLADWIN. These receipts are the prisoner's writing - he never accounted for any of these monies: here is the 19th of December, but no entry to the name of Agar or Sharpe; in the week ending on the 9th of January, here is no entry from Agar, nor on the 16th of January from Sharpe - we missed some goods, and spoke to the prisoner; he made out a list of some money which he had embezzled - he did not deny the fact at all.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH EDWARDS. On the evening of the 9th of February I was in <placeName id="t18300218-165-crimeloc921">Angel-court, Throgmorton-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Did not you say it had no mark? A. I told the officer so, but I understood from my mother that it was marked J. C.</p>
               <p>CHARLES THOROGOOD. I am an officer. On the 9th of February I was on duty near the back of the Royal Exchange - I saw the two prisoners come down Sweeting's-alley; Clarke was close behind the prosecutor, and Patten behind him - I followed them down Angel-court, and met Patten turning back: I seized him with this handkerchief in his hand - I called the prosecutor, and asked if he had lost a handkerchief - he said Yes; Clarke was going on, and I said, "Take hold of that one" - he did not; I pulled Patten up, and took Clarke myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Was it dark? A. Yes - I had followed them about three hundred yards; they were out of my sight when they turned into the court - as I turned, Patten had just turned from the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Where did you first see them? A. In Sweeting's-alley - there were two or three persons passing; Clarke was about five yards from the gentleman - I should not have taken another person who had been passing; Patten did not attempt to go away.</p>
               <p>Clarke's Defence. I was returning from Rosemary-lane, where I deal in wearing-apparel; this prisoner asked me the way to Bell-alley - I told him I was going nearly the same way; I got as far as Copthall-court, and aceidentally came in contact with him again - he asked if he was right; I said Yes, and went on - when I was called back by the officer I declared my innocence, but he said he was positive of me - I am a cripple, and it is not likely I should be guilty of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Patten's Defence. I cannot say what I wish; but had my trial come on on Saturday, I could have produced friends to give me a character.</p>
               <p>Patten received a good character.</p>
