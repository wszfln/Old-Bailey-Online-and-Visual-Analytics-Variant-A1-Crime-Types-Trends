                  </hi>. I am assistant to John Francis and Sons, grocers, The Broadway, Streatham—on Saturday, the 15th September, the prisoner came in with this cheque for £12 on the Eastern Branch of the London and Westminster Bank, signed E. West—he asked if we would cash it for Dr. Barnes—Dr. Barnes is a medical man and one of our customers—I know him perfectly well—I know no one of the name of E. West—I cashed the cheque—afterwards I sent it by a friend to the bank it was drawn on, and I had a telegram back on Monday morning saying "No account"—the cheque is now marked "No account"—on the 5th of December I went to Bow Street, and recognised the prisoner from a number of men.</p>

I live at High Street, Bexley, Kent—on 22nd September I was at my brother-in-law, Reuben Message's, butcher's shop at High Street, South Norwood—about 8 o'clock the prisoner, I believe, presented to me this cheque for £12 on the Eastern Branch of the London and Westminster Bank; he said, "Dr. Churchward's compliments, and can Mr. Message oblige him with change?"—I knew Dr. Churchward was a customer of my brother's, and I cashed the cheque—the man left the shop directly—on the Monday I paid the cheque into the bank; it was returned marked "No account"—I know no person of the name of E. Lancaster—I saw the prisoner again, when I went to Bow Street at the beginning of December, among a number of men—I turned and said I was not perfectly sure, and then I picked him out as the man to the best of my belief.</p>

Weldon, and Caldecott</hi>)—<hi rend="italic">The paper was as follows:</hi> "After you have found addresses, post yourself outside their houses and make a note of the tradesmen that call there"—I caused Mr. Dalamore and Miss Kelsey to be at the station on the remand on 12th December—I placed the prisoner among eleven or twelve others—he was rather shabbily dressed then, in dark clothes and a round felt hat; not as he is dressed now—both the witnesses picked him out—I told him he would be charged with uttering these five cheques, also the two in question—he replied, "I must think where I was on those days."</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father as a contractor in building materials at 46, Great College Street, Camden Town—I know the prisoner—on 15th September I was at the Coach and Horses, Holloway, about quarter to five, and saw the prisoner there—he remained with me till about 11.30—he was in my company the whole time, pending his leaving me once or twice to go and be shaved, for about ten minutes—he told me he had gone to Mr. Garner's, the barber's next door—we left the Coach and Horses about 6.30 or seven, and went and played billiards together—I was not called at the Police-court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective of the Metropolitan Police—on 19th December I went with Constable Collins to 85, Harrison Street, Gray's Inn Road—a child was coming out at the door—we went in and went up to the second floor—we knocked at the door; it was locked; it was opened a little way by the prisoner, who tried to close it again—we forced our way in and overpowered him—he was smothered with a greasy, oily, black substance, wet, his hands were quite wet with it—I said, "We are police officers"—I then went to the window under which a bench was erected, and picked up this plate—it was on the bench with a magnifying glass on the corner of it—I said, "What is this for?"—he said, "We are getting out a scheme for Christmas"—we then began to search the room—there was a line across one corner, upon which were hanging several notes, one or two were quite wet—I picked up one and showed it to the prisoner—he said, "We were going to have 'A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year' put on the back of it"—I said, "Who do you mean by 'we'"—he said, "I work for the other man"—I said, "Who is he, what is his name?"—he said "Mr. Devon"—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "I don't know, I picked him up at a public-house in Clerkenwell"—I then continued searching the room—on the right-hand side of the room was a largo copper-plate printing press, two old chairs without backs, on one of which was a large pad of blotting paper saturated with water, between every few leaves were pieces of paper cut to the size of the forged notes—I produce them—there were about six—in all I found about 50 pieces of paper—on another chair were six printed notes lying—seven were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="1889020400011"/>
               <p>hanging on the line, and three were in a cupboard, sixteen in all; they were all damp, except the three in the cupboard—there was" also a quantity of other blotting-paper—in the cupboard I found a quantity of paper of the same kind as the notes are made of—on the bench under the window, in addition to the magnifying glass, were these thirteen engraving tools, three bottles of liquid, three oil-stones, three sticks of charcoal, one small melting pot, a large piece of whitening, a tin of printing ink, a cup and brush, with some of the ink in it, wet, one piece of beeswax, a piece of indiarubber, four leather pads, one wet, two lead pencils, and a memorandum book—on the mantelpiece was a catalogue of copper-plate printing machines, in which was an invoice; there was also a memorandum book, a red book, in which is this entry, "Mr. Devon commenced rent 8th December, 1888; three shillings per week for second-floor back at 85, Harrison Street, of Mrs. Hawkes. Dec. 15, paid 3s."—the invoice was dated December 15, "Received as under from Benjamin Winstone and Sons, one second-hand copper-plate press, 18, one copper-plate ink, and one blanket; received S. Cottam"—I found some copper-plate ink on the mantelpiece, and a piece of blanket round the roller of the machine—there was some wet blotting paper on the machine, which had the appearance of being in use—there was a fire in the grate, upon which was a flat iron—the room was generally fitted up as a workroom, no bed or any furniture—I found no materials for printing Christmas and New Year's wishes, no type, nothing of the sort—there was no other person in the room besides the prisoner, myself, and Collins—two other officers came in later on—when he was charged he said, "I suppose I had better not say anything now"—I charged him with having this plate in his possession and the notes, and feloniously forging the same—he gave his address "Triangle Hotel, Smithfield"—about a week before his apprehension I went to Mr. Lemarcraft, 5, Green Terrace, Clerkenwell—I there saw a box with the prisoner's name on it, and in that box I found this indenture of apprenticeship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was first spoken to with regard to this matter about five weeks before the prisoner was arrested—I had not been to 85, Harrison Street before 19th December—I had had observation kept of the house by Collins occasionally—I had been there once or twice, but not to keep any observation for any length of time—I had not seen any other man there—when I went there on the 19th I did not go over the house; it is an eight-roomed house, let out in tenements, a number of people live in it—the lock on the prisoner's room door was an ordinary one—nobody slept in that room—I think the prisoner told me that Devon had been there with in a few minutes—I handcuffed him at once on going in—he gave us every assistance, as I took up the several things he said, "That is so-and-so," and he said, "You will find the invoice of the press in the book"—the first thing he said was, "This is a scheme being got out for Christmas"—I can't say that I have ever seen such things got out for Christmas, I have seen cheques as advertisements of different firms—I have produced the whole of the notes I found—I made a note of his exact answer the first opportunity I had—he did not say that it was intended to be written on the back of the notes, "Wishing you many of them"—I think they are good imitations of Bank notes; on comparison with a real note of course there is a difference; I don't think I should take one of them in their present state, there is no watermark on them, the paper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="1889020400012"/>
               <p>is thicker—I think I went to the window to see whether there was a watermark; it is a very light room, no blind, but it is not overlooked, the houses at the back are 50 or 60 yards off—the line on which the notes were was in the corner of the room, and could not be seen from the window.</p>

Waterlow's—it was through the father that I knew the prisoner—to the best of my recollection I only saw him once before the purchase of the press, about six or eight months ago—on 15th December he came and said he had some work that was urgent, that must be done at or about Christmas, and he wanted me to intercede for him for a copper-plate press, that he had a sovereign to pay, and would I kindly facilitate his getting it on easy terms from Messrs. Winstone—he reminded me that I knew his father—I introduced him to Messrs. Winstone.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I am in practice at Montague Place, Poplar—about twelve at night on Saturday, 19th January, I was called to see Cooper—he was in bed, with his head bandaged—he was complaining of severe pain in his head, and was apparently suffering from concussion of the brain—I prescribed for him—there was a contusion over the right eye—I did not see him again before his death—on the 21st January I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was effusion of blood between the dura mater and the left hemisphere of the brain—that might have been caused by a blow over the eye—I found nothing else to account for it—the man had evidently a weak heart; I did not consider him a strong, healthy man—I had never seen him before—I know nothing of his having fits; there was no indication of his having had sunstroke.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sometimes come to London; but I do not live here—I was only a few minutes in the public-house, because it was closing time—we were walking together from 12.30 till the police came at 1.20—I only had a few shillings about me—she did not attempt to take that, she asked me how much money I had, and I said, "I have only a few shillings"—no man knocked up against me as I left the public-house, nor did we pass anybody—I did not take out my watch to see the time when I got out, nor in the public-house, but she may have seen my chain in the public-house, because it was warm, and my coat was open there—I said to the constable, "She has got my watch; if she has not got it she has given it to the man who has gone"—I never saw it in her hand—I was walking about with her three-quarters of an hour before she attempted to steal it—I gave her no money; she asked me to go home with her; but I had no intention—I could not get away from her—she had not always hold of my arm—I felt my watch safe before I left the public-house—the prisoner did not cry out when the man rushed up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am accustomed to feel my watch—I last felt it safe before I went into the public-house very likely—I felt her pull it away after she opened my coat—my watch-glass always broke, and I had no glass to it for two months; and I carried it without a glass in a leather case.</p>

I have just turned fourteen—I live with my parents at 95, Lamb's Conduit Street—about 10 o'clock on 27th November I was going to Lincoln's Inn Fields—the prisoner spoke to me at the Bedford Row end of Hand Court, and asked me if I would take a note to the Union Bank—I asked where it was—he said, "You will find it, it is the corner of the turning; be quick back because I want to get a bit of dinner," and I ran off—he said he would wait in a public-house for me at the bottom of Hand Court; I left him at the public-house door—he told me that if they asked me where I came from I was to say from Mr. Selby, of Bedford Row—I asked him what number—he said, "They won't ask you that"—I went to the bank—I left there to meet the prisoner again, accompanied by two gentlemen, who walked about five yards behind me—I did not find the prisoner when I got back to the public-house—I gave a description of him to White, the police officer—I next saw him at Bow Street in a little room; I picked him out of ten others—I have no doubt he is the person who gave me the note.</p>

               <p>it was about a fortnight after 27th November—I do not remember how soon after I gave the description I was asked to go to Bow Street to see the prisoner; I did not take the dates—it was not the same week that I went to the bank I am sure—"White called at my house and told me to come to Bow Street the next morning about half-past ten, and that he had caught the man—he did not walk with me there—I was an hour or an hour and a half at the station before I was called in and saw the prisoner—I was in Court listening to the cases going on—White saw me when I got to the station—the prisoner when I identified him was not dressed as he is now, but was very shabby—I was in Court this Sessions when the prisoner was tried on two other charges—I heard the detectives describe his clothing as very shabby—one of the men from whom I picked the prisoner had a surgical bandage on his head—I knew he was not the man—I had seen him in the witness-box while I was waiting in Court—I do not think more than one had a bandage—I had not seen any other of the men in the Court—they were not gentlemen, nor dressed as gentlemen—the man who asked me to cash the cheque had the manners, speech and appearance of a gentleman—there was a marked difference between him and the men I saw at the station; although shabbily dressed the prisoner was the most gentlemanly man there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). On 4th December, 1888, I saw the prisoner with another man in Holborn—I was with another officer—I touched the prisoner on the shoulder and said, "Smythe, a friend of mine opposite wants to speak to you"—he said, "That is not my name"—Sergeant White came up, and I told the prisoner we were police officers from Scotland Yard, and should arrest him on suspicion of uttering forged cheques—the prisoner darted off and fell in the roadway under a passing donkey—I conveyed him in a cab with the other person to Bow Street—in the waiting-room there he pointed to the other person and said, "Release that gentleman; I am the b——y thief"—he was very excited—when Armour came to the station the prisoner was placed with nine other men, and Armour unhesitatingly said, "That is the man that gave me the letter to take to the bank"—the prisoner was shabbily dressed, with a greasy sort of dark coat and old brown hat; he looked dissipated—White took the description from the boy, and found the documents on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The boy gave me no description—I did not see the boy till he was brought to Bow Street—I arrested the prisoner from the boy's description and from information received—I was working with White—he was on it a week before I was—to the best of my belief the description given by the boy of the prisoner was circulated in the same week that the robbery took place—I cannot say how long after the boy went to the bank the description of the prisoner was in the hands of the police—I did not see Armour at Bow Street till he had identified the man—I cannot say where he waited; the usual course was adopted—there was a general resemblance between the prisoner and the men he was put with—there might have been a man with a broken head and surgical bandages waiting to go into Court; there was not with the other man; I am not sure of it—one of the men did not get in the witness-box and give evidence with a surgical bandage on—we received information the night before this—in consequence of the information we went to the neighbourhood of Holborn, Hand Court, I believe—we went there several mornings,</p>

               <p>at no fixed time—before I saw the prisoner with Dr. Thorburn I saw him with Ward; Ward's name is in the prisoner's pocket-book—I decline to say if Ward gave me information; Ward will come if you want him—I must decline on public grounds to give the name of the person that gave information—I saw Ward in Holborn about half an hour before I arrested the prisoner coming out of a public-house—White was behind me then—I was about fifty yards from Ward—I did not follow the prisoner and Ward—I waited thinking some other man was going to join the prisoner—Ward hung about—I did not arrest the prisoner while he was there—I had not seen Ward that day before he went to Holborn—I had seen him before I went on that day to arrest the prisoner—I decline to say if Ward has ever given me information about criminal matters—he has not a brother in the police force to my knowledge—I believe he is not the policeman Ward's brother—I take no responsibility for the identification; I do a little for the arrest—after their suspicious behaviour in Holborn I asked Dr. Thorburn to come to Bow Street—he made no objection—he is a doctor; his name also is in the prisoner's book—a lot of forgeries had been committed, and I asked him to come—I did not know him—I did not take him into custody; I asked him to come—I should not think he was the worse for drink; he was very excited—he had been about ten minutes in the public-house—he may or may not have been drinking—I was first spoken to by the solicitor to the Union Bank on the 5th December, when they came to prosecute, and I gave evidence at the Police-court—I produced the cheques on that day—I had other documents found on the prisoner which I did not produce—the prisoner was tried on two other charges of uttering this Sessions, and acquitted—a number of other persons have been called to identify the prisoner—I should think on that day seven others came in consequence of our action, and said he was not the man—in case of forging cheques we send for all the people—no person from Mr. Pitman saw the prisoner before his committal, except when they gave evidence in Court, as far as I know—so far as I know there are no other charges against him on the files of this Court.</p>

I have been nine years in the police force—in the latter part of November I saw Armour, who made a statement to me, and gave me a description of the prisoner, which was circulated the same day—on 4th December I was in Holborn on the other side of the way to Leach—I saw him stop the prisoner who was with Dr. Thorburn; I crossed over the road; directly I got on the pavement the prisoner darted away; he fell down in the middle of the road, and Leach secured him—we thought Dr. Thorburn might be concerned with the prisoner, and he went to the station—the inspector knew him as a respectable man, and he showed us his cheque-book, and he was allowed to go; before he went the prisoner said, "Release that man; I am the b——y thief"—I went and saw the boy about his coming to Bow Street—I told him he would see a number of men, and if he saw the man that handed him the note he was to place his hand on him—he went to Bow Street—before the identification took place he was shut up in a room; I know he was there for some few minutes—I believe I saw him come—I believe I saw</p>

               <p>him in the Detective Inspector's room; that was a very short time before he went into the room where the number of people were—officers went out and fetched persons in from the street; no unusual course was adopted—the boy picked the prisoner out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I and Leach are attached to Scotland Yard; we are officers of the Criminal Investigation Department—I was not examined at the Police-court—we each take responsibility for the identification—I went to Armour's house three times I think; I saw him twice—I went to him the night before he was brought to Bow Street—I am not sure if he gave me a description of the man in the same week that the cheque was passed; it was within a few days—I did not see him on the day of the uttering nor the next day—the bank spoke to me about it the very day, the 27th—I am not sure if they gave me the boy's address on that day; I should think most likely they did—I went to his address in consequence of what they said to me—I believe I got the description within the week that the cheque was uttered—I told Armour I had got a person in custody whom I believed was the person who had passed the cheque—I saw him the next day when he came to Bow Street; I have no doubt about it—I don't know if I saw him when he called at half-past ten—I am not sure how long after I saw him there he picked out the prisoner—I don't think it was within an hour—I cannot say if it was an hour and a half—I cannot say if I saw him in the detectives' room, I had so many people to see there—I believe the boy was in Court hearing the cases; while he was waiting the men from whom the boy was to pick out this man were brought in from the street—the identification was conducted in the ordinary way—I believe there was a man with a broken head and a surgical bandage; I do not know who that man was or where he came from—the men from whom Armour identified the prisoner were fellow prisoners and two, three, or four men invited to come in from the street—very likely the fellow prisoners had been locked up the whole night, and were probably recovering from the effect of debauch; it is a most difficult matter to get people to come in and stand—I found these cheques on the prisoner—seeing Dr. Thorburn in company with the prisoner I thought Thorburn was up to no good—I meant that he should come to the station, he was under compulsion, and it was not till he had satisfied the inspector that he was respectable that he was allowed to go—the prisoner was not the worse for drink; he was greatly excited—I don't think he said at that time that Ward had put him away; he did afterwards—I don't think he mentioned Ward's name at the station; he did not say Ward had planted the things on him—I was not in the station the whole time; I was in and out of the room—he was twenty-two hours at the station before he was charged; we had to get the evidence—I know Ward; he is here, and can be put in the box if necessary.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188902040034"/>
               <p>prisoner in the doorway of the room—she rushed towards me in an excited manner, and spoke to me in a most excited, incoherent manner, in a loud excited voice; I could not understand what she said—she was greatly excited and rushed towards me, holding out both her hands, as if in the act of clutching me by the face or throat—I immediately took hold of her wrists and threw her to the ground, partly falling and partly holding her, and there I held her; she became temporarily insensible for about three or four minutes—I then took her up, and took her into the front bedroom, and put her into a chair—she partially came round, and requested that I should give her a rope to hang herself, again speaking in a very excited state, putting her hands to her head, repeating, "Let me hang myself, let me hang myself"—I left her in charge of the women, and immediately went into the back room, and saw the child on the bed; the clothes were saturated with water; she was perfectly dead; the body was warm, and the clothes were warm from the warm water in the bucket—I believe the whole body had been put into the water—there were no marks of violence on the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had attended her in several confinements—as far as I was able to judge she was always a kind and affectionate mother—I should imagine that in this case mania arose from over-lactation; I have known of such cases as long as nine months after confinement; it commonly supervenes speedily after—there are three kinds of puerperal mania: one which comes on in the puerperal state before the child is born, another which comes on during the state of labour or soon after, and another kind which is recognised as the insanity of lactation; she was still suckling her child at this time—it is common to get this condition in women of delicate constitution, who have borne children rapidly, and have a profuse supply of milk, especially after loss of rest or anything likely to exhaust the nervous system—pain in the head is one of the symptoms that would occur—I said before the Magistrate, "I have no doubt that when I saw her on Saturday last she was temporarily insane," that was the opinion I formed at the time, observing her conduct and demeanour.</p>

I went home about eight o'clock last evening, and did not go out alter. My wife was with me, and we went to bed about half-past nine, and did not get up again till nine this morning. We occupy the front parlour; we nave been there since Sunday night, the 19th. Signed, 'Thomas Murphy'"—I then took him to St. Clement's Road; he pointed out a room to me—I saw a woman there, Eliza Balster, and in the prisoner's presence I told her that he was in custody on a most serious charge, and without receiving any intimation from the prisoner, I should be glad if she would tell me all that had occurred on the previous night, where he was, and all about him—she then said, "I have known Thomas Murphy about seven months, and we have lodged here a week; he was at home with me from seven o'clock, and we were in bed together from that time till eight o'clock this morning. I am quite sure he was not out between ten and twelve last night; I am not married to him"—I then told her that he would be brought up at Hammersmith Police-court on the Monday, if she would like to attend—I have not seen her since—on the following morning, Sunday, I took the prisoner to the Infirmary—at that time he had been told the charge, but was not actually charged; he was simply detained, as I did not know exactly what the state of Whittimore was—Whittimore saw him at the Infirmary—I asked him to make a statement in his presence, which he did, and I</p>

               <p>the prisoner Lamotte has been in our service thirteen and a half years—it is our practice to give out securities on loan, and it was Lamotte's duty to give us the securities, and to see that the loans were all in order—the securities were entered in the loan-book, which should show not only those which are out on loan, but those which are in our box—the book is in Lamotte's writing—the main facts are also entered in the ledger, but not the whole of the figures—the prisoner Germany was in our employ for about a year or eighteen months—I think he left about June, 1886—he was our authorised clerk; that means authorised to deal for us on the Stock Exchange—I am not quite certain whether when Germany was with us Lamotte had charge of our securities and loan-book, but if he had not he used to take out securities under my direction, and he attended generally to the loans—October 26th was the account-day—this entry on October 26th of 500 Erie shares is Lamotte's writing; and also this entry on October 12th, the previous account-day, of 450 shares; and on November 14th 500 Erie shares; and 500 on the 29th—on October 12th there is an entry, "Pember and Boyle, 1,100 Eries"; on August 26th 1,800 Eries, in Lamotte's writing; on November 14th 1,480, and on November 29th 1,480—under the name of Sheppard, Felly and Co. on October 12th 900, and on 26th October 900, on 14th November 950, on 29th November 950—on 29th November I was looking through the book and noticed that though it was apparently balanced, some of the figures were wrong, which made me doubt the balance; I spoke to Lamotte about it, and put the figures right; I found he had given two firms too much security, and went to them the same day and obtained information from them—next morning when I was going out of the office Lamotte stopped me and said he wished to speak to me; I went back with him into the office, and he made a statement—he went out of the office in the afternoon, at my desire, and brought back this list of the numbers of some Erie shares; only the figures and the numbers on the right were then on it—the name "Germany" was not on it; that is Mr. Vivian's writing, and so is the writing below—we afterwards missed from our box some Norfolk and Western shares, for which we are agents in this country, and the holders of shares send them to us for registration; Lamotte received them when they came in, and it was his business to enter them in the registration-book as received—this is the passing through book, and there is no entry in it on 16th November of 170 Norfolk and Western shares being received for registration from Gosling and Sharpe—on 14th November here are 190 Norfolks received from Arthur Anderson; the numbers are given here in Lamotte's writing—I made out this document (<hi rend="italic">A</hi>) from the books—the securities so numbered ought to have been in our box on November 14th, and, I presume, on the 80th—I cannot tell whether they were there on the 30th—I never Authorised Lamotte or anybody else to take those shares out, or to take them to Germany—I have never dealt with Germany on the Stock Exchange—after Germany left us he went to another firm, and left there and started for himself as a broker about a year after—I drew up with Mr. Abrahams the list E, and have initialed it as correct; it shows two lots of 50 Eries and one lot of 100, received from Stoop and Chancellor, the two lots on 26th October, and 100 on 14th November—that is one of our clerk's writing—I took the names and numbers from the book—the 100</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188902040044"/>
               <p>Eries to Chancellor are Nos. 71765 to 71774, and correspond with those in the list brought by Lamotte—78282 appears in both lists, and also 82567 and 82568, 88163 and 83194—the total number of Erie shares missing is 400, and 170 Norfolk and Westerns—I am aware of the rule of the Stock Exchange, that any member doing business with a clerk is liable to expulsion—the rules are known to clerks as well as members—on the Saturday following the account, December 1st, I sent to Germany's office for Mr. Ray—he came; I had an interview with him at my office, and on Monday, December 3rd, I applied for a warrant against both prisoners, and gave my evidence before an Alderman at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have two partners, Mr. Gray and Mr. Vivian—after Germany left us he went to another house, and afterwards became a member of the Stock Exchange—he would have to be recommended by a member, in some cases by three members, and to find two securities in £500 each—he did some business in the same market as ourselves, in the American market—these Eries and Norfolks are American securities—we had every confidence in Lamotte—on the Friday when he confessed to me that he had stolen various securities, he stated that he could go to the brokers and get me the numbers of the Eries—he went out, and after some time returned with a paper with the numbers of about 360—he then told me he had been dealing with the broker in the name of his brother-in-law, Mr. Robertson—I insisted on his giving me the broker's name—he at first said the broker was not so much to blame—Lamotte was a very efficient clerk—he had great experience in our business, which is a very large one—he is very well connected, and I understand he is entitled to a reversion of some property—he suggested on the Friday that he should go and see his uncle at Brighton, and see if he could make some arrangement with him to help him to make an arrangement with us—I consented to that, and he came next day, Saturday, and offered me £200 in part payment of our loss, and said he had not found his uncle, as he was at Usk, in Wales—I did not take the £200, and he put it in an envelope and handed it over to Mr. Grant—I allowed him to go away again; and on Monday, the 3rd, a warrant was obtained, and he was arrested at Usk on the Tuesday—I cannot tell whether there is such a person as Mr. Robertson, his brother-in-law, but there is a Mrs. Robertson—almost all firms do speculative transactions for customers—they buy stock which is not to be delivered; and if the stock goes up at the end of the fortnightly account the person has won, and the broker pays him the difference, if not he receives it—often when he is a loser he makes an arrangement with the broker to carry over the account to the next account-day, to see if it gets a little better, and the broker has to arrange that on the Stock Exchange, and the client has to bring in securities to cover the debit balance, and the broker makes use of the securities till the next account-day—the difference between contangoing and selling is, that in contangoing you can get the securities back at the same price, or an equivalent; it is not a sale out and out—of course that costs money—it is sometimes difficult for a broker to arrange to carry over, if the broker is supposed to be shaky—Erie stock is very convenient for contangoing—I never had any dealings with Germany after he was in business on his own account—when a broker fails in the Stock Exchange we call it a hammer—Germany was hammered on Saturday, 1st, or Monday, 3rd—one of the officials calls the attention of the members</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188902040045"/>
               <p>by hammering, and Mr. Grant takes charge of the affairs, and settles matters; he is the official assignee, and has the books to wind up the affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> His doing so depends upon whether there is anything to do it with, and whether he can get the books. I used to see Germany in the American market nearly every day, but never heard of his doing any business for Lamotte's brother-in-law, nor did I ever see Robertson—we were agents for the Norfolk and Western Railroad when Germany was with us, and he knew that—we frequently had Erie shares in our possession at that time—it was only on my consenting to Lamotte going away that he gave me the broker's name—I said, "Germany must have known what he was doing when he was dealing with you," and Lamotte said, "Well, I think he must have known."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner of the last witness—I was present on November 30, when Lamotte made a statement—he went out of the office, and brought back this list of Erie shares—a conversation took place about the broker's name, and I made this memorandum, "Germany" at the back of the document—I heard nothing about Norfolk shares being missing that day, but next morning (Saturday) I went to the Stock Ex change, and discovered that these Norfolk shares were missing—I then saw Lamotte again—I called at Germany's office on the Saturday, and found he was not there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was present when Lamotte said he had been doing business with the broker in the name of Mr. Robertson, his brother-in-law—he said first that he did not want to give up the broker's name because he was innocent—I said, "Do you mean to tell me you think he is innocent?"—he said, "I can't help thinking he must have known"—that was the Saturday morning, not at the same conversation—I have heard that while Lamotte was with us he came into some property on two occasions; I understood it was about £4,000—the Stock Exchange Committee act very strictly, and if it became known to them that a broker had been dealing with a clerk he would run the risk of being struck off the list of members for breaking the rules—if the broker was a defaulter because he was not able to meet his engagements, if he found he had been dealing with a clerk, that would be reported to the Committee—if Germany had entered Lamotte's name in his books, and had got into trouble, and the name had been found there, it would have been a very serious matter for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I told Lamotte that I had heard in the market that there were other shares besides those he had taken—he said, "Yes, 350 Erie shares; I did it to help Germany"—I said, "Do you still say you think he is innocent?"</p>

                  </hi>. I have been clerk to Germany since January, 1888, at first with a salary and commission, and about July, 1888, there was a fresh arrangement by which I was to have half the profits—I advanced some money—I have seen Lamotte in Germany's office, and outside when I went there—there were three accounts open in Germany's books with which Lamotte had to do—an account headed "W. Germany" was opened on August 29th, 1887—that was the first entry in the ledger—I have seen no earlier ledger—the entry was "W. G.," which was afterwards enlarged into "W. Germany"—the whole of that account is purely speculative as far as I know, but there is one entry of stock delivered—there is another account in the name of H. P. Robertson, which was used for contangoing stock, after which the balance created in Robertson's account was transferred to the account of W. Germany—there were no entries in my time in Robertson's account, except those of stock contangoed and transferred to the other account—the H. P. Robertson account commenced in September, 1887, when the books show a balance against Germany, which had to be cleared off in some way, and there was a transfer from Robertson to Germany, which left a balance of £13—Lamotte gave the instructions for the entries which appear in the account—I never saw any communication from any other person which had reference to that account—I never saw H. P. Robertson, or any communication purporting to come from him—Lamotte brought in the stock which from time to time appears in Robertson's account—with one or two trifling exceptions it all consists of Erie shares; there are two other stocks mentioned in this ledger at the beginning of October, 1887; of course there are other ledgers—after that date there are no other shares brought in to be contangoed but Eries—I saw Lamotte bring some of them in; he handed them to me or to Mr. Germany—there was sometimes a credit and sometimes a debit balance, and a debit balance was always cleared off by shares being transferred by Lamotte—he never paid cash to clear it, to my knowledge—when there was a credit balance a certain number of shares would be taken up to diminish the cover—various cheques were drawn and paid to Lamotte; they were debited to the account—cheques of even amounts were handed to him for the difference, not for the actual balance due to him—if £130 was due to him, a cheque for £100 might be given to him, not one for the amount due, because the account was settled by returning shares—in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188902040047"/>
               <p>some cases cheques drawn to Germany were made payable to cash—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the cheques—Germany banked at the Imperial Bank—one of these cheques to Germany for £100 is endorsed by Lamotte, it is dated October 22nd, 1888—I have given Lamotte my private cheques in exchange for Germany's, and these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of them—I understood that Mr. Robertson was Lamotte's brother-in-law, and that it was a joint account; as far as I remember I heard that both from Germany and Lamotte; I understood that Mr. Robertson was a joint speculator backing Mr. Lamotte up—I have heard that from both; the only time I can fix was when in conversation Mr. Lamotte said that his brother-in-law, Mr. Robertson, had a joint interest in the account—I understood that Mr. Robertson was living up West, and I think Germany told me that he was a banker; that was three or four months before the failure—as a rule contract notes are made out for every bargain made for a customer, and contract notes were sent to Lamotte up to July last year to his private address, Tornfield Road, Shepherd's Bush—I am not aware of any contract notes being sent after July—a number-book and a ticket-book were kept, and the two together then ought to show the shares brought in—I have gone through the H. P. Robertson account, and put down the shares brought in and the shares returned; that shows a total of 890 Erie shares contangoed on the Robertson account, or sold with an agreement to buy back at the same price—it shows 690 Erie shares given back—I believe it to be accurate; I went through it twice—at the end of the October account of 1887, those 100 Erie shares are carried over, and on the following account-day 150 Erie shares appear to have been carried over—I cannot trace in the books where the 50 shares came from, they are not in the ledger—when they come in they ought to be entered to the credit of the account—when Lamotte brought in the shares, some were entered in the name of H. P. Robertson and others as coming in from W. G.—on 24th October £300 was the actual amount owing on the two accounts of Germany and Lamotte, and on 26th October Lamotte brought in 150 Erie shares; they were taken to the Imperial Bank, Germany's bank—150 Norfolk shares were taken with them—those were mine—that was for a loan—£1,415 was the amount deposited, and £1,250 was the amount borrowed—if I took the Norfolks away it would leave about £720—Germany's account at the bank was credited with the £1,250, and he drew on it—as far as I know no entry was made either in the Robertson or Germany account of the receipt of those Eries—on November 14th I was not in London, but the books show that those 150 shares were taken out of the bank, and the loan paid off—I believe the books show another 100 Erie shares brought in on the same day—on November 14th there was a loan from the bank of £400, which was paid off next day—that would be about the amount you would get on 100 Eries—I see by the credit-book that 100 Eries came into the bank on the 14th—this is the contra entry to the 150 Eries contangoed—the second mark in pencil would include the parcel marked November 13th—there is no entry on October 26th of those 150 coming in—ticket 628 says, "100 Eries, W. G., Imperial Bank"—that is Lamotte's—they appear to have been taken to the bank, and on November 15th they were taken out—the whole 250 were sold before the 15th; the 14th was the account—they were credited to H. P. Robertson's account—I find no entry in the ticket-book of any of those 150 coming</p>

               <p>in on October 26th—the ticket shows the numbers of those 100 shares which came in on November 14th—they are 71765 to 71774, and were sold to Mr. Heath—on the same day 100 Eries were sold to Mr. Josephs, and 50 to Mr. Godfrey, but in point of fact they went to Forbes—the 250 shares sold produced about £1,448, which was credited to the Robertson account—that was transferred to Germany, and left a credit balance of about £700—£700 worth of shares were sold more than was necessary to clear the balance; that balance remained on the account—I judge that Germany was bankrupt on October 26th, 1888—he was in want of money, but I think he got over the November 14th account without wanting any money—he had the £700 to help him—some of the Norfolks of October 26th were mine—I knew he wanted them, and I lent them, and the following account commenced on Tuesday, November 27th—there had then been two fresh dealings, I think, but the markets had altered, and after allowing for the £700 to Lamotte's credit, there was a balance of £1,750 on the wrong side—that was produced solely by the alterations in the markets—I saw Lamotte; and Germany told me he had seen him, and would arrange with Mr. Robertson for the necessary stock to help him over—Lamotte came and brought some Norfolks on the account-day, and I heard him instruct Mr. Germany to bring in 170 Norfolks and 350 Eries—the 350 Eries were to help Germany over the account—if I recollect rightly, Lamotte said he would cry <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi>, and he was offered one-third of the profit by Germany—Lamotte asked if Germany had spoken to me about it—he brought the Norfolks in on the account-day, the 29th, but before he brought them the stock-jobbers with whom the stock had been contangoed had been to the office inquiring for them—I was present when Mr. Dare or his clerk came, and Mr. Duporry—the conversation was with me—they came again later in the day—Germany sent for them—I heard what passed; Germany said that it was box stock of his father's, who was away, and he could not get at him, and I think he said letters had miscarried—I had Norfolks in my hand which Lamotte had brought in—I think I said that I had instructions not to deliver them unless Germany could tide over to-night—Germany said that they were mine, and I confirmed that—I declined to deliver them unless they held back Germany's cheques—I handed over the Norfolks, and an arrangement was come to—this was Thursday, and they were to hold over till Saturday morning—on the 30th Germany was about in the Stock Exchange—on Friday afternoon between three and four o'clock Lamotte came to the office, and in consequence of what he said I gave him some information out of the ticket-book, and he took away this list of numbers of Erie shares—Germany was not in the office then; he came in soon after, and I told him Lamotte had been to get the numbers of some Erie shares—I understood those to be the numbers of the shares which had been delivered to Robertson—that did not purport to be the numbers of all the Eries—I did not know what Robertson wanted them for—Lamotte came back in about half an hour, as I was going out, and said he wanted to see Mr. Germany—I said, "Won't I do?"Germany being out—he said, "No, I must see Mr. Germany alone in the upper corridor"—I sent for Germany, and he went up to where Lamotte was—I saw him afterwards, and thinking it was strange, asked him what it was about—he said, "Oh, it is nothing" or words to that effect—I</p>

               <p>thought Lamotte looked ill, he was wearied and pale; I only saw him for a short time—I remained in the office till six o'clock, the books were then locked up, and I locked the door, leaving no one there—I had seen Germany three-quarters of an hour before, and he said he should be there next morning—I went there next morning at 9.15, and found all the books were gone except the private ledger and address-book—Germany did not come, and I went to the bank and found that £300 was missing, which had been drawn out by this cheque <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in Germany's writing—I then drew out the balance, £210, and went to Germany's private address at Brixton, but he was out—on the same Saturday he was declared a defaulter, and Mr. Grant took possession of his affairs, and at his request I handed him the £210—on, I believe, the next Wednesday morning, I received this post-card from Germany at my private address, "I have been cruelly advised; now I shall do what I consider right; all the books will be sent to the assignees, and I, if mentally fit, come Saturday"—I found the books there when I got back—ticket 634 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) gives the numbers of the Norfolk shares brought in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> "When I went into Germany's service in January, I knew Lamotte as clerk to Vivian, Gray, and Co., and I knew that the Germany account and the H. P. Robertson account were practically his—I understood that it was a joint speculation of his and his brother-in-law's, Lamotte being the experienced man who was doing the speculations—he told me once that it was so—I understood that his brother-in-law was finding the money—I was told that Lamotte had a private banking account at the West-end; at Hansom and Bouverie's, I think—Lamotte's visits to the office were perfectly open; there was no secret arrangement to my knowledge—there were two clerks, at one time—when he brought in any stock as cover, he gave it to me, and if Germany was there he gave it to him, or to the clerk; there was no secrecy as to the clerk—I was present when the 170 Norfolks were brought in, and I believe they were delivered to me—the numbers would not be entered till they were taken out to be delivered; I actually entered them before I took them out, in the ticket-book—I had some Norfolks myself, and lent 50 to assist in the October account—I have heard Germany say that Lamotte's account, which he was working, was not a profitable one for him—I knew that he was going to leave Vivian, Gray, and Co.—Germany's total commission, roughly speaking, from November to November was about £260, and then there was a small profit on carrying-over, which I cannot calculate—they were the ordinary brokers' commissions—from July last I shared the commission, and my share came to about £60—when the balance was in Lamotte's favour, cheques were drawn in his favour; the first entry in the old ledger is £500 paid to Robertson's account—the Stock Exchange accounts are fortnightly, and at the end of every fortnight accounts were made out to show the position of Lamotte's affairs, whether for or against him—the contract notes would show what the account was, and would agree with the books, and if Lamotte did not want contract notes our books would show what the state of affairs was—if Lamotte did not choose to trust Germany without having a contract note, it made no difference, the account would be just the same—there were other clients of Germany who did not have contract notes—the price of the stamp on contract notes was raised in May, 1888, from 1d. to 6d., and a double stamp must</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188902040050"/>
               <p>be used for carrying over—I believe he suggested that he did not want contract notes—we had received Erie shares from other customers—Germany had a good many debts out, he would have been more than solvent if they had been paid—every broker is personally liable, and if a person owes him money, he would come to trouble if he could not arrange to carry over—I assisted him, and I am a creditor—on the second day it is more difficult to contango stock than on the first day—the Norfolk stock had not come in, and therefore there would be more difficulty in doing it—if people on the Stock Exchange are led to believe that the stock, instead of being borrowed came out of his own box, they are more ready to trust him—I had not the slightest notion that the 150 Norfolk shares had been improperly come by—he either said that they were his own or his brother-in-law's—I had not the smallest notion that they had been stolen by him from his employer—what I did was to prop up Germany's credit—I thought if he carried over to the next account he would probably come right—in this account "I," the Erie shares brought in at the different times are shown in the first column—100 were brought in in September, 1887, and in November 50 went out—those shares had been contangoed by Mr. Germany, and after wards got back for equivalent value and bodily returned to Lamotte—on October 24th there was a debit balance of £300 on the Lamotte account—at that time there were a good many outstanding transactions to be carried over to the next account—150 Eries were brought in by Lamotte—the value of the Eries would be about £750, and Germany could get a loan of about £750 for the Eries brought in by Lamotte, and the 450 would remain as loan for the accommodation of Mr. Germany—he carried over that account successfully—whenever he became a defaulter an investigation must have shown that it was Lamotte's account—I have not been able to find the actual numbers not entered in the ticket-book, they were taken direct to the Imperial Bank, and when they came back the same numbers would be on them still—on November 14th, when the loan was paid off, the 150 came back into Mr. Germany's office, and on the same day it appears Lamotte brought in another 100 Eries; those two added together made it 250; those were contangoed on November 15th, which gave a credit balance of £700 for Mr. Germany to carry over to the next account, and then the balance was £1,750 on the wrong side by reason of change in prices—before they were contangoed the numbers were entered, and if they were stolen from Vivian, Gray, and Co. they could be traced by the numbers in the book—when Lamotte came to get the numbers he said that he wanted them for Robertson, and I let him have access to the book, knowing it was his own account—I never had the slightest suspicion that the Erie shares had been improperly come by—I had heard from Mr. Germany that Lamotte was going to bring in 300 or 350 Eries to enable him to tide over the account—I heard the conversation in which Lamotte said, "If I assist you with 300 or 350 Eries I must have a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi>"—I understood that those were to come from Robertson—I think it was Germany who proposed for the benefit of the loan of the 350 Eries; Lamotte was to have one-third of the profits—Lamotte saw Germany in the afternoon, but did not tell me what had passed; the books were taken away the same night—the post-card is dated the 4th, that would be Tuesday; the books were brought back the next day, and he surrendered himself after he heard that a warrant was out</p>

               <p>against him—on the Friday morning when Germany drew out the £300 the balance was £540—I drew out £210, leaving £9 balance; the balance on the morning of the 28th was £463—I had no doubt at any time that the story Lamotte was telling was the truth.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As to Germany's failure there is nothing of which he need be ashamed; it was brought about by people who owed him money not paying it; there was more than £1,700 owing to him; some of them had actually increased in the last account, and some of them had been standing—shares were taken up in some instances which were not taken back—I never looked to see whether Lamotte brought back the same shares which had been given to him; it never struck me, but I should say they were not—I cannot remember whether they were ever handed to the clerk in my presence—there were two clerks at the time of the failure, one had charge of the books, and the other, if he had anything to do, would go away and do it—an investigation would not show that these shares were being brought in by Lamotte—it did not occur to me to ask where Mr. Robertson kept all these securities—I do not know that this account of Lloyd and Barnett's was closed in June, 1888, but I never heard after that of his having a banking account—I do not remember Lamotte suggesting that contract notes should not be sent, to save the stamp—there were one or two customers to whom contract notes were not sent; in one case, I think, it was the clerk to another stockbroker—the commission earned was about £260, and less than £100 for carrying over—I do not know of any balance being paid to Lamotte till this year; he had the benefit of the credit balance as cover—the last time I heard of the loan of £100 owing by Germany to Lamotte was at the beginning of last account—the third of the profits was to be upon every transaction—I do not think he made it a condition to bring the Eries in; he did not say he would bring them in if he did not have it—I understood he said he must have <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> if he brought them in—it was arranged he should have one-third of the business—that was on the occasion when I heard him say he was about leaving Vivian, Gray's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an acting bailiff—on 9th January I was in possession at Aumerle Lodge, Camberley, the residence of the prisoner—Mears was acting with me as bailiff—on that afternoon, about half-past four, I saw Mears there—I looked towards the duck-pond and said to Mears, "There are three ducks missing"—the prisoner said to me, "By Heaven, if you don't get off my premises I will shoot you as dead as the duck found in my pond this morning!"—he was up at the back window—I was about fourteen or fifteen yards from the window—he said, "Are you going?" and he aimed at me, holding a revolver with two hands—I said, "If you will allow me time I will go"—I was gradually moving away to a corner, where there was a water-tank—he still kept aiming at me all the way—at last I made a rush and stooped down in the corner—he then came to a side window, opened it, and said, "If you put your head out of that corner I will shoot you dead"—I then heard him say to Mears, "Young man, I bear you no malice, but if you don't get off my premises I will blow your brains out"—I heard Mears say that he was a very foolish man for acting in that manner—he then went behind a tree, when the prisoner said, "I can see you; if you don't go beyond the range of my revolver I will shoot you dead. Are you going? I can shoot the head off a ten-inch nail at 100 yards"—Mears beckoned with his stick to me, which I thought was a sign to escape—I jumped over the fence into a field alongside the London and North Western Railway, and I then came into a small two-acre field belonging to the prisoner—he observed me, and he said to the lad employed on the premises, "Who is that, Jack? I see no one"—he said, "A man in the field"—the prisoner said, "Speak, or I'll fire"—I made no answer—I got about 20 yards off Mears—I beckoned to him to come along towards the gate, which he did—the prisoner was at the front bedroom window, which is at a corner of the house—I ran and got under some trees close to the gate—the lad employed on the premises was continually coming from the house down towards the gate where we were—the prisoner told the lad to go and see where those men were—at a quarter to seven I heard him, because we followed the lad as near as 30 yards from the house—we doubled up to hear the conversation between the two—the gate is about 140 yards from the house—the prisoner asked the lad, "Where are those two men?"—he replied, "Under a tree, near the gate"—the prisoner said, "Do you mean the wood?"—the lad said, "Yes, sir"—he said, "All right, I will very soon fetch them out of that"—we doubled back sharp and shifted our position, as we thought very probably he would fire at us—in about a minute or two he came to the window, and told the lad to stand on one side—at the same time I heard a report of firearms, and saw a flash of fire, which I believe was from the middle window—at the same time I could hear the bullet whistling through the branches and lodge in a tree within a short distance of where we were standing—next day I examined the tree, and found the branches were cut with the bullet; pieces were taken out of it, and the bullet went about three yards beyond the tree—that was on the 10th—afterwards, on the Monday, Inspector Andrews and myself made a further examination of the trees, and we found the marks where the bullet had lodged—we could not find the bullet—I am a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had prior dealings with Mr. Reynolds—on one occasion I summoned him—the summons was dismissed on account of the false evidence the prisoner got up—I had no grievance against him—previous to the summons he set a ferocious dog on me twice—I had a grievance on account of the injury he caused to my cow—I was only examined on one occasion before the Magistrate—I said before the Magistrate that the prisoner said to Mears, "If you don't go I will blow your brains out"—I believe the clerk took it down; the evidence was read over to me by the solicitor—I am not aware of any omission—it was not there—I did not give my evidence direct at the time; the Magistrate wished to adjourn for luncheon, and the clerk read the evidence over to me, and he wished me to state if there was any deficiency, and correct it—I found there was no mistake and no deficiency—I said before the Magistrate that the prisoner said, "If you don't go beyond the range of my revolver I will shoot you dead"—Mr. Tootal, the clerk, took it down—I also said that the prisoner said, "I can shoot the head off a tenpenny nail at 100 yards"—I followed the boy up and down between the gate and the house to hear the conversation—the boy was within hearing of all that I heard the prisoner say—I never went into the house until after the prisoner was in custody—I was in charge of the outdoor effects that were seized—Mears was with me all the time, and could hear all that I heard; we went both together on the grass, to within about thirty yards of the house—the railway runs near the house, trains were passing and repassing—I was there from half-past four till quarter-past seven—the firing took place about quarter of an hour before the cab arrived; it might be longer—I did not see the prisoner open the cab door to let the lady in; I was about ten yards from the cab—it was not dark, it was a peculiar light, between moonlight and dark—I distinctly saw the female in the cab.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Pembroke Road, Camberley. On the afternoon of January 9th I was in company with Kay, in the rear of the prisoner's premises, counting the ducks in the pond—I saw the prisoner several times—he never spoke to me—he opened the window, and accused Kay of stealing one of the ducks, and an altercation took place between them—he told Kay if he did not go off his premises he would shoot him as dead as the duck he found that morning—he told me that he bore me no ill-feeling whatever, and I had better go as well—after that, finding that I did not move, he said if I did not go by the time he counted three he should fire at me, and blow my brains out—he was then pointing a revolver at me—he was at the window upstairs—he counted one, two, and I then moved away to an adjoining tree, by the side of the house—he then came to a window overlooking the same tree—he saw me, and told me that he could reach me very well there, still pointing the revolver from the window—he said he never missed his mark, and if I took one step further towards his premises he should blow my brains out—thinking the tree not large enough to protect me from the shot, I moved to another tree about fifteen yards distant, still in a line from the house—after that he came to a window overlooking that tree—I then pointed with my</p>

               <p>stick to Kay, and called to him to go away—the prisoner saw me make the motion, and told me if I made another move he should blow my brains out—at that time Kay had come into the meadow adjoining; I joined him—the prisoner asked a lad ho had there who it was in the meadow—the boy said he did not see anyone—he then called out "There is someone; speak, or I shall fire"—I did not speak; we moved away, as we thought, out of the range of the revolver, towards the gate—we returned from the gate towards the house several times—the prisoner was continually calling the lad from the gate to ask him questions about whether he saw anyone coming, which I took to be Mrs. Reynolds coming from Edgware—on one occasion, when we ran up behind the boy, he asked him where those men where, and the boy said, "At the gate under the trees"—it was then raining, and we had got under the trees for shelter—the prisoner said, "Which trees do you mean, the wood?"—the boy said, "Yes, sir"—the prisoner said, "All right, Jack, I will soon fetch them out of that"—in about a minute he said, "Jack, you stand out of the way;" and in about a minute or half a minute we heard a report, and saw the flash, and heard the whiz of a bullet through the trees where we had been standing—next morning we examined the tree, and found a branch scarred as though by a bullet, a piece was chipped off from the top part of the branch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Gibbon Brothers, printers, of Finsbury Park—on 20th November we had orders to print cards for the School Board election from Dr. Burns and Mr. Storr—on Sunday, November 18th, I called on Dr. Burns to know whether I was to keep the type up any longer; he said that I was not to keep it up, but that he had another job—I went into his dispensing place, and he produced this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188902040064"/>
               <p>bill, and told me to get out 30,000 bills, and to keep it as near as I could, but to substitute his name, and Mr. Stort's and Mr. Herbert's, in the place of three names on this bill, and also to put his own name with Mr. Herbert's in blacker type, with a figure "2" and "L. K. Q. C. P." after his own name—on the other side there is something about Cardinal Manning; that is his writing—he did not say that I was to omit, "We, your clergy"—I carried out his instructions as near as I could, and delivered the 30,000 bills—he next came to see me after the solicitor had called—I had no complaint till then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not submit any proof to the prisoner; these pencil alterations are in his writing—my mind is a perfect blank as to what he said when he came to me—he said something—he asked me for the copy—I made some evasive answer—I had given it up to the solicitor's clerk, and did not like to say so—Burns may have said, "How is it you did not print the bills according to my instructions?"—he said, "His Eminence Cardinal Manning is favourable, and so is Father Lockhart," but he did not say that was to be in substitution of the words, "We, your clergy"—he told me to copy the bill as near as I could as to the type—he came in with two men whom I knew, bawling something out to try and got me to say something which would bring blame on myself—I heard the evidence of the two gentlemen who accompanied him, and heard them say that these questions were all put to me—I have great doubt that he complained that it was a negligent act on my part, but I cannot swear it—I have not been paid for the bills, and have threatened to put him in the County-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no animosity against him; as soon as I arrived at Clerkenwell Court he came and asked me to protect him by taking the matter on myself—I said, "I will say as little as I can, but I must protect myself"—that is what I have done.</p>

I live at 11, Edenham Street, Kensal Road, and am a labourer—about half-past twelve on the morning of January 9th I went from the Skiddaw public-house, which is not far from the Harrow Road, over to a coffee-stail, where I met the prisoners—I left the coffee stall by myself, and afterwards Stevens sprang on my back, and said he wanted some money, or else he would kick my ribs in—he knocked me down at the same time—he felt in my pockets and knelt on my right hand—Hawkes stood under the wall—I twice holloaed out "Police"—two constables came and caught the prisoners—I went to the station and charged them—before I was attacked I had in my pockets a Jubilee half crown and between 7s. and 8s.—afterwards I found that all I had left was 2s. 1/2 d.—I was sober—I had only had a pint of four ale—I went to the Police-court a week afterwards, but the case was called on and I was not there—I had come over so queer I had to go away.</p>

About two o'clock on the morning of 9th January I was with Crawley on duty at the comer of Chippenham Road in Elgin Avenue—I heard cries of "Police," and went in the direction and saw Hawkes leaving Warner; he was about fifteen yards from him—Stevens was bending over Warner, who was on the ground—Stevens ran across the road; I pursued him—when he got to the corner of Edbrook Road he began to walk fast—I caught him about twenty five yards from Warner—I asked him what was the matter over the way—he said, "I don't know, I have just come out of doors"—I said, "I know that is not true, for I have seen you three times before to-night"—he said nothing—I said, "You will have to come back with me"—I took him to Warner, who was still lying on the footway—I asked him what was the matter—he said, "I have been knocked down and robbed by two men"—I said, "Do you know this man?" (Stevens)—he immediately said, "That is the man that robbed me"—Hawkes was then further along the Edbrook Road—there is a low wall along one side of the road where Warner was on the ground—I took Stevens to the station—Warner went too—the other constable arrested Hawkes—when formally charged at the station Stevens said, "I know nothing about it"—on the road to the station Stevens said, "You have made a great mistake this time"—at the station Warner said he had lost some money; he did not know how much; he took out 2s. 1/2 d., I believe, from his pocket—he was greatly excited—I believe he had been drinking; he is a very old man, partly paralysed on one side.</p>

I am a solicitor practicing at Lamenter, Cardiganshire—I knew the deceased, Caroline Morgan; she died on 2nd February, 1888—I had previously acted as her solicitor, and for her family—on 5th January, 1888, I went to her house at Frondewi—I had a summons from her a few days before, to go to her on that day—she was then ill—I pre pared her will on that day, I got the instructions from herself verbally; this is the probate, and this <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the original will that I prepared on that day; it was signed by her in my presence, and was attested by me and my son; this is signed in her ordinary handwriting, except that it is a little more shaky on account of her being very unwell at the time—it is signed C. Morgan, she always signed C. Morgan—under that will neither the prisoner or his children derive any benefit <hi rend="italic">The will was put in and read</hi>)—The son of the first-named executor is the person deriving substantial benefit under that will—I have here my written instructions which I had previously taken—after her death I took steps with a view to proving the will—on 23rd February, in consequence of something I heard, I went to the house of Miss Morgan, at Frondewi; I found the prisoner there in possession; after some negotiation with him I induced him to leave—I had two constables with me, I had asked them to meet me there as I was afraid there might be a breach of the peace—at that time he said nothing about any other will, but I told him I thought it was an extraordinary thing on his part to do such a thing—he said very little—I knew at that time that a will had been proved on 16th February; he was there in possession under that will—after that I commenced an action in the Probate Division for the purpose of setting aside the will which had been proved on 16th February—the prisoner appeared in that action as the defendant—I was present at the funeral of Caroline Morgan, I think on the 8th—the prisoner was there; I spoke to him—he said nothing to me about the will of 23rd January—I did not read the will of 5th January at the funeral—I knew the late Joseph Morgan, of Maister, well; he was uncle to Miss Morgan—he died on the 29th January—I know Caroline Morgan's handwriting—looking at</p>

I am a nurse—I was employed as nurse to Miss Caroline Morgan, from December, 1887, up to the time of her death—I remember her having a fit on 24th January, the day before I saw Joseph Morgan at the house between 2 and 3—I was in the bedroom when he came up, and the whole time he was there—the prisoner did not come into the bedroom at all while he was there—I did not see him at the house at all that day—Miss Morgan did not sign any document while Joseph Morgan was there—she was very weak, in bed—he was there about twenty minutes, perhaps less.</p>

No. 26—Burke said, "That will do," and they walked away—I knew Burke before, and I knew Thompson's face, but did not know him by name—I picked out Thompson at the station on Saturday from a number of men.</p>

J. Rimell—the references were A. F. Benning, solicitor, of 7, Quality Court, Chancery Lane, and Silburn, solicitor, of 32, Watling Street—the rent was in arrear generally throughout the year; up to Midsummer, 1888, we had to distrain twice; the distress fetched a trifle over £1—the premises were never actually vacant—I know nothing of Benning being there resident; I never saw any of the tenants myself; it was all done by correspondence.</p>

Meet me by 6.30 train.—Silburn.")—I believe I met that train; I saw the prisoner later on, after receiving the telegram; I don't know if I met him—I don't know if that was the time he paid me the £25 or not; it was about that time—I cannot say whether it was on that occasion, but one evening after banking hours he said, "I have some money for you, and I shall have to cash a cheque, and I will come up the first thing in the morning and give you some money"—he came next day and paid me £20 in bank notes, and I gave him a sovereign—he said with the £4 I had that would make it about right—he said he would give me another £100 next February—I wrote several letters to him before this, asking if it were possible to let me have the money; he said no, as my mother was away nobody would have anything to do with it; but when he was in Norwich he said, "I shall be having £400 or £500, and I will let you have the money myself"—he also said, "I am taking some rooms at Brighton for entertainments, and you might come down there, and I will give you £2 a week as a kind of manager and to play the piano"—I should have gone there this month—I agreed for £100, and he said about £80; I said I would take £80 because I wanted to purchase out of the army—he said, "Well, of course you will stick to your old arrangements?"—I said, "Oh yes; if you will only let me have the money"—I have always placed explicit confidence in him as my solicitor from the first time I knew him; until after his arrest I did not believe it; he treated me always in a gentle manly like manner, and I thoroughly believed I had a friend in him as I had no other friend—a receipt was given for the money—I did not read the receipt; he said, "That is a receipt," and I signed it, but I did not read it—this is my signature to it; I signed where he told me—my eye did not catch the words, "Camm to Rimell," because the doctor was just going the rounds, and I had not time; I just signed it <hi rend="italic">This receipt was dated 9th November</hi>, 1888, <hi rend="italic">for £55, to be paid in a month, and</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">when the matter was completed</hi>)—I had no notion when this document was given to me to sign that the prisoner had under this deed of assignment obtained and lodged in his bank £450, or £415 out of £450, which had been advanced—he said nothing of it to me; he told me he should be receiving £400 or £500 himself in a short time—when I signed this receipt I had not been informed, and had no notion of the deed of assignment, which purports to be dated 27th January, 1888.</p>

In the parchment deed of 27th January, 1888, I see an alteration in the date, in the word "eight" of eighty-eight—I have not studied the prisoner's handwriting, I have only studied the signatures—I see two erasures in the words £210; it is scratched out with a penknife, not particularly carefully or effectually—I see some figures, 27-1-88, immediately under the signature—I should not like to say whether the "2" has been altered, it is not written so nicely as the others—it may possibly have been made out of the figure 1; it has that appearance—I should not like to swear it—I cannot tell in whose handwriting those figures are—the "8" in this receipt of 25th February, 1888, looks as if written by the same hand—if this is Manning's, the date on the deed would also be his—I find a seal on the deed; it has a monogram, "W.

               <p>any samples of the handwriting of Mr. A. F.

I came from Newcastle to London some six or seven years ago; I cannot give you the date; I should think it would be about 1879 or 1880—somewhere about that, as near as I can guess—my certificate lapsed once or twice; I forget the year—I had it out in 1887; up to 1887 it was out—I took it out in 1887, not at the commencement, shortly after—I have not taken it out since 1887. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "As a fact, has your conduct been under investigation ever since 1886 at the hands of the Law Society?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "I told you at Bow Street that there was a case pending, and it is a matter I take exception to your mentioning in a Court like this, because it has not been dealt with—it has not been under investigation since 1886; it is just coming on now—a charge has been made against me of allowing an unqualified party to use my name; there is nothing in it—a Master's report has been made against me—he has found that I did allow it, according to his lights—it has all been explained—I say I have no right to have these questions asked me, because they are to be dealt with at the Royal Courts, and anything I say now may be prejudicial to my case hereafter—I plead privilege, on the ground that what I have to say may criminate myself—it might; I don't think anything can criminate me; at all events, it might—I left Devonshire Chambers some two or three years back; I cannot give you the dates—I keep books as a solicitor, but they are not here; I have not made any reference to them since I was at Bow Street—it was about three years ago that I left Devonshire Chambers—I had no office for a time; I think I went from there to Quality Court; that would be about a year and a half ago, somewhere about the autumn of 1887—I suppose I was there for about six months—I then went to 11, Clement's Inn, and occupied a little room there, communicating with that of Manning—that would be in the spring of 1888, as near as 1 can remember—I suppose I was there not more than five or six months, off and on—that would bring me to the autumn of 1888; that is all my remembrance—I have had no office since—I never went to 210, Strand; I have called there, but had no office there—I have done nothing particularly since—I have known Manning some five or six years, I think—I knew him before he went to Clement's Inn—I have known Peacock a very short time—I did not know him before May, 1887—I gave Manning a reference in May, 1887, in the name of Rimell, as being satisfactory and solvent, because Manning came and asked me to give a reference for Rimell, a man I knew very well, and I gave the reference for Rimell 'and not for the prisoner—I went to his office in Clement's Inn simply to take affidavits—there was no idea of that sort at the time—I used to go there from day to day—Manning was then in occupation of those rooms—he had no other place of business at that time that I am aware of—it was in November, 1887, as near as I can remember, that he suggested to me to go to Aldershot—when I was examined before I said I could not tell; the matter had gone out of my mind—I told you at that time I was not accurate as to date—I cannot remember—I said it was in the early part of this year—that would not be so very long back—the early part of one year would not be very far from the latter part of another—I don't remember having said before the Magistrate that my visit to Aldershot was in the early part of 1888; I could not tell the time; I won't say I did not; I might have said so—whenever it was, I went down with Manning—it was somewhere about</p>

               <p>eight at night that we got to the Royal Hotel—he asked me to go down to take a declaration—it did not strike me as in the least odd—we went into the coffee-room, and there saw Henry Camm—I believe the deed was first produced, I fancy before the declaration; I did not pay particular attention—the deed was signed after they had had some conversation together, of which I did not take any heed—I can't say whether the deed was read to Camm; he had it in his hand—when the declaration was signed my portion of the work was done; I had nothing further to do—my impression is that I did not go to Clement's Inn before the spring of 1888—the declaration was taken on 23rd November, 1887; I was at Clement's Inn at that time; I had left Quality Court—as attesting witness to the deed, I described myself as of Quality Court—there is nothing in that; I have often done it—I had only just left Quality Court, and any address was sufficient for it; there was no reason for not putting Clement's Inn—I knew Mr. Fisher some years back—he did not come to Clement's Inn till after I had been there—I could not tell you the time, I suppose it was February, 1888—I think that was the first time I saw him there—I don't know how the statutory declaration, dated 23rd November, 1887, came to be in his handwriting; I believe he did some odd work before he came there; he used to do occasional jobs for Manning—that is the only explanation I can give—the time was not impressed upon my mind—the declaration is in two different hands; I can see that very plainly—a portion of it at the top is in Manning's hand, Fisher's for some six lines, and then the other portion in Manning's—I really could not say that this is the document I filled in at the time I went to Aldershot; when the declaration was handed to me I simply signed it and stamped it, and that is the only thing to bring" it to my memory—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Explain, if you can, how that document, vouched by you as having been declared before you in November, 1887, is mainly in the handwriting of Fisher, who did not come into Manning's service till 1888. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I cannot; I had nothing to do with the drawing of the declaration, I simply took it—I cannot explain it—I pledge my oath that the deed and declaration were both signed by Camm at the same time—on my oath he signed it in the coffee-room of the Royal Hotel at Aldershot—I did not know that at the date purporting to be the date of the deed, 27th January, Camm was no longer at Aldershot; I did not know the date of the deed; it was never shown me—I did not know that he was then at Colchester—I know nothing more than that he signed the deed in my presence—it was my duty as a commissioner to look at the date of the declaration, and to see that the date was correct—I cannot tell you whether the 27-1-88 was there at the time I wrote my signature—I have looked at it in Court before—I wrote my signature as attesting witness there and then in the coffee-room from what I can remember—I explain the difference between the two dates to the deed and the declaration, simply that the date was not filled in the deed at the time it was executed—I can give no other explanation; I know nothing about its contents now—very possibly I was constantly at Clement's Inn in November and December, 1887, and January and February 1888—I was there every day for a time—I daresay that would be the time I was constantly going there—I knew Manning there as managing clerk to J. H. Silburn—I called him Manning—no other name that I know of—"Debenham and Co." was outside the door—I never knew exactly who Debenham and</p>

               <p>Co. were—I pledge my oath to that—I gave a satisfactory reference to Debenham and Co. when they were going to 210, Strand, because Manning told me he was going to adopt the name of Debenham—I never meant to convey the idea that I never knew the name of Debenham—he told me then that was the name he wished to take the office in, I meant to say, when the name was put on the door of Clement's Inn—I was not Manning's reference at Clement's Inn—I was a reference for Rimell—I was Manning's reference as Debenham at 210, Strand—up to that time I did not know who Debenham was—at the time I gave the reference I knew he was going to trade under the name of Debenham—I don't know what as—my reference was simply that he was capable of paying the rent, and went no further—I have no more idea than you have why he was going there as Debenham—he went there in July—I was there altogether about five times, I think, and I only saw him about twice out of the five—I did not leave Clement's Inn until up to the time he left, or just a few days before—I was told that a distress had been put in at 11, Clement's Inn—the furniture was seized and condemned under the distress—I knew that Manning had left, owing rent, when I wrote the letter of 10th July; that would not make any difference as long as he paid his rent—I was quite under the conviction at that time that Rimell was the tenant—the mere fact of his not paying his rent is no evidence of his not being respectable—his funds would be all the larger—I hope I am still a member of an honourable calling; I have done nothing to forfeit it, I am perfectly certain of that—<hi rend="italic">The letter of the witness was read, stating, "in regard to Debenham, I believe him to be a respectable and responsible person"</hi>)—£30 a year was the sum mentioned in the letter to me—I never knew Manning to be going by any other name than his own up to that time—I don't know whether Mr. Camm addressed him as Silburn—he might; managing clerks are often called by their masters' name—he has been addressed as Silburn, but I thought nothing of that—I knew the name of Debenham, but up to that time I had no idea he was under that name; I thought it was somebody else—I never became in any sense a tenant at 210, Strand—Manning spoke to me about some negotiation with a Mr. Hocombe about getting an advance of money—I really forget at what time that was—it was not very long after he went to 210, Strand—he told me he was getting an advance from Mr. Hocombe—I did not clearly understand what it was—I distinctly pledge my oath to that—he told me that Hocombe required some assurance as to what would be the cost connected with the reversion—he did not suggest to me that I should represent the solicitor of the deceased's estate—I did not undertake to do so—he said, "Mr. Hocombe required an opinion from somebody who would be qualified to give it"—on 16th October I wrote a letter to Mr. Hocombe—it is on paper, with "A. F. Benning, solicitor, 210, Strand, corner of Essex Street," printed on it—that was printed without my knowledge and without my sanction; I never saw it till that very night when I wrote the letter, which I admit I did foolishly, because I had nothing to do with 210, Strand; therefore the letter ought not to have been on it—in spite of that I never took possession, or had anything to do with 210, Strand—I had not taken out my certificate then—I have not now—I knew what Mr. Hocombe required at the time I wrote that letter, that was why I put it in that way, "in my belief the costs in</p>

               <p>promise; I said I would come back, I don't know why; that was the reason I did not go back—this is my telegram <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is to Mr. Hocombe—it says, "Detained at meeting," that is quite true, I was detained at a meeting in the City; it was no consequence my going back, therefore I simply sent the telegram as a matter of courtesy to Mr. Hocombe—I did not under take to go back; if that was all I was required for, it was not sufficient to go back for, and leave something else for it—I have seen this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) once, and once only, when you placed it in my hands at Bow Street—considering I did not see any documents, I can't say whether this was one of the documents taken by Manning when he and I walked up to Mr. Hocombe's on the morning of 23rd October—I did not see any document—it is Fisher's handwriting—I knew Manning about five or six years; I did not know him before 1883; it would be about the commencement of 1883, I think—he has frequently been absent; he was absent for a specific time—when a man can pay his way he is respectable and responsible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting at 8, Red Lion Square—I had had before me from December last certain documents, which have been here called in question—I have made a comparison between those and certain others which have been handed to me for the purpose of comparison—among them there have been samples of the genuine handwriting of the prisoner Manning and the witness Benning; as to the latter only lately—I have also had these two small books in Manning's handwriting, which contain a number of dates in 1887—I have examined the signature of Henry Camm to this deed of assignment of January 27th, 1888—I have had for the purpose of comparison a number of the undisputed signatures of Henry Camm; about eighteen in number—in my skilled opinion the signature to this deed is not the genuine signature of Henry Camm—it is much bolder than the genuine writing—the "e" in Henry almost touches the "n" following—I have no doubt that the signature of the attesting witness and the words above it are the handwriting of Benning, and in my opinion the "Henry Camm "is in the same handwriting—the figures "27-1-88" are Manning's—I notice an alteration in the date 87, and an erasure at the place where the consideration 210 has been filled in—in the second sheet of the deed the figure 2 in 27 has been altered from a 1 into 2—the figure 8 in this paper of Manning's agrees with the 8 in the deed—the 8 in the deed is darker than that on the declaration—that may be accounted for by the different substances on which the two things have been written.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first person who came to me about giving evidence in this matter was the Solicitor to the Treasury—they gave me a book with seventeen or eighteen signatures of Camm's—it was an order book, B 50 I think it is called—I took them to be genuine signatures—I was not told that the signature to the deed was a forgery; I was told to give an opinion upon it—there is a difference between writing on parchment and on note paper—I should not call the writing in the order book a running hand, that on the parchment is a running hand—it depends on the skill of the forger whether running handwriting is more difficult to forge than one that has not so much slope—this "Henry Camm" is a good imitation—I could not have produced a signature nearer than that to it; I could not copy a signature like this without hesitation—with me the hesitation Of the pen would be seen in the signature—it does not suggest itself to me that the signature must have been practised a good deal,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188902040114"/>
               <p>because I see his natural hand in the attesting clause; I mean Benning's—I have seen several letters of his—I have seen the letter of 18th May, 1887, to Taylor and Humbert, and that of 16th October, 1888, to Hocombe, and his two test signatures in Court—I had not seen those test signatures when I made up my mind as to Benning having forged—I have based my opinion on the letters written by him and the writing here—I might not always be able to distinguish between Camm's real signature and the forged one; it might be so good an imitation—I was shown several letters admitted to be Camm's, and hesitated to say whether they were his or not—I can tell which of these is written by Camm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I desire to examine and consider them before I give evidence on them—I did not feel inclined to pass my word with regard to those letters produced from the prisoner's custody—the first document given to me before I saw anything else was the deed of assignment, and my eye was at once struck by the "amm" in the signature to the attesting clause, and the "amm" in the signature to the document being bold, thick writing and similar—then I saw the letter of 16th November, written by Benning, in which the words occur <hi rend="italic">"in re</hi> Camm deceased," and that convinced me it was Benning's writing; the slope is the same, and the "c's" and "a's" are identical—in the signature to the deed the last curl of the "m" runs upwards, and partly round, and turns somewhat back—I find that last stroke turns up and back exactly in the same way in the test names written by Benning at the Police-court—the letter "y" at the end of Henry runs up into the capital "C" of Camm; there is great similarity between it and the "y's" written by Benning in "Quality Court," in "Chancery Lane," in "May," in the letter to Messrs. Taylor, Sons and Humbert, in "Gray's Inn," and in the two test signatures, and in the attestation clause the "y" in "Chancery Lane" and that in the signature are in my opinion by one and the same person.</p>

I am a clerk in the employment of the Rent Collecting Society, 67, Norfolk Street, Strand—in 1887 we were acting as agents in respect of offices at 16, Tokenhouse Yard, where Peacock occupied offices—he went into possession about the middle of April, 1887, and continued till the end of that year—after that the management of the property passed out of our hands—I could not saw if Peacock's name was outside the door—the name of Foster was on the door of the office that Peacock occupied—I was there once or twice; not beyond that—application for rent was made to Peacock—I believe a solicitor's letter was sent on one or two occasions to get the rent—on November 7th, 1887,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Buckle, of 6, Josephine Avenue, Brixton—in May, 1887, I made Coghlan's acquaintance under the name of Vaughan—about that time he came to stay at our house as a guest first, and remained afterwards as a boarder—at that time I and my husband had Peacock as our solicitor—we went to him at 11, Clement's Inn, and after his removal from there I saw him on several occasions at 16, Tokenhouse Yard—the name of Charles Foster and Co. was up there on one of the doors, and A. F. Peacock, Solicitor, on the other—I have frequently seen Coghlan there; he occupied Peacock's room; he told me he was on the Stock Exchange—I was going away with my husband into Yorkshire for a short holiday, but for some little time before I went I saw Coghlan and Peacock—at that time I was the principal proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Sale and Exchange</hi> newspaper, the publishing office of which was at 282, Strand—Coghlan brought me a letter which he said was from a gentleman who wished to purchase part of the news paper for £1,000; he read the letter to me, and the signature of the writer—I have forgotten the name; I thought it was honest and straightforward, and took no more notice of it—I saw the handwriting of the letter—I believed the contents to be true—Coghlan brought the book from the office showing the cost and profits of the newspaper—Coghlan said if I could get Mr. Buckle to advance me £500 for three weeks, this gentleman would pay him £1,000 in three weeks, and then he would return the £500—I said I would consult Mr. Peacock—I went and consulted Peacock, and he advised me to advance the £500—I mentioned the letter to him, he told me he had seen it before—I said, "We have not got the money"—he said, "Well, you know Mr. Buckle can get a further advance"—we had lent Peacock £100 on June 15th to accommodate him, by taking some deeds to Glyn, Mills and getting a loan of £100—he said, "Well, you can get the £500 by a further advance on those deeds that you have at the bank already if Mr. Buckle would agree to that"—I consulted Mr. Buckle, and he did agree to it if Glyn, Mills would advance the money—at the time another matter was under consideration between my husband and myself with regard to a deed of gift to me of some shares in the Lion Brewery Company at Brentford, and the Kirkstall Brewery Company at Leeds—it had been arranged between us that those shares should be transferred by means of a deed of gift—in relation to both matters we went and saw Peacock on 3rd August at 16, Tokenhouse Yard—Peacock had said, "Tell Mr. Buckle I shall want the shares, because I shall want to take the numbers before I can complete the deed of gift"—my husband accompanied me, taking the shares with him on 3rd August, to Tokenhouse Yard—we saw Coghlan and Peacock together in the same room there—Peacock said, "I want the £500 to-day to put in the <hi rend="italic">Sale and Exchange</hi> until this gentleman pays the £1,000; I will go with you to Glyn, Mills, Mr. Buckle, to see if we can get an advance"—he went out with Mr. Buckle; I remained in the office with</p>

               <p>Coghlan—they came back with a cheque which Peacock filled up and Mr. Buckle signed—Peacock said, "You had better make the cheque out to Mrs. Buckle," and I endorsed it and passed it into Peacock's own hand with the object I have stated—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he had no authority to deal with that cheque or its proceeds for any other purpose than that of the newspaper—Mr. Buckle then produced the shares and gave them to Peacock for him to take the numbers, so that he could complete the deed of gift to me—Peacock said, "Leave them with me at the present, I am rather busy just now"—Mr. Buckle said, "I am going away to Yorkshire"—Peacock said, "Very well, when I have done with them I will put them in my bank until you return, and then you can have them"—then Mr. Buckle handed the forty Kirkstall and thirteen Lion Brewery shares, and Peacock took them—Coghlan heard what was said by my husband and Peacock; he was in the same room—soon after we left—my husband went to Yorkshire on 8th August, and I followed him on the 17th—we went to stay with my brother—on 7th September the prisoners came to lunch at my brother's, and went out shooting for a little while—Peacock came back with a long letter from the same gentleman who had offered the £1,000—he read it to me—it said, if I would sell him the whole of my interest in the paper he would pay me £2,000 down—Peacock apologised for delay, but said he had been away—he left Coghlan and Mr. Buckle outside shooting—there was a reference in the letter to the earlier letter—I saw the letter—I do not remember the name of the writer—it was the same name as that of the person who purported to write the first letter, and it was apparently in the handwriting of the same individual—I said, "What do you advise, Peacock?"—he said, "By no means sell your interest in it, Mrs. Buckle; it will make you £1,000 a year in a very short time"—he said this gentleman, who was coming in, was a very clever fellow, and had been accustomed to newspapers, and would very soon make a very good thing of it—I believed him and took his advice, and retained my interest in it—I believed in the genuineness of the letter—Coghlan afterwards came back, and they left together as they had come—they were staying at the Fleece at Thirsk, I think—they said they were on business about a salt-mine at Middlesbrough, and they had called at my brother's on the way—I remained at Thirsk till 17th September, and then returned to London—at the end of September, or the early part of October, I saw Peacock at the <hi rend="italic">Sale and Exchange</hi> office—I asked' him about the £500, and he said the gentleman had not paid it, but it would be all right—Coghlan told me about that time that they were spending about £5 a week in advertising; and I went to the office and spoke to Sharman, the editor, and got information from him—Coghlan had left our house then, I think, and was with his wife—he left at the early part of October, I think—quite at the end of October Peacock came to the <hi rend="italic">Sale and Exchange</hi> office and said, "Mrs. Buckle, that villain Yaughan has got this place (meaning 282, Strand, the newspaper office) insured for £500 in his own name; before you leave this afternoon get a new lock put on the door so that he cannot come in, because he means to set fire to the place to get the money; he has also got the business into a great deal of debt"—I sent out for a locksmith on that day and had a new lock put on—an insurance policy in the name of J. Vaughan was in the drawer of the safe in the office—I tore it up and put it in the fire—this receipt for the payment of the premium of the insurance was given me—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188902040117"/>
               <p>at the same interview I said, "How about that money, Peacock; that £500?"—he said, "Well, I am very sorry to tell you, Mrs. Buckle, there never was such a man"—I said, "well, how about those letters?" and he said, "Those letters were concocted by Yaughan to get the £500 from Mr. Buckle"—I said, "They are not in Yaughan's writing"—he said, "He can write a dozen hands; in fact, I never met such a clever villain in my life"—I said, "How could you do it, Peacock, when we have trusted you so much and befriended you on so many occasions?"—he said, "Mrs. Buckle, if you will only trust yourself to me, I have done with that villain, and you shall not lose one penny of the money. We have bought a patent of a horse protector," and he said he should get £3,000 paid down in January, and he would then return the £500—I allowed the matter to stand over—on 10th January, 1888, Peacock handed me some shares in the Nylstroom Gold Mining Company as security for the £500 until he paid me—he handed me at the same time a transfer of the shares, signed by Coghlan—he said, "I will give you these to hold as security, but don't put them in the market; they are at a very low figure just now. I will tell you when to sell"—we did not receive any dividend from the Lion Brewery, and we could not understand how it was; I wrote, and they sent me a card to tell me that Mr. Buckle was no longer a shareholder—on 2nd March I sent my editor to the office of the Lion Brewery—he brought back certain information—on that I went to see Peacock, whom I saw coming up Norfolk Street with his clerk—his office was then in Norfolk Street—I held the paper which I had received about the shares being sold, in my hand, and said, "Good God, Peacock, what does this mean?"—he said, "What, Mrs. Buckle?"—he shook so—I said, "Those shares"—he turned to his clerk and said, "You can go on,. Simpson"—his clerk went on—Peacock said, "I will go on with you, Mrs. Buckle, to the office, and tell you all about it"—we went into the editor's room at 282, Strand; he asked the editor to leave, as he wanted to speak to me privately—the editor left—Peacock said, "I am very sorry indeed for you, Mrs. Buckle, you have had so much trouble, but it is that Vaughan who has led me into this; the shares are not sold; Yaughan broke into my drawer, took them out, and got money on them at the bank, and I knew nothing at all about it; but if you will tell me what the dividend is, I will give you a cheque for the dividend, and before the next dividend is due I will redeem the shares; for Gods sake don't name it to a living soul, Mrs. Buckle, or it will ruin me "—I promised him I would not—he gave me a cheque then for £22 15s—but it was so indistinctly written, his fingers shook so, that they refused it at the bank, and I had to get another one from him—I said to him, "Where are the Kirkstall Brewery shares, then?"—he said, "I am afraid they have gone the same way, but don't trouble; I will redeem them all before the June dividend is due"—he told me not to name it to Mr. Buckle or anyone; and I promised I would not—between the time of my coming back from Yorkshire and this interview in March I had asked him about these shares; and he said, "They are at the bank, and I forgot them when I was down"—he promised again and again to bring them—I mentioned it three or four times, and said, "Mr. Buckle would be more comfortable if you would get them, and give them to him"—he said he would do so, but he never did—I don't think I asked him about the shares between the conversation in October, when he told me he had</p>

               <p>discovered what a villain Peacock was, and the 2nd March—I cannot say whether I did or not; I believe I did in November, and told him Mr. Buckle would be more comfortable if he got them; which he promised to do—I cannot say positively, but I believe that took place in November—I generally met him at 282, Strand; I have called at his office several times, and he has generally been out—after his request I kept the matter to myself—on 2nd March he told me the Nylstroom shares were worthless; there was no gold mine at all; that the affair was got up by Vaughan writing letters to Pretoria, where he said he had a brother, and he had someone there to repost the letters home, and that was how he formed the gold mining company with his own letters, and that when he had all the money subscribed, £10,000, he wrote a long paragraph and sent it out to Pretoria to be put in the paper there, announcing the death of his brother, and Peacock said he had a paper with the paragraph, and he could transport Vaughan any day on that account alone—he said Vaughan never had a brother there at all; the letters were nothing else but his own writing, and there was no gold mine—Peacock said he would be sure to pay the money himself back again; that he was getting a mortgage from Hewetson for £4,000, and he said he should have so much for himself, and he would repay us then—he said Vaughan had got a gentleman with £2,000, but he wanted £8,000 or £10,000 to get new machinery—that was before he told me the shares were worthless; it was when he handed me the shares as security—on 5th April, 1888, I believe it was Peacock sent me a letter to say he had heard I had been saying something about him—I went to the <hi rend="italic">Sale and Exchange</hi> office and into the editors room and saw him—he said, "Mrs. Buckle, I hear you have been saying things against me that you have no right to"—I said, "Who gave you the information, Peacock?"—he did not tell me, but said he would not be doubted, and that I was to be very careful what I said or he would make our law expenses come to £2,000, and he said, "You know it lies in my power to do that"—I said, "Is this the way you are going to repay us for all our kindness to you in lending you money and all that? You villain, do your best and do your worst; I am prepared for it all"—we have lent him money frequently, in addition to the £500, when he has been in difficulty—I then went and placed my affairs in the hands of Messrs. Carritt and Sons, solicitors, and left them to negotiate with Peacock—I got back none of the £500—Peacock told me Vaughan got it; he said he handed him the cheque—I forget when he told me that—I never gave either Peacock or Coghlan any authority to deal with those shares.</p>

A. Buckle is my son—in March, 1886, he was carrying on the paper for me—he is thirty years of age—he is not here—I do not know whether he lent him £2 on June 9th, 1886, or £5 on September 20th; I do not know anything about their affairs—I never lent my son George one penny in my life—he is my younger son; he had a certain sum to come to him when he was twenty-one, and Peacock drew it out, and the poor boy never got anything but £10 and £5—I have never seen a receipt which my son gave for £212 1s. paid to him by Mr. Peacock—he is not here, he is in Africa—I persist in saying on my dying word that Peacock did not pay me the £212—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a very good imitation of my son Whitehouse's writing, but my son never received this amount—I do not believe Peacock ever paid my son that sum—the signature to this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not James Whitehouse Buckle's—the bookkeeper told me for one week I could not answer for these cheques—this cheque for £10 to James Buckle, on November 11, is £10 which Peacock repaid out of £50 which he had paid Peacock—Mr. Buckle advanced £100 to my son Charles for some arrangement—this is my husband's £10 which he got out of the £50, after going over and over again for' it—these are the items in which the money was paid—I do not know whether this is Charles' writing or not, he has just come from Australia, I do not know whether he is in Liverpool, or whether he has arrived in London with his wife—"December 20th, £240, pay J.

(<hi rend="italic">This was to the effect that having seen Peacock he stated that he had nothing to do with the Lion Brewery shares except when Mr. Buckle transferred them, and suggested that if paid the amount due he would hand over all the papers</hi>)—Ultimately by appointment I saw Peacock, I think on 5th December, 1888—I put a series of questions to him, these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the questions and his answers.

I was in the service of Mr. and Mrs. Buckle as domestic servant—I remember their going to Yorkshire some time in 1887, I think in September; they were away both in August and September, at that time Mr. Coghlan was lodging in the house—while they were away letters came for Mrs. Buckle—I gave Vaughan one—I knew Coghlan as Vaughan—the letter was from the Kirkstall Brewery—the other, letters I for warded to Mrs. Buckle; there were not many, I think—he asked me to give the letter to him as he was going to write to Mrs. Buckle, and he would send it in the letter—he said we were not to send Mr. Buckle's letters on, but to save them for him and he would always forward them, Mrs. Buckle's we were to send on, but not Mr. Buckle's—I did not give him any more letters; I did not see any more for Mr. Buckle, I sent Mrs. Buckle's on—Coghlan never advanced any money to me while Mr. and Mrs. Buckle were away.</p>

There was a mortgage executed to Mr. and Mrs. Buckle on the news paper</hi>")—I do not know of the existence of any mortgage for the sum of £500, which purports to be a mortgage to us—in December, 1887, Peacock paid £240 for valuation of the <hi rend="italic">Sale and Exchange</hi> office—he said that sum belonged to a client, and he would lend it for a short time; he said nothing about its being his own money—that is the only sum which I can remember as being a sum which can be referred to in this account, and that is the only sum I think that I know of by means of which Peacock has endeavoured to account for the trust fund of £945, leaving him in debt over £700, of which I know nothing—when the advance was made no suggestion was made by him, or intended by me, that he should take this trust money, for which he and my husband were jointly responsible, and advance it to me as a loan—I was with Mr. Buckle when the cheque was paid—Peacock said he was going to invest £906 in very good property at Sutton the next day on mortgage—I went to him once with my husband, when my husband said he would like to have the mortgage deed securing the trust money; Peacock said, "Well, it is in the bank, Mr. Buckle; I am equally responsible as well as you, and therefore I must look after it"—I had no intimation from the prisoner., that that money had not been invested on Sutton property—I knew nothing about it till this signed account was produced, which pretended he had advanced £500, which I never received.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer of Kirkby Bourne, Lincoln shire—down to the end of 1887 I was in partnership with my brother as drapers, in Little Newport Street, Soho—we were joint owners of a small house in Newport Court, and my brother put up the small shop to let in November, 1887—it had been a greengrocer's—after that I saw Terry, and on January 27, 1888, this agreement came, and the premises were let to him. <hi rend="italic">This was dated January</hi> 27, 1888, <hi rend="italic">from Wilson to Terry.

I am a draper, of 250, Well Street, Hackney, and 5, Little Newport Street—on 15th November Terry came to me about the lease of a shop which I held in Newport Court, which had been a green grocer's—he said he had a shop in Walker's Court, in which he had a manager, and he wanted that shop on the same conditions—he asked the rent; I said 10s. a week, and accepted him as a weekly tenant—a few days after the name of Palmer was put over the door—the last weekly rent he paid was in January, 1888—he then came to me with regard to taking a lease, and an agreement was signed—I tried to get my rent, but none was paid—I tried to find Terry, but was not successful—I saw Perkins on the premises two or three days before April 10—he is indicted as Jolliffe—I saw him cleaning down the premises, and asked him by whose authority he was there—he referred me to his solicitors, Silburn and Manning; I said that I did not recognise any solicitors, I only recognised Terry—he continued opening the shop, and it was open on April 10—after that, my brother coming back, I had nothing more to do with it—I afterwards saw a bill outside the premises, with the name of "Morgan, house-agent, Bloomsbury," on it—I went to Mr. Morgan with my sister-in-law, and asked him who had instructed him to let the premises—he produced a document, signed I believe by Debenham and</p>

Dear Sir,—Absence from home has prevented me from sooner replying to yours of the 6th inst., in regard to Mr. Debenham. I believe him to be a respectable and responsible person.—Yours truly, A. F.

I am a warehouseman, of 3, Lumber Court, St. Martin's Lane—in July, 1888, I saw a house-agent's bill outside a little shop in Newport Court; in consequence of which I went to the office of Mr. Morgan, house agent, 5, Great Russell Street, and saw his clerk Green, and asked him the particulars of the shop—he read them out to me; it was a shop and large cellar, a premium, and several other things, and an unexpired term of seven years—he said the premium would be £50—I said I could not give that, I offered £8—he said he would write to Mr. Manning and ask him all about it, and submit my offer—I asked him if any back rent or gas bill was owing—he said "No, none whatever"—after that I left—I went over the shop and then returned and saw Mr. Morgan—he said he was acting for Mr. Manning, and would write to him—I afterwards saw him—he said he had written to Mr. Manning, and he would accept my offer of £8—on 4th July a draft agreement was drawn up for me to sign—this is it—Mr. Green drew it up—I signed it, and Green and another young fellow who I had with me witnessed it—I paid Green the £8, and took this receipt for it <hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—an appointment was made for me to meet Mr. Manning and receive the counterpart signed—I opened the shop on the 5th, but did not go to see Mr. Manning till the 9th—I then went to Morgan's, and saw Manning there—he asked if I had the draft with me that Mr. Green had given me—I had left it at home—Manning was put forward as a solicitor, landlord of the premises in Newport Court—I was told to fetch the draft, and I went and got it, and brought it back to Morgan's—I did not see Manning then—I stopped there a few minutes and Mr. Fisher came in—he handed me this agreement—he wrote some of it out in Morgan's office—the signature was put to it at the time—I can't say whether the signature was what he wrote—I gave him the draft and he handed me this agreement <hi rend="italic">This was dated 9th July</hi>, 1888, <hi rend="italic">and was between George Perkins, of Marine Parade, Brighton, and the witness, signed G.

Perkins" before Manning brought it—he asked Fisher to sign it, but not because it was signed by Perkins already and not by a witness—he asked Green for a 6d. stamp and put it on—he did not put the 6d. stamp on the receipt; he only wanted 1d. stamp for that; he signed this with a 6d. stamp—this was the only document my brother had in his hand—I don't remember his looking at the other documents—I could not undertake to say he did not—after it was signed I put this document in my pocket, and I kept it five or six days, and gave it to my solicitor—the words, "And all liabilities aforesaid to be paid up to date," were not in the document when it was given me at first—I don't believe those words were in it when my brother had it—they would be put into it at some time when Fisher put his name—I only saw Green give Manning a 6d. stamp, and Manning sign it, and say to Fisher, "Sign this"—I saw Manning sign it—I did not say before the Magistrate "I did not see anyone sign it"; I did see it—nothing was said about the back rent on the day I met Manning—this document has got my signature; it was handed to me to sign; my brother saw it before I signed.</p>

J. Rimell—he occupied the place about a year, I never saw him there—we had to distrain for the first quarter's rent, the second quarter was paid with some delay, and we had to distrain for the two remaining quarters—nothing was left, and what was sold only yielded £1 14s. to meet half a year's rent—I do not know where he moved to—we were very glad to get the chambers again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and estate agent at 105, King's Road, Brighton—among my clients I have Dr. Graham Bennett, of Hertford Street, Mayfair—he is, I believe, owner of 28, Grand Parade, Brighton, and of a chapel behind it called either Grand Parade Chapel or St. James's Hall, which was let for £90 a year—the dwelling-house was to let at £60 a year, and in the last week in September the prisoners Manning and Terry came together, and said they would pay us a premium for the hall if we could get it for them—we said we would communicate with the owner—I sent my clerk with them to Dr. Bennett, but they were unable to see it that day, and promised to call next day, and in the meantime we were to communicate with Dr. Bennett—next day Mrs. Bennett came to our office with the key, and when Manning and Terry came they produced their card, "Maxwell, Debenham, and Co., 2, Prince Albert Street, Brighton"—they went with my clerk to see the premises, and came back and offered £100 per annum for the two on a 7, 14, or 21 years' lease—we said we would communicate the offer to Dr. Bennett, which we did, and received a letter from him saying that the hall was already let at £70 a year, but that he would take £130 for the house and hall on a repairing lease—I communicated that to them, and they made this written offer <hi rend="italic">Signed Maxwell, Debenham, and Co., agreeing to take the house and hall at</hi> £130 <hi rend="italic">a year on lease, provided they were put into tenantable repair</hi>)—I forwarded that to Dr. Bennett, and he agreed to accept the offer, allowing £10 off the first quarter—they came again next day, and gave as references "Rev." J. Coghlan, 9, Mill's Terrace, West Brighton; W. H. Manning, 200, Buckingham Palace Road; Dr. Campbell, 10, Park Square, Regent's Park; and Mr. Rimell, Green Lanes, Penge; and Mr. Walter, of Leinster Square, Bayswater—they said they wanted the hall for educational purposes; shorthand was mentioned, and I think Terry said that Manning was a good shorthand writer—I went to 2, Prince Albert Street, and outside the office was "Maxwell, Debenham, and Co., London and Provincial Trade Protection Society"—I wrote to the persons named; Coghlan replied,"Mr. Debenham was a tenant of mine; he gave every satisfaction"—Rimell replied, "I have known Mr. Debenham some years has a most respectable man"—Manning sent a similar letter; Dr. Campbell and Mr. Walter did not answer, and I told Coghlan so when he came—he said, "Dr. Campbell is in Paris," and gave me another reference, Mr. E. G. Fisher, who wrote, "I have known Mr. Maxwell, who is a respectable person, and always paid his rent regularly to me"—I believed the references were real, and sent them to Dr. Bennett; he kept them and wrote this letter, accepting the references—I then communicated with Mr. Stephens, Dr. Bennett's lawyer, and a draft lease was prepared and submitted to the prisoners, and they approved—there were some chairs in the hall which I said they must take at a valuation; they agreed, and I appointed a valuer for Dr. Bennett, but could not get them to appoint one—the matter was compromised by their paying £12 10s. deposit, and then the lease was executed; they had signed the draft "Thos. Maxwell and W. Debenham"—I left the matter in Mr. Stephens'</p>

Coghlan was a clergyman; they said, "Yes, living in his own house at Brighton"—I did not know that he was occupying a furnished house at 3 guineas a week—I had no notion that the letter signed G. H. Manning was written at the dictation of Debenham himself, and that Fisher's reference was written by the same hand as the other—if I had not believed them to be genuine references I should never have sent them to Dr. Bennett—I believed Maxwell and Debenham to be a genuine firm, and that the people composing it were honest.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I practise at 7, Hertford Street, Mayfair, and I am the owner of the house 28, Grand Parade, Brighton, and of the hall which adjoins it—in September last the hall was let as a chapel on a three years' agreement for £70 a year, there was one year to run—I instructed several agents, of whom Messrs. Brant and Co. were one, to let 28, Grand Parade; they had it on their books—about 29th September I received a letter from Messrs. Brant and Co. offering £100 a year for the two buildings—correspondence ensued, and on the 1st October I wrote agreeing to let the premises at £130, subject to references, and I told them I thought they could get rid of the agreement with the chapel people by paying them a certain sum—I particularly asked for landlords' references; I received a letter containing the references before I agreed to let the premises—I subsequently instructed a lawyer to execute the lease, believing the references and the statements contained in the letters implicitly—I decidedly should not have let the premises or executed a lease if I had known that those persons who gave references were not tenants—I made an arrangement with the tenants of the chapel to give it up on my undertaking to remit the half-quarter's rent; £8 15s. I think it amounted to—the defendants took all the doors off and made a communication between the chapel and house, which has spoilt the latter for private purposes; it will cost me about £20 I estimate to put the premises back into the condition they were before—I have had to pay half the legal expenses of the lease; I have offered Messrs. Brant half their com mission, £14; I hope they will take it—roughly speaking I have lost about £40 on this transaction; against that I have received £12 10s. on the sale of chairs, leaving a balance of £27 10s. to the bad—the house was in a fair state of repair at the time—I have done repairs to it from time to time—I have a bill here showing what repairs I did last year.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOMPAS</hi>. I would not undertake to put it into repair myself because they wanted structural alterations—I said they must take it on a repairing lease—rent was due at Christmas; they were arrested in November—no rent was due then—Brant demands his money; I hope I shall not have to pay it—the prisoners paid half the expenses—the prisoners spent something on the structural alterations—I have seen the house since; it has not improved, in my estimation—I agreed to allow £10 towards repairs—the house had been unlet between three and four years, but two years ago I papered and painted every room in the house, and last year I ran up bills amounting to £23—the chapel people still continue there at the prisoners' suggestion, and I told them not to pay any rent pending the trial—they have refused to pay me the £8; they say the prisoners allowed them to remain in till Christmas on account of allowing them to come in and do certain alterations to the chapel—when I received the reference I looked at Coghlan's writing, and it seemed that of a gentleman, and I thought Mr. Brant, living down at Brighton, had ascertained all the facts; I wrote and told Brant to accept—the lease was executed about a month afterwards—all I want is to have my rent paid—there was no rent to be paid to me in November—the rent was to commence at the half-quarter, but the lease on the quarter day, the 25th—I signed a lease, saying no rent should be due till March, but </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188902040152"/>
               <p> there was a preliminary agreement—according to the lease the first rent was due on 1st March, 1889, but the half-quarter's rent was due on 25th December, because they had possession—I had to pay £8 15s. to Messrs. Thorpe and Street for giving up the chapel to them on 11th November—I thought they would be good tenants, and allowed them to do anything they wished; I should not have allowed them to make alterations if they had not had a lease.</p>

Perkins"—my signature as attesting witness was upon Manning's instructions—he said, "Fisher, you may as well sign this—I objected to it at the time—he said, "It is all right; you know it is all right; any responsibility I will take myself "—I believe that was at Clement's Inn, before I went to Morgan—I swear it—I went to Morgan's to complete, to give the document to Mr. Manning, when he arrived from Brighton—Mr. Morgan gave me the document a few days previously out of his safe, and I said, "It is already signed with the exception of the name and the amount, the consideration, being filled in"—the endorsement is my writing—it was not signed on the 20th, but before that, and attested—it was signed by me under pressure from Mr. Manning—it must be a forgery perpetrated by Manning—the interlineation was written at Mr. Morgan's office, I believe by me—I cannot say at what part of the interview, Manning—asked me to write it in—I saw the money paid over to Manning, I did not see Jolliffe then—I was not present when Manning paid Jolliffe the money—I do not remember receiving any instructions from Jolliffe about the premises—I identified "G. Perkins" as one of Jolliffe's names—that struck me as odd—I only asked about it when Manning asked me to attest it—Manning went down to Brighton a good deal after that—the letter of 5th October is my writing—Manning told me to write it—I knew it was a reference given to Debenham, who was Manning—I knew it was a tissue of lies, and that it was to be put forward to a prospective landlord—Coghlan's letter is his writing, I believe—I have seen Rimell's writing on business letters coming from him two or three times, as Manning told me on some occasions to write Rimell's name—Manning wrote his letters to Rimell—I saw the envelopes and addresses only; I posted them—Rimell's brother was Manning's or Silburn's client—Rimell did not reside at Green Lanes, Penge—I do not know where he lived—this address is "F. G. Rimell, Green Lanes, Penge"—I believe that is his hand—the letter from 17, Commercial Road, Blackfriars, of 8th December, is my writing disguised—Terry was present—Manning said, "Fisher, disguise your hand"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "I do not want the writing to be known," and I wrote the letter from his dictation—I left them at 210, Strand—I knew</p>

               <p>Maxwell and Terry were one person—the letter says he was my tenant—that was a lie—I knew it; I Knew it was to be given to a landlord and the object of its being disguised—I did not see Perkins in October—under Manning's instructions I wrote this letter of 15th October from 210, Strand, "Mr. Manning has left our office. He merely attended at Mr. Morgan's office to receive the money which we have handed to Mr. Perkins, who was well known at "Walker's Court and the Marlborough Street Police-court in connection with an assault"—that is not true—there was no call-book at 210, Strand—no books were kept there. <hi rend="italic">This letter was to Pigott, Hart, and Co., referring them to "Mr. Perkins' solicitor" for evidence of title on paying costs, and signed "Debenham and Co.</hi>")—that was a tissue of lies, and I knew it—I left 210, Strand on 10th October, but I used to go morning and evening for 4s. or 5s. a week—this letter of 6th April, 1888 was signed "Rimell" by Manning, and is my writing—I wrote it by Manning's instructions—when I said Manning never went as Rimell I had forgotten that; there were so many things I did for Manning and so many names it is almost impossible to remember.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Bishop, a signalman, of 88, Kosher Road, Stratford—on 28th November I met the prisoner when I was looking for work—she told me a pitiful story about her husband having left her, and I took her to my lodging—she said she was looking for work; she had food in her pocket, and I gave her some tea—on the 29th she came again at 8.30 a.m., and we went out about 8.40, and walked about till 11.30—I then asked her to come home with me—she consented, and while I stood talking to a person I know, I saw the prisoner go into my house, and when I got in she was in the passage—she followed me upstairs—she then said she had to go to West Ham, and was to come back in an hour and have dinner with me—I was there the rest of the day, but she never came back, and I missed a pair of boots two days afterwards, worth 7s., which I saw safe the morning she came, on the top of a cupboard—I am the only lodger in the house; the landlady lives downstairs.</p>

                  </hi>. Mrs. Bishop lodges with me—on 29th November, between twelve and one o'clock, I opened the door to the prisoner—she said that Mrs. Bishop was talking, and would be there directly; I saw her talking a few doors further down—the prisoner followed me upstairs, and I went into my kitchen on the ground floor, leaving the door slightly open; I looked through and saw her going upstairs, and then I closed</p>

               <p>my kitchen door—the prisoner came downstairs quietly, and I saw her pass through into the yard and return and stand on the door mat—Mrs. Bishop then came in and they went upstairs together—after the prisoner left no one but Mrs. Bishop went upstairs till the Saturday two days afterwards, only my four daughters, and they did not go to Mrs. Bishop's room—I do not know when the prisoner left.</p>

From information I received, on 12th January I followed the prisoner Parker home to 8, Gray Street, Waterloo Road—on the next night, Sunday, at 6 p.m., I went there again with two constables and found the door ajar; we were in plain clothes—we all three went into a room on the ground floor and saw the two prisoners sitting side by side at a small table, on which was a saucer containing sand and these 17 florins—Bradbury was giving the finishing touches to one of the florins; he had a file in his hand—Parker held this mould; it was hot; it contained a florin in process of manufacture—I said, "Halloa, you seem busy here"—Parker's spectacles fell off, and he said, "Good God, we are done; you have got us fair, there is no use saying any thing; you can have what there is"—they were secured, and I saw Sergeant Grogan find five finished half-crowns and some partly finished, in some water—two files were on the table, and a broken piece of the mould bearing the impress of a half-crown—this ladle, containing molten metal, was on the fire, and there was a lot of molten metal and plaster of Paris in the cinders—they were taken to the station, and the charge was read over of manufacturing counterfeit silver coin—Parker said, "How can you charge me with making silver counterfeit coin when there is no silver in them?"</p>

               <p>I tried to get a piece to bring away, but they were too small—I also found in the ashes a lot of droppings from metal—there was a coke fire and a ladle over it, which I took off—I said, "Where is the battery and acid?"—he said, "I don't want any battery; there is platinum in them," pointing, to the coins—I took this antimony off the mantelpiece.</p>

I am inspector of counterfeit coin—this is part of a double mould for a half-crown and florin; it has base metal in it—the florin has the get on—this coin, which Bradbury dropped, is bad, and here are sixteen others all counterfeit, and all from this mould—this ladle contains molten metal—platinum is a very expensive metal—none of these coins have been in a battery—here are two pieces of bismuth; that is not expensive—bismuth and antimony can be used in the manufacture of counterfeit coin—plaster of Paris is used to make the moulds with, and this piece of glass to make them on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Parker's Defense.</hi> I admit that I made them, but not for uttering. 1 was employed by a man named Stanley, to make them with the distinct understanding that they were to be used as dummies by professional gamblers on racecourses to deceive the public as to how much money they possessed. Each was to be stamped with an advertisement of a refreshment booth on a racecourse. I went out to buy some fuel, met Bradbury, and showed him the two coins stamped with the advertisement, and asked him to stop till I had finished, and we would have some drink together. About a quarter to six a woman came and said that her husband had sent for the two coins which were stamped, and asked me not to go out till her husband came. I then saw that it was a trap laid for me by Stanley. I did everything openly. I could have thrown the coins into the fire. He took the stamps away that I should not be able to prove my innocence.</p>

I am a licensed victualler, of the Queen's Head public-house, Charlotte Street, Blackfriars Road—in August, before the 13th, the prisoner, whom I knew, came and asked me to cash a cheque for £10 4s., drawn by the Hull Tallow Refining Company, on Pearce's Banking Company—I paid it in, and it was returned marked "Refer to drawer"—shortly after I saw Hallett; I told him I had had the cheque returned; he said he would see to it; and the next day he brought me another cheque for £10 4s., drawn by Jones, on Kurtz and Co., in favour of Hallett—I gave him the first cheque back—I paid the second in and it was returned—I told the prisoner about it—he said he would see to it—I cashed another cheque for £2—I received both cheques back, marked "Refer to drawer"—after that I saw the prisoner and told him the cheques were returned, and he said he would see about it—I did not see him again for some time—on 5th December I wrote him this letter <hi rend="italic">This expressed surprise at not hearing from him about the cheques, and said he found R. M. Jones, and Kurtz and Co. were one and the same, and that the prisoner knew at the time the cheques were drawn there was no money at the bank to meet them; that unless he had a satisfactory explanation by Friday he should hand the cheques to his solicitor, as he found other people in the neighbourhood had had unpaid cheques</hi>)—I got no answer—I next heard that the prisoner was in custody—after that a man named Dawson called, and in December a woman, giving the name of Mrs. Jones, called with Dawson, and paid me £12 4s., and I gave the cheques up—I have never seen Dawson in the prisoner's company.</p>

               <p>£8 10s. in cash, and I must take a bill for the balance—looking on the cheque as a cash payment, I agreed to do it—he was very anxious the advertisements should appear next morning (Saturday), and they did appear—I paid the cheque into my bankers (<hi rend="italic">Dated August</hi> 31<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, 1888, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> £20, <hi rend="italic">on the Yorkshire Banking Company, Limited, Hull, in favour of Hallett, and purported to be signed by the Hull Portland Cement Company, Limited, by two directors and the secretary, and crossed</hi>)—I should not have touched the matter unless I had looked on that cheque as equivalent to cash—on the Monday or Tuesday the prisoner called with a man named Margison, who I believe was a vendor in connection with the company, and he informed me that in consequence of some articles having appeared in a newspaper, the manager of a bank at Hull was very much annoyed, and he feared the cheque would come back—I said it would be sent back to me later in the day if it were so—at that time a number of advertisements had appeared—the cheque did come back—the prisoner had already given me this bill for £25 for the balance <hi rend="italic">Dated London, August</hi> 30, 1888 <hi rend="italic">for</hi> £25, <hi rend="italic">value received, on the Hull Portland Cement Company, Limited, endorsed R. Hallett, accepted, payable at Messrs, Williams, Deacon and Co.</hi>)—it would be due 3rd December; it was dishonoured—I did not get one shilling of the £8 in cash, so that I got nothing—I was responsible for the advertisements, and I had to pay upwards of £400,. which is absolutely lost—I wrote to the prisoner and to the directors of the company, but I never got a farthing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took a bill drawn on and accepted by the Hull Port land Cement Company and a cheque drawn by them—I knew nothing of the prisoner beforehand; I gave him the credit—I was doing the work for him—I should have sent every bill to him, not to the company—he said he was promoter of the company—I think Margison first told me he had reason to believe the cheque would be dishonoured; the prisoner was with him—he left it to my option as to withdrawing some of the advertisements—he did not ask me to do so; he said I could do as I liked—the advertisements were to be inserted for some time—he gave the order on Friday, and he called on Saturday, when the advertisements first appeared—I could have stopped them on Wednesday in London—they were to appear on five or six consecutive days—I could not stop them for Monday or Tuesday—I could have stopped them all after Wednesday, but some of them were at a contract price, and the price would have been raised—I could have stopped some on terms, not very easily—Hallett's statement about the cheque rather impaired my faith in his credit—I should not have given him any more credit—I did give him no more credit—I took Margi son's promise—I did not trust Margison entirely after that—I did trust the Hull Portland Cement Company—I paid for these advertisements, some by cash and some by credit; they were all good papers—I did not write to the prisoner asking him to change the list of papers he had selected, because some he had selected would not insert the advertisements without cash—I wrote to him, not to that effect—a year or two ago I had to make a compromise with some newspapers—I paid 5s. in the £—not one paper refused to put these advertisements in; I think one paper did not like the character of the advertisement—there is not a news paper in the kingdom that will not speak in the highest terms of me—I have only failed twice; I had unfortunately to make an arrangement in</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Duke of Gloster public-house, Gurney Street, Newington—I know the prisoner as a customer—on October 17th he brought me this cheque for £5, which I cashed—he came again on Sunday, October 19th, with another for £5, which I cashed—he said he was connected with a Yorkshire cement company—on the Monday I paid the cheques into the London and County Bank—they were returned marked "Refer to drawer"—I went to Hallett's and had a conversation with his wife—a Mr. Dawson came in with the prisoner—Mr. Benjamin White afterwards handed me £5, and I returned the first cheque—the signatures on the cheques were the same—I found there were a number of these cheques floating about, and I communicated with the police on December 12th, and the prisoner was apprehended—he had told me he managed the accounts of the Hull Portland Cement Company, and I inferred he was the London manager—I had instructed Mr. White to call on him for the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner said the first cheque was for work done—he did not tell me he was going to Hull to pay bills into the bank—from then my negotiations were conducted through Mr. White.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor's clerk, of Salisbury Buildings, Walworth—Mr. Dawe spoke to me about two cheques, in consequence of which I went to 52, Nelson Square—I saw prisoner's wife on the first occasion, and himself on the second—I said to him, "Those two cheques which you passed to Mr. Dawe have been returned dishonoured, how can you explain the matter?"—"Oh," he said, "I expected they would come back, there was no money there when they were drawn; it will be all right, I don't want to do old Dawe"—the wife said, "All right, pa and Jones are one, they are managers of this company between them; the company is theirs practically, that will be all right"—the prisoner said, "I will call round and see you about that"—he called one evening on Mr. Dawe with a Mr. Dawson—as Mr. Dawe had left the matter to me, he said, "We have come to see you about those cheques"—I said, "Yes?'—he said, "We are going to pay £2 10s. on account"I said, "You cannot do that"—Mr. Dawe said to Mr. Dawson, "Who are you?"—the prisoner said, "This is one of the principal shareholders of the company"—he then said he would pay £5—I saw Mr. Dawe on that, and he refused—after some haggling I agreed to give up one of the cheques, and did so—Dawson took it from Hallett, ripped a piece off, lighted, burnt it, and trod on it—they said they would come on Monday and bring the other—they did not come, and I went to see Hallett again—I said, "You have not turned up with that money; it will be a serious matter with you"—he said, "Oh, Dawe can <hi rend="italic">fly</hi> for his money, you tell him to go and b——r himself, and you can do the same."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was acting for Mr. James Dawe—I am a solicitor's clerk—I am entitled to do business for myself—I charge 5 per cent., sometimes a little more—we threatened the prisoner with prosecution in default of payment till we found other cheques were floating about, not up to the arrest—I drew up the information for Mr. Dawe, who swore it—I did not write to the prisoner, demanding payment—I have never written to Mr. Hallett or anybody connected with this case—I write letters when necessary, as anyone may, provided they do not write as a solicitor, and are not charging for the letters, but I am not going to put myself within the law—I told Mr. Dawson that Fenn was my employer, and that he was not employing me in this business, and he was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Yorkshire Banking Company—the Hull Portland Cement Company opened an account on 16th July, of which this is a certified copy—the last operation was October 3rd, when there was 2s. 5d. credit—the account was not then formally closed—the cheques produced, A, B, D, E and G, were presented at the bank—they are marked by our officials, "Refer to drawer," etc.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper at 42, Essex Street, Strand—in August, 1888, Hallett (coming with a Mr. Emerson) took a room on the third floor at 4s. 3d. a week—in the room were two office tables, chairs, a copying press, and iron safe, a copying book, and a company's seal under lock and key—the first name on the door was "The Hull Tallow Refining Company"—that remained four or five weeks, when under it was placed "The Hull Portland Cement Company"—I remember two meetings there—it is a small office—I have seen Hallett there several times, and Emerson—Jones, used to come there—I believe Kurtz was Jones—brokers were put in on 20th November—the furniture went—the seal was left—I cleaned the office for 2s. a week—they owe me 10s.—I last saw Hallett there on the 4th December—he came for letters—the police came on 21st December—I went in the mornings and evenings—sometimes five or six letters came in a day; some days there were none—no one attended regularly—an office-boy was in charge part of the time—Hallett and Emerson I have often seen—there were no books—I gave up possession of everything in the office to the police—an amount was paid in advance when the office was taken—Hallett said he wanted the office to receive letters for the companies—there were a great number of callers after they left respecting the companies.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed as clerk by R. M. Jones, trading as Kurtz and Co., at 18, New Bridge Street, in May, 1888—the prisoner was a fellow-clerk—he was there when I went—I believe Jones was a company promoter—he promoted the Hull Tallow Refining Company and the Hull Portland Cement Company—no real banking business was carried on to my knowledge—one of the directors, Emerson, used to come—I did not know Mr. Kurtz—no bankers' books were kept, no till, or customers—I know no one having an account there—the prisoner was there, except one or two absences in Hull—there were two rooms—I know Hallett's writing—all the cheques produced are endorsed by him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known cheques paid frequently—they were orders on Kurtz and Co. for sums to be paid—Jones had stamps he used, with "Kurtz and Co., Bankers," on them; printed forms—I have been paid my wages by the cheques—one was honoured; another was dishonoured.</p>

               <p>which I have gone through—the only book was a diary with entries from May 31st to October 23rd—they all relate to legal proceedings taken against the two companies in every kind of court—there were letters of inquiry about the company, and writs, dishonoured promissory notes, a summons in the City of London Court, and dishonoured cheques—I found 30 cheques on Hills and Sons, and 42 cheques on Messrs. Frederick Kurtz and Co., of 18, New Bridge Street—all the cheques on Kurtz and Co. purport to be signed by Jones—I also found prospectuses and share certificates of the companies—in one prospectus Hallett appears as a director, and Kurtz and Co. as brokers.</p>
