            , the Prisoner, was very officious in bringing him home, and he was as ready to take him away, and carried off the body, coffin and shroud, all together.</p>
               <p>Mary Hill. I spoke to an old woman, who had an empty house, to let me put the body there, and she gave me leave, and I sent it there. I was sitting upon my husband's coffin *, and I heard somebody open the door, and I was frightened; there were five men came in, who said they came from my brother, and wanted to take him away; and as they were taking him away the coffin burst open, and the candle went out, and one of them said, d - n the woman, is she mad, that she cannot light the candle!</p>
               <p>* Francis Hill, who was convicted last Session for a Burglary.</p>
               <p>Q. What woman was that?</p>
               <p>Hill. One that I got to sit along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner do any thing?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes. When the coffin burst open the Prisoner knocked his hand down upon the lid of the coffin, and then took it away and put it into a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Prisoner is the person?</p>
               <p>Hill. I do not know very well, he has changed his dress, [Mrs. Hill looked earnestly at him] but now I know that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Hill. Between ten and eleven at night.</p>
               <p>N. B. Those Trials with this mark + shew that the Prisoners were indicted for Capital Offences, and must have received Sentence of Death if the Jury had found them guilty of the whole Indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him by the candlelight?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes, and I saw him before that, because<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174804200003"/> he helped to bring him from the unfortunate place. I jumped out of the door, and hung by the coach as long as I could, to the bottom of Long-Acre, at last I dropped down dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoner assist in putting the coffin into the coach?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wright. I know the Prisoner very well. All that this unfortunate man desired was, as he was a dying man, that I would see his body buried, for he hoped he had made his peace with the Almighty: I promised him I would, and the Prisoner came, in order to take his body away and Stevens's * together, (there were two bodies in the cart, and there was a great mob, and one of them said it was Frank Hill the silversmith) and the Prisoner and some others desired to have the body of Hill, and somebody said, Have you got any thing to bury him with? and they said yes; so they got the body from the surgeons, and would have brought him home to my door, but I did not think that proper; and the Prisoner, Walker, stood at the door where they brought the body, and they threw the body down off the mens shoulders; and I said to the Prisoner, I will take away the body, but I cannot take it away just now, and I went to get a room to put him in; and I said I could not stay to see him stripped, but when they had stripped him, I would give them any thing for their trouble; and I went and bought a coffin, and sent it, and the Prisoner at the bar came to me, and said, G - d d - n his eyes, he had stripped him, and nailed him up in his coffin. I sent to the house where the body was carried, and the woman sent me word, that some men had taken my brother away; I said she was a base woman to let any body take the coffin away. Mr. Thrift had nothing for executing him.) Mrs. Thrift came to my house, and said she heard my brother was sold to a surgeon, that his head was off, and that a woman, that sells cats and dogs meat, told her so; I went to the surgeon's, and enquired after the body, and desired to know where it was.</p>
               <p>* Stevens was convicted with him for the same fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the surgeon?</p>
               <p>Wright. Mr. Champante. I went with Mrs. Thrift to his house; he did not care at first to own that he had it, but at last we went into a room, and there I saw the body lying upon the lid of the coffin with his head off. I asked for the clothes, and he said there were no clothes upon it, and that there was only the shroud; Mrs. Thrift said, if there was nothing but that he might keep it. I took up Walker, and he said he sold him for a guinea, three shillings for a coach, and half a crown to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What, do you mean for the coffin, shroud and body together?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was at Tyburn, or at the place of execution, any otherwise than running down from my work.</p>

            , and we trapanned him about the buttons. I got a warrant and went to his lodging, and he said, what do you come about the buttons? for they sold pewter buttons for silver; I said no, I came to him upon another account, I came about the coffin and shroud, and I said there must be more concerned; he confessed to me the taking the body, coffin and shroud together, and that he sold it to Mr. Champante, a surgeon in Hart-street, and he would have been an evidence. I did not care to go to the surgeon's myself, they know me so well, so my wife went there with Mrs. Hill.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Champante. There were four strange men came into my surgery, and asked me if I would buy a body which was executed that day; I told them, if they would bring it privately about eleven o'clock at night, I would gratify them for it, and I never saw any of the persons since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner one of them?</p>
               <p>Champante. I cannot swear it, my Lord. I gave a guinea to one of the four men, but I do not know that I saw the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wright. My Lord, I desire he may be asked, whether he did not own that the Prisoner was one of the men, and that he had them of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say so to any Person?</p>
               <p>Champante. No, my Lord, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wright. It is ill manners to break in upon the court; but I went to see Mr. Champante; I spoke to the maid, and said I wanted to speak to Mr. Champante, and she said at seven o'clock my master will be at home. I went and saw Mr. Champante, I told him my business, and that I had taken up the Prisoner, and would prosecute him; I said, must I give you a Subpoena, or will you come freely? he said I will come; and Mr. Champante said that he knew Walker the Prisoner, and that he paid the guinea to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever declare to Mr. Wright or Mrs. Wright, or any body, that you knew the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Champante. No; and I do not know the Prisoner at the bar. When the four men came and offered me the body, I said if they would come privately at eleven o'clock at night, I would give them so much money for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to the Prosecutor. What house was this body taken out of?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wright. I do not know the house; I was told it was an empty house, and that I might put the body into it; that the landlady lived in May Fair, and that I need not be afraid of any thing; for I was willing to have leave, that I might not come into any trouble about it.</p>
               <p>Jury. I should be glad to know who provided this room that the body was put into.</p>
               <p>Mary Hill. I did; it was an old empty house ready to fall down; Mr. Wright said he would pay for it, because I was not able.</p>

               <p>Clarke. A person came and acquainted me with it.</p>

               <p>Q. How came it that you did not hear in twelve months time whether he was married or not?</p>
               <p>Clarke. He had lodged two years in the neighbourhood, and I heard he was a man of a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Where about in Drury-Lane was this?</p>
               <p>Underwood. Just against the playhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what did they do to you?</p>

               <p>Q. What did you say to them?</p>
               <p>Underwood. Nothing: I went out of the house when they had robbed me, and they all run out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have them again?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I went to the watchouse, and the constable and watchmen took them.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the tall woman enticed you into the house, what did she say to you?</p>
               <p>Underwood. She asked me to give her a dram.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you go there;</p>

             was brought to the watch-house by one of the watchmen, (I was out of the watch-house then) and when I came in this man told me he had been robbed in an alley by three women, but he did not know the name of the alley, and he said he had spent eighteen pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the watch?</p>
               <p>Barnard. No. I found the came in the house; this is the cane. When I went to the house, a man said he was going to bed, but with some solicitations the door was opened, and I found only one man in the house: I was told the landlady was gone to the Fox: I observed a closer, opened the door, and there I found Fitzsimmonds and Margaret Hill shut up in the closet.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner. Is that cane yours?</p>

               <p>Barnard. I found the cane in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do further to you?</p>
               <p>Underwood. One of them had got a club in her hand and threatened to knock me down, then she threw me * down upon the bed, and took my watch from me.</p>

               <p>Q. How much did you spend?</p>
               <p>Underwood. They charged me eighteen pence.</p>

               <p>Underwood. It was a sort of punch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink it?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I did not call for any, but they charged me eighteen pence, and stopped me afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any criminal conversation with them?</p>
               <p>Underwood. No; I only kissed them, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was not above ten minutes in the house, were they all in the room all the while you was there?</p>

               <p>Davies. I had a guinea in gold, and five shillings in silver, and they were for getting into my breeches-pocket as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them?</p>
               <p>Davies. I can't tell which; the candle went out, and I went down stairs, and I could not find my way out, and the old woman lighted me out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Davies. I lost two handkerchiefs, a guinea, and a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the Prisoners took them?</p>
               <p>Davies. Either of the two, I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you had?</p>
               <p>Davies. I had twenty nine shillings and four pence halfpeny.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both in the room when you lost your money?</p>
               <p>Davies. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie down in any house?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174804200008"/>Davies. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie down in the first house?</p>
               <p>Davies. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put your hand in your pocket when you came out of the first house?</p>
               <p>Davies. I don't know?</p>
               <p>Prisoner Scott. I have nothing to say. I am a hard working woman.</p>
               <p>Pris. Atkins. I was going to my mother's, and the young woman was going home; Mr. Davies asked me where I was going, and I said, I was going towards Tower-Hill, and he was very much in liquor, and asked me to go into a house on Tower-Hill; I told him, I did not know any house of that kind, for I am not used to any such thing, and he pulled and hauled me into the house, and forced me to go up stairs, and threw me down upon the bed by main force.</p>

            . About the 11th of October last I took a publickhouse, and Mr. Crossfield, who lived in the house before, recommended the Prisoner to me for a <rs id="t17480420-11-deflabel74" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Was the money locked up?</p>
               <p>Finch. Always; and no body had the key but my wife or myself. I went into my bedchamber, and opened a box where my money was, and counted it; it was tied up in a green silk purse, there was 20 l. in the little end of the purse, and thirty guineas in the wallet end, and I missed part of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you miss?</p>
               <p>Finch. Upwards of twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss this?</p>
               <p>Finch. The 24th of March, or a day or two before. This servant was to have gone away before, but agreed to stay two or three days longer, and on the 23d she went. My wife said, she was sure that Judith had got the money; I said, Judith, I have lost a great deal of money at different times, and I believe you have got it; said she, why do you suspect me? I said, you have had a great deal of money lately, and that is the reason; she said it was remitted to her from Ireland by her uncle, to one Dr. Ryley: I went to Dr. Ryley, and told him I had lost a great deal of money lately, and that I believed the Prisoner had robbed me, and hoped he would endeavour to help me to it: I told him, that the Prisoner said her uncle had sent her some money, and that she said it was remitted to him; he said she was a very wicked woman, for it was false. She was taken the 26th of March, and there was found in a trunk, that was left at Mr. Crossfield's, a great many clothes and things that were superfluous. On the 28th day of the month, when she was in New Prison, she confessed that she had taken out of my box, which was in my bedchamber, at different times, to the amount of twenty eight pounds, and that she opened it with a false key; and there were some of her keys that would open my box better than mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he ever saw me wrong him of a farthing in his life?</p>
               <p>Finch. No, my Lord, if I had, I would have prevented it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I behave like an honest servant while I was with you?</p>
               <p>Finch. I am afraid not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she live with you?</p>
               <p>Finch. About five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all the money you lost?</p>
               <p>Finch. No, my Lord, I believe I have lost one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Crossfield. The Prisoner lived with me about six months, and I recommended her to Mr. Finch, thinking her to be a very honest woman, and I told her she should be welcome to be at my house, and have her victuals and drink: she left a box at my house, and there were a great many things in it, and some keys were found at my house, and there were some things found in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174804200011"/> her box, which I believe she took from me. She said she took at different times out of Mr. Finch's box 28 l. she brought to me 22 s. 6 d. which she said was a present from her uncle, in order to pay her passage to Ireland; she said it was remitted to a gentleman here.</p>
               <p>[The money was produced.]</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same money you had of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Crossfield. I cannot say it is exactly the same money.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her uncle in Ireland?</p>
               <p>Crossfield. She said he was a Romish priest.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this money delivered to you?</p>
               <p>Crossfield. The day after she came from Mr. Finch. It was observed that it could not be the money that she delivered to me, because that was 22 l. 6 d: and there was in the bag 22 l. 1 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I give you three guineas, which I received for wages.</p>
               <p>Crossfield. I believe that was the first money I received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rigg. I was present at Kentish Town when the box was opened, and the Prisoner confessed in New-Prison that she took to the amount of 28 l. at different times, out of Mr. Finch's box in his bedchamber.</p>

               <p>Q. What was there in it?</p>
               <p>Stanniford. Four shillings and two pence three farthings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a bag of halfpence?</p>
               <p>Stanniford. Yes. I believe there was 6 d. in silver. I said somebody must know something of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174804200012"/> it, and I mentioned it to the company then there; and Mr. Middleton offered to stand search. My brother came to Mr. Middleton, hit his hand against his pocket and heard something gingle, and he said here it is, and he took it out of his pocket. Mr. Middleton said he did it in a joke, and desired for the sake of his wife and child, that I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cupboard locked?</p>
               <p>Stanniford. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it?</p>
               <p>Stanniford. In the bar backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the money in it as it was when you left it?</p>
               <p>Stanniford. It is the same money as it was taken out of his pocket?</p>

               <p>Q. What did he go for?</p>
               <p>Stanniford. I believe he went to the little-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was your brother gone up stairs?</p>
               <p>Stanniford. I believe about four or five minutes. I called my brother down to give change to somebody for a pint of beer; when he came down, he went to the bar to give change for a shilling, and missed the money; and the Prisoner gave my brother a shilling to change, and my brother said, the cupboard was broke open: and he said, he would have them all searched, and the Prisoner offered to stand search, and said, what did I mean by questioning such a person as him? so I went and struck my hand against his pocket, and I heard the halfpence gingle, and took the bag out of his pocket, and I said, I have a mind to strike it down your throat, only it would be wasting it upon you.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Stanniford. Because he was more ready to strip and be searched than the rest; and he said, he took it out of a joke off the bar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you see me take it off the bar?</p>

I was tired, and when I went up to bed, I missed the tankard. I asked the maid where it was, and she knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Slade. About half an hour after eleven, and the tankard was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there in the house besides?</p>
               <p>Slade. There were two young men that lodge in the house, but they were fast asleep, and after the Prisoner was gone, I waked them, and bid them go up to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a poor man there?</p>
               <p>Slade. Yes, but he went away; the Prisoner was left in the house by himself, except the two young men that lodge there.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were two women there?</p>
               <p>Slade. Yes, but they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you saw the tankard in your house after the two women were gone?</p>
               <p>Slade. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of it?</p>
               <p>Slade. Yes, I am sure of it, for the tankard was behind the Prisoner's arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it since?</p>
               <p>Slade. No, the Prisoner's wife has mobbed me and my wife about it, and said I had found it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take it out of the house?</p>
               <p>Slade. I did not see him take it out of the house to be sure, I only took him up on suspicion.</p>

            , who was servant to Mrs. Phillips, and he told him, friend, you must go no further; Duggin said, he was ordered to do it to prevent mischief; and he said, you shall not go any further; and then they drew their swords, from whence proceeded this mischief; Captain Dawson received a mortal wound, and died upon the spot. This gentleman, Mr. Laverick, fell at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174804200017"/> same time, but it will be enquired into, whether this was a real fall or a feigned fall; and this Mr. Priswick, if he had not been pushing this affair on, he would have endeavoured to prevent it. This is the evidence we shall endeavour to lay before the Court in this case : Some put it upon the fashionable, but not legal doctrine of duelling. In Lord Hale's History of the Crown it is laid down beyond all doubt, as clear law, and determined, that if A and B fall out, and presently take their weapons and go out and fight, and death ensues, it is not Murder but Homicide; but if there is deliberation, and they go the next day, then it is Murder*. And if these facts come out as I believe they will (for I should be sorry to urge any thing against them that is hard) I believe the Court will be of opinion that this is murder; and if they are proved, I shall be very sorry for these gentlemen.</p>
               <p>*The case of Ferrers and the case of Morgan were cited.</p>
               <p>Second Coun. for the Crown. May it please your Lordship and gentlemen of the Jury, the offence with which the Prisoners at the bar stand charged is the greatest offence that can be committed, for the lives of men ought to be very much taken care of, and those who are guilty of these crimes, are to receive conviction and punishment according to law: And gentlemen, you are to go between the law and the Prisoners, and if you find the facts proved, then it lies before you to find them guilty. Gentlemen, this is an Indictment against the Prisoners at the bar for murder, but they are distinguished in the Indictment: Mr. Laverick is indicted for the murder of Capt. Dawson, and the other is charged with being aiding and assisting in this duel, which occasioned this murder; but in the law there are no accessaries in murder, they are all principals, and if you find them guilty of the facts, this is wilful murder in both. Gentlemen, the law makes the killing of a man homicide, but there are different species of killing; if one man kills another under some circumstances, it would be hard to find that man guilty of murder : The law makes an allowance for human passions, we are but men, and as men we have the frailties of human nature: And the law makes an excuse for human frailties; but if a man is in a passion, and has time to cool, and kills another, then the law says he is guilty of murder, and there is no excuse, it is an evidence of malice; then the question is, whether in this case there is this excuse that the law allows? And gentlemen, there are some facts which I will mention very briefly: Mr. Laverick and the deceased met in a coffeehouse, some words, if not blows, passed, and they went out and came in again, and seemed very good friends; and then it was agreed that they should meet and fight: Mr. Laverick declared that he had received a challenge from Dawson, and that they were to fight the next morning, and they did meet the next morning. Gentlemen, they had all this time to cool, and Mr. Priswick had an opportunity of doing a good office, and following the laws of his country; for when Mr. Laverick was told he was to fight, he said he had no sword, Mr. Priswick offered him his sword, and Mr. Laverick said this sword will not do, it will only cut and slash, and he was forced to provide another. There was one Mrs. P hillips, and it was a praise worthy thing in her, she did endeavour to prevent this mischief; she might have had them put under arrest, but the hurry of her spirits and the weakness of her sex did not permit her to do it, but she sent her servant after them, and he followed them; and they went to the back side of Montague House, drew their swords, shook hands, and put up their swords again; they went further on, and then their swords were drawn again, and the deceased dropped down dead. Gentlemen, these are the facts, and, under my Lord's direction, if these facts do appear, and that this was after a whole night's consideration, and of so many hours standing; I say, if they appear to be guilty of that fact, they are guilty of murder. There is another consideration, which I am sorry to mention to you, that this gentleman, Mr. Priswick, appears here as indicted for murder, and perhaps attended with these circumstances, which greatly aggravates the crime; for in order to promote this, he said your honour is at stake; and perhaps, if the law takes place in this case, it may get the better of this mistaken notion of honour : As to Mr. Priswick, I wish I was not under a necessity of saying what I am going to say, for if he is guilty of this, he is guilty of twice the fault that Mr. Laverick is; he had not the same bias upon his mind as to this quarrel, he was a stranger to the quarrel, and when Mr. Priswick came to the coffeehouse, and was told that Captain Dawson and Mr. Laverick were to fight the next morning, he should have softened and mitigated the affair about this false notion of honour; and when Mr. Laverick said he had no sword, he took out his sword, and said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174804200018"/> here is mine. Gentlemen, I would not aggravate any thing, only it will come out in evidence, that he lay with Mr. Laverick that night, and went with him to the coffeehouse the next morning; he might then have prevented it; and when Mrs. Phillips's man followed them, in order to prevent their quarrelling, he said you shall not follow us; and when he offered to be Mr. Laverick's second, Mr. Laverick said, Mr. Dawson has no second, and I will not have any. Gentlemen, I shall leave this to your consideration; if under these circumstances you shall think that Mr. Laverick is guilty of wilful murder, and that Mr. Priswick was aiding and assisting him, you will find them both guilty.</p>

               <p>Duggin. Capt. Dawson said he had been used very ill; he had some bruises in his face, and he said he had them at Mrs. Darkin's; it is a coffee-house in Tavistock-Row.</p>
               <p>Q. When by Mrs. Phillips's direction you followed them, where did Dawson go?</p>
               <p>Duggin. He went to a cutler's just by Pall Mall, and changed his sword, and then went to George's Coffeehouse in the Hay-Market, and staid there I believe about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come in a coach?</p>
               <p>Duggin. Mr. Laverick did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Priswick come in the coach with Mr. Laverick?</p>
               <p>Duggin. I cannot say whether he did or did not; I saw them all three come out of the coffeehouse, and they went into a coach, which carried them to the end of Russel-street, and they discharged the coach there; then they went down Southampton-Row into the fields, and walked to the back of Montague-House, close to the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see first?</p>
               <p>Duggin. Mr. Laverick turned to the wall and took Mr. Dawson by the hand, and I thought they were friends?</p>
               <p>Q. How were their swords?</p>
               <p>Duggin. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say?</p>
               <p>Duggin. I do not know; I was not near enough to hear what they said, but Mr. Dawson put up his sword.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were their swords at the time of their shaking hands?</p>
               <p>Duggin. They were not in their hands, I believe they were upon the ground; but I saw Mr. Dawson put up his sword, and they shook hands, and they all three walked towards Tottenham-Court, and then they went further into the fields : After they had got some way into the fields Mr. Priswick came back, and he said I should not follow them, and then I said, I hope the consequence of this will not be bad, and Mr. Priswick said he would do all he could to prevent any Mischief; and he said to me, the thing was either made up, or was likely to be made up, and afterwards I saw their swords drawn, and they were pushing at one another.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Priswick go up to them directly?</p>
               <p>Duggin. Their swords were drawn before he got up to them. I saw Mr. Priswick make all the hast he could up to them, and I think he did endeavour to break their passes, and I saw no thrust made after that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before they both fell?</p>
               <p>Duggin. A very little time : I was in hopes the thing was all over, and soon after I saw Mr. Dawson fall; and when I came up both Dawson and Laverick were down: Mr. Priswick was in a good deal of confusion; I said to him, do you take care of Capt. Dawson, and I will go and fetch a coach, but before I came back he was dead. I desired Mr. Priswick to examine Mr. Dawson's pockets, and there was a letter sent to Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174804200019"/> Darkin, desiring them to come to him at the Swan at Tottenham-Court.</p>
               <p>The cross examination.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. You say Capt. Laverick was down?</p>
               <p>Duggin. Yes, and Mr. Priswick said, Laverick stand up. This was after they both fell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he assist Capt. Dawson?</p>
               <p>Duggin. He went up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you approaching nearer to them when they shook hands?</p>
               <p>Duggin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who offered his hand first?</p>
               <p>Duggin. Mr. Laverick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any animosity then?</p>
               <p>Duggin. No; then they walked on together.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from them when Mr. Priswick came to you?</p>
               <p>Duggin. About three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do all that was in his power to prevent it?</p>
               <p>Duggin. Yes; and when he came up to them he endeavoured to break their guards.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you, whether he did not endeavour to come up to them as soon as he could?</p>
               <p>Duggin. He did, he run as fast as he could to prevent it.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you believe that wound was given before he got up to them?</p>
               <p>Duggin. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Mr. Priswick was in a good deal of confusion, do not you think he would have done Mr. Dawson all the service he could under these melancholy circumstances?</p>
               <p>Duggin. I believe he would.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw them shake hands and put up their swords and walk on, would not the walk they took have carried them to the Swan?</p>
               <p>Duggin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing that Mr. Laverick said after Mr. Dawson was dead?</p>
               <p>Duggin. No: I was gone for a coach.</p>
               <p>Jury. You said Mr. Priswick endeavoured to break their guards; did he strike either of their swords down?</p>
               <p>Duggin. I was so far off that I could not see what sword he struck, or whether he struck either of them.</p>

               <p>Squires. On the 13th of April between twelve and one, I saw four men go before me into the third field from <placeName id="t17480420-22-crimeloc140">Montague-House</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17480420-22-crimeloc140" type="placeName" value="Montague-House"/>

               <p>Q. When you first saw them there, were they pretty nigh together, or at a distance?</p>
               <p>Squires. The two first were pretty nigh together.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were all the four together when you first saw them?</p>
               <p>Squires. I think they were; I saw Mr. Priswick turn back to speak to Mr. Duggin, and presently Priswick turned back to go to Dawson and Laverick. Mr. Johnson was with me, and I said to him, there is a duel going to be fought, and we both run, and Mr. Priswick run as fast as he could, and then the two gentlemen were engaged, and had made two or three pushes, and Mr. Priswick waved his hand for us to come up, and Mr. Priswick struck down their guards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where Captain Dawson received his wound?</p>
               <p>Squires. It was on the right side under his pap, and if Duggin had told us at first that they were going to fight a duel, I believe we might have been up before they could have fought.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Dawson live after he received the Wound?</p>
               <p>Squires. I believe from first to last it was a quarter of an hour; they were both down, and Laverick went to Dawson and said, dear Dawson, speak. The Person that was along with me was up before I was, and he said, speak, if you can, but I could not perceive that he spoke at all, and he died in my arms. He said three times, oh, or oh dear, or something like that; we told Mr. Priswick he was dying, and he said, he hoped not, and he ordered Duggin to go for a surgeon and coach, but before he returned, Dawson died.</p>

               <p>The cross examination.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. How long do you think they might continue fighting before Dawson fell?</p>
               <p>Squires. I really can't tell how long, I believe about a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. And did Priswick do all he could to get up to them?</p>
               <p>Squires. He run as fast as he could, and he did all he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what Laverick said after Dawson fell?</p>
               <p>Squires. I said he was dying, and Laverick and Priswick both said, they hoped not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Priswick strike down their guards immediately after he got up to them?</p>
               <p>Squires. He endeavoured to strike down their guards; I said to Mr. Johnson, there is a duel, and then I said to Duggin, there is a duel I believe; there is, said he; do you know them, said I; yes, said he; I know them all three.</p>

            ; the first time I saw him in England was, when the quarrel happened.</p>
               <p>Coun. for the Crown. When was that?</p>
               <p>Waddington. On Tuesday the 5th of April, at Brown's coffee-house, in Covent-Garden; Mr. Laverick came in and spoke to Mrs. Brown, and said something that I did not hear, and turned and went out again; and when he came in again, Dawson said he was a man of more honour, than to cast reflections upon a gentleman, and not to maintain it; and Dawson said to Laverick, I gave you my sword to defend yourself, but you would not, I desire you would never be seen in my company hereafter; upon that, Laverick called Dawson a silly puppy, or something like that; upon that Dawson took his sword in his hand in the scabbard, and struck him on the head with it, and cut his head with the hilt, and they had a little struggle, but we separated them, and there was no challenge that night; I put Mr. Dawson into a chair immediately, and sent him home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Captain Dawson a quiet man, or otherwise?</p>
               <p>Waddington. I never knew him in any quarrel, though I was with him all the campaign; he was always reckoned a very good natured man.</p>

             on the account of cowardice?</p>
               <p>Waddington. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Capt. Dawson struck him on the head on account of calling him puppy, did not Capt. Laverick bear this quietly, or did he then express any inclination to quarrel, or to take a challenge?</p>
               <p>Waddington. There were a few words passed. and I saw Laverick five days afterwards, and he had no thoughts of fighting, for he said he had not heard any thing from Dawson, so he thought it was all over.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think Capt. Laverick had any inclination to it?</p>
               <p>Waddington. I believe he had not, at that time, any inclination to fight on the account of that thing; for if Laverick had any inclination to call Dawson to an account, he would have done it before five days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mr. Dawson always reckoned a man of very nice honour?</p>
               <p>Waddington. Yes, and so they ought to be.</p>
               <p>Q. But there is a difference between honour here and honour in the field?</p>
               <p>Waddington. There is so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any resentment after this affront from Capt. Laverick to Capt. Dawson?</p>
               <p>Waddington. He did not talk of any resentment, after Dawson was sent away in the chair.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Darkin Sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Dawson?</p>
               <p>Darkin. Yes, I have known him a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you keep a coffeehouse in Tavistock-Row, Covent-Garden.</p>
               <p>Darkin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Laverick lain there?</p>
               <p>Darkin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect whether there was not a quarrel there?</p>
               <p>Darkin. Yes there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an account of it to my Lord and the Jury.</p>
               <p>Darkin. On Monday the fifth of April -</p>
               <p>Q. to Capt. Waddington. Was this on Monday or Tuesday?</p>

               <p>The Trial of Mr. Laverick and Mr. Priswick continued, from Page 140.</p>
               <p>Darkin. ON Tuesday the fifth of April, at night, the two Prisoners at the bar, Mr. Dawson, Mrs. Phillips, and me, were at the Crown Tavern on Ludgate Hill, and we came home about eleven or twelve at night; Mrs. Phillips and Mr. Dawson went out, and Mr. Dawson came in with his sword in his hand, and said, Laverick is a rascal and a scoundrel, but I have broke his head, and that is enough for me. About quarter of an hour afterwards Mr. Laverick came in with a black eye, and his head cut down, and Laverick said, Dawson has broke my head when I am drunk, but I will break his when I am sober; and I never heard him mention it to Mr. Dawson afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you mean before the next quarrel?</p>
               <p>Darkin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the day before the duel?</p>
               <p>Darkin. Yes, I was at the play, and my servant sent for me from the play.</p>
               <p>Jury. What day of the month was this?</p>
               <p>Darkin. Tuesday, the 12th of April, Mr. Laverick went from my house to the play, and came to my house again; when I came from the play no body was there at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Well then, who came in first?</p>
               <p>Darkin. As I was speaking to my servant in came Mr. Dawson, and he said to me, how came Laverick to say he would cane me? he is a rascal and a scoundrel; and I never heard Mr. Laverick mention his name. I said to Mr. Dawson, you may call Mr. Laverick what names you please, for I shall never trouble myself about it; and Mr. Laverick said you have used me ill before a great many gentlemen, when I was so drunk, that I was not able to defend myself, and Dawson talked of fighting; Mr. Laverick said he did not love to fight in a coffee-house, and Dawson said he would fight him now; Mr. Laverick said he had no sword, and Mr. Dawson put his sword into his hand, and said, take mine and I will get another; and Laverick took the sword and threw it out of doors, and said, you puppy, do you think I have nothing to do but to fight you? I will not fight : Upon that Mr. Dawson struck him across the head, and said, I find you will not fight, take that then. They went out of doors, and staid about a couple of minutes, and when they came in again Mr. Dawson said to Mr. Laverick, Sir, remember you are to meet me at twelve o'clock to-morrow at George's coffeehouse, and Mr. Laverick said he would; and Mr. Dawson said, if he did not come according to promise, he would post him for a rascal and a scoundrel; then Mr. Dawson went out immediately. Mr. Priswick came in between twelve and one o'clock, and went up stairs into the company where Mr. Laverick was, and Mr. Laverick said to Mr. Priswick, Dawson has challenged me to fight, and Priswick said he would go with him and be his second; Mr. Laverick said there is no occasion for that, for I do not know that Mr. Dawson has a second; Mr. Laverick said, I believe we shall only frighten one another, we shall not fight, for you lost my sword two days ago, and Mr. Priswick said you shall have my sword; Mr. Laverick took it in his hand, and said he would not have it for all the world, for it is cut and thrust.</p>

               <p>Coun. for the crown. Did you know Captain Dawson?</p>
               <p>White. Yes, I have known him about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>White. I am servant to Mrs. Darkin.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this matter?</p>
               <p>White. Last Tuesday was sev'night, after I was in bed, Mr. Dawson came into Mrs. Darkin's coffee-house about ten o'clock at night, and asked for that scoundrel rascal, Laverick.</p>
               <p>Q. What regiment did Mr. Laverick belong to?</p>
               <p>White. He belonged to the Old Buffs. Eliz. Jones came to me and desired me to get up, for she was afraid there was going to be some damage done; I sent away immediately to the play to my mistress; and I said to Capt. Dawson, I was sorry to see him in a passion, (for I never saw him in one before;) and he said; if I was impertinent he would kick me; and when my mistress came in from the play, Mr. Dawson asked my mistress how she could say such and such things, and he asked again where that scoundrel rascal, Laverick was, for he said, he was come with that resolution, that he should either have his life, or he would have Laverick's life; I sent to the play to desire Mr. Laverick not to come to Mrs. Darkin's, for fear there should be some further damage, but I believe the messenger did not deliver the message right, for he did come; Mr. Dawson went out and came back again before Mr. Laverick came, and Mr. Laverick asked Mr. Dawson how he did, and Mr. Dawson asked Mr. Laverick, how he could presume to say that he would cane him the first time he saw him; and Mr. Laverick said, he never said any such thing, and he did not know what he meant; and Mr. Dawson struck Mr. Laverick over the face, and there were some blows given on both sides; and Mr. Laverick said to Mr. Dawson, I have enough of this, this is usage I don't understand; upon which they both went out of the door, but what they did I can't say; and when they came back, Mr. Dawson said to Mr. Laverick, remember you are to meet me to-morrow, at twelve o'clock, at George's coffee-house, which Mr. Laverick said he would; and Mr. Laverick said he would meet Mr. Dawson if he insisted upon it. I forgot to tell you, that when they talked about fighting, Mr. Laverick said to Mr. Dawson he could not fight him, for he had never a sword,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174804200024"/> and Mr. Dawson offered to lend him his sword that night, and Mr. Laverick took it and threw it out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there when Mr. Priswick came in?</p>
               <p>White. I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when he came in?</p>
               <p>White. About half an hour after twelve: and I heard Eliz. Jones say to Mr. Priswick, that Mr. Dawson and Mr. Laverick had some words, and that there was a challenge between them, and Priswick said, by G - I am glad of it, I will go along with them. Mr. Dawson went away about eleven o'clock, and I never saw him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Priswick stay there all night?</p>
               <p>White. He lives there; Mr. Priswick boarded at our house; Mr. Laverick lives at the Blue Boar Inn, in Holbourn.</p>
               <p>Q. When they went from your house, did they go in a coach?</p>
               <p>White. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who called the coach?</p>

               <p>Q. When was Mr. Dawson at your house?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Mr. Dawson lay at my house the night before this thing happened, and told me what had happened at Brown's coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean what happened the night before he was killed, or the first night?</p>
               <p>Phillips. The first night, the fifth of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an account what you know concerning this duel.</p>
               <p>Phillips. Mr. Dawson was to have gone from my house the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. What he lodged at your house?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes; but he said he would not go till he saw whether Mr. Laverick would fight him, for he said Mr. Laverick may raise a report that I would not fight him; and Mr. Dawson said, he believed it was all over, for if Mr. Laverick had a mind to fight him, he should have heard from him before now.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know about Mr. Priswick?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Mr. Priswick came, and said, Mr. Dawson, will you go? said I, Mr. Dawson, will you go? he said he would; and I said he should not go out with Mr. Priswick, till I knew what he went for.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Mr. Priswick said to Mr. Dawson, Mr. Laverick says, if ever he meets you he will cane you; but, says Mr. Priswick, do not tell him that I told you; and he said he believed Mr. Laverick would be at Mrs. Darkin's, and said, I would have you go to see whether he will cane you or not; I said, Mr. Priswick, it is wrong in you to promote a quarrel, for Mr. Laverick knows where to find Mr. Dawson, and if he was to go to strike him again, he would be counted a quarrelsome man; says Mr. Dawson, What does that rascal say he will cane me? if he does, I shall be the first of the family that ever was caned: I persuaded him not to go out, and he said, to oblige you I will not go; and Mr. Priswick said, then you will not go, and Mr. Dawson said he would not; and Mr. Priswick said, then we will not go, and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened the night before the duel was fought?</p>
               <p>Phillips. The night before the duel Mr. Dawson went out about ten and came home about twelve; and he said he had been at Darkin's, and that he had knocked Laverick down; and he said, I am very well satisfied, for I have received satisfaction enough. By this I thought the thing was all over, and Dawson lay at my house that night, and ordered his servant to be with him at nine o'clock, and he went out very unconcerned the next morning; I bid my man go out and follow him, and come and tell me where he went.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you sent your servant to see where he went, had you any apprehension of any damage?</p>
               <p>Phillips. No, none at all; I asked where he was going, and he said he would not tell me; and as he had ordered his man to come at nine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174804200025"/> o'clock in the morning, I thought he was going from my house. I never saw Mr. Dawson in such spirits in my life, as he had when he went out.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. When Priswick said, upon your interposition, then we will not go, did Mr. Dawson seem pleased or displeased?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the same account before the Coroner's Jury as you do now.</p>
               <p>Phillips. I think I gave the same account as I do now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sledger, surgeon, sworn.</p>
               <p>Coun. for the Crown. I suppose you examined the wound, give an account what you observed.</p>
               <p>Sledge. On Wednesday the 13th of April a person came to me, and desired I would go along with him, for there was a duel, and they were both wounded, and he believed one would be dead before I got there; I went to Mr. Laverick first, his coat was unbuttoned, and the breast of his shirt was bloody, and he desired me to go to the other gentleman first and dress him, for he wanted me more than he did; and he asked how Mr. Dawson did, I told him he was dead, and Mr. Laverick said, Is he dead that I loved so much? I found there was a necessity of opening Mr. Laverick's wound, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Laverick say any thing to Mr. Priswick?</p>
               <p>Sledge. He said, I believe you might have prevented this unhappy accident, if you had said something in the coach, which neither of us could do, and Mr. Priswick said, what could I do?</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Sledge. I apprehend it was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect whether there was any thing else said by Mr. Laverick as if he blamed Mr. Priswick?</p>
               <p>Sledge. Mr. Laverick said to Mr. Priswick, if you had come up when I received my wound, in all probability Dawson would have been alive, and you might have prevented this unhappy accident; and Mr Priswick said, what could one man do between two men with swords?</p>
               <p>The cross examination.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. You say, Mr. Laverick was so tender of Mr. Dawson, that he would not let you dress his wound first, but would have you go to Mr. Dawson and assist him.</p>
               <p>Sledge. Yes; and when I told him Mr. Dawson was dead, he expressed a concern, and said, Is he dead that I loved so well?</p>
               <p>Q. And was not he much concerned about it?</p>
               <p>Sledge. He always was all the time I attended him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mr. Priswick as much concerned?</p>
               <p>Sledge. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a person be wounded while he is fighting, and not be sensible of it immediately?</p>
               <p>Sledge. Yes, unless it goes into the cavity, and then it may be some time before it is discovered.</p>

               <p>Q. Give an account of what you know of this affair.</p>
               <p>Johnson. When I came first into the field, I saw three gentlemen come from Southampton-Row, and went by the Duke of Bedford's Wall towards Montague House, and then I saw these three gentlemen go towards Tottenham-Court, and they got into the third field; and one of them turned back to a man that followed them, and the other two went on, and he that came on spoke to that man.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were the two gentlemen, when they drew their swords, from the other gentleman?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I believe about one hundred or one hundred and fifty yards; and when they had drawn their swords Mr. Priswick made a beck to me with his hand, and run towards them himself; but I apprehend that one of the gentlemen was wounded before he or I got up, and when Mr. Priswick got up to them they were both down, and when they were up, went immediately to fighting again; and Mr. Priswick endeavoured to beat their swords down with his right hand, and took their swords out of their hands; Mr. Dawson fell down backwards, Mr. Priswick went to speak to Dawson, and I said I believed he was dying, and he said Oh! or O dear! Mr. Priswick left Mr. Dawson, and went to assist Mr. Laverick; Mr. Laverick went to Mr. Dawson, and said, for God's sake, Dawson, speak, and I said I believed the gentleman would never speak any more; and then a surgeon was sent for.</p>

               <p>Pris. Coun. Has his behaviour been as a quarrelsome person?</p>
               <p>Senhouse. No, far from it: My first acquaintance with him was when he was a school-boy, and since he has come to man's estate I never heard any thing against him; I have very often been in his company, and found him to be a very peaceable man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Barlow. I was some time at school with him in Yorkshire, and he always was a quiet good natured lad. I have seen him a little inclinable to liquor, but he was always peaceable, and never inclinable to quarrel, or promote quarrels, but quite the reverse.</p>

               <p>The council for the crown replied, that he was unwilling to reply in a case of this nature, but only to do his duty to his client, and in regard to the publick, that he did not doubt but his lordship would call this murder in the eye of the law. For only give this the name of a duel, and then according to the wild notion of people. men may get off with impunity : that he spoke it with deference to the court, that if two persons quarrel on a sudden, and their blood is up, and one kills the other, it is not murder, but homicide, or manslaughter; but if there was time for them to cool and recollect, and one kills the other, then he must take the punishment which the law inflicts upon murder; and if Mr. Priswick was aiding and assisting in this, he is equally guilty with the other; and that it is murder, and left it to the consideration of his lordship and the jury, what part Mr. Priswick has taken in this affair.</p>

            , is indicted upon an act of parliament made in the nineteenth year of his present Majesty, and which the legislature were forced to make; and the occasion of this was, a set of lawless people setting the government at defiance, and putting the people in danger of their lives; this being carried to a great height, and all the means that were used to support it proving ineffectual, the legislature made an act, whereby it is enacted, that after the 24th of June, 1746, if any persons, to the number of three or more, armed with fire-arms, shall assemble themselves together, in order to be aiding and assisting in running, landing, and carrying away uncustomed goods, they shall be guilty of felony, without benefit of the clergy; and there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174804200028"/> was another necessary provision in this act; (this practice was got to such a height, that the magistrates dared not to put the laws in execution) and it is enacted, that the offenders may be tried in other countries, that the magistrates and other juries might not be afraid of putting the laws in execution. The Prisoner at the bar, as you will hear from the witnesses, has made himself extremely famous in this way; there is a gang called the Hawkhurst gang, which have been a terror to the neighbourhood, and he has been the principal leader in this gang. This is an offence committed on the 13th of August, 1746, and it will be proved to you, that he, together with several others, to the number of eight, nine, or ten, armed with carbines, and other offensive weapons, went to the sea-side and landed tea, which they put into oil-skin bags, and put them over the horses backs in canvas bags; and this is their constant way of running this tea; but tea legally brought, is never brought in these sort of bags, and the witnesses could not possibly mistake the Prisoner; he was so very well known in that country, and they saw him leading and driving fourteen or fifteen horses. Here are several witnesses to these facts, which cannot be contradicted, and I believe it will appear to you, that it is very happy that he is likely to be brought to justice. Call

               <p>Pelham. Between four and five in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he appear?</p>
               <p>Pelham. The Prisoner was armed with a blunderbuss or a carbine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he pistols?</p>
               <p>Pelham. I did not see any pistols, but holsters I saw.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you see them do?</p>
               <p>Pelham. I saw them load the horses with casks and oil-skin bags.</p>
               <p>Q. How many horses might they lead?</p>
               <p>Pelham. I believe there might be fourteen or fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you was not curious enough to examine what was in the oil-skin bags?</p>
               <p>Pelham. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was in those bags?</p>
               <p>Pelham. Tea. That is the way of running tea.</p>

               <p>Pelham. Uncustomed brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. What place did they go to afterwards?</p>
               <p>Pelham. I saw the Prisoner and them going all together towards Lyd.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Prisoner was there?</p>
               <p>Pelham. I am certain he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any vessel along the shore?</p>

               <p>Q. What size was the vessel of?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go by the vessel before these goods were put on shore?</p>
               <p>Pehlam. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what goods there were on shore then?</p>
               <p>Pelham. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the goods before they were put upon the horses backs?</p>
               <p>Pelham. I saw the goods both before and after they were put upon the horses backs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live in Kent?</p>
               <p>Pelham. Yes; I was born and bred there.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the general package of these goods?</p>
               <p>Pelham. In oil-skin bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say what was in these bags from your own inspection?</p>
               <p>Pelham. I was not near enough to see that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these fourteen or fifteen horses all drove or rode upon?</p>
               <p>Pelham. Some were rode on and some were drove.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any goods taken out of the vessel?</p>
               <p>Pelham. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. on cross examination. How near was you to the place where you saw these goods loading?</p>
               <p>Pelham. About twenty rods.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say the Prisoner was among them?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174804200029"/>Pelham. Yes, because the Prisoner rode by me as near as I am to that gentleman. [meaning my Lord Chief Justice.]</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner armed?</p>
               <p>Pelham. They were all armed.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that this was on the 13th of August?</p>
               <p>Pelham. Because when we sell our fish, we set down the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you your book here?</p>
               <p>Pelham. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you always make memorandums when you go a fishing?</p>
               <p>Pelham. Yes, and this was the last day I went a fishing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any memorandum of seeing the Prisoner in this act that you speak of?</p>
               <p>Pelham. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason of your remembering this then?</p>
               <p>Pelham. Because it was the last day I went a fishing.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discover this?</p>
               <p>Pelham. Last Sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not do this before?</p>
               <p>Pelham. I did not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know this before. How came you to keep this a secret for a year and a half? did not you think it your duty to give an account of this to a Magistrate as soon you knew it?</p>
               <p>Pelham. Yes, but I had no opportunity, for I could not get any body to take my information.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you set down every time you go a fishing, or only the last day?</p>
               <p>Pelham. Every day.</p>
               <p>Sol. Gen. Have you any doubt of your seeing the Prisoner when you saw this gang?</p>
               <p>Pelham. I am very certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was usual, in this year 1746, for people to go directly to a Magistrate, and give an information?</p>
               <p>Pelham. No, if they did, they would have enough to do.</p>
               <p>Q. How many gangs have you seen?</p>
               <p>Pelham. Forty to be sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What clothes had I on?</p>
               <p>Pelham. Such a frock as you have now; I cannot say it was exactly the same colour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have not wore a frock these five years. What wig had I on?</p>
               <p>Pelham. A light wig.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You never saw me there.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you come to know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Haddon. I lived a servant at the George Inn in Lyd.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you mention any particular time when you saw the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Haddon. Yes; on the 13th of August, 1746, I saw him with seven or eight more, and there were fourteen or fifteen horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the horses loaded?</p>
               <p>Haddon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take them to be loaded with?</p>
               <p>Haddon. With tea and brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you take it to be so?</p>
               <p>Haddon. Because it was the way they used to bring the tea and brandy; I have helped them down with it many a time?</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner armed?</p>
               <p>Haddon. He had a blunderbuss on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the year was this?</p>
               <p>Haddon. I was driving a load of corn in a team, and was forced to go out of the way for them, and I think they went farther into the country.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you are always very civil to them, and give them the way?</p>
               <p>Haddon. We are forced to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Haddon. Between six and seven in the morning, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the first or the last time of carrying in corn that year?</p>
               <p>Haddon. The first time.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Lyd from the shore?</p>

            , otherwise Rowlin, otherwise Rowling, is, and stands convicted and attainted of felony*. And this the Attorney General for our said Lord the King is willing to aver and testify, and therefore desires the court to award execution against the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>* See the act of the 19th of his present Majesty to prevent smuggling.</p>
               <p>The several issues contained in this suggestion, the Prisoner has denied, and thereupon issue is joined; and you are to try these issues between our Sovereign Lord the King, and the Prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>King's coun. May it please your lordship, and gentlemen of the jury. There was an act of parliament made in the 19th year of his present Majesty, to prevent this pernicious practice of smuggling; and besides the provisions made by several clauses in this act, there is another provision which was thought necessary by the legislature to be made, which was, attainting them if they did not surrender; for every man was afraid of giving an information against them, because he was in danger, his family in danger, and his effects in danger, and no justice of the peace was willing to take an information; and therefore there was a method to be thought of, whether it could not be done in any other part of the kingdom; and therefore it was enacted, that an information might be made before any of his majesty's justices of the peace for any other county; and the legislature has thought fit to attaint them if they do not comply with the terms specified<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174804200031"/> in this act. Gentlemen, you have nothing to do whether the Prisoner is guilty of this offence, you are only to try whether he is guilty of the several facts stated by the Attorney General; therefore I will state to you those material facts, and you are to try whether those facts are proved.</p>
               <p>The first fact is, that he was on the 13th day of July, charged on oath before

Gentlemen, these things are incumbent on the part of the Crown to prove, and it must be proved that these things were done. And there is a negative to be proved, that the Prisoner did not surrender himself within the forty days, and if he did surrender himself within the forty days, it is incumbent on him to prove it; and if these things which I have suggested to you are proved, you will find the issues for the King; the Prisoner denies all these facts, and therefore we shall endeavour to prove them.

               <p>Sharpe. On the 7th of August, 1747, the Duke of Newcastle laid this before his Majesty in council.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend then?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes; and the King then made an order in council, for all those persons, who are mentioned in that order, to surrender themselves within forty days after the publication of this order in the London Gazette.</p>
               <p>The order made by the King in council on the 7th of August was read.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this order being sent to the printer of the London Gazette?</p>

               <p>Smith. Yes, and I went on the 19th to Leostoff.</p>

               <p>Smith. On a Wednesday; and about eleven o'clock in the forenoon I read the proclamation at the market-place, where all proclamations are read, and nailed it up at the cross, where all proclamations are nailed up. And I read it at Beccles, on the 22d of August, on a market-day.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day?</p>
               <p>Smith. A few minutes after one.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you nail it up?</p>

               <p>Tisted. I am sure they are true copies.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. My Lord, the Prisoner is not the person intended in the information of Sealy, and we are ready to prove it.</p>
               <p>King's Coun. If they can prove there is any other Rowland of Ipswich, butcher, that may alter the case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kelly said, that Sealy had declared, and said he was willing to make an affidavit that he never did make any information against the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you get this Sealy here?</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. My Lord, we could not get him.</p>
               <p>Jury. As this is an extraordinary case, we desire to know whether it should not be proved, that this is the man meant in the order published in the Gazette.</p>
               <p>King's Coun. The Prisoner, before execution is awarded, may shew that he is not the same person, and then the council for the King are to prove that he is.</p>
               <p>Jury. Our doubt is, whether it ought not to be proved, that this is the man that was meant in the information, or whether he is to prove that he is not?</p>

               <p>Cohen. On the 29th of February, when I opened the Synagogue, I found the key of a closet in which we put several things, and when I opened the door, I found that the poor's box was broke open, and the money taken out; I sent for a smith to open the door of the altar, and there is a cupboard under the altar, and there were some particular things in that, which we only use on particular days, which were taken away; there was the covering of the law, the altar vails, and five pair of bells, which we put on to our laws at particular times.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain yourself what you mean by the laws.</p>
               <p>Cohen. The five books of Moses, which are wrote on parchment, and rolled up on two sticks. I went to Mr. Symons our elder, and he ordered me to call our vestry together between four and five in the afternoon. I had a suspicion of

            , because the goods that were stole were carried out of a window which looks into his yard, and there was a cane found, which there is great reason to suspect was the Prisoner's. Our vestry sent for me, we got a search-warrant, and I went and searched his house, but found nothing; they sent me to fetch those things belonging to the Synagogue, and there was a board of the floor broke open, and when the board was taken up I saw all my things there, and I carried them to our elder of the Synagogue; they were in the Prisoner's house up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>The five pair of bells, the altar vails, and the covering of the law, were produced in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What are these bells called?</p>
               <p>Cohen. They are called Aaron's Bells.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you use this covering upon all days?</p>
               <p>Cohen. We use these things in holiday-time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find all the things in the same place under the floor?</p>
               <p>Cohen. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And was, you told to break open the board of the floor?</p>
               <p>Cohen. No, other people did it; but when it was broke, I found all my things.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to get this information where the things were?</p>
               <p>Cohen. I don't know, but I do suppose the Prisoner had confessed at the vestry where the things were.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find your money, did you?</p>
               <p>Cohen. No, my lord.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know of this affair?</p>

               <p>Q. How long was it after you missed them, before they were found?</p>
               <p>Levi. I went to my Lord Mayor about two or three o'clock in the afternoon for a search warrant, and I searched the Prisoner's house, and there were some ropes which we pull the windows of the synagogue to with, in the Prisoner's garret, but I could not find any thing else; I searched two or three other houses, and while I was gone to search them, a cane was found in the womens gallery in the synagogue, (this is the cane.) I went to the Prisoner's house again, and he told me, his son was writing at a desk above stairs. I staid in the house two or three hours, and some of the gentlemen who were sitting at the vestry, came and bid me go up and move the table, and they took up a board.</p>

               <p>Q. What did they bid you go for?</p>
               <p>Levi. They bid me go up and stay till they sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect any one person more than another?</p>
               <p>Levi. Mr. Polock found some little sparks of gold in the window, as if these things had been drawn out at the window.</p>
               <p>Laz. Symon. The clerk of our Synagogue came and told me, that it was broke open, and he said, for God's sake, Sir, let me have a warrant to go and search the house of a person that I have a suspicion of; we got a search warrant, and there were some ropes found in the Prisoner's garret, that did belong to the synagogue; I desired our clerk to call several of the members together, who belong to the vestry, to consult what was to be be done. We sent to the Prisoner's house, with a message for him to come to us, and when he came, we told him, we have a strong suspicion, that you are the person that has robbed the synagogue, and desired that he would make a confession, but he would not at first; we asked him when he went to the synagogue, and he said, at eight o'clock: and others said, they saw him at half an hour after seven; he desired the company to withdraw, and then he did confess the fact; that he lay concealed in the synagogue all night, and had taken the things and hid them under the floor: and that he did expect a reward would be offered for them, and then he did design to produce them; and we sent Levi the sexton to the Prisoner's house, and bid him not stir from the place till he had orders to go; Mr. Solomon was there, and he can give you a better account of this.</p>

            . On Monday the 29th of Feb. I was informed that the synagogue was robbed, and was desired to attend the vestry, and they told me, there were some pieces of rope found in the Prisoner's house that belonged to the synagogue. I desired that the Prisoner might be sent for to the vestry, and he came, and stood out in it for about half an hour, that he knew nothing of it; we told him, we had evidence enough against him, without any thing else; he desired the company to withdraw, and then confessed the fact, and said, that poverty had brought him to it; that he had concealed himself in the synagogue all night, and had taken the things away, and carried them to his house, and that they were put under the boards of the floor where his son was writing; we ordered the floor to be broke open, and under this place where the table stood, these things were found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I always had a good character, and can have one from dukes and noblemen, but I hope God will stand my friend; I was lately come from Germany, and was in great distress. I found these things in the yard, and carried them to my house, and concealed them there, thinking that a reward would be offered for them, and then I did design to produce them</p>

            . I am gate-keeper at Aldgate, and have been twenty years, and I always make it my business to stop people that I think suspicious. On the 25th of March, the night the fire was, after I had been several hours at the fire, with my Lord Mayor, I went to my watch house at Aldgate, and just under the gateway, about five o'clock, I saw the Prisoner coming along with a bundle; I asked him what he had got, he seemed a little surprized, and desired I would let him go; I asked him where he had them, he said, he had been at the fire, and the people were throwing their books out of the windows into the street, and that a man gave them to him; (they were very wet and dirty) and said, for God's sake take them away, and carry them to the owner; he said he was a gardener, and had been a fallading at Newgate-Market.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found them in the channel, in Leadenhall-street, and there were a great many more, and a strange man gave them to me, and desired me to carry them away.</p>

About a quarter after three, I was at my stand, and heard something wrench, and I saw the Prisoner wrenching something off from the post, and the Prisoner run into a court and concealed himself; I went to my stand, and in about a quarter of an hour I heard something tinkle again; I asked him what he did there, and he said, he worked there; I took hold of his handkerchief, and that broke, and he got away, but I secured him: the iron-rail was wrenched from the post, and the nails drawn, but was not taken from the other rails.</p>

            . I am a brasier in Wood-street. I had a search-warrant about the copper, and that discovered this affair; this piece was cut by a smith to deface it, and it was brought to me quite hot, and I knew it to be stole. I found these four fellows at an alehouse called the Twopenny house, in Chick-Lane; it is called so, because they sell strong beer for two pence a quart; they buy their malt at six shillings a quarter. When the Prisoners were before Justice Hole, he asked them what they had to say, and they said they had nothing to say, for he knew too much already.</p>
