                  </hi>. I am clerk and manager to Arthur William Ellis, of the Chemical Works, Millwall—they are the premises of Messrs. Simpson and Payne—Mr. Ellis is a contractor—he contracts to make sul phate of ammonia and Prussian blue—on 6th November, about 12 o'clock in the day, a boy brought me a message, in consequence of which I went to the gate of the factory and there saw Colleman; I had never seen him before—he asked me if I left off at 12 o'clock—I said "No, not till 1"—he said "Are you Mr. Pallett,?"—I said "Yes"—he said he had been down to my father's at Woodford a few evenings ago, that he was speaking to him on a little matter, and he should like to have a little private conversation with me, and asked if I could appoint a place to meet him at 1 o'clock, which I did at the Anchor and Hope, Millwall—I went there at 1 o'clock—and found Colleman outside; we then walked on towards Limehouse—he asked me if Mr. Ellis had a patent for the manufacture of ammonia—I said I believed he had—he asked me if water was used with the ammonia; I said I did not know—he said he wanted the information for some French<lb/>men, and asked me if it was sold in a powder or liquid—I said in a powder—he said he would pay me for the information if I gave it to him—I said "You are asking me these questions, and I don't know who or what you are, and if I answer them I shall get myself into great trouble"—he asked me if I remembered a foreigner named Alexander being at the works about two years ago—I said I did not, as I had not been there so long—when I spoke about getting into trouble he said that he was a sworn interpreter and any thing I should tell him could not possibly be heard of by anyone again—he asked me some further questions about the Prussian blue; he asked me if Mr. Ellis made colours—I said yes he made several colours—he said "Any blue?"—I said yes, I had seen Mr. Ellis experimenting with blue—he asked me if it was sold in the powder or the liquid, and who were the buyers—I said I did not know—he then gave me half a crown and this card. (<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi> F. Colleman, interpreter, 3, Great Queen Street, Westmins<lb/>ter.") He had a small piece of paper in his hands when he was talking to me, nothing else; no pencil—about ten minutes afterwards he asked me the different ingredients that were used to manufacture blue—I said I could not tell him, as Mr. Ellis was so dose when he was experimenting that I could not possibly see them; he always put it down in a book that he kept for the purpose—he then asked me if I could possibly get hold of that book, and if I could take it to him he would take me to the Frenchmen and I should have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said "I don't think I can, as Mr. Ellis generally keeps it locked up"—he then asked me to get a copy of it, to copy it out and take it up to him—I said I would and an appoint<lb/>ment was made for me to take it there on the following Wednesday, but</p>

               <p>if I could get it before I was to write to him and let him know that I had got it; but when I wrote I was not to mention what I had got, I was to say "I have got what you want" and if there was anything farther he would write to me and let me know what what was wanted—he said I was to address him as "Dear Friend"—I asked him if he had not better get the Frenchmen to write to me—he said "They won't be d——fool enough to do that"—he gave me the address of the Frenchmen, 5, Fitzroy Square, and said if I wrote to him that would find him—that was all that was said at that interview—I made a communication to Mr. Ellis that night; I told him what had transpired—he gave me certain instructions, and on 8th November I wrote to Colleman and on 10th I received this answer—I subsequently had conversation with Colleman about it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Your letter addressed to me at 5, Fitzroy Square, has been duly handed to me.

The Frenchmen are not so free in parting with their money as to give you 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that"—I said I did not mean 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for what I had got, that I wanted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the index, before they had the index, and for two or three samples that I had, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more when I had got the copy of the book—he said they would not give so much as that, that he had spoken to his governor Mr. Smith, and Mr. Smith said that if they were gentlemen they ought to give me at least two guineas—I said two guineas would not pay me for the risk and trouble 1 was running, but I would take 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "Very well, I will tell them what you want"—he then took me to 5, Fitzroy Square; we went by omnibus—the door was opened by a female—Colle<lb/>man asked if Mr. Louis was in—she said no, but his nephew was—he said "He will do"—she then turned round and said "Oh here is Mr. Louis," and I then saw the prisoner Louis—Colleman said something to him in French, which I did not understand, and he bowed to me; I expect to in<lb/>troduce me—we then went into a billiard room there and waited there while they played a game—Louis then took me and Colleman up three flights of stairs to a room with a bed in it—I there saw Chavannes sitting in an easy chair—what then passed was in French—Colleman then asked me if I remembered a Mr. Alexander being at the factory about two asked years ago—I said I did not—Louis then went to the door and Alexander or Bobrownicki walked in—they were then all present—they commenced to</p>

               <p>the blue and the two liquids—they then commenced to question him about the nuke of Prussian blue, how much was made, and who were the buyers at Bradford, in Yorkshire, and also about the ten gallons of columb water—Rogers said he could not answer them in that way, he could not get at the different ingredients used without consulting Mr. Ellis' book—Bobrounicki then asked him in English if he could get Mr. Ellis' book—Rogers said he did not think he could as Mr. Ellis kept it locked up—Bobrownicki told him if he got that book and took it up to him on Wednesday night he would give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-Bobrow<lb/>nicki gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on this occasion, and Rogers, Colleman, and I then went downstairs and found three policemen at the door in plain clothes and Colleman was apprehended; he said nothing—Rogers, Colle<lb/>man, and I then went into the house again and the others were taken in custody—they had a warrant—a short gentleman, not one of the prisoners, asked me to give the money back which I had received—they were re<lb/>manded from time to time and then discharged, and then this bill was found.</p>

I have been in Mr. Ellis' employ about fourteen months—he is a contractor and works for Simpson and Payne—I was not aware that Bobrownicki had a patent in respect of this matter, or that rightly or wrongly he thought that Mr. Ellis was infring<lb/>ing it—I had two interviews with Colleman on Saturday and three after<lb/>wards, two of which were at Fitzroy Square—when I was first introduced to Chavannes and Bobrownicki and Louis I promised to bring a copy of the book for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a sample of blue was also to be brought—I do not know what it was to be put into; it is a powder—I was permitted by Mr. Ellis to make a copy of the index—I don't know whether the book is in his writing—I never looked through it—what I have seen him write was in English—it is what he writes down when be makes experiments himself—I remember being examined and cross-examined before the Magistrate, Mr. Newton—Mr. Ellis was represented by a solicitor—I mentioned before the Magistrate that I heard Bobrownicki say that if Rogers got the book and took it to him on Wednesday he would give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will not swear that, but I believe I did—I have seen Mr. Froggatt, she solicitor two or three times in the matter, three times at the outside—I never heard Chavannes or Louis speak a word of English—Bobrownicki speaks very broken English—he was at one end of the table, and I, Rogers, and Colle<lb/>man at the other—I took no sample on the last occasion; the only sample I took was on the 10th.</p>

               <p>with Mr. Ellis, and in consequence of instructions from him on 20th November I went to 3, Queen Street, Westminster, with Arthur Pallett—I there saw Colleman—he asked me if I was ready to answer any questions that would be put to me by some parties to whom he was going to intro<lb/>duce me, respecting the manufacture of blue—I said "Yes"—he said he was employed by a person named Smith, of Ironmonger Lane, City, to make these inquiries on behalf of some gentlemen who were about to establish a manufactory of blue—on the way to the omnibus he asked me if I spoke French—I said no, I spoke Irish, by way of a joke—we went to 5, Fitzroy Square, to the third floor, and in a back room there I was in<lb/>troduced by Colleman to Chavannes, Louis, and a lady—Chavannes asked Colleman who I was, and Colleman said "I now introduce to you the principal workman at Mr. Ellis'" (that was said in French—I do under<lb/>stand French thoroughly) "who is competent to answer any questions that may be put to him respecting the manufacture of blue; he is well up to his work; he has not been there very long and consequently does not know any foreigners who may be employed there"—the female interpreted what I said to Mr. Chavannes, who was lying on the bed, ill with the gout—she went together with Mr. Louis to the door and then admitted Bobrownicki—he seated himself at the table, and pens and ink and paper were produced, and he began to ask me some questions about the manu<lb/>facture of blue—I tad tutored myself with a few answers to questions liable to be put to me—he asked me how many pounds of blue could be manufactured out of a thousand gallons of columb liquor—I answered "I think three-quarters of a hundred weight. I am not sure"—he then told Louis to bring him down two samples from the top of the cupboard, one contained in a glass and one in paper, and he asked me if I knew the nature of the contents—I told him that in the glass was sediment of manu<lb/>factured blue, but as to the nature of the liquid in the bottle I did not know—he asked me the names of the liquids contained in the two different bottles—there were two bottles, one containing a dark liquid; there were four samples altogether—he asked me if I knew what the liquids were composed of—I told him I could not get that answer without con<lb/>sulting Mr. Ellis' book—I first suggested the existence of the book—Bobrownicki asked me could I procure that book—I said I should have some difficulty in doing so as it was under lock and key—he said "I shall be here on Monday; can you procure the book by that time?"—I said "Yes"—he said "By what time?"—I said "By 6 o'clock on Monday evening"—I was then asked who were the purchasers of the blue and the prices Mr. Ellis sold it at, and so on—Bobrownicki asked what I wanted to procure the book and answers as to the information required, and I said 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not bring the samples with me;' Pallett did—four samples were produced to me, they had one of their own—I then went downstairs, and the prisoners were taken into custody—I was called up afterwards to in<lb/>terpret the warrant to them—Pallett introduced me to these men as the principal workman—Colleman did not.</p>

               <p>I could procure Mr. Ellis' book—I said it would be a difficult matter as I had no access to Mr. Ellis' book—I said I might perhaps obtain a copy and would endeavour to do so by Monday evening"—that meant a<lb/>copy of the information they required respecting the sale of the blue; the" prices, the principal customers, and so forth—I did not say it as put down there—when I talked about getting a copy, I intended a copy of some information not in the book; they asked me for the names of the customers, the purchasers of the blue, and the prices, and the copy I referred to there was as to that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturing chemist—I am a contractor with Messrs. Simpson and Payne under a seven years' agree<lb/>ment—I am not their foreman; here are my agreements—I have been. engaged there about ten years and a half—in April 1873 I took out certain patents for the manufacture of blue from ammoniacal liquor—these (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) are my patents—since then, in order to improve upon those patents, I have made certain researches in my business—I keep a rough experiment book which contains the results of certain experiments made subsequently to these patents—the book is in Court, in the hands of my private solicitor—it contains the results of researches extending over a considerable period and of very great value to myself—I was in the habit of using it almost daily for the purpose of consulting it and of jotting down the result of other enquiries; I kept it under lock and key, sometimes in my desk and sometimes I took it home to Woodford—Pallett was in my employ—I re<lb/>member his making certain statements to me early in November, in con<lb/>sequence of which I gave him certain instructions, and subsequently, after taking advice from my solicitor, I employed Rogers to act in concert with Pallet—neither Pallett or any other man in my employ would understand. the nature of the operations carried on by me, or be able to describe them without the aid of that book—in 1872 Bobrownicki was engaged at the works under the name of Alexander; I can't say when he left—he was there about eight months off and on—he would be aware of the existence of this book—he came there stating that he had a patent, which afterwards proved to be only a provisional patent, asking us to give him facilities at the works for practically demonstrating the value of it—he tried the patent—it utterly failed—my assistance was asked—I gave it, and his complete specification was patented through the knowledge he there ob<lb/>tained through me, which complete specification was at total variance with the provisional one—it lapsed because the stamp duty was not paid—the entries in my book had nothing whatever to do with that patent of Alexander; in the one air was used, in the other steam—Pallett, the gate-keeper, was the first who gave me information about the visit of Colleman to my place, and subsequently Pallett junior—I applied first to my private solicitor, who advised me to go to inspector Greenfield—he said it was not a matter that he could take up and recommended me to a private inquiry man—the book contains the groundwork of the patents that I am about to take out; more comprehensive patents—there are some entries in French; the rest of the book is chiefly written in English, and those parts I wish to keep secret are written in chemical symbols—I could not put a value on the book; it is one of considerable value to me—I have been paid some hundreds of pounds on these patents—it contains secrets known only to myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know a gentleman named Thomas Christie who carries on business at 155, Fenchurch Street—I do not know that in 1872 he was introduced to Bobrownicki; I have seen them in contact—I am aware that a provisional patent of Bobrownicki's in reference to the prepara<lb/>tion of ammoniacal liquid was registered in 1872—it was registered jointly in his name and Mr. Christie's—I am informed that in May, 1872, there was an arrangement between Christie and Messrs. Simpson and Payne for Simpson and Payne to work that patent—I cannot explain it—I am in the position of a contractor and, therefore, I don't know what Simpson and Payne do; all I know is from what I have heard—I was acting as con<lb/>tractor for them in 1872—I do not know of any private arrangement between Bobrownicki and Christie, by which, in consideration of Christie having advanced monies, Bobrownicki had agreed to assist in the working of that patent—I have been informed that in August, 1872, there was an arrangement by which a person named Fenner, Christie, and Messrs. Simpson and Payne were jointly to engage in working Bobrownicki's patent—I don't know it of my own personal knowledge—it was after that that Bobrownicki came to the premises and made certain experiments; that would be about June 1872, the entry in my book is the 11th—he was engaged experimenting there I should say three or four months, off and on—I was frequently ex<lb/>perimenting with him—the results of one or two of those experiments would be written down in my book—the only writing of Bobrownicki's in the book would be in reference to the first provisional specification—thereis writing of his in the book; there is the direction which I asked him in the first place, on 11th June, to give me, because I was satisfied the thing would not answer—there is the book, it will speak for itself; the pages that are gummed together I do not wish to be opened—I know nothing of Simpson and Payne, Fenner, Christie, and Webley meeting from time to time in reference to the working of this patent of Bobrownicki's—I know nothing except that I have seen Bobrowuicki, Christie, and Fenner together—sub<lb/>sequently to my indicting them for this offence I heard that certain pro<lb/>ceedings were threatened by Bobrownicki against Simpson and Payne; but I don't believe it—my patent was taken out in 1873 by Messrs. Bell, Crowder, and Greenfield—I never heard the name of Taylor, Howe, and Co.</p>

I am only a poor interpreter, and am paid for what I interpret"—I then went upstairs at 5, Fitzroy Square, and found the other three prisoners—I had the warrant read to them in French and told them they must consider themselves in custody—Chavannes was suffering. from gout, and I sent for a doctor and had him examined—I could not understand what was said, because some of it was in French, Boyle, who, understands French, will speak to that—I sent them all to the station except Chavanaes—I left him at the house in charge of a constable—at the time I took them into custody I told Bobrownicki that I wanted some papers that he had got, and he handed me some papers, and amongst them were two that had been taken to him by Pallett previously, relating to liquors—Colleman afterwards said to me that he should round on the whole lot of them, that his master was nearly as bad as the others for he had found him no counsel or bail.</p>

The real question was whether they intended per<lb/>manently to deprive the owner of the possession of the book, or whether it might not be likened to the case of a school boy surreptitiously abstracting from his master's desk a key to his lessons; could the boy in that case be charged with stealing the book? Here it appeared that what the defendants wanted was the information contained in the book, and although they adopted an improper mode of proceeding in order to obtain it, the question was whether their intention was to incite to the commission of a larceny of the book, and if not they could not be found guilty.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller of Northampton Square, Clerkenwell—on 5th August, 1875, the prisoner came to me and asked me to get him a gold watch, value about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for someone in France—I afterwards got three for him and showed them to him—it was to be a cash transac<lb/>tion—he afterwards sent me this letter, enclosing a cheque, and believing it to be worth the money I parted with the watch and chain—I also re<lb/>ceived these other letters from him, dated September 2nd, October 1st, and November 3rd, but saw nothing of him—it was not till after he was in custody on another charge that I discovered that the watch and chain had been pledged—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My brother John is a sleeping partner with me—he is not always there transacting business, but is often there—the prisoner has never bought any goods of us before—these six cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) bear my brother's endorsement, but they have nothing to do with the firm—my brother is here—I did not take proceedings between August and January owing to the false letters the prisoner sent—I sent an invoice with the watch and another by post, and I gave a receipt to the messenger who brought the cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When the prisoner selected the watch he said nothing about having credit nor did he refer to my brother at all—I did not believe the letters were true, because they contradicted each other.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been called to the Bar, and live at 14, Albert Mansions, Victoria Street—in the year 1867 I was visiting at the house of a lady in St. George's Place—the prisoner was a footman there—about a year afterwards I met him accidentally in Piccadilly—he addressed me and said he had been dismissed from the service of the lady where I had seen him as footman, that he was out of place and in want of money—I gave him something, I cannot remember what-from that time down to 1871 I saw him perhaps three times; I can't say positively, they were acci<lb/>dental meetings—I gave him other monies, altogether perhaps a little over 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not as much as 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in 1871 I was living with my mother at Rutland Gate—I was possessed of a gold watch, chain, and latch key—I wore it in my waistcoat pocket, without the chain being attached to my button hole, the watch in one pocket, and the latch key in the other—I can't say what the value of the watch was, I did not purchase it—it was worth more than ten guineas—I recollect walking from Hyde Park Corner towards the Albert Gate in the Park roadway about 11 o'clock one night in the beginning of August, 1871—I was wearing my watch as I have described—I met a soldier in the uniform of the Horse Guards Blue—he was not known to me—he made some remark to me which I answered—I do not remember what the remark was—he was only a minute in my presence—I went straight home to Rutland Gate—I found I had not my latch key with me, and 1 suspected that the watch was gone, and it was not there, the key and chain and watch were gone—I have no positive know<lb/>edge when or how they were taken from me, I had not felt them taken—I saw the prisoner two or three days after my loss; it was an accidental meeting—I told him of the loss of my watch, I thought he might be able to recover it, that he might go round to the pawnbrokers and try to recover it—I did not know the number of the watch; I could not tell him the number—I told him to make enquiries about it—I saw him again a day or two after wards—when I first met him I pointed out the man I believed to be the man I had seen that evening, who I believed to have stolen the watch, I meant the soldier—the prisoner told me he thought his name was Dale—when I saw him again he said he had been unable to find the watch at the pawnbrokers—I had described it to him—I told him I was leaving town and he said he would write to me if he heard anything of it—I did get a letter from him—I don't know what has become of it, I suppose I destroyed it—I came up to town and met him by appointment in the street, I think it was in the park—I never saw him in any house from the time I saw him as footman, down to the time when the detective Butcher was at my lodging—on meeting him he told me he thought he would be able to get the watch back for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him the money and it was arranged that he was to bring the watch to me at a certain place, I think at the South Kensington Station, some time that afternoon—he did not come, I did not see him till nearly a year after, nor hear from him—I then met</p>

               <p>him accidentally in Piccadilly—he addressed me, he gave no explanation about the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or the watch, hardly any conversation passed—I can't re<lb/>member what was said—nothing was said about the watch or the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was only a minute or two with me, I went away and went home—I do not remember anything that was said, it is nearly five years ago—I can't be certain when I next saw him, not for many months—I can't remember where it was, it was in the street accidentally—I never had any conversa<lb/>tion with him in reference to my 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or the recovery of my watch, I always avoided him afterwards—I went to reside at Albert Mansions in April, 1872—I never gave the prisoner my address—in June and July, 1872, I re<lb/>ceived two letters—I received no letter after that until the one dated 7th December—I have given the prisoner a small sum once or twice since I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when I met him by accident, and he asked me for money, when he was out of place—I gave him small sums—he had always some story about being out of place, and about getting something out of pawn—the largest sum I have given him on those representations has been perhaps 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can't say exactly the maximum amount I have given him, perhaps over 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I say I avoided him after he had the money, I mean I never spoke to him unless he spoke to me, and I only re<lb/>mained in his presence a few minutes—he followed <hi rend="italic">me</hi> about—I was not exactly alarmed at him, I endeavoured to get rid of him—I was out of town on 7th December, I returned about the 14th, and found this letter awaiting me at the St. James's Club, but it was directed to Victoria Street—I then consulted my solicitor, and afterwards addressed a letter to the address given, Nutford. Place—Sergeant Butcher was brought to my rooms at an appointed time—the prisoner came to my rooms—I held in my hand the letter I had received, and I said "Did you write this letter?"—he said "Yes"—I then said "Did, you send this letter?"—he said "Yes"—I then said "What do you want?"—he replied "Whatever you like to give me"—I said "Supposing I refuse to give you anything, what will you do then?"—I cannot remember what he said, he gave some vague answer—at that moment Butcher came into the room, he had been in the adjoin<lb/>ing room—I had never given the prisoner my address—beyond pointing out the soldier who I supposed to be the person who had accosted me I had never seen or spoken to that person afterwards—I don't remember that the prisoner ever gave me Dale's Christian name.

When we came out we got shoving each other about; one of my mates got knocked down and I was pushed over him. As I got up the first constable said I attempted to rob the man. Eight or nine of us were all larking together ten minutes before the constable came up." <hi rend="italic">Sullivan says:</hi> "I was a little the worse for drink. Seeing a mob I went up. The constable shoved me and said he would lock me up. I said I had done nothing.

I was a little in front, and turning round I saw three of our mates on the ground and the con<lb/>stables ran across the road, and one of them took me to the station. I told them I had done nothing.

I am a jeweller, and am living at the Globe Hotel, Hatton Garden—on Saturday night, 20th December, I was between Holborn and Oxford Street, where some omni-busses stand, and met the two female prisoners—Sullivan, who speaks a little French, asked me to go home with her, before doing so I went with both women to have a glass, but that was only a momentary affair, just inside the house and out again—we then went to Sullivan's lodging, which is down a turning; I don't know the name of—I went into a house with them, and into a room on the ground floor—both the women went into the room with me, and one of them locked the door, I can't say which—I then took off my clothes upon which one of them extinguished the candle and at that moment three men came in who rushed on me and robbed me of my watch and chain, which were in the left breast pocket of the coat I had taken off, and of a parcel containing jewellery—1 had put my clothes on a chair, and they were thrown down when the three men rushed in, and when I found my clothes there was nothing in them—the room door was unlocked from the outside—the men struck me; I rushed upon them—I see one of them here—I defended myself—they did not strike me, they robbed me of my things, and when I cried "Thief" and "Help" then they struck me.</p>

               <p>the 27th December, I was in the Fountain public-house in Edwin Street, Long Acre. I called for a pint of beer, and as there were some persons in there drinking, I asked the company if they had any objection to my singing them a song. They said "Not the least." I sang a song and gave a recitation, and received 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers and some whiskey, and the mad man (<hi rend="italic">the prosecutor</hi>) gave me two pieces of broken chain, and he called for a pot of ale. He followed me out and said "Will you have another?" We went to the corner of Long Acre into another public-house. He said "One more pint," and while there a gentleman came up and spoke to Mr. Buck, and then said to me "I will speak to you outside." He said "Do you know who you have got in your company?" I said "No". He said, "That man is mad." I said "You don't mean that?" I showed him the two pieces of chain, and he said "If I were you I should not keep his company. "This man's name I don't know. Mr. Buck left the house and I returned the chain and said "Here is your chain." He pulled me into the middle of the road, and the man that was with me rushed at him and the three ran into the road and the man who tried to get him from me ran away. He (Buck) made another rush at me. I stood in defence, and he then walked away. I was then accused of robbing him of his watch and chain. That is the explanation I have to give.</p>

Beaumont &amp; Compy."—I had never heard of them before—he spoke of Mr. Clarke, of Birmingham, as being connected with a highly respectable firm importing oil from Italy, and that I should have to do business with them—I said I would rather do business with Underwood; I asked him then how he. knew Underwood—he said he had been in the leather trade in Paris for about twelve years, and that Underwood was a very large buyer of the firm he was connected with in Paris—then he said I could not see Mr. Clarke as he had returned to Birmingham, and he made an appointment for me to see Messrs. Beau<lb/>mont til; Co. on the following morning and gave me the card produced—I called there the next morning and saw the prisoner and the boy (the last witness), and the prisoner said to me "Mr. Beaumont's partner is not in" I said I would return in about half an hour—I went back again and he came to meet me at the the door and said "Mr. Beaumont's partner is in," and conducted me to a desk and introduced me to a person as Beaumont's partner I had no idea that he was a brother of the prisoner's—he said the goods were considered by the person who had seen them as being inferior and high in price, and would I take a discount off the price—I said I had given the quotations as low as I could make them—I produce a letterpress copy of the invoice prices quoted amounting to 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for eighty-five and a half dozen skins—the prisoner was present—I refused to take off any discount, and said I had agreed to give the person who negotiated the sale a commis<lb/>sion of 5 per cent in the presence of the prisoner—he said "Well, in consi<lb/>deration of your giving Mr. Marchant this commission, we will not say anything about the discount and would take them at that price—he called him "Mr. Marchant," and not his brother—I said I had other goods with these, Russia goods and sheep skins for the backs of chairs which would do equally well as morocco, and to break them would be a loss—he said he knew a man who was a very large buyer of these goods and probably he could do with them, and after going into the matter and an approxima<lb/>tion of what they would be, consented to take the whole parcel at 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the terms of payment being thirty days—I wanted cash—Underwood was the person referred to as the large buyer whom he spoke of in the presence the prisoner and Ferdinand—I had taken with me a stamped bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. thinking there would be no difficulty in having the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash—he he said "We cannot afford to do it, all we get out of the transaction</p>

Beaumont's man"—I said I should much prefer having them counted, but he came back with a man and a barrow—he said he bad come for the goods, and I said I should not have time, that it was much too late to send them away, and if the goods were left there I should have them prepared and packed ready to go, he said "No," they had got packing cases of their own, and they would prepare and send them that night—he waited, having the man there, and I asked the man in the presence of the prisoner if he was Messrs. Beaumont's man, and he said he was—I have seen him since—he is the porter of Sambrook Court—the goods were taken away at about 6 o'clock in the evening—I arranged I should call on them the following morning which I did—the prisoner was there and Ferdinand came in after—Ferdinand said in the prisoner's presence that the goods had gone off to Birmingham that morning, and then we had the conversation about the bill—I wanted cash for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. acceptance"—I produced my stamped bill in blank, and he produced another stamp from his pocket, and another bill for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was drawn, and they were accepted by Ferdinaud Marchant, and were handed to me—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I got no money whatever—they were signed "E. Beaumont &amp; Co."—they came due and I never got a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—as to the commission I said to the prisoner "It is customory to give the commission when the goods are paid for, that is my experience"—he said he thought otherwise, and he was going to take a tobacconist's business in the Edgware Road—I was curious enough to ask the man's name, and he said "Johnson," and he said he wanted the money to buy the business, which he had agreed to do for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I demurred at paying—there were two silk dresses I had of which I believe he had samples—they are not in the ordinary course of my trade, but were taken on a contra account from some person, and he agreed to take them and the balance (2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) in money, which I gave him—I went to Sambrook Court about a week afterwards, when they seemed to be getting on with their business as usual—I did not see any one at first, but ultimately I saw Ferdinand Marchant—my suspicions were then aroused that my goods had been taken from me by fraud—I did not speak to the prisoner about it, though 1 saw him at the time—they wanted to get some more goods from a person in the Hackney Road—I did not speak to Ferdinand in the prisoner's presence—I met him at the entrance of the door and said I must request his address where he slept last night—I then pressed him—he refused to give it to me at first, and I said "If you do not I shall give you into the custody of a police-constable"—he then took out his pocket book and took out two envelopes, one bearing the address of "34, Mount Pleasant, Gray's Inn Lane," and the other "8, Mount Pleasant"—on the following day I applied for a warrant to issue from Old Jewry against the prisoner—I never saw Ferdinand afterwards—I went to the place of business again and found the boy there, who said they had gone away—I have been there since the boy left—I could not get in, it was shut up—when I got the address, was Friday, the 18th November—I have since had occasion to go to Paris where I saw Adrian in charge of the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">for the prosecution</hi>, Mr. Besley, on <hi rend="italic">behalf of the prisoner, contended that the indictment could not be sustained.

He was charged as a bailee of the post-office order; the order was payable to himself; no one but himself had a right to be paid by the post-office order, and the particular coins in which it was paid must have been perfectly indifferent to the sender. The case of "</hi> Reg. <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Hassall," 8, Cox, Criminal Cases, 491, <hi rend="italic">was conclusive upon this point. There was no bailment here; it was physically impossible that the prisoner could pay the specific coins handed to the postmaster by the sended of the order, he must pay it with other monies received by him upon the order in London. The order was never to be returned to the sender, it was simply an order from the postmaster in the</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">country to the postmaster in London, and when that order was obeyed by pay<lb/>ment to the payee, all was done that the bailment required. It was not a negotiable instrument, and no action would lie against the postmaster for refusal to pay any other than the payee.</hi> Mr. Cole <hi rend="italic">relied upon the case of "Reg. v.</hi> Aden," 12, Cox, Criminal Cases, 512, <hi rend="italic">which he contended was precisely on all fours with the present case. That case shewed that there was no necessity for the specific coins being received, if a man had money holding for another, it did not matter what the coins were, he would be liable under the section upon which this indictment was framed, it was a matter for the Jury whether at the time the prisoner cashed the order he intended to appropriate the money, and if so he would be guilty of larceny.</hi> The Common* Serjeant: "<hi rend="italic">This indictment consists of two counts, both counts charge the prisoner as a bailee; the first count charges him with stealing the post-office order. Now that was not a bailment to the prisoner, it was sent to him, and he was to cash it. The second count charges him as a bailee with stealing the money. The money never was the money of the sender, the money paid in at the post-office in the country was one thing, the money received in London was another; therefore on both counts the case fails in point of law, and the prisoner must be acquitted."</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a rate collector of 21, Delhi Street, Landport—I am the bother of Frederick Sanders, <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Stoke Newington, and during 1872 I had two or it may be three interviews with the defendant in connection with Mr. Sanders' affairs—I advanced to the defendant 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the purpose of paying a composition to my brother-in-law's creditors and I discounted a bill for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given by the defendant to my brother-in-law—that bill was dishonoured and noted which came to eighteenpence—it was to be paid at the second advance on the Saturday, but it was not—about 20th April, 1875, the defendant gave me the duplicate of a watch, which was pledged for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave him a receipt—I took it out, and I think I paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for interest—I paid 15 guineas altogether to get it—he did not pay one penny composition to the creditors with the ten guineas, and when I found that out I wrote and threatened him that I should take proceedings for misappropriating the money and I told him so as well—I also wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "F. W. Mophett, Esq. Sir,—I must earnestly request you to send me the amount you agreed to pay after your ex<lb/>amination, as you must be aware that money is better to me than the watch and want it pressingly, &amp;c., and I beg you to send me a cheque by Wednesday") I had threatened to summon him for misappropriating the ten guineas and he came to where I live at Stamford Hill and told me he was shortly to be married, and persuaded me not to take proceedings as it would ruin him—he asked me to come next morning, and I did so, and he gave me the ticket of what he said was his late father's watch and worth 50 guineas—I took it out and it was a new watch, worth a little more than half that—the prisoner drew up a receipt for the duplicate—I remember the form of it—it was "35, Moorgate Street, April, 1875" (I won't be certain about the date, but it was about the 20th, within three days either way) "I, A.</p>

               <p>M. <hi rend="smallCaps">DIXON</hi>, hereby acknowledge that I have this day received from Mr. F. W, Morphett the duplicate of his gold watch and chain as security for the due payment of the sum of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."(some odd shillings which I do not know)" and I undertake not to deal with the said duplicate until after the 25th of June next ensuing. A. M. Dixon"—that was made up of the ten guineas for the composition, the dishonoured bill of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was returned to me, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the noting of the bill, and as he would not allow me to redeem the watch for two months, he allowed me the pawnbroker's interest, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was on blue paper and I rather think it was ruled not quite half a sheet, or it may have been half a sheet—this receipt marked A (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is not what I gave to the defendant—there was not one word in the receipt I gave him about Messrs. Edmunds and Company's claim in com<lb/>position 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is utterly impossible that this could be my signature, though it staggered me at first—it is very easy to imitate my writing, be<lb/>cause I never take my pen off—I positively swear that it is not my signa<lb/>ture, and that there was nothing at all about Messrs. Edmunds and Co.'s claim—I was present at Guildhall when this was produced by the defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The case was before Sir J. C. Lawrence and the charge was in regard to the non-payment of Edmunds' sum of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was no committal for forgery, but we intimated that we should proceed on that charge here—Sir J. C. Lawrence did not send the case for trial for forgery, but he knew we were going to proceed—it was my own act—three or four years ago Mr. Sanders had the smallpox for about eleven months—I cannot tell you more exactly—that was the cause of our liquidation, because his house had been shut up—there was only one liquidation before the one the prisoner had to deal with—the one the prisoner had to deal with was the one caused by the smallpox—the smallpox did not last through both liqui<lb/>dations—I was a person claiming on a bill of sale on the second liquidation, or rather I claimed nothing; I gave it up in favour of the general creditors—the Registrar in Bankruptcy did not charge me with a fictitious bill of sale to my knowledge—I know that there was an appeal to the Judge, but not on that ground—I have not got the bill of sale, I believe it was torn up, of course it was <hi rend="italic">given</hi> up—I gave it up, and then I voted by proxy for the liquidation of my brother-in-law at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—that was not objected to on the ground that the bill of sale was an entire myth, it was on account of the bungling of our accountant—I do not know that if I had held the bill of sale as a secured creditor I could not vote, I am not up in these things—I do not know whether my bill of sale was to cover every atom of the stock, I know that for years I have been advancing him money—I do not know whether my bill covered all the stock, but I know it was thoroughly genuine, and that it was my own bill—I know that there were months before the matter was discussed, but 1 do not know that it was not till February, 1875, that the liquidation fell through; I have so much to do with my time and I am a long way off—the defendant gave me this receipt at Guildhall for the ten guineas (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I paid the money to him with my own hand at his office—when I pressed the prisoner to pay the ten guineas he wrote and told me that he was bankrupt, that was his answer—I do not know whether I have got the letter, I have not looked for it—I came up to Lon<lb/>don in April, 1875, and saw him at his place—he did not tell me that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was bankrupt and that as he was holding the composition money and the proceeds of the composition order he would give me security for those amounts—I received this bill, dated January 1, from my brother-in-law—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601100043"/>
               <p>got it somewhere between the date of his getting it and it being due, it is impossible for me to say now—it came into my possession, to the best of my belief, some time in February, and I gave cash to my brother-in-law for it—I paid it to a spirit merchant at Southsea, and it was returned to me not many days afterwards—it was brought back directly it was refused; if I look at it I dare say I can tell you(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is a two months' bill on 1st January and would be due on 4th March; I do not think I had it till 5th March; I have held it ever since—I did not come up to London from 5th March till April, and when I came up I did not bring it—the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was part of the bill—I sold the watch and chain in July or August for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a silver watch—I got the watch in July, I believe—having got the pawn ticket as security for the bill, I did not send Mr. Morphett back the bill; it was only for part of it, and I wanted to see whether he would pay me; he was to have the watch back again—I should have sent back the bill when I got the money; I was only taking additional security—I had my brother-in-law's security as well, but ho was very hard up—I have the bill now—the receipt I have describe 1 did not describe what the 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for—the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. interest was not due in April, but it was allowed to me because I was not allowed to take the watch out; that is very simple indeed; your client allowed me the interest in April which the pawnbroker would charge me in the following July—I told Sir J. C. Lawrence that the pounds were seventeen and the shillings I was uncertain of—I said "I gave the defendant a receipt in the following words as far as I recollect—I did not say "I, A. M. Dikon acknowledge as earnest for the payment of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, a gold watch and chain, and I hereby undertake not to deal with the security till 24th June next ensuing"—I recollect the pounds very clearly, that was the most important part—I swear that on 27th April I did not sign my name to this paper—I will swear that this "A. M. Dixon" is not my writing—I swore before Sir J. C. Lawrence that if it was my signature the words describing the amount of Edmunds &amp; Co.'s claim for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and composition 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been put in afterwards, because the resemblance staggered me—I am not aware that I signed my name standing, Mr. Morphett generally offered me a seat—I will not swear that I did or did not sign it standing—he did not in my presence read "Duplicate of my gold chain, &amp;c, that has been given as security to A. M. Dixon, &amp;c., being an amount paid to me <hi rend="italic">in re</hi> Sanders"—he did not write that in my presence—I did not stay five minutes—I wanted to catch my train—this letter is in my writing. (<hi rend="italic">Bead:</hi> "November 12, 1875, signed A. M. Dixon to F. W. Morphett, Esq., Delhi Street, Land-port. Dear Sir,—I shall be in London on Wednesday, the 20th instant, and I shall call at your office at 3 p.m. of that day. I will bring all you require and a form I received from the solicitor, as I will fill that up at your office. I shall also bring the money so that all may be paid if possible at once. If I do not hear from you between this day and the 20th I shall conclude that my appointment will suit you.") This other letter is also in ray writ<lb/>ing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "October 21, from A. M. Dixon to F. W. Morpbett. <hi rend="italic">Re</hi> sanders.

(<hi rend="italic">This was written</hi>

I had not then found out the cost of it, I am no judge of a watch—I did not turn it into 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and another watch, for two months afterwards—I had just got it out when that was written—this letter is my brother-in-law's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "118, Stoke Newington, No<lb/>vember 13th, 1875, I herewith send you the statement of account as to Edmunds &amp; Son, and unless that amount is at once forwarded I shall act upon the judge's advice, and at once institute criminal proceedings under the fraudulent bailee act; Edmunds debt and costs, including counsels fees, etc., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., my costs, and solicitors fees, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; total 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. This is also an answer to yours just received during the writing of this, your im<lb/>mediate attention to this will oblige, yours, &amp;c, H. T. Sanders.") I knew of that letter being written some time afterwards—I did not go to the police-court and get a summons within two or three days after that letter was written, I was in Portsmouth—I afterwards attended at Guidlhall four times—I never said a word about a blue paper receipt till Mr. Wontner put this receipt into my hands, I was asked "Is that your signa<lb/>ture?"—I did not look at the contents, and for a moment it staggered me and I said "It is very much like it, but if it is this has been added to it since, and it is the wrong colour—I mean to swear that I mentioned the blue colour, though Mr. Wontner said in his speech that I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not the fact that nothing was said about the blue paper till your sister-in-law, Mrs. Sanders, was examined? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was the first to mention it—when the white paper was shown to me I did not say anything about the colour of the paper, because a paper was handed to me, and I was asked if it was my signature I could not say that it was not until I had read it, and I said "Here is this addition to it, it cannot be, and the colour of the paper I signed was blue," if any paper was put before you and the question was asked "Is that your writing?" you would look at it first; I did not read it through before I said that; I was simply looking at the signature; I did not read it through before I said that the words about Edmunds it Co. were added, but they were close to the signature, and in a different ink; I did read the paper through before it left my hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say that if the signature was yours, the words before the signature about composition had been added? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said it before, not after<lb/>wards, I got stronger afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Sir J. C. Lawrence was not asked to commit the prisoner for forgery—I was up from Portsmouth four times, which cost me a good deal of money—I understood that if the charge of forgery was gone into I should have to come two or three times again—it was understood that a bill for forgery would be preferred at these sessions—the liquidation under the prisoner's management was a complete humbug, nothing came of it but chaos—the prisoner made the calculation himself in April, about the interest on the watch when I took it out—the date I was to hold it to without taking it out was I believe June 24th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Frederick Sanders, a tailor, of 1, High Street, Stoke Newington—in the latter part of October, 1874, and early in 1875, I called on the defendant at his office in Newgate Street, about business generally—I called a great many times, and on one occasion I think it was in July, I asked him whether he had paid the Messrs. Edmunds, as he had not sent a receipt—he said "I will show you a paper which will prove it," and he showed me half-sheet of blue paper square, about the size of this sheet before me—he had told me that Mr. Edmunds' name was on it, and I asked him to show it to me—I did not read it all down, I merely looked to see if Mr. Edmunds' name was on it, and it was not—Mr. Dixon's name was on it and Mr. Morphett's, but no other—I said "I don't see Mr. Edmunds' name on that paper, will you be kind enough to show it to me?"—and he snatched it out of my hand and threatened to push me out of the office—I noticed "17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." on it and some odd shillings, which I cannot remember—this receipt now produced is not the one, he put into my hands in July—I am certain it is not—I appeared at Guildhall, as one of the witnesses against the defendant when charged with stealing 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Dixon—while he was under remand he came to our house about 1 o'clock one day—my husband was then ill, and was upstairs lying down—the bolt of the door was down, and the prisoner kicked the door and said "I must come in," rather rough "Mrs. Sanders"—I said "The door is made for rough people"—he said that he wanted to see my husband particularly; I told him that he could not, for he was ill—he said that he wanted Mr. Sanders to go to Southampton to Mr. Dixon, to arrange about the money—I assured him that he could not see Mr. Sanders, and then he said "I would give you 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not to know the colour of the paper."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not been turned out of the place in July, but he threatened to—he did not request me to go, I said that I would go—he got up out of his chair and said that he would turn me out—I do not know that it was in July, but it was the same day that I saw the blue paper—I went there for the receipt for the payment to Edmunds—I do not know that it was a receipt that I saw, I only saw that the two names were on it, and the amount—it was in my shop that he offered me the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mrs. Kent who lives with me was behind—she is an independent person—she is not here, she is too old to come—I have no living soul to confirm his offering me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I cannot bring the old lady, and I cannot bring my child who is only seven years of age—I believe this was on the day before I went to the police-court the second time.</p>
               <p>

               <p>half an hour on that point—I might have been in the box half an hour on 3rd December, but it was a very short half-hour—I did not say a syllable to Aldenman Lawrence about this man offering me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to conceal evidence, Mr. Pratt is the man that I named it to—I took the County Court summons with me to the prisoner and asked him what I was to do with it—I did not demand the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of him—I do not know of my husband writing and demanding the money and the expenses—I did not have the prisoner as a witness at the County Court—I took the summons and showed him, but did not tell him before—I did not know in July that he had handed over security to my brother in respect of Edmunds' amount; I knew he had handed over the duplicate of a watch and chain, but I did not know what for—I did not get the money from my brother for the composi<lb/>tion, Mr. Dixon paid it to Mr. Morphett in my presence—I do not know whether my husband employed a solicitor in his liquidation or whether he employed Mr. Earl of Charles Street, Hatton Garden.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have given evidence at the Old Bailey before and at the New Bailey for thirty years—the case of Davis <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> May on 11th Decem<lb/>ber last year was in the Probate Court, "Westminster—they sought in that case to upset a will on the ground that the signature to it was forged—I gave evidence on that occasion from a comparison of that signature with the acknowledged signature of the testator—I swore that it was a forgery and I believe so now—that action was not based upon the evidence of my<lb/>self and Mr. Chabot, nothing of the kind—I unhesitatingly swear that it was not—litigation began in 1874 and I was not called till 1875—I heard that the Jury stopped the case when they had heard my evidence, but I was not in Court—they did not want to hear the summing up of the Judge—I was not present when a man named Parsons swore that he saw the testator sign it, that was the day before—Sir James Hannen tried the case—if he said that a more reckless charge of forgery he never heard in his life, that was no fault of mine—he said that it was painful to reflect on the enormous expense gone to, because Mr. Chabot and Mr. Netherclift thought their opinion better than the testimony; that was an unjust speech.</p>

                  </hi>. I have had experience in the study of handwriting—I was employed to look at the impugned document, and before I did so 1 warned the prisoner that if I formed an opinion against him I should give evidence against him on his trial—I cautioned him very carefully, and said "I have been before consulted by prisoners and have found against them, and they have had penal servitude, and therefore be careful; I shall not shield you for a moment. I won't be dragged in to shield a man to commit a crime"—he still persisted in submitting the writing to me and said that he was not the least afraid—I went from Mr. Wontner's office to Guildhall, when the document was in the possession of the officer of the Court—I looked at the admitted signature of Dixon, and after a careful,. analysis of document A I said that the "A. M. Dixon "on that was in the same hand that wrote the other—I should like to call attention to a particular point—there is another signature to the depositions and the letter "x" is disjoined from the "o" in Dixon; after forming the "x" the pen has been lifted before forming the "o," but you will find that the up-stroke of the "x" terminates in a little hook—that is a point which would hardly be observed by anybody but an expert—the same hook is in this receipt, but it is done exquisitely—if it had been done by a forger it would have been done more clumsily—I say that in the alleged forgery the up-stroke of the "x" is so beautifully done that none but an expert would</p>

               <p>notice it, and it would require a skilful hand to do it—I have made several attempts and could not do it—I think there was another signature on the depositions Mr. Wontner showed me. which I have not here—looking at the signature to the letter marked B, at the first moment one misses the dot of the "i" in "Dixon," but on carefully looking it touches the "c" in "etcetera," and it is a dash obliquely, and when I look at the other signa<lb/>ture I notice it there also, that is an indication of a natural hand of the person signing; then I say that the whole of the signature is done with some rapidity, the lines are smooth and clear, and it would be impossible for a person to write with rapidity and make a signature so like, and particularly to execute this minute hook, except by natural handwriting—then again there is the flourish underneath the alleged signature which is precisely like the flourish to the letter—all those reasons render it certain that it was written by the same hand; I do not see the slightest difference—the difference in the receipt is attributable to a fresh dip of the pen—the words "Edmunds and Co." and "Composition 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." is a different tone, a different tone of ink—it is—not every one who could write it off to the bottom—a person might write down to "2 months" and then blot it, and then write the rest—if you look at the body of the document you will find that the ink differs in colour—in the body of the document the "6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>" with the "4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." is in regular writing, and it is my opinion that the receipt was written down to "2 months," and then blotted, and then that "Edmunds and Co. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." was put in—I suspect that it was not all written at one writing, and then with the same pen the signature was written—from what I see here it is consistent with the whole being written by Mr. Morphett and then signed.</p>

On 30th November, about 8.30 a.m.—I went to Oakley Street, Westminster Bridge Road, and watched there—I was in plain clothes—No. 15 is a newspaper shop, kept by Mrs. Brown—I saw the prisoner go to that shop—he spoke to the landlady and left—she made a sign to me and I followed him—I said "Mr. Burcham;" he took no notice, but continued to walk along—I again addressed him, "Mr. Burcham;" he said "That is not my name"—I said "I am a police officer and wish to speak to you about the letters you have been in the habit of receiving at the house you have just left, 15, Oakley Street, in that name"—he said "Stand out of my way, will you?" and struck me—I took him into custody—on the way to the station he said "What are you going to do with me"—I said "I am not at all sure that you will not have to go to Ireland; you are making a pretty good thing out of the poor dupes in different parts of the country"—he said "What do you mean?"—I said. "You know as well as I do, about pretending to lend them money"—he said "It is no use denying it"—I asked him his name and address—he said "John Reed"—after I had written that down he said "No; not John, Samuel"—that he lived at 51, Duke Street, Waterloo Road, and that he was a walking-stick maker—I have been there—it is a private-house—I found a Mr. Liddamore living there, a walking-stick maker—I got these three unopened letters after the prisoner was in custody, one from Oakley Street and two from Nile Street—they were delivered a few minutes after I took him.

I am the wife of James Brown, living at 15, Oakley, Street, Lambeth, and keep a news shop—I know the prisoner and recollect his coming to my shop, about the 15th November, for a pennyworth of note paper—he also asked if letters might be addressed to him there—I said "Yes," and asked in what name—he said Burcham—I do not know whether he said "S" at the time, but the letters were addressed to "S. Burcham"—a day or two afterwards a letter came addressed to S. Burcham, Esq.—the prisoner called and I gave it to him—he put a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. down and said he always gave a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a letter—he called everyday for about a week or ten days—he had about a dozen letters altogether—I recollect his being taken into custody—until then I received letters for him—one letter was from Bideford, I noticed a second from Exeter, and a third from the country, but I do not know what place—on the 30th November, the day he was taken into custody, he came before the postman who brought one letter afterwards, which I gave to Butcher, and it was marked "W"—the prisoner never said who he was, nor where he lived—he gave no address—he said nothing more than he had three years good character and did not want to throw it away for nothing; I thought he was advertising for a situation—post cards that came were in reference to advertisements.</p>

Burcham, on a piece of paper which I have destroyed—she did it at my request—in this name she asked me to receive letters—the first thing that came was a postcard—afterwards the prisoner called and received two letters and a postcard, in the name of S. Burcham—the woman nest came and received a letter and paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the four—subsequently two more letters came addressed to S. Burcham, which I gave to the prisoner—all the letters I received with the exception of the postcard I think, bore the postmark, Bideford—I remember a regis<lb/>tered letter coming which was delivered to the prisoner in my presence, and that bore the postmark, Bideford—I do not know at all where the prisoner lived—on one occasion I told him two gentlemen had called for him, and he said "No matter"—I know nothing more of him except receiving the letters—I know nothing of any loan office, or any explosion of gas at any place.</p>

I am a waiter and live at 44, Falmouth Road, Borough—on the night of the 15th December last I was in the Borough Road with a friend and we saw the female prisoners standing at the corner with other females—my friend had had a little drop to drink, I was perfectly sober—the females were trying to decoy my friend away, I got him round the corner, and he being a little in liquor I could not get him away—after we had got round the corner of Kell Street they tried to push him into a door way, and Hogan struck me in the face and cut my cheek, and all four got hold of me, and took my watch and chain and picked my pockets of every<lb/>thing I had—I stopped at the door and called "Police!" and a constable came up and I said "I have been robbed in this passage"—he said "Do you know the persons?"—I said "Yes," and gave a description of them, and he went into the house—they would not admit him till he threatened to break the door in, and he then found Hogan lying under some old clothes in a back room conceded!—my watch was a silver geneva—I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was positive of the transaction at the police-court—I did not say two of the women had hold of me, but three—I didn't say that I thought—I think two of the women had hold of me while the man snatched the watch from my pocket—I said the same at the police-court about the man being concealed under the clothes in the room—<hi rend="italic">I</hi> heard my deposition read over and signed it—I was only a few minutes in the house—it was about ten minutes after my friend went down Kell Street that they were taken into custody—I swear it was not half an hour—I had nothing to drink in the house—I don't know whether my friend did, I did not know whether my friend was in the house or not—he is not here—he did not see anything of the robbery—I did not wish him to go into the police-station on the night they were given into custody—he was not pre<lb/>vented—he was not shut out or turned out—I don't know that he said out<lb/>side that the man had got nothing to do with it—I was inside—I heard the prisoner make a statement at the police-court—I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> hear him say" The prosecutor came and said I had taken his watch—I knew nothing, more about it then a new born babe—he had a friend outside the station who said "I knew nothing about it"—I would not swear he did or did not say that I went up into the room with the policeman where Hogan was there was no bed there—it was about 1 o'clock in the morning—I don't think he was asleep—he had not his eyes shut—I never saw him till the policeman went up to him when he awoke, he was up at once—whether he was asleep or not I don't know—the robbery of the watch took place in the passage—there was light from the street and light from the room—I should not have gone round there at all, except to try and get my friend—he is a big man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was light from the door and from the room by which I could recognise the man's features. <hi rend="italic">Clarke</hi> Your friend went upstairs with a young woman and the policeman knocked at the door and I went down and opened the street door, and you and the policeman stood at the floor till your friend and the young woman came downstairs, and as she came down you said "That is the woman who had my watch." <hi rend="italic">Lamb.

               <p>cries of "Police!" and "Help!" in Kell Street, and I went down there—I saw Giles standing there with his face covered with blood and asked him what was the matter—the prisoner was inside the house—I went in and saw Clarke in the passage and Lamb in the backyard and found the man concealed under some old sacking and bed clothes in the back room—there was no bed there—it was a round heap and he was lying coiled up awake, not in a sleeping position—I saw the prosecutor's friend afterwards—he was the worse for drink—Hogan said he didn't have the watch, and the prosecutor said in his presence he had robbed him of his watch while two women held him—I found these pieces of chain attached to the prosecutor's waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have not found the watch or remains of the chain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prosecutor was quite sober, he knew what he was about—he said he had had a glass—he said he had lost about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said at the police-court that prosecutor said he had lost his money, but did not know how much—his friend was not turned out of the station—he went away—I am sure he was not pressed to go away—I have not made enquiries about Hogan—we usually do when we have a case—I never knew where he worked—I heard his mother give her evidence at the police-court as to his character and say he was a carman—she said he is a hardworking <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> and never sleeps away from home, and you can refer to Mr. Heeseman, the man he has been working for for many years—I knew he had not been working there for the last nine months because I have seen him loitering about—the prosecutor pointed out these two women and the others he could not—Lamb was in the back yard, in the w.c.</p>

They all went out and left me in the room by myself. There was a bed in a corner of the room and I lay down and fell asleep and was awoke when the prosecutor said I had taken his watch. I know no more about it than a new-born babe. He had a friend who came to say I knew nothing about the matter and he was not allowed to come in."</p>
