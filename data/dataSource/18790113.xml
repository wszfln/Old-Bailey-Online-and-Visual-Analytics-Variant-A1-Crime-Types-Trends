                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler at the King of Den<lb/>mark in the Old Bailey—I purchased that house from Mr. Watson Ansell on 23 July, 1877—I paid him part in cash and part in three bills, two of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and one for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the first was a three months' bill, and the second six, dated 23 July, 1877, the day of the change—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was afterwards cancelled, and I gave another for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was, I believe in Mr. Ansell's possession—that was cancelled about 6th March last—on that day I think I saw the prisoner at my premises—the form of a bill for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out on that day—Ward drew it up—no name was put as the drawer—I accepted it in Ward's presence—he drew the bill for Mr. Ansel who was busy at the time—nothing was said about any name being put as the drawer of the bill—Mr. Ansell gave him instructions what he was to do with the bill—he said, in my presence, "Take care of that bill for me, and keep it in your safe"—I heard nothing else said as to what was to be doner with the bill—I did not hear anything said about the drawer's name—Mr. Ward took the bill away with him—the name of Josiah Ward now upon I was not on it at the time I accepted it, or at the time Mr. Ward took away—it was not put on in my presence—it is not in the same ink as the rest of the bill—an account was made out at the time the bill was drawn up between Ward and me—he drew it up for Mr. Ansell, showing the state of the account between Ansell and me—I did not owe Ward any money at that time, I never owed him any—the hill was presented to me the day it became due, by Trenchard and Smith, and I paid it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say that the bill was fraudulently signed by Mr. Ward with his own name instead of Mr. Ansell's—I had no knowledge of that at the time I paid it—I saw the bill, of course, with Ward's signature on it when I paid it—my banker told me that I must pay it—it was payable at the bank—I did not make any excuse for not paying it—I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187901130002"/>
               <p>ill the day it was presented, I was not present, I was in bed—I stated in my sworn information at the police-court: "Since that I have, under the threat of legal proceedings, paid the said money to Messrs. Trenchard and Smith, who presented the bill in company with Mr. Morris, the defendant's manager and clerk"—I am not the prosecutor in this case, Mr. Ansell is—he was out of the room at the time I accepted the bill—he was in his own office—he had not been into the room that morning at all—Mr. Ward drew up the bill, and I accepted it—I believe he brought the bill to my place and drew it up there—I don't think it was ever in Mr. Ansell's possession—he never had the bill—he was not in the room when Mr. Ward made out the account—it was not an account between Ward, Ansell, and myself combined—it was between me and Ansell, it had nothing to do with Ward—I can't say whether Ward wrote down the amount of his commission for discount<lb/>ing the bill—I don't recollect—this (<hi rend="italic">produeed</hi>) might have been the account that Ward wrote out at that time—I can't say—I say it was Ward who wrote out the account—I did not write it—this is the account against Ansell—that is my writing "26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. six months' rent, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., interest 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I wrote that at the time—I don't know who had the interest—that was written when Ansell was out of the room—I don't know whether Mr. Ward was to have the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his security—I am sure Mr. Ansell's sigrature would have been worth the paper on which it was written, if he had signed the bill—if he had put his name to it it would not have prevented the bill being dis<lb/>counted—I did not know that he had undertaken to pay a composition of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound in a fortnight, and that he failed to carry it out—I heard of it in Court a week or two ago—I do not know that a demand in bank<lb/>ruptcy was made against Mr. Ward in reference to this bill—I never heard of it—I do not know that Mr. Ansell made a demand in bankruptcy on 12th September last year for the payment of the debt on this bill—Mr. Ansell and I carry on business in the same premises—he calls himself a carrier's agent—I never heard of this document: "The following are the particulars of the demand of Ansell against Ward, amounting to 153<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., being the amount of money received by you from Lamplough as trustee or agent for me in discharge of the balance due on a bill of exchange for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I have no recollection of it, it might have been shown, or I might have been told, I don't recollect—I can't say the date when proceedings were taken against Mr. Ward at Guildhall Police-court—I don't think it was so early as the latter end of last summer, or the beginning of autumn—I know that proceedings were taken against him—I was a witness—I think I filed an information—the charge was dismissed—I have not been here before.</p>

I am a carrier's agent at the King of Denmark in the Old Bailey—I have known the prisoner some years, I don't know how many—I think I handed him the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill to take care of about December—I am not certain—I gave it to him at his place I believe—he kept possession of it till the beginning of March—I gave it him to take care of for me as I had no banking account, I had to carry it about in my pocket or leave it at home, he had an iron safe—Ward brought back the bill to the Old Bailey at the beginning of March—I don't know the day exactly—Mr. Lamplough was there—I was not there when the bill was delivered to Mr. Lamplough—I saw Ward after he had been to Mr. Lamplough—he handed me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think it was—that was for the interest of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up to that date—that came from Lamplough—I owed Lamplough 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Ward, it might be five or six years or eight or nine years, not twelve or fifteen; he has not been a very great friend to me that I know of; he has cashed a bill for me before—I was summoned for keeping a betting house, but I never kept it, and the charge fell through—Ward was my bail for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in 1877 I owed him something like 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know the exact figures—he went to a meeting of my creditors—I believe he voted for my paying my creditors a composition of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound in a fortnight; I don't know, I was not there—I have no doubt he did—I never had the paying of it; my solicitor had the money to pay; I don't know whether he paid him or not—I don't know that it was never paid; I never had the accounts rendered to me, and' never saw them—I think the amount of my debts was something like 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 2,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was secured—there is an account between Ward and myself now; he has done repairs for me, but I have never had the account—I should not think it was as much as 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he built a little place for me—I have never asked him for the bill—he did not tell me that he would do further work for me on my promising that he should be paid the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in full, and pay him for the future work he was to do; that I swear—I sold the King of Denmark to Lamplough—there were three bills, two of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at three, six, and twelve months—I had a cheque for 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about 24th December—that was on account of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was exchanged in March—I had several amounts in cheques from Ward; 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—on 24th December I had a cheqde for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 11th February, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 18th March, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 27th April an acceptance for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not have a truck from him on 1st March which was charged 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I swear that—he paid some small sums for backing horses for me—I had no gold from him after the second bill became due; that was about 26th February, I think—I took proceedings at the police-court before Mr. Alderman Knight, and the</p>

               <p>charge was dismissed—that was about November, I think; I am not certain—I believe I had leave to be bound over to prosecute—I never gave Ward a bill of sale—there was one drawn up, but he never had it; I was to have had some money of him, but I never had it, consequently the bill of sale was never handed over to him—I don't know whether the bill of sale alleged that I owed him 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I never read it—I don't know whether it was filed in the Court of Queen's Bench; my solicitor handled it, and did what he liked with it—I very likely signed it; I think it was done in anticipation of my having some money, but I never had it—Ward knew I was going to give the bill of sale if I had the money of him to pay an action, but it was never wanted; I should certainly have read it if I had handed it over to him, but there was no necessity; he never had possession of it—an action had been brought against me in the Mayor's Court by the South-Eastern Railway Company; his lordship overruled the South-Eastern Company, they applied for a new trial, and they beat me there before Mr. Brandon, but they have never asked me for the money—there was no execution out against me at the time I signed the bill of sale—my solicitor served Ward with a demand in bankruptcy for the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; we endeavoured to get the money civilly if we could, and if not we tried to get it this way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Ward was to let me have the money on the bill of sale to pay the South-Eastern Company, because he said I could not have any on the bill; he said no one would discount Lamplough's bill, but it was not required, and the bill is now in my solicitor's possession; I saw it this morning—the cheques that have been spoken of were on account of the second 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was not discounted for me—now and then I would go to a race meeting with Ward; perhaps once a month—I believe there was no account between us on racing matters.</p>

I am a solicitor, and am acting as solicitor for the prosecution in this case—I was acting for Mr. Ansell in the second action brought against him by the South-Eastern Company—there had been a previous action before his lordship, in which, under his ruling, Mr. Ansell gained the verdict; the South-Eastern Company went to the Court of Common Pleas, and obtained a new trial—after several postponements by the South-Eastern Company it came on per proviso in March—I told Mr. Ansell that it was necessary to have Queen's Counsel in the matter, as important points of law were raised, and I must have some money to pay them with; he said "My fried <hi rend="italic">Josh</hi> Ward will let me have it under a 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill if I give him a bill of sale as collateral security," and acting on those instructions I executed the bill of sale, and it was executed and dated, fancying we should have the money that day—no money was obtained under it to my knowledge—several appointments were made for Ward to let Ansell have the money; it went on till the last day for tiling, and I filed it on that day, and I have held it ever since.</p>

               <p>—I am not able to say how they got into the basket—I do not remember seeing them brought; all I can say is that I found them there—it is a room to which the public have access who wish to bring letters to the Board of Trade—this is one of the letters I found—I took steps, according to the usual course of business, to have it placed before Mr. Gray, the assistant secretary—the basket is one to which the public have access—this letter is dated Dec 27, 1878. and the other Dec. 31, 1878.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The letter of</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th December was read as follows:</hi>—"Sailors' Home, London, Dec. 27, 1878. To the Assistant Secretary, Board of Trade, Marine Department, Whitehall Gardens. Sir,—No one but the Lord Chief Justice of England and a jury of my fellow-countrymen can decide the point in dispute between the Board of Trade and me, since the Board of Trade declines to discuss the matter with me any further There there<lb/>fore becomes a cruel necessity forced upon me to adopt some unprecedented means of forcing on a trial in the Criminal Court, which I can only do by placing myself in the undesirable position of a prisoner committed for trial But independent of this object, the misconduct of your colleagues in their treatment to me justifies me in denouncing them all as a gang of dishonest, unprincipled, and cowardly robbers, tyrants, and oppressors, and as I must hold somebody responsible for their misconduct, I hold you respon<lb/>sible for the department of which you are assistant secretary, and demand from you the instant restoration—restitution is the proper word—to me of the second renewal of my master's certificate of competency, bought and paid for by me, sir, as well as earned, eleven years ago, by 17 years' hard service under the British flag. If you are able to comply with this impera<lb/>tive demand, and I know whether you are or not, this letter ends here, and my case begins and ends with your compliance with my just demand. If not, then, sir, singling you out from the gang of daylight robbers who take a mean advantage of their power to ruin and destroy me upon a plea which itself is a gross, infamous, monstrous, and most cowardly libel upon my character and reputation, that everything in connection with my history during the last ten years tends to disprove. <hi rend="italic">I threaten—mark the word, sir</hi>—I threaten you with a sudden and violent death as you emerge from the head office of the Board of Trade to-day to return to your private residence, and take care I am not armed and fully prepared to carry out my threat. I am a true-born Englishman, sir, and I must either have redress for my wrongs, or I must be completely annihilated. In this crisis, sir, I quote the motto which appears beneath the Royal arms above the doorway that they adorn, and closing my letter with the shout of 'God and my right,' I have the honour to remain, your obedient servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">WM. MULLENS</hi>. P.S.—At my earliest convenience will serve my pur<lb/>pose just as well as the day of which this letter bears the date.")</p>

               <p>had known him previously—he was under my care from 26th February, 1876, until 1st May of the same year in Colney Hatch Asylum—when I saw him on the 9th January last I was with him about two hours and a half—I had conversation with him during the whole of that time—I formed an opinion as to the state of his mind—I believe he was of unsound mind—he had various delusions, first of all as to his own connections, which were great; secondly, as to his own aspirations, which were great likewise—he wrote love letters to one of the Royal Princesses—he passed from under my charge at Colney Hatch in this way: he constructed with great ingenuity a skeleton key, with which he liberated himself early in the morning of the 1st May, and escaped from the asylum, and when he got to a port by the seaside he sent me back the key which he had constructed, with a polite note.</p>

I am the surgeon of Newgate—the prisoner was under my charge in the prison in 1869—my opinion then was that he was of unsound mind—he was then charged with sending threatening letters—I saw him again the other day when Dr. Sheppard saw him, and I quite agree with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I agree with him in the answer he gave, that although the prisoner's mind may have been affected, he knew the value and meaning of the language he was using—I think he perfectly understood; whether he intended carrying it out is another matter, but I think he perfectly under<lb/>stood that the threat to murder was an illegal and a wrong act; of course I speak from the experience I have had of him since he has been with us, I do not know the state of mind he was in at the time—I saw him on the 2nd of the present month; the letter was written on 27th December—I do not recollect what the state of his mind was in 1869; I merely know the fact that he was here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> You were here a month ago; the Lord Mayor sent a request that I should report on the state of your mind—I did not examine you; I had a conversation with you, but you protested against my examining you, and therefore, not being able to go fully into the matter, I excused myself from making a report to the Lord Mayor without having a full opportunity of judging—there was no one to prosecute, and the case there ended—I had a general conversation with you, but no examination—you protested on the score of submitting your statements, opinions, and principles to the arbitration of any medical man; you told me that you looked upon doctors as your natural enemies, and you therefore objected to express any statement, opinion, or feeling to a medical man—you said that you preferred to submit your thoughts, feelings, and statements to a jury rather than to two doctors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Before I commence my defence I feel constrained at this crisis to utter the ejaculatory prayer to the Great Judge of all judges,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187901130014"/>
               <p>and to say in the hearing of this Court, and in the hearing of all England, "God defend the right, and confound the wrong, for His great mercy's sake, through Jesus Christ our Lord." Gentlemen of the Jury, the question that has to be decided by your verdict is not a mere question of life or death, or imprisonment or liberty, to me. I care nothing for death. Death has been my playmate since I was a little boy twelve years of age, and I have gone through a thousand fiery ordeals to gain the object which I have gained to-day. Therefore I bespeak the patience of the entire Court to hear me to the end. Nevertheless I feel constrained to adopt the bold and fearless language of that bold and fearless' outlaw who, after having achieved a thousand daring feats, and being brought at last into the presence of a con<lb/>queror so mighty that he wept because there was nothing left to conquer, cried out to his judge, "Alexander, I am your captive. I must hear what you please to say and endure what you please to inflict; but my soul remains unconquered." I sincerely trust that the noble and learned Judge presiding over this case will respond to my appeal, and answer me in the language of the mighty Alexander, telling me to speak freely, for that it is not for him to silence me. With regard to the question of counsel, I received a letter from the Almagamated Society of British Seamen, offering assistance in my defence. I replied, thanking them, but declining it, in my belief that the spirit of truth and justice will impregnate the Court as I stand a prisoner at the bar of England. In commencing my defence I feel impelled to remind you of the beautiful prayer contained in the Litany of the Established Church, which so beautifully links my case, that of the desolate and oppressed, with the case of the widow and fatherless, that every Sunday morning hundreds and hundreds of consecrated lips give utterance to, and that is responded to by the no less beautiful expression, "We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord." I propose to confine my defence to the establishment of the truth of the statements which I made to Sir James Ingham on the 2nd inst., and by the ability with which, in your opinion, I prove the truth of those statements, I propose to vindicate the sanity of my mind. (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner then proceeded to contend that there was no proof that he had delivered the letter, and that if he had, the threat, if any, only referred to the day men<lb/>tioned in the letter.</hi>) He then added: I have no ill-feeling towards Mr. Gray, but I think I was justified in resorting to some ruse, in order to bring the case I have against the Board of Trade before the public eye of Britain. By writing the letters I was merely pretending to ape the madness which has been shouldered upon me on and off for ten years, entailing medical examination after medical examination, most annoying to me. I entreat you, my lord and gentlemen of the jury—I ask you indulgently to consider the tre<lb/>mendous odds that I have to contend against. I am only a poor mariner of England, doubly and trebly branded with the stigma of insanity, dragged into a reluctant contention with a gentleman who in his own person represents a whole Department of the Imperial Government, and if I have resorted to a harmless stratagem, in writing these letters, to draw the Board of Trade out of their great stronghold, it is not because I would enter into open rebellion against their authority, but that I might again honourably place myself beneath their jurisdiction. I would not hurt the wing of a fly or dislodge a hair upon a baby's head; and all the thunderbolts which the Board of Trade can launch will never drive me out of my beloved country. Gentle<lb/>men, your verdict to-day will either be a last culminating wrong or the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187901130015"/>
               <p>healing balm for all my previous wounds. I will say no more. I will leave the matter to God, to the Jury, and to his Lordship.</p>

I am butler in the service of Mr. Edward Tyler, of 29, Oxford Square—about 1 o'clock on the morning of the 4th December I was sleeping in Cambridge Mews—I was called up by the police, and found Keefe in their custody—I went to the police-station and charged him—I afterwards went to 29, Oxford Street—I searched the area there, and in it found this jemmy and two wooden wedges—there were marks on the area door where the jemmy had been used, and the wedges had been put into the door—the area gate was locked—I had left the house about 11.15—the area door had been tried from the bottom up to the lock in the centre, close against the doorpost—there were persons sleeping in the house that night, but not on the basement—the door had not been lately opened, but a portion of the bottom was cut away, and the stonework was chipped or broken away for several inches, as if from the use of one of these instruments—the area door opens outwards—it was strained and damaged, but not opened—it was forced, so that the screws of the lower bolt had given way.</p>

About 12 o'clock on Tuesday night, 3rd December, I was on duty in Oxford Square—in passing No. 29 I noticed some dirt on the area gate and footprints down the steps—I turned on my light, looked over the area railings, and saw the two prisoners on their hands and knees at the area door—I could see them both distinctly—I asked what they were doing there—one of them replied, "We were gaffing for some beer, and we dropped half-a-crown down the area, and we had gone down to look for it"—I said, "Shall I come down and help you look for it?"—one of them replied, "Oh no, not now, some other time will do"—they then ascended the area steps, and climbed over the gate into the square—I had my bull's-eye upon them all the time until they were ascending the area steps, then I turned it off; when they got over the railings I secured them both—we had a struggle; I found that the two of them were rather too much for me, I let Wyatt go, and secured Keefe, and took him to the station—I was struggling with them, I should think, about 5 minutes—Wyatt ran away—I searched Keefe at the station—I there saw six or eight persons, and out of them I identified Wyatt—I have not the least doubt of his being the man.</p>

               <p>400 yards from Oxford Square—I met the two prisoners there—Wyatt asked me for a light—I turned my lamp on, and he turned round and walked away sharply; he did not wait for the light—I saw the two prisoners again between 11.20 and 11.30 in Burwood Place, Edgware Road, near to Oxford Square and Cambridge Street—I have no doubt about their identity—in the morning I went with Thurston to examine the area door—I found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> concealed among the flower-pots with one of the wedges.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, of Durnford Road, East Holloway—on the evening of 11th July I was in the Woodman public-house, Colney Hatch—I saw Gould there, and to the best of my knowledge Stratton was standing by his side—I treated them both to twopennyworth of something—a few minutes afterwards, about 10.40, I was going along the path towards the railway station, and was suddenly knocked down by a blow on my head and rendered insensible, but I saw no one—it appears that I received three blows, for I have three wounds; one blow cut away part of my thumb and the nail—I fell—I had a watch in my waistcoat pocket attached to a chain—I missed them, and also 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a bunch of keys—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Quintan helped me up and gave me into the hands of a police<lb/>man—I have known Gould twelve months—I have a very slight knowledge of Stratton.</p>

Edward Quintan. I am a bricklayer, of Station Road, near Southgate—on 11th January, about 11.20 p.m., I was on my way home by the path leading to Colney Hatch station, and found Purkis lying on the path about half way between the railway bridges half insensible—his head was bleed<lb/>ing very much from more than one wound—I picked him up and set him against a fence while I picked up his hat and handkerchief—I put his hat on, and put his handkerchief, and this part of his waistcoat, which had been torn off and was lying by him, into his pocket—his walking-stick was lying by him broken into several pieces—I took him some distance, met a police<lb/>man, and handed him over to him—I know both the prisoners well.</p>

On 12th January, about 6.30 p.m., I went with Burr to Stratton's house—I knocked at the door, and his brother came—I asked him for his brother, and Stratton came to the door—I said, "I am a constable, and must take you in custody for a highway robbery with violence on an old gentleman named Purkis—he said, "Will you, you b——?" and struck me on the mouth with his fist and rushed to the back door—I went after him—he tried to escape at the back—we had a struggle in the wash-house, and Burr came in at the back door—he caught hold of me between my legs, got his hand through my trousers and drawers, and said he would tear my * * out—I told him the charge—he said, "I don't care about that, I am innocent of that; I thought it was something else you wanted me for"—I took him to Southgate station, searched him, and found on him a knife, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and this watch and a key—I asked him how he</p>

               <p>got the watch—he said, "I met an old gentleman last night, and he gave it to me"—I asked him if he knew who it was—he said, "No, Gould was along with me"—I asked him if he got a chain—he said, "No, Gould has got it '—I went with Burr to the Railway Tavern, and saw Gould there—I touched him on the arm, and said, "I want to speak to you"—he came out, and I told him he would be charged with assaulting Mr. Purkis, and with highway robbery last night—he said, "I am innocent of that, I know nothing of that"—on the road I said, "Mr. Purkis is very ill, I don't know whether he will die or not"—he said, "Well, I shall make a clean breast of it: Mr. Purkis treated us to twopennyworth of whisky each at Mr. Willshire's, and left about a minute before we did, and soon after the old gentleman came out I saw Stratton knock him down and rob him. I stood on. I did not interfere myself, and said nothing to no one. I afterwards went with Stratton as far as his gate and left him"—I received this hat and waistcoat from Purkis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think Burr would hear the conversation about Purkis being likely to die—he was only a couple of yards behind—I did not tell him it would be better for him to make a clean breast of it—he said that Mr. Purkis had made a coat for him—he is a tailor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statements before the Magistrate.</hi> Stratton says: "Satur<lb/>day night I tried to pick up Purkis, Gould helped. Purkis had his stick; he was drunk, and did not know what he was doing; he fell down again, we picked him up; he pulled out his watch, gave it to me, and said he was in the Bankruptcy Court. He said 'You keep this watch, and I will see you at Mr. Willshire's on Monday night'. I said, 'No', when he dropped it on the grass I picked it up, and put it in my pocket He said, 'That's right' We helped take him down till we got to the railway path, when he fell down again; we took him as far as the first railway signal, when he said, 'I can go now,' and we let him go. He asked me to get his hand-kerchief out of his pocket, and I gave it to him." <hi rend="italic">Gould says:</hi> "I went into Mr. Willshire's on Saturday night, and saw Mr. Purkis there. He gave us each some whisky; we drank it and left We had not gone far down the road when he came rolling behind us. He got through the gate, and fell down; we picked him up and took him as far as the first signal; he took his watch out of his pocket, and started off to go along the line when he fell down again; he was pouring with blood; we picked him up again, when he asked Stratton to pull his handkerchief out of his pocket, which he did. He stumbled about again, and I left Stratton with him. I had not got far when Stratton called me up, and told me he had got the watch. I told him to keep it, and then went home," <hi rend="italic">Stratton in his defence re<lb/>peated the same statement.</hi>

                  </hi>. I live at 31, South Parade, Trafalgar Square, Chelsea, and am a wine merchant, carrying on business at 16, Abchurch Lane, City—I have known the prisoner for some time, and since April last I have had business transactions with him; he carried on business as a stockbroker at 18, Austin Friars, his name was not on the door—I have visited at his office and he has visited at mine, and we have had transactions together—on Saturday, 5th October last, about 10.20, he called on me, bringing this cheque marked A. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>; October 4th, 1878. Messrs. Williams, Deacon, and Company. Pay to bearer 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Henry Labouchere." <hi rend="italic">On the stamp were the initials</hi> "F. A. P.") He said "Kindly get this cashed for me"—I said "How do you want it?"—he said "Get me one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and eleven 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, pay 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into your bank for me, for I shall want a cheque on Monday or Tuesday for that amount, and bring the eleven fives down to Kempton Park to day"—I said I would do so—I have a banking account at the London and Westminster—I knew that he had no banking account and I had obliged him, before in the. same way—at the time he handed the cheque to me there was no receipt stamp upon it; he asked me for one and I gave it to him, and he put it on the cheque, and he put on the letters F. A. P. and the figures 4-10-78 on the receipt stamp in my presence—he said "If they ask at the bank who this cheque is from say from Pinckoff's"—I went with the cheque to Williams, Deacon, and Company, about 11 o'clock; an inquiry was made of me by the cashier, and I mentioned the name of Pinckoff's—the cashier then paid me the cheque with one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it because I endorsed it in my own handwriting—it is numbered 29133, dated 2nd March, 1878—I paid this note into my account at the London and West-minster, the chief office in Lothbury—I also received the eleven 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, which I pinned together and took down to Kempton Park race meeting on that Saturday, where I saw the prisoner and handed them to him—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. remained as it had been arranged—I did not see anything of the prisoner until the following Tuesday, the 8th; he came to me that day between 12 and 1 o'clock, and while he was there a clerk called on me from Williams, Deacon, and Company, and in the prisoner's presence he said to me "Mr. Tryon?"—I said "Yes"—he said "I have called to trace a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, can you tell me where you got it?"—at that time the prisoner was behind me reading a newspaper, and as I was about to reply he kicked my legs with his foot, and said "No, no, no, no," and that was the answer I gave the clerk, "No"—the prisoner said behind me "Kempton Park or Carter"—that was whispered, but loud enough for the clerk to hear—I then said "Prom Kempton Park or Carter, but I don't know where"—the clerk then left—after he was gone I said to the prisoner "There is some mistake about this cheque, what is the meaning of it?"—he said "Oh, yes, they paid me too much, that will be all right; I will go and put it right and be back in half an hour"—he then left, and I did not see him again until I saw him in the dock of the Mansion House—I know his hand-writing—this letter marked D is his writing—I don't think the envelope is—I do not know that handwriting—the prisoner might have called at my office about 1st August—I remember his bringing this cheque marked C—it is dated 1st August, drawn on Williams, Deacon, and Company, for</p>

V.—he asked me to get it cashed for him—I said I would—he told me to get 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and ten fives, I did so, and handed the money to him—I remember his coming to my office about 30th August, on that occasion he brought me five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I paid those notes into my bank on the same day, and gave him a cheque in exchange for it—this is it—the cheque is dated August 30: "Pay to No. 977 or bearer 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Tryon and Co."—the number is the rotation number of the cheque—I put a number at his request—I said "What name?"—he said "No name, put a number"—these three letters, marked F. G. H., are in the prisoner's handwriting, and I believe the envelopes also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had no business transactions with the prisoner before April—I knew of his being a liquidating debtor—I claimed 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as lent to him in January, but I wish to withdraw that proof—it was made up of 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for wine supplied, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. money lent on 12th January—I swore to that debt—it was not a true debt—I did not give him the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a music-hall one night in January—I have seen him at a music-hall more than once—on no occasion did I give him money at a music-hall—I did not know of any syndicate operations on the Stock Exchange with regard to a com<lb/>pany in which Mr. Labouchere was interested—I do not know anything about it—when the prisoner gave me the two cheques he did not tell me from whom he had had them—I did not ask him—at the time the clerk came from Williams, Deacon, and Company I had not heard of a large embarrassment in Mr. Labouchere's account—I knew nothing whatever about it—I was not asked by the detective Hancock to go to the Mansion House—I went to Mr. Mullen's office at first, and I went to the Mansion House on my own account—I did not believe I was about to be given into custody—I received a letter from Mr. Mullens, and on receipt of that I went to hi office—I did not go from there to the Mansion House—I was not kept in suspense as to whether I was to be a witness or a prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Mullens's clerk called on me, and I said I preferred seeing the principal, and I went on to his office and made a statement—I afterwards attended at the Mansion House several times and gave evidence. George Tinson. I am a cashier in the bank of Williams, Deacon, and Company, 21, Birchin Lane—Mr. Henry Labouchere has an account there—I have been in the habit of cashing his cheques for a long time—this cheque for 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was presented to me for payment over the counter on Saturday, 5th October—I have not the slightest idea who presented it—I cashed it in the ordinary way—I have my book here with the entry—it is in my own handwriting—I gave in payment for the cheque a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 29133, dated 2nd March, 1878, and 11 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—I believed the cheque to be a genuine one, and paid it accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are about 70 clerks in the bank—about ten would be employed in paying and cancelling cheques—this is my own cancellation—we know each other's cancellations perfectly well—I was not present when Mr. Labouchere went through a large bundle of cheques—some cheques were shown to me alleged to be forged, which I had cancelled—there were certainly over a 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I paid myself—no inquiry was made into the cheques that were presented in 1874 that I am aware, I think only from 1877—there would be a few before that, but I did not see them—no forged cheques of 1874 or 1875 were submitted to me—I cannot tell you how many there were that I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187901130040"/>
               <p>had cancelled, perhaps five or six—I should not think there were anything like forged cheques amounting to 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the 1st January, 1877, up to the end of 1878, nor to the amount of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those I had cancelled might amount to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know what they amounted to altogether, but I believe it was something between 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not the slightest idea what the earliest date of these would be—I cannot tell you whether there were any earlier than 1877—I have the books here—I was not subpœnaed to bring the cheques—they are in the hands of the solicitors—I have not seen them—there are very few customers at our bank who draw on plain paper—some gentlemen occasion<lb/>ally draw on blank paper, but very few, not habitually, they usually draw on forms—to the best of my belief Mr. Labouchere is the only customer who invariably sends his cheques on blank paper—I have not brought Mr. Labouchere's cheques for 1874—I cannot possibly say how many cheques would represent the 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I paid—if I saw the cheques I could tell those that I paid—I don't know whether it was ten or a dozen—they were exactly similar to this cheque, marked A, and I believe written by the same hand—the writing was so like Mr. Labouchere's that I passed them all—I could not pledge my oath now that it is not Mr. Labouchere's writing—all I mean to say is I look at the signature, and it is so like Mr. Labouchere's that if I had no reason to question it I should say it was his—they were all alike, and I paid them all—the cheques would not be returned to Mr. Labouchere every month, but whenever he liked to call for them—I cannot say whether ho ever had them returned—I know it must have been very rarely—of course any clerks in the house could go and look at the drawer where the cheques are kept—I suppose all the cashiers have dealt with Mr. Labouchere's cheques—the junior clerks who go round to the clearing house would not necesssarily have them in their hands they would only have them in their hands from the clearing-house to the bank, or when they write up the pass-book—it is no part of their duty to see that they are genuine—the senior clerks who cancel the cheques would go through them to see that they were right—the junior clerk has nothing to do with the cancelling, he only collects them from the clearing-house—I have no doubt that from 1874 to the time when the prisoner was taken into custody 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cheques in a similar handwriting to this have been passed through the clearing-house or over the counter against Mr. Labouchere's account—all the cheques are registered in a book—customers who have printed forms would have the opportunity of ascertaining at once whether the cheques were genuine, if they were not upon the book delivered to him—a printed form is a great protection to the bank as well as the cus<lb/>tomer—if I saw nothing on the face of the cheque to make me doubt I should not trouble myself to look at the signature book; it depends upon circumstances how often an ordinary customer gets his pass-book made up; they vary; if it is a mercantile account it is done every week, and some have them every day, but private customers may not have their account made up in six or twelve months or two years—out of 1,000 customers quite one per cent would let us keep their pass-book for a year—I dare say there would not be one in 200 who would let us keep it for two years; we always send back the cheques to ordinary customers—if we saw amongst a number of cheques one not having a consecutive number we should make inquiry, but the chances are we should never see it unless the customer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187901130041"/>
               <p>pointed it out to us—the fact of the consecutive numbers being disturbed, and a strange number interposed, would no doubt put us on inquiry—in ordinary cases we simply look at the pass-book, put the cheques together, and send them back—if I had any doubt of this at the time I should not have paid it; if it were presented to me to-day in its present state I should gay I would pay it; if Mr. Labouchere swore it was not his handwriting I should not pay it—in the face of Mr. Labouchere's oath I should not pay it—if it was presented to me, and I knew nothing of the present pro<lb/>ceedings, I should pay it—I should not pay any of these cheques now without looking into it thoroughly first; that is not because we have orders not to pay any more of the Labouchere cheques; we have no orders of the sort—I am told this is a forged cheque, and I say that the signature is so exact that I should have paid it if I did not know the circumstances; without reference to the circumstances I should undoubtedly pay it—with reference to the ledger accounts of all the customers, the balances are struck every three months—if the customer has got his pass-book we wait for him to bring it in; if we have it it is made up—the pass-book is a copy of the ledger—I cannot fix the date when Mr. Labouchere had his pass-book in 1876—I do not know whether it was at the bank all that time—I don't think we had his pass-book for some time; that would not be known to all the clerks; perhaps to three or four or half a dozen, it might be only two clerks, who make up the ledger and strike the balances; they do not change about—I don't know of the existence of any pass-book of Mr. Labouchere's—I don't think I ever saw one—he would not have any difficulty in looking at the ledger at any time—I cannot tell what his balance was on January 1st, 1877—the ledger would show; it is not here—I don't know that I was subpœnaed to bring it; I was subpœnaed to bring the books; we cannot bring the ledgers, they are all in use—the book containing Mr. Labouchere's account contains three or four hundred accounts; we want it every quarter of an hour—I have not a copy of his account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. labouchere has been a customer 15 or 20 years perhaps—his father was a partner in the bank—I cannot say that he has always drawn his cheques on blank paper—I know he has for a great many years—business-like customers have their pass-books made up pretty often—we have unbusiness-like customers who are somewhat irregular in that respect—Mr. Labouchere did not have his pass-book at all regularly.</p>

I am going to give Crowe money for this cheque, but I am not going to give him all; he thinks I have plenty of money, and I have not"—he said he would give Crowe cash for it, but he did not want Crow to know that he had got the money—if I said just now that Kettle said he should not give it him all, it was a misunderstanding; what he said was, "I shall give him cash for the cheque, but I shall not have this country cheque credited to my account till four days, so I have not the money to give him"—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I paid in on the 5th would not be credited to my account till the 9th—Kettle said that Crowe and a lot more thought that he had got lots of money—he said he had given him part of this 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me that at the bank when he gave me the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—he said, "Pay this into your account, because I have given Crowe a part of this amount"—I believe he mentioned not wanting Crowe to know about his having the money in order to explain his only giving him part of it—I don't know why he should not have given him the whole—I have given Kettle cheques before; not in exchange for cheques, they have generally been for notes—he, having no banking account, occasionally brought me notes, and I have given him my cheque for his convenience—I had not the slightest idea that there was anything wrong about the cheques—no charge has been made against me about it—an inquiry was made of me about one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note which was the proceeds of a forgery—I don't know the number of it—I was asked for an explanation, and I gave it—I received a letter from Mr. Mullens, and gave my explanation.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Benshanm Road, Thornton Heath—about two years ago I made the acquaintance of Kettle—I knew him as a stockbroker, at 18, Austin Friars, trading under the name of Kettle and Crowe, that was in October, 1877—I knew Kettle there up to June, 1878, when I left—I was employed in the office—there were two rooms, I sat in the outer room, Kettle occupied the inner room, and Mr. Crowe when he was there—the name of Kettle and Crowe only remained up for about two months, not longer, certainly; it was then painted out—while that name was up Crowe came frequently—he came less often after the dispute arose—there was some litigation between Kettle and Crowe, and then Crowe ceased to come but seldom—he resumed coming about February, 1878, and then con<lb/>tinued to come from time to time until June, when I left—sometimes he would call every day. and sometimes it would be two, three, or four times a week—he would remain perhaps half an hour or an hour in the inner office with Mr. Kettle, and sometimes in the outer office—after the name of Kettle and Crowe was painted out the name of Robinson and Co. was put up, that was myself—that name remained up to June—I think it was the end of June when I left—I think I saw Crowe a day or two before I left—my salary was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tradesman in Roman Road, Old Ford—I know Chater—on 9th August last he came to me with this cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dated 9th August, drawn by Alfred B. Rocke, payable to self or bearer, on Rocke and Co., Old Bank, Shrewsbury—he asked if I would pass it through my bankers for him—I at first objected, and asked where he got it from—he said he had taken it from Mr. March, a pawnbroker at Poplar, in payment of two cases of cigars; that he had been to Lubbock's bank, and they had told him that they had orders to pay, but being a crossed cheque it must be passed through a bank—ho assured me that it was perfectly right, and it would put him to great inconvenience because he had not given it a thought of the cheque being crossed, and he could not get the money—he asked me to make him an advance, to give him a post-dated cheque of my own for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated the 15th; he said he had an account to pay at Bradford the next morning, and that it would save his commercial reputation if it was paid, and eventually I gave him a post-dated cheque; I was to pay the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque in to my bank, and it would be collected and the balance would be in my bank before my 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque became due—I paid in the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, and it was returned on the 13th through my bank marked "No account"—I stopped my 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque the same morning; Chater was to call for the balance of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday or Tuesday, the 12th or 13th; he did not call—I communicated with him, and on Friday, the 16th, he came with Stephenson, who was a stranger to me—the shop was closed; Chater rang the bell; I went to the door and said, "You have some one with you"—he wanted to come in—I said, "I don't want any of your friends inside," and I declined to admit his friend—Chater came inside and I closed the door—he asked me if I had got the balance of the cheque—I said, "You are quite aware that the cheque was no good"—he said the cheque was perfectly good, and he had taken it of March, of Poplar, as he had stated to me—I said, "Then the best thing we can do is to go and see March, of Poplar, to see if this is correct"—I then said, "Who is your friend outside?"—he said, "Mr. Charles Davis, solicitor, of Cheapside"—I then went out with him, and he introduced me to Stephenson; he said, "This is Mr. Charles Davis"—we then all three went to Poplar and saw March; we went into the shop, and I asked March if he had given Chater a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in payment of two cases of cigars—he said, "No, I never had a business transaction with Chater; in fact, I have no knowledge of him"—I said, "Then it is not true that he got this cheque from you?"—I had the cheque with me; March asked me to produce it—he said, "No, I never saw it"—Chater and March then commenced a quarrel, and I left, leaving Stephenson, Chater, and March together—I came from Poplar by the last train, and Stephenson and Chater came in the same train, I believe in the same carriage—when we, got out of the train Stephenson said, "You can see plainly enough that March knows all about this cheque"—I said, "I decline to have anything to say about it till I have consulted my solicitor"—Stephenson said, "Who is your solicitor?"—I said, "Mr. Crossfield, of</p>

               <p>Mark Lane, Ellis and Crossfield"—he said, "Then you had better refer Mr. Crossfield to me; I have not a card, but Mr. Charles Davis, of Carey Street, Cheapside"—next morning March and Beaumont called on me; March said, "I have come to know why you disturbed me so late last night about the cheque, I know nothing about it, I have never had a business transaction with Chater in my life"—I said "Who is this gentleman with you?"—he said "It is my solicitor"—Beaumont then said "Do you know what you have done?"—I said "No"—he said "Well, you have given a post-dated cheque, for which you are liable to a penalty of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if you take any steps in this matter we shall lay an information against you and enforce the penalty"—I then ordered them to leave and they then left—this is my 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque produced—I went and saw Mr. Grout about it—I wrote to Rocke and Eyton, of Shrewsbury, about the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque and got an answer—I applied for a warrant against Chater—Mr. Grout showed me these three bills produced and left them in my hands for inquiry—I had seen one of them before—I believe it was the one for 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I could not positively swear to it—that was about a week before I gave Chater the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—Chater showed it to me and asked me to discount it—he said that Stephenson had been in the habit of paying him with a cheque, but that he had sent in this bill by post, stating that trade was bad and he could not get it discounted—I returned it to him and he took it away, this is it. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "London, July 10th, 1878.

Stephenson, 2, Carey Lane, Post-office, London; drawn by Frank Chater, accepted by Charles Stephenson, payable at the London and County Bank, Shoreditch; endorsed "Frank Chater, 65, Lefevre Road, Old Ford, London, E"—when I get these bills from Grout I made inquiries respecting the acceptors—I did not try to get the money, they were not due—I went to the addresses—I went to Beaumont's address and to Stephenson's address which was given on the bills—I went to 23, Wilson Street, Finsbury; I found the name of Beaumont and Co. on the door-post, but there was no one in the office—I then went to 2, Carey Lane; I could not find Stephenson there or any one of that name—when Chater showed me this bill for the larger amount, I said "I don't know who Stephenson is"—he said "I am very much surprised at that, you being in the trade; he is a large staymaker, carrying on business in 2, Carey Lane; I thought every one knew him"—I saw a person at 2, Carey Lane—after the first hearing of the case against Chater, March called on me—a person named Tickell called first—March and Beaumont called together—March said that he had called to see if we could not come to some settle<lb/>ment—I said "I have nothing to say to you, this is your solicitor; what is his name?"—Beaumont said "I am not a solicitor, my name is Hughes, I am summoned for the defence"—I said "Then you are Beaumont?"—he said "Yes, Beaumont Hughes"—I said "Then I have nothing to say to either of you, get out of my place"—they left; nothing more passed—when Rocke's cheque was presented to me I thoroughly believed it to be a bond fide cheque—I should certainly not have advanced the money had I not believed it—a person named Tickell called on me twice with reference to this affair—these documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came to me by hand in this envelope—a child left them wrapped up as a parcel—both letters are in Chater's writing.

I saw Beaumont on two occasions; the first was at my place of business—he came with March—he sat down in a chair in the shop while I conversed with March—March said he was his solicitor—Beaumont did not himself say that he was a solicitor—the next time I saw him was on the Friday night, when he came into the shop with March and said what I have stated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Chater.</hi> You first called on me about this cheque on the 11th, and afterwards on Friday, the 16th—it had been returned on the 13th—I received a letter from you on the morning of the 15th, asking me to wire you whether the cheque had been met or not—you did not call on me on that same evening; when you did call, you asked me for the balance of the cheque—when you had my cheque you did not deposit any security with me besides the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I received that same day a security for a previous advance—you gave it me enclosed in an envelope—I did not see what it was at the time—I afterwards found it was two contract-notes for two pieces of silk in pledge—I had lent you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. four or five days previously—the securities are in the hands of the solicitor to the Treasury—I decidedly did not receive them as security for my cheque—after I had given you the cheque you apologised for not giving me the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "You had better give me an I O U"—you had a broken finger at the time, and said you could not write, and you gave me these two documents enclosed, and said, "Here is something worth 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; put that in your cash-box, and I will bring you the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the morning"—you gave me the tickets as security for the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not open them till after the cheque was returned—I have known you 12 years, perhaps more—your letter was dated from High Wycombe; but posted at Richmond—I applied to your wife on the 13th, the day the cheque was returned, and she said you had gone into the City and would be home to tea—you were in town that day, I had the means of knowing—your wife came to me on the 13th after the cheque was stopped, and showed me a telegram; it was open—she said you had gone to Bristol—I did not go to your wife afterwards and say you were a foolish man not to have come to me—I went with a sergeant of police past your house, your wife was standing at the door, I am not quite sure that I spoke to her, she had been ill, I believe I said, "Your husband is a very foolish man never to go near any one about this affair, to let it come to this pass"—she said, "He is in the public-house below"—she said she had persuaded you to come and see me or Mr. Grout about the affair, but she could do nothing with you—I went down to Mrs. March four times.</p>

I lent him—I did not ask him for any security—I asked him for an acknow<lb/>ledgment, because he had not returned it—it was only as security for the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that he handed me these two duplicates—I did not ask him whether I should deduct the 10a that he owed me from the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I did not suggest that I should give him a cheque for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said before the Magistrate that Chater was drunk when he came with Stephenson—I think I said he had been drinking—he was excited from drink—the conversation with Stephenson took place in Addington Road, Bow, in coming from the Bow Railway Station—I did not say before the Magistrate that I travelled alone in the carriage; they got out of the same train; they may have been in the same carriage, but not in the same compartment—I was perfectly sober—when I went to 2, Carey Lane, I saw a man who represented him<lb/>self as Mr. Masters—I saw the name of Masters up; he did not tell me what he was—I beg pardon, the man I saw was not Masters—at the time Stephenson said "You can see plainly there March knows all about the cheque," I had formed an opinion too; I was of the same opinion as Stephenson.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. I believe in my cross-examination at the police-court I said that I would not have given this cheque except on the faith of its being received from March—I gave it on the faith of Chater's statement, not on the faith of his statement that he had received it from March—I said at first that I did, but I was not allowed to explain—I was cross-examined by Mr. Abbott, and he put it to me, "Would you have given him the change only on the faith of his only having had it from March?" and I said "No"—of course, if he had brought me a cheque which he picked up in the street I should not have cashed it—I believed he had taken it in a business transaction—I had no idea who March was—I did not take it on Chater's statement that he had it from Rock—I never heard a word about his having had it from Rocke—I never saw Chater to speak to him but once after the cheque was dishonoured; that was on Friday night, 16th August—I saw him several times, you understand, but only once to have conversation with him; that was the time he called for the balance of the cheque; nothing was said about Rocke then; not a word—I saw the name on the cheque in the first instance, and asked him who Rocke was—I gave him the cheque on the faith of his statement entirely—I did not take pains to find out who the drawer of the cheque was at the time Chater gave it to me—I said "Who is Rock?" and he replied "Rocke is a brother of the member of the bank on which the cheque is drawn"—I did not make any further inquiry—it was at Chater's request that I post-dated the cheque after I declined to give him an open cheque—I had no doubt about the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he gave it to me; his object was to get the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by some means, or to get anything—he did not suggest the date of the 15th; I swear that—he said the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was payable at Lubbock's, and would be got on the Saturday morning—I was asked at the police-court what my balance was at the bank at the time I gave this 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I did not decline to answer—I beg your pardon, I was not asked what my balance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187901130057"/>
               <p>was—I was asked to produce the bank book, and in the absence of my solicitor I declined—I had it in my pocket—Chater did not say "If you give me your cheque post-dated, and it should not be paid, yours will not be presented till after the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque is, and I will give you the money or the cheque back and take back my securities"—I never saw the securities until after the cheque was returned through the bank—I did not know what they were, only from his statement—he said they were duplicates for silk, and that they were worth 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not say that one was in pledge for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I say that I took them for the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and not as collateral security for the cheque.</p>

The representation made to me when March came with the other person to settle the matter was that they were sorry for Chater and his wife—I did hear a rambling statement about giving the cheque to the Shrewsbury Bank—I did not understand from March that Chater had been taken in in the matter—I do not remember his telling me that Chater had given a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque for the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that Mr. Dunn's cheque would not be presented until the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was honoured, and that Chater had been deluded and had not intentionally acted wrongly.</p>

I am a clerk and cashier at Lubbock's bank—they are agents for Rocke and Co., bankers, of Shrewsbury, upon whom the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was drawn—I am in the country office—I know the country business—cheques are not paid in London unless we have special instructions—that is a course of business which all the clerks are familiar with—that cheque was not paid or presented—it would be presented at the Shrewsbury Bank for payment—some little time after the cheque was returned from Shrews<lb/>bury, Chater came to our bank—I think he stated that a summons had been issued—he said some one of our clerks had given an answer to the cheque, and he came to see if he could find him—he said that answer was that the cheque was all right, but must be paid through another bank—no clerk or cashier would have given such an answer—I told him so—he gave me a description, but we had no one in the office answering that description.</p>

I need only say that upon adjournment I shall be most happy to attend, but the testimony I can give I imagine would most aid the prosecution. My cheque was given to Mr. March for a totally different purpose from that to which it was used, which appears to me to be an attempt to frighten my brother in the Shrewsbury Bank into paying the money to avoid exposure. I never knew that March had parted with it till it came to my knowledge through the Shrewsbury Bank, and that Chater was trying to extort 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from them to settle the matter; as I feel sure no money has passed it may be settled. I shall be very happy to attend, especially as I have suffered most severe losses through the treachery of March and his associates, whom I don't even know. Signed A. B. Rocke.") I also received this diary, in which I find numerous references to most of the parties in it—it begins on the 21st March—I find references, for instance, to Barth and Tickell, F. Reeves, and others—it is simply a scribbling diary—the last entry is October 4th, "Chater 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due"—I produce an I O U from Rocke to Beaumont for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated September 18th—I received it from Miller, but not with this bundle—this is a bundle I received in a cash-box which Miller brought from a public-house in the neighbourhood of Wilson Street—there is a post-card in it, and a letter addressed to Chater by a Mr. Perring, of Welling borough, dated 16th October, 1878: "Have not heard from you since taking four pair of samples from Mr. Norman. I have ex<lb/>pected a line from you with some orders, please remit me post-office order. Your kind attention with orders will much oblige. "Here is a memorandum dated from Aldersgate Street making an appointment for 10 o'clock, another with the initials T.

Hughes and Co.: "Your promissory note for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due on Saturday, let me hear from you without fail on Friday. "Here is a further letter from the same people: "I am surprised not to have heard from you or seen you; no alternative but to realise at your expense to-morrow. "That is addressed to A. B. Hughes—then there is a receipt for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit on letting two rooms on second-floor at 29, Fenchurch Street, at an annual rent of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a bill for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on March, due September 13th, 1878, drawn by Augustus Beaumont Hughes, payable at the London and County Bank, Limehouse—these are papers that were given to me from the cash-box by Miller.</p>

                  </hi>. I am general manager to Messrs. Waterlow, stationers, in the City—in April last year Beaumont called to order some printing and stationery—he gave his name and address as "Beaumont, 23, Wilson Street"—I made inquiry, and eventually executed the order; they were printed memorandum headings and letter paper with headings; that was done by his direction—I asked him for a reference, as he was a total stranger—he did not mention any name, but I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read: "5, New Square, Lincoln's Inn. 5th April, 1878. Messrs. Beaumont and Co. have requested me to write and tell you that I have known Mr. J. Beaumont for many years, and I have much pleasure in doing so, and in stating you will be quite safe in trusting him to any reasonable amount Yours truly, Francis C. Reeves.</hi>") I referred to the Law List, and found that Mr. Reeves was entered as a barrister-at-law at that address—I did not supply the order upon that; I sent this memorandum to Mr. Beaumont: "Your reference, Mr. Reeves, being unknown to us, we think it will save time if you will favour us with a deposit of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."

He left those two bills, and wanted 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to send again to London for wages—I advanced him the money—he said Stephenson was a customer and bought a great many cigars—I relied upon the letter received with the bills, which I supposed to be a genuine business transaction—at the same time I held a bill for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was coming due in a week or two, on which I had advanced 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was of course to have the balance—I passed that bill through my bank; it was dishonoured—all the bills were dishonoured—I wrote previously to Stephen<lb/>son</p>

I was with Sergeant Miller when the Reeves were apprehended—in consequence of information I received I went to 19, Elgin Road, Maida Vale, in November—Mr. Avery, the occupier of the rooms I went to search, stated that Mr. Rocke had been the tenant pre<lb/>viously—I found several documents there now in possession of the prosecu<lb/>tion—in the drawer of a desk I found some papers, and handed them over to Mr. Wontner—I apprehended Beaumont on the 22nd October, in Fen-church Street, in the street—the warrant was read over to him by Miller—he replied he knew nothing about it—I said "That is not the only charge against you, there are several others for obtaining goods at various parts when you were in Wilson Street"—he said "I was only a servant there managing the business for Reeves, the barrister, and his brother"—he said he had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week salary, but they did not pay him after the first week; that they traded as Beaumont and Co., and that all the goods they had were paid for, with the exception of 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if he got into any trouble it would be through Chater—I asked him to accompany me to his office, which he did, at 79, Fenchurch Street—"Beaumont and Hughes "was painted on the door—I said "Here you are as Beaumont again"—he replied "I was going to trade as Beaumont, but my proper name is Hughes"—he opened the door of the office, and it was perfectly empty—he said "I have not com<lb/>menced business yet"—I said "You have March here"—I saw March's name on the next door—he said "Yes, I have let him the office next door"—I then arrested him.</p>

(that was the adjourned summons in Dunn's case)—Chater said "Adjourned again"—Stephenson said "What is the meaning of it?" and walked with me—I was going to get the warrants, but I did not tell him so—I did not take Chater in custody—I took Rocke on 7th November at the London and County Club, Langham Place—I read the warrant to him; he said that he had seen it in the Times, and had been to the police-court, but had not been called as a witness or put in the dock—I said that I could not help it, he would have to go to the station with, me; he said "March did not tell the truth; it was the cheque I gave March, and he gave false evidence at the police-court," alluding to the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque in Dunn's case—I went with Peele on 21st November to 2, Carlton Cottages, Rayner Park, Wimbledon—I made a parcel up, and sent a strange man with it; he knocked at the door, and a female came and said "Who is there?" the man said "I have brought a parcel for Mr. Reeves, a barrister," and he replied, "He is not here, he is in Cork, in Ireland"—the door had not been opened—he said "Well, I will take the parcel back where I got it from"—the door was then opened, and Mr. Burke Reeves came to the door and said "I am Mr. Francis Reeves, the barrister's brother; I will take the parcel"—I slipped inside and said "I am a police officer, and hold a warrant for your apprehension"—he went back into the parlour, and behind the parlour door was Francis Reeves—I said "This is your brother; I have also got a warrant for your apprehension for conspiring with five others in custody to obtain goods"—Francis Reeves said "Mention one item," and I said "Glue"—he said "Who has laid the information?"—I said "A man named Taylor, I believe"—he said "He is a fine gentle<lb/>man to lay an information," taking something from his pocket and putting it on the back of a table by the window—it was this banker's pass-book and a document of a will—Francis Reeves said that he denied himself because the sheriffs were after him, and he thought it was the sheriffs' officer knocking at the door—they were both taken to Bow Street station (<hi rend="italic">This was the pass<lb/>book of Francis Reeves, showing a cheque of</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to "Beaumont" on</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The copper was in the store on 28th September—it was a large copper, burnt through at the lower riveting-rim—a patch had been put in, and the patch was burnt through again—there were three skins to it—the copper I afterwards saw at Mr. Ginman's was a similar one, with all those peculiarities—I know Mr. Slaughter, the surgeon-major—this certificate is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "McManus is very ill indeed.") I was present when the case was heard before the Magistrate—Miller was charged, and the prosecution was withdrawn—the prisoner was also charged, and was repre<lb/>sented by Mr. Hughes—he had an opportunity of cross-examining McManus—one of the two entrances leads up to the commandant's house, and the other direct to the office by steps—a cart could not go up them.</p>

I received the keys from Mr. Jacobs. I should say I received the keys between 11 and 1 o'clock, and from that time I had charge of the store. Mr. Miller's successor was appointed on Oct. 14. I ceased to be employed in that capacity. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not the stores given over to me officially—I would not consider myself respon<lb/>sible if half the things had gone away, the doors and windows being insecurely fastened—one of the windows had fallen by its own weight—I remember seeing a man named Jupp in the store for cement shortly before I had the keys—I could not say whether the copper was there then or not—there are two compartments in that store—I do not know in which compartment the copper was kept—I had heard Miller had complained of the insecure fastenings of the place—when you open the door of the store you can see into both compartments.</p>

Richard Ginman. About 6.30 a.m. on Monday, 30th September, Piper came and asked me if would buy a copper—I said "Yes," and he brought it at about 7 o'clock in a van which I did not notice a name on—I did not notice the driver—I paid Piper 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—about a fortnight after Whitlock came and I showed him the copper.</p>

I am eight years old—I have been living with my father and mother, at 2, Russell Court, Old Kent Road—the prisoner is my mother, my father is a basket maker—there are four children besides me, I am the eldest—we only had one room—the baby was the one that died—her name was Ellen, she was 11 weeks old—it died on a Saturday; I don't know how long it was before the Saturday that this matter occurred—mother was in the room and had the baby, father came home in the evening and they were quarrelling, I don't know what about; she went outside the door, father shut her out, she came in again, and sat down and gave the baby some tittie, father told her to be quiet, after that mother went to the door and set the baby down, she threw it down on the floor, it cried—it began to cry before, and when it was thrown down it began to cry again—father picked it up, and then it left off crying—he knocked mother down and went upstairs and asked the lady upstairs to take the baby, mother was then in the passage—father came down without the baby—mother told him to bring it down, he did not, and she went up and brought it down and gave it a drop of tittie, and father knocked mother down, and the baby fell out of her arms—father hit mother in the jaw, and she got up and said, "All right, you have broken my jaw-bone"—the baby fell on the floor, mother sat down—father picked the baby up, gave it to me, and told me to take it upstairs to the lady, I did, and the lady said mother had taken it away from her, and I took it down again—I did not hear it cry when it fell on that occasion—father made the bed, and I went to bed, I don't know when they went to bed—this was about half-past 11—mother had had a little drop, and I think father had, too—mother fetched the doctor, and he told her to keep the baby quiet; I don't know when the doctor was fetched—I never saw mother do anything to hurt the baby, except on this occasion.</p>

Why don't you open the door for me?"—he said "We have had a little fright, if you had heard what I have heard you would not ask me why I did it"—I said "What, chop a woman's head open"—he walked out—Mrs. Baker at this time was in the closet—I fetched a policeman—she would not come out till the policeman came—I saw her head bleeding very much, pouring down her neck into her.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The letter was directed to John Sears, asking him to send the money that Mr. Sefton said he would send.</hi>) When I went out my father came to the door and shut it after me; there had been no quarrelling between my father and mother before I left—I heard him say a week before that mother would not live long, he would settle her—he did not say why—when I came back I found a police<lb/>man in the house.</p>

I said 'Very well,' and let go, and she threw it into the coal cupboard. I took her into the back washhouse and bathed her head. She said 'Let me have a drop of brandy.' I took her into the bedroom and she had some brandy and gave me some as well.

I have done nothing"—I said "We will take you in custody for being concerned with others in uttering counterfeit coin"—I think I said "Florins"—he said "You have made a mistake this time; I have not done anything"—I took Quinlan, and Macey took the other two—Quinlan was rather rough—he said "If you were single-handed, you should not take me alone"—Thomas tried hard to get away from Macey—we pushed them into a shop and waited till a constable in uniform came, and the three were taken to the station—I saw Macey search Quinlan—a packet of tea and sugar was found upon him.</p>
