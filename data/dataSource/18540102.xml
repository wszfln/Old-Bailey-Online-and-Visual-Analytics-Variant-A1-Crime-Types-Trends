                  </hi>. I was married to Mr. Burton in Feb., 1853; his name is Thomas Jones Burton. In the year 1852 I became acquainted with the defendant Crutchley; he was introduced to me by a person of the name of Stanborough—the first transaction between us was his getting me to dis<lb/>count a bill for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did discount it—I think it was upon the application of Stanborough, who was to take it to Mr. Crutchley, at Brighton—I was asked, as a very great favour, if I would lend him that money; and I never, until then, discounted a bill in my life, or ever did to anybody but them—before that bill became due, an application was made to me by Crutchley, with regard to another bill—that was a bill for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was represented to me by Crutchley that a lady of the name of Nash wanted some money—the bill purported to be drawn by her—I made inquiries about it—I went to a Miss Bowles—I made inquiries about every bill, though I have been so deceived—I gave back the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money for that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—that was 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I advanced upon that bill—that was what he himself said I ought to give—I never suggested what I was to give—it was Crutch<lb/>ley's own suggestion—I did not know what I was to give—before that bill of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. became due, another bill was offered to me by Crutchley—that was a bill of a person of the name of Rawson, upon Wright; it wag a promis<lb/>sory</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401020002"/>
               <p>note for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Crutchley brought it me—by the tenor of that note I should say that Wright was to pay the money upon it—it might be from Wright to Rawson, I cannot say—I am sure Wright was the person that was to pay it—when Crutchley brought me that note he told me that Wright was a man of large fortune; landed property in Northumberland—he told me the name of the place where he lived was Whitley-court—that was the name of his residence—I asked Crutchley particularly that I might see Wright; but he always told me, throughout the whole affair, that Wright was a person that did not wish to have anything to do with ladies; that it was all right; but that I could not see him, because he did not wish to have anything to do with ladies in the affair; but that he would see that it was all right—I said I could not advance such a large sum of money; that I had never done anything of the kind; and that I could not do it unless I knew that Mr. Wright was really the man of fortune that he was represented to be—upon that Crutchley said, "There is a gentleman, a friend of his, who will be up in London about this time, and you had better come and see this person, and he will satisfy you who and what Mr. Wright is"—it was then arranged that I and Crutchley were to go and see this person—I cannot remember the day on which we went, but it was in the beginning of May, because I know on the 13th May I went to Childs', the bankers', to draw out the money—Crutchley and Stanborough went with me to see this person—we went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> together—Stanborough got out before we got to the place—I cannot swear where the place was—I was talking at the time, and I really do not know—it was at an hotel, either in Berners-street or the lower part of Oxford-street, or Holborn—it was a large hotel—when we got there Mr. Crutchley inquired for Mr. Gray or Grake—I cannot exactly remember the name, but it was not Morton—I am quite sure of that—he asked if this Mr. Gray or Grake was within—the answer was that he was—Crutchley then said to me, "You had better go up alone, because you can ask questions better without me than with me; ask every thing you like"—I went up alone, and was introduced into a room where I saw a person who I have since known as Morton, and who was tried here last Session, and convicted—he is the person who was represented to me as Mr. Gray or Grake—he was sitting there with a bag of papers, like a lawyer—I said I had come to inquire about a Mr. Wright, who I was told was a man of large landed property in Northumberland, that I was going to lend some money, and wished to know if he was highly respectable, and a man of fortune—Morton said that he was a man of large fortune, and highly respectable—he said, "Your money is as safe as possible," and said that the fortune was in Northumberland, and consisted of landed estates; that the residence was Whitley-court, and that he was a near neighbour of his, and the money was as safe as could possibly be—before I left, Crutchley came up stairs into the room, and said, "Well, have you asked what questions you pleased of Mr. Gray?" or "Grake"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Are you satisfied?"—I said, "Yes; this gentleman says he is a near neighbour of his, and is a man of large fortune, and my money is perfectly safe"—I said I wanted to see Mr. Wright; he said I could not, and I said I must have the money back in October, as that was the time I wanted it—Crutchley assured me that I should have it, and I lent the money—I went to Childs', the bankers', to get it; Crutchley went with me—I advanced a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and about 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 660<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 670<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash; it was 970<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, but you know I have never had a farthing back—I had 378<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Childs'—about June, Crutchley came to me again with a bill of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Colonel</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401020003"/>
               <p>Bulkeley on Mr. Wright—I said I knew something of Mr. Bulkeley; I knew the lady he had married, and I did not think he was a man of large fortune; Mr. Crutchley assured me that he was—of course I advanced the money again—Crutchley said it was all right about "Wright, and he repeated to me in the most solemn manner that it was all right, that I should never lose any of the money, that it was as safe as possible—in consequence of those representations, I gave back the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money for the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I have got that written down on a piece of paper, which I can swear to—it is only a scrap of paper—I received 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for discount—he was the person that suggested it, and I had confidence in him, and thought him very honourable—it was the bond that was to be paid in Oct.—the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill would fall due in about two or three months—about the middle of Aug. Crutchley came to me, and said he had been thinking of the affair, and it would be much better to change the bill into a bond, because it would be so much more secure—I asked him over and over again; and I asked Stanborough the same, and he said it would be so much more secure on land, on his own Land, his estates at Whitley-court—the bond was to be for 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was to go with him to Mr. Boucher, a lawyer, at Guildhall, for the bond to be given—I saw a letter from Wright at Mr. Boucher's at that time, saying that he should be in funds in Oct.—Crutchley showed it to me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bond—it purports to be made from Wright to Crutchley; and I said it was a very extraordinary thing, as the money was mine, that it should be made out to him, and he said that made no difference—he always said Mr. Wright did not wish to have anything to do with ladies—that was told me every time—before the bond was signed, I said I could not advance so much as the additional 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Crutchley said, "I will join you in doing it"—he said he would pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was to pay the rest—I paid about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave back the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill of Captain Bulkeley, and gave 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Crutchley—he was to make up the difference—I never had the bond myself at that time, it was kept by Mr. Boucher—in Dec., 1852, or Jan., 1853, Crutchley called on me, and said if I gave him a bill for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I should have his interest in the bond—I did so, and Mr. Burton has paid it since my marriage—between Oct. and that time I had made application constantly to Crutchley for the money, which was to be paid in Oct., and he said he did not suppose it made any difference to me, as I was receiving 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, and he supposed it was not convenient to Mr. Wright—I have never received the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent.—I asked him for it several times, whenever I saw him, because I wanted the money—I told him repeatedly that I never should have lent it if he had not assured me that I should have it back in Oct.—I have frequently seen Mr. Wright, and he assured me that he had not 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the world—if I had once seen him, I never would have lent him the money—I first saw him two or three months ago, when this trial was first coming on—with great difficulty he had been found—I went to a house to identify Morton, and there I saw Wright—I saw a person named Wright at the Police-court at the time when Crutchley and Morton were under examination—I heard Wright examined—there was no other Wright examined with reference to this particular case—I do not speak about his personal appearance, because a most gentlemanly man may look vulgar; but I never saw a more vulgar, low man than he was—just before my marriage, I told the defendant he had always promised me that the money should be paid on 18th Feb.; and after my marriage, when I came back from Paris, which was much about</p>

               <p>that time, I spoke to him about it, and he then said he had done a great deal better for me, he had made it into another bond for 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it would not now be paid till 1855, and I was to receive 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent., for it, and he had added another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the interest—nothing was advanced by me after that—that bond was in Mr. Boucher's hands, and we paid 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for preparing it—I have never received any portion of the money I advanced—I afterwards called on Mr. Crutchley, at his residence, and frequently spoke to him about it—a few days before the last Session, I was at a ball at Willis's rooms, and saw Mr. Hawke, Crutchley's solicitor, there—he joined in a game at whist, at which I was engaged, and asked me if I would speak to him after the game was over, and by his inducement I went with him to Crutchley, in the Bench, and saw him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether, when this young man came of age, that he became a partner of your husband? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Upon my honour, I do not know anything of the affairs of the business; I have an independent fortune—my husband is a Church decorator, in Wigmore-street, but it has nothing to do with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know, as well as that I am speaking to you, that this young man, when he came of age, sold whatever property he had, and advanced upwards of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to your husband in March, 1853? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not; I have heard that there has been some squabbling about money, but I have never listened to it; it does not at all concern me.</p>

               <p>consulted the solicitor in the least about it—I was told, to my utter surprise, that this young man had chosen to call himself my next friend, and as he had been a <hi rend="italic">very kind friend</hi> to me, I thought that was all I had to do with it—before this indictment was preferred, I heard that he had instituted a Chancery suit, but I do not know anything about it—I never spoke to the solicitor about it, but I was spoken to about it, and certainly disclaimed his being my next friend—I have never heard my husband threaten to ruin this young man; I believe he is too good a man—I believe Mr. Crutchley went out of town in Aug., 1852—he was out of town a few weeks, I should think; I do not know that it was longer—he went after I had got the bond—I believe this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my husband's writing—this other letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my husband's writing—I made inquiry about Mrs. Nash through Miss Bowles—I did not make inquiries about Captain Bulkeley at all; I had known his family, and I believed him to be honest—I relied on Crutchley as regards Captain Bulkeley, and I knew him to be a gentleman, and a very different man to Wright, I should say; that is from what I now know of Wright—they said that Wright was not here on the morning when the last trial took place; I never saw him then—I have seen him frequently—I have never given Wright one farthing at any time—I have never authorized any one to do so for me—he has certainly not been main<lb/>tained by me, or by any one I know—at the time I visited Crutchley's mother, Mrs. Millbank, she resided in Harewood-street, Harewood-square—I asked Mr. Stanborough to make inquiries about Rawson for me—I asked him at the same time to make inquiries about Mr. Wright for me—I took every precaution I could—I have not seen Stanborough for these two or three months; I do not know exactly how long, perhaps two months—his family are respectable, but he, I think, cannot be—his family are very poor, but I believe his mother is a very, lady-like woman—I have certainly lent them money, which they have never repaid me—I lent the mother 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I shall never see again—that was without any bill at all—I know they are very poor—I do not know that they are otherwise than respectable—I do not recollect that the name of Lord Hastings was mentioned to me by any one—I never made any inquiries at all from Lord Hastings—I cannot say that Stanborough might not have done so—I never told him to do so—he told me that Rawson was of a very respectable family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Get me out, that's a good fellow; and believe me, faithfully yours, W. M."—"W. C. Wright, Esq., 14, Windsor-terrace, Yarmouth, Saturday, 4 o'clock, Jan 29th, 1853. Dear Wright,—I have not seen <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>, therefore I am at a loss to know what he is about. I suppose you wrote to him the letter I sent you to copy. I suppose he will send you the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by this post I was much annoyed at not hearing from you to-day. Mind and write by to-morrow's post, but do not fail. Yours truly, W.

My dear Wright,—<hi rend="italic">Fred</hi> called here to-day, and to my surprise gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, of which I enclose you a post-office order for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable at Yarmouth, to W. C. Wright, made by Mrs. Elizabeth Morton, of No. 6, Bedford-place, Pimlico. You must be in town on Wednesday, to meet him at Burdon's Hotel, at half past 3 o'clock, but I wish to see you previous thereto; be in London, if possible, early on Wednesday mornings and we will make arrangements for me to get out at once, and in all probability I will return with you to Great Yarmouth. Be true to me and rest assured I will stick to you through life, and you shall find me a good friend; for I can have the command of plenty of money at once, and am happy to say without the party we are now serving. P. S. The reason of my sending you 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is, that I was without a shilling, and could not get any money, but will make it right when in town."—(<hi rend="italic">Two other letters, doled</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th Feb.</hi>, 1853, <hi rend="italic">were also read.</hi>)—"Burdon's Hotel, 9th Feb., 1853. (<hi rend="italic">This letter had no envelope</hi>) My dear Wright,—Strain a nerve, and be in London on Saturday morning; I shall not get out before; and be with me, and I feel confident I can go on with you to <hi rend="italic">Fred;</hi> and I will undertake you shall have the money in the course of the day. He was with me to-day, but I could not get any money from him; but he assured me if you would be in London on Saturday he would complete the transaction with you. If you cannot come up to London, get some person at Yarmouth to witness the bond, and send it to me; and I give you my word I will not part with it until I get the money from him, which I will, without taking one halfpenny, remit you by Saturday's post. Do not neglect, for we can get money from him after this transaction in a bill. Faithfully yours, W. M. P. S. Surely Hudson would lend you 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a day or two. Nothing will prevent your having the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on your arrival."</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Gurney, of West Ham. On the 27th Dec, about 12 o'clock at noon, I was on the box of his carriage in Bishopsgate-street—there was no one in the carriage—it was standing still—I felt a jerk at the carriage—I turned round, and saw this man with half his body inside the door of the carriage—he had the shawl on his arm, and was in the act of taking a reticule bag and umbrella from the carriage—when I turned round he looked me in the face, snatched the articles from the carriage, and ran away with them down Camomile-street—I jumped down from the carriage, and followed him—he dropped the things in Camomile-street, as I was running after him—I followed him up St. Mary Axe, and came up with him just as the policeman stopped him—I had only lost sight of him as he turned the corner—I am sure the man who was stopped was the same man who ran off with the things—I saw him drop them, and a person took them up and gave them to me—they belonged to Miss Sarah Gurney, she had come up in the carriage that day—I had set her down at Houndsditch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police on the Eastern Counties Railway. On the evening of 2nd Dec, from information I received, I proceeded to the house of Mr. M'Namara—I went with him and a constable and a private individual to Bluegate-flelds, Ratcliff-highway—I found, on the top of a ladder leading to a loft, a number of bundles of baskets—that was the usual entrance to the loft, and that entrance was blocked up by those baskets—they were packed in bundles—there were ten or eleven bundles—I suppose about a dozen in each bundle: dry fish baskets—I pointed them out to Mr. M'Namara—I obtained permission to go round to the front of the loft—I got in, and found many hundred baskets—I could not get far enough in the loft to count them—numbers of them were marked—I took one, which is called a tally, off one bundle; this is it—I went from there to the Bird-in-Hand beer shop, in Church-street, Stepney—I found the prisoner Parker there officiating as landlord—I asked him if he were the owner of the loft where the baskets were—he, said he was—I asked him if he were in the habit of dealing in baskets—he said he did—I requested him to accompany me to the loft, which he did—when we got to the ladder that the baskets were on the top of, I took him up, and when he saw these eleven bundles of baskets on the top of the ladder he said, "I did not buy them, I did not take them; I know nothing about them; some of my <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> must have taken them in in my absence"—we then went round to the front of the loft, and on gaining admission I showed him a number of baskets, which I got from the piles marked—I asked him how he could account for the possession of them—he then commenced crying, and said, "Oh, don't ask me any questions; I am sure I cannot say; you see what is here"—Mr. M'Namara asked him what he gave for the baskets that were marked—he said 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—Mr. M'Namara said, "You know well, Parker, you had no business to buy them at 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; they are worth a shilling each"—Mr. M'Namara identified all the marked baskets—I then asked Parker if he had bought any baskets from <hi rend="italic">Solly</hi> Mitchell (meaning Hyams)—he said he had repeatedly bought from Mitchell—I asked if he expected any from Mitchell that day—he said he was not quite sure, but he thought he did—he then asked me to allow him to have his wife brought into the loft—I did, and when she came he said to her, "Oh, my dear, see what trouble I have got in; I expected that b—y <hi rend="italic">Solly</hi> Mitchell would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401020027"/>
               <p>do this for me some day"—he said, "Was he here yesterday?"—she said, "He and his wife were at our house yesterday" (this was between 12 and 1 o'clock on the Saturday morning)—I asked him if he did not consider he was doing wrong in buying so great a number of baskets at so low a price—he sat down on a bundle of baskets, and cried a great deal, and said, "Ask me no more questions"—I told him to consider himself in custody, and took him to the station—I went from there to Mitchell's residence—I took Bounce about 6 o'clock on the Saturday morning, on the platform of the Shoreditch station—I asked him if he had delivered any baskets on the previous evening to any person on his way from Billingsgate to the Eastern Counties station—he said "No"—I told him to consider himself in custody for delivering eleven bundles to the other prisoner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the first thing you said, that you charged him with an offence in delivering these baskets? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I charged him with delivering the baskets, and I asked him if he knew me—he said, "Yes; you are Mr. Gavin."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not the first words used by Bounce, "Very well, Sir, I must go?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not to my recollection—I stated all that was said in an<lb/>other place, as near as I can recollect—I am not quite certain that I put any questions to him till I told him he was in custody, but I believe I did—I think I can swear that I put questions to him before I told him he was in custody—I will swear it—I touched him on the shoulder, and said, "Rounce step this way with me"—I said, "Do you recollect delivering eleven bundles of baskets on the way to the station last night"—he said, "No"—I said, "Not to <hi rend="italic">Solly</hi> Mitchell"—he said, "No"—I said, "You may consider yourself in custody for having delivered eleven bundles of baskets to <hi rend="italic">Solly</hi> Mitchell, in the Tenter Ground, Spitalfields"—this is my signature to this deposition. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition being ready contained these words:</hi> "This morning I took the prisoner Bounce into custody on the platform at our station, at 10 minutes past 6 o'clock; I told him I charged him with stealing a quantity of fish pads last night from a van he was driving from Billingsgate to the station—he said, 'Very well'—I asked if he knew me—he said, 'Yes; you are Mr. Gavin'—that was all that passed.")</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that portion read to you before you signed the paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot exactly recollect it—my evidence was three-quarters of an hour in length—I think that statement was made by me before the Magistrate—I could not undertake to say—if I have not done so I ought, but I cannot undertake to say whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you repeated the question how he could buy these baskets at 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he would not answer; did you state that before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I did—if I did not I ought to have done it—I believe I men<lb/>tioned the price, 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., before the Magistrate, but I cannot undertake to swear it—I should think if I heard the word reiterated once, I did eight or ten times—I believe I made use of the words 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. before the Magistrate—I am not quite certain, so as to take my oath of it—I have taken a great many persons into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it, in the exercise of your duties, your habit to catechise prisoners in the manner you have told us you have to day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not my constant practice, but I do not wish to take a prisoner into custody till I have ascer<lb/>tained that there are lawful grounds for me to do so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>ten or a dozen certificates of character, which the prisoner had transmitted to Mr. Woodhouse—on Friday, 2nd Dec, the prisoner called at my place of business—I said to him, "I have received these documents" (holding the certificates in my hand) "from Mr. Woodhouse, the rector of Finingley, and he states that you have sent them to him, and are applying for the situation, of schoolmaster there"—he replied, "I sent these to Mr. Woodhouse"—at that time I had them before me, and produced them to him—among them was one purporting to have come from the Rev. Mr. Johnston, the rector of Lutterworth, dated in Nov., 1853—I told the prisoner that Mr. Woodhouse had requested me to see and examine, and judge of his qualifications, and if I thought him qualified, to engage him.</p>

               <p>you have received from Mr. Sharman, bearing my name, must be a forgery for I have given nothing of the kind, nor has Mr. Sharman ever been a master at any school in Lutterworth. Some ten or fifteen years back, or more, there was a Mr. Sharman, master to the infant school at Hinckley, and an excellent master he was; but his moral character proved to be such, that he was obliged to leave. If you can lay hold of the Mr. Sharman who has signed the testimonial, I think he ought to be punished. I suspect he is the man that was master of the infant school at Hinckley. I am, Sir, yours faithfully, R. H. Johnston."—when I had read the letter to him to the end, I observed that the initials to the letter did not corre<lb/>spond with the initials to the certificate—I observed that to him, and said, "How can you pretend this to be the signature of Mr. Johnston, when it has not his proper initials?"—the prisoner was confused; and I then said, "Do you still pretend to tell me that this certificate is his signature?"—he said, "No; but I am sure I have got the original among my papers, and I can find it."</p>

The committee have great pleasure in giving their certificate of good character to Mr. and Mrs. Sharman, and the ability with which they have conducted the infant school for the last four years."</p>

                  </hi>. I am rector of Lutterworth, in Yorkshire, and have been so about thirty-four years. The signature to this letter is mine, the signature to the certificate is not—I was not at all aware of its existence until I received a communication from Mr. Woodhouse—I wrote the letter to Mr. Woodhouse which has been read by Mr. Baxter—I cannot say how long it is since I had anything to do with the prisoner, but I believe above twenty years—in the month of Nov. last year, or within any recent period, I should not have given aim such a certificate, because I had no knowledge of him latterly; he had been a very good master at Hinckley—I was only upon the committee, the school was not under my control—I did not authorise anybody to write any such letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not I receive a most excellent character when I became master of the Hinckley school? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; you conducted the school to the satisfaction of myself and Mr. Dicey, who was a constant visitor—I do not know whether you resigned the school of your own accord—I cannot say what was the cause of your leaving—I cannot say that Mr. Dicey and myself came over to Hinckley to request you to continue in the school after you had resigned; it is above twenty years ago, and I really could not say one way or the other—I certainly say you were a very good master when you were at Hinckley, but after that I can say nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was he master at Hinckley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe about four years—he conducted it satisfactorily during all that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I not receive a most excellent character from the com<lb/>mittee of Hinckley on my removal to Sheffield? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe you did—you have not received letters from me since that period, that I know of—I cannot recollect writing to you when you were in the Isle of Wight, but I cannot say that I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I think it was a letter dated 1850; it is not among these papers; it was produced and read before the Magistrate at the first hearing, and I particularly requested the officer to be careful of it; in that letter Mr. John<lb/>ston states that he still remembered the excellent manner in which I had conducted the school. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I remember that he did conduct the school very well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> This letter was in consequence of there being a vacancy for a school at Lutterworth, and in the letter you state that you well recollect my excellent management of the Hinckley school, but in consequence of there being 168 applications for it, you advised me not to apply? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You call it to my recollection—I did hear of that, and I wrote a letter of that kind, telling you it was no good your applying for the school at Lutterworth—I have stated that I had nothing to do with you for twenty years, but I did not recollect that communication—you have brought it to my mind—I had no knowledge of where you were at all, or what you were doing—</p>

               <p>I cannot say that I sent you a letter by a Mr. Firth, about two years after you had gone to Sheffield, to know whether you were comfortable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have hinted in your letter to Mr. Woodhouse that there was something in my moral character that made me leave. Do you know Mr. Dicey's handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very well (<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter produced by the prisoner</hi>); this is his writing; it is dated 6th April, '42, and begins, "Dear Mr. Sharman,"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Dicey being a Magistrate, and a principal supporter of the Hinckley school, do you suppose, if there had been anything prejudicial to my character, he would have addressed me in '42 as "Dear Mr. Sharman?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I should say he would not—Mr. Dicey was certainly in a position to know whether there was anything prejudicial to your character or not, quite as much so as myself—you have been out of my sight for these twenty years, and I did not know at all what was passing with respect to you—I know Mr. Firth, of Ullasthorpe—I do not recollect sending a letter to you by him, I might have done so—I cannot say that I did or did not send such a letter a year and a half after you left Hinckley, wishing to know whether you were comfortable, and if not, the committee were anxious again to receive you—I do not know where the letter that I did write to you was directed, but I remember stating that it was no use your applying for the Lutterworth school, as there were so many other applicants—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one produced by the prisoner</hi>)—I state here that I well recollect your good management—it is dated 1849.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If so short a time since as 1849 you did not recollect having com<lb/>municated with me, is it not possible that you may have altogether forgotten having written a testimonial for me to the Rev: Thomas Sutton, some six-teen or eighteen years ago? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes! it is quite possible—I would not swear that I did not give Mr. Sutton a testimonial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You will not swear that this is not an exact copy of a testimonial that was given by you to Mr. Sutton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This signature is not mine, and the date is certainly of last year, Nov., 1853—I certainly have not the least recollection of giving Mr. Sutton a testimonial with the exact words there used; I believe I did not—I do 'not know when the testimonial to Mr. Sutton was given—at the time you left Hinckley I would have given you such a testimonial as this; but I would not have done it latterly—I have never, directly or indirectly, stated in any communication I have made to you, that I would not have done so; I have never, that I know of, ever hinted to you that there was anything incorrect in your conduct—you had no reason to anticipate from anything that you heard from me that I should change my mind with reference either to your character or ability—you never heard anything from me to that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How can you charge me with a forgery, if you do not know whether you gave me a certificate or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I know that in Nov. 1853, I gave no such certificate—I know this is not my handwriting, and there<lb/>fore I know that this is a forgery—I really think I did not give Mr. Sutton this; this is a forgery, because it is not my signature; therefore it is what I consider a forgery—it is not a copy of that given to Mr. Sutton, because the date is different; the date makes all the difference; I might give a very good certificate at one time, but many years afterwards a copy of that becomes a forgery—this does not profess to be a copy, but it professes to be my own, whereas it is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you did not recollect, until he called it to your memory, the transaction with respect to a correspondence about</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of the <hi rend="italic">Venus</hi>, trading from London to Newcastle. On Wednesday, 21st Dec., about 2 o'clock in the day, I came on to Tower-hill; as I came across, the prisoner Large asked me to be so kind as to show him the way to London-bridge; I told him I would show him as far as I was going—I was going to the Goal Exchange—he and I came across the hill, and in crossing Bear-lane, he said he was going in to have a glass of ale, would I come along with him—I told him my time was short, I did not wish to go; but by persuasion, I went with him into the Ship Afloat, in Bear-lane—Mr. Brown's name is over the door—Large went up stairs, and I followed him—he called for two glasses of ale; they were brought in and handed to Large, and stood on the table—another man came from the farther end of the room, and he showed to Large three nut shells—he said, "Those men who were sitting at the table, asked me what I called these, and I called them monkey skulls, which I brought from Gibraltar with me;" and he said to Large, "I will show you how I play with them"—Large sat down, and he asked me to sit down, and I sat down on his right hand—the prisoner Crane then came in, and sat down by the side of me; they did not appear to know each other—as soon as I sat down, he sat down on my right hand, and he got on playing with that gentleman who had the nut shells—I can hardly describe the play—there were three nut shells and a pea under them—I do not know whether Large began to play first, but one of them did—I do not know whether it was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at first—it was to know what shell the pea was under—one of the prisoners was betting with the man who was playing with them—I do not know which began first, but they both betted; one at a time—after that, Crane, who sat on my right hand, persuaded me to bet—he said, "You had better try"—I said, "I have only 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket; that is all I have—I betted the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I won; I found the pea the first time—Crane then put a half sovereign into my hand; he held the money—the man the shells belonged to staked the other 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Crane then said to me, "You had better try again: try your luck, you are lucky"—the man that had the nut shells was shuffling them about all the while, and he said he would bet a sovereign that no one would find out where the pea was; so I betted the half sovereign, and I just put my hand on the shell where I thought the pea was, and there was no pea there, and I lost—I said, "I have got no more money now, I am done"—one then consulted with the other; they looked at one and then at another—I looked at them, and they looked at me, and Crane said he was a loser too; but he did not say how much, and I do not know how much—Large then put his hand in his pocket, and said to me, "There are two sovereigns I will lend you"—I took the two sovereigns—he just put them into my hand, and said, "I will lend you these two sovereigns, you are sure to win this time"—the player was shuffling the shells round at the same time, and showing me the pea—I saw it two or three times—he then said he would bet five sovereigns to one, or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that no one would find the pea—the two prisoners said, "Try," and I betted the two sovereigns, and there was no pea there—I then said I had no more money; I was done again; and I came out of the house, and the two prisoners came out too—I do not know what became of the player;</p>

               <p>I did not see him—I walked up a little towards the Coal Exchange, and I said I was going to get some money—Crane said he was going to draw some money; he was going to a friend of his, and he would come back again to redeem his loss, for it would not do for him to lose—I said it would not do for me to lose either; I would do anything to get it back again—Crane then left us, and said he would be back in half an hour's time to the Ship Afloat—I then went on to my coal factor's, and drew 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and five sovereigns—when I came out of the office, I saw Large standing in the gallery—I had told him I was going to draw 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he and I went back to the Ship Afloat—as soon as we got in and sat down the man with the nutshells came in, and sat down by the side of us, and I had no sooner sat down than Crane came in—Large called for two glasses of ale, and we began to play again, and took turn and turn about—I think I betted a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note first, that was to find the pea, and I lost to the man who is not here—I do not know whether the next bet I made was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I went on betting, and lost—I put my hand into my pocket, and found I had only five sovereigns left—I gave Large his 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I betted the other 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I thought I might have a chance of getting something back again—I lost that, and I said, "Now I am a <hi rend="italic">hatter"</hi>—I suppose that means a man that has nothing—we then got up to go—the man whom the nutshells belonged to left the house first—the two prisoners and I stood up, and I took the glass of ale that was standing there—I had not touched any of it before—I took it up to drink—I said, "I am dry now," and both the prisoners persuaded me not to drink it—I said, "I must have a drink now, for I have paid dear for it"—I drank about half of it—I did not feel anything particular, but when I drank the half I held it up to the window, and I thought it was very thick, so I put it to my mouth again, and then stood the glass down—I did not drink the remainder—I put it to my mouth to taste if there was anything in it, and I did not taste it—the two prisoners and I came out of the house together—we separated at the top of the same lane—one took one road, and the other the other, and I walked to my ship, which was in Middle Hole—when I got to my vessel I sat down on a chair, and fell asleep for two hours—the mate persuaded me to go to bed, and I went to bed—I dare say it was half-past 4 o'clock when I got on board.</p>

I took Crane into custody on Wednesday, 28th Dec, about 10 o'clock at night, at the Duke of Wellington public house, in Cannon-street, St. George's in the East—I told him I took him on suspicion of defrauding two seamen out of money, one named Rogers, and the other Hamilton—he said he was entirely innocent, he did not know anything at all about it—I knew the two prisoners before; I have seen them together on three or four occasions in four or five or six months.</p>

On the morning of the 3rd May this charge sheet was laid before Mr. Hardwick, the police Magistrate, who heard the charge—Mr. and Mrs. Booker attended, and the defendant was sworn as a witness, on a charge against them of indecently exposing themselves—I took down his evidence—(<hi rend="italic">reads:</hi>—"Henry Amor, police sergeant, <hi rend="italic">A</hi> 21, says: 'Last night, about a quarter past 9 o'clock, in Hyde-park, I saw the prisoners on the footpath.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401020067"/>
               <p>I saw the female with her back against the rails, and the male prisoner in front of her. They were in the act of being in connection together. I took them in custody, and saw the male prisoner's trowsers were down. On the way to the police station he said they were man and wife. I was in plain clothes. They were halfway between the wicket gate and Albert-gate. I told the prisoner I should take him into custody, and he sung out for the police.'")—the marriage certificate was produced before the Magistrate, and he discharged them, but directed inquiry to be made into their characters—on the following Monday they attended at the police court, and were dis<lb/>charged—it was not necessary for them to come on that day, but they did come—the defendant was expected, but I cannot say that I was in Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a china mender, at No. 1, Parkside, Knightsbridge, the first shop from Hyde-park-corner. I have had that shop getting on for four years—it is only a shop—I live at No. 30, opposite—I have been married ten months—this is the certificate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my wife's maiden name was Eliza Westbrook—she is the daughter of a shoemaker—we were married at St. Peter's, Pimlico—she was living in the neighbourhood with my aunt—my sister, Charlotte Booker, has continued to live with us since our marriage—on 3rd May I had been out on business all day—my sister was taking in some work of my cousin in the evening, and the shop not being very large, I said to my wife, "Let us go down the park"—we went out together, and came to the wicket gate—my wife went through first, and I noticed the prisoner speak to her—I said, "What is he talking about?"—she said, "Never mind, he is drunk"—I turned round, called him a vagabond, and asked him why he was insulting my wife—he only said, "I know you, go on"—I had never seen him before, and did not know he was an officer—we pursued our walk about, fifty yards, when my wife turned round and said, "This drunken fellow is following us"—I saw a policeman coming in the opposite direction, and just as he passed by I called out, "Police! police!—the defendant then ran up, and said, "Hold hard!"—I gave him in charge, and the policeman was going to take him when he turned round and said, "I am your superior," and told him to take me and my wife in charge, which he did—I asked what we were charged with—the defendant said, "Never mind, you take them"—I asked two or three times, but was not told what I was charged with till I got to the station—I said I lived only just in front of the railings, and asked him if he would not come and see where I lived—he said he could not go without an order from his sergeant, and the sergeant said I should not go—I told him that the woman was my wife—I ran to my own house, stopped at the gate, and then said, "Here is where I live, now I will go with you"—they took me into the park again, where the defendant had got my wife with a few people round her—we came out at the Apsley-house gate, and I said, "I had better have a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, I do not wish to be exposed "—the defendant said, "You are not going in that; hold him b——y tight!"—I and my wife were taken down Piccadilly to Vine-street station, without any charge being made against us—I found Mr. Burnett at the station, who asked the officer what the charge was—he whispered, and the sergeant then said we were charged with indecency—I cannot say that I heard the defendant make the charge, for I became insensible, not being in good health at the time—my cousin, who had brought the work to the shop, came to the station with our marriage certificate, and on its being shown at the station we were allowed to go home—it was then very nearly 11 o'clock—we went to the Mary<lb/>lebone street police office next morning, before Mr. Hardwick—the defendant</p>

I however can assure your Lord<lb/>ship, that what I then stated was perfectly true and correct; I felt that when first charged with the crime of perjury, my decamping is calculated to place me in a false position, and it is a circumstance which I have ever deeply deplored; but I trust your Lordship will be inclined to waive it altogether, it arising entirely from drink, and the unbounded influence which at that time a female possessed over me, who induced me to go away with her; I am truly ashamed to confess this to your Lordship, but feel that I have no alternative; I have ever borne a good character. I was four years 126 days a soldier, and was appointed sergeant part of that time, which my discharge from the regiment will show. The good character I had from the regiment procured me a situation as constable in the metropolitan police force, and was appointed sergeant in the A Division, which rank I held when this charge was made against me; I have felt ashamed to apply to my friends for assistance, and being without funds, am consequently undefended.

I am the wife of Malcolm Ross, and live at Trafalgar-road, Greenwich—he is the master of a vessel, and the prisoner was a sort of ordinary boy on board the ship; he was not an apprentice—he had only been with us three weeks—he was only taken on trial—on 16th Dec., he came to my house to take his meals, the same as the other lads, but he left my house before dinner, between 11 and 12 o'clock; dinner was at 1 o'clock—after he had been gone two or three hours, I missed my husband's watch from the kitchen mantelpiece—I had seen the prisoner standing at the kitchen door, emptying a sack of potatoes—I left the room to wash my hands, and, during my absence, he must have stepped across the kitchen—I took the watch down about 11 o'clock to wind it up, as it had stopped; I twisted the guard round it on the mantelpiece—the prisoner never came back—I gave information to the police, between 4 and 5 o'clock the same evening—this is the watch; there is the knot in the guard which I tied—I know it by the glass, and by the wearing of the plating—my husband has had it eighteen years, and I have always been in the habit of winding it up when it is at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a single woman, and live at No. 4, Banes'-alley, Deptford. On Monday night, 22nd Nov., or Tuesday morning, I was in New King-street, talking with a person named Mrs. Dyball—we were near the corner of the alley where I live—while there, three foreigners came up, and began talking with me—the prisoner is one of them—he asked me would I go home with him all night-—he spoke in English—I said "No"—at that time I saw Brosnahan and Sullivan on the opposite side of the way, in New King-street—I did not call to either of them—Brosnahan crossed over from the other side of the way to this man, and asked him what did he want to do with the two women that were standing at the corner of Barnes'-alley—the prisoner made answer, and said, "Nothing," and then Brosnahan hit him in the side of the head, and ran down towards the Dockyard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Brosnahan a friend of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I knew him before, but he was no friend—I knew him before.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did Sullivan do when Brosnahan called out to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He ran down to the dockyard gate—I ran after them, and saw Sullivan lying in the gutter, and the prisoner upon him—that was close by the dockyard gate—the prisoner got up off of Sullivan, and then Sullivan got up—the prisoner then <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> something black out of his right hand trowsers pocket, and stooped and stabbed Sullivan close by the groin—I did not see him open it first; he drew it out of his right hand pocket, and stooped and stabbed him—Sullivan called out to me, "I am stabbed!"—the front of his trowsers was down, and I saw blood on his shirt—at the time I saw Sullivan in the gutter with the prisoner upon him, none of the other foreigners were near, they had gone on—I did not see anything of Brosnahan at that time, not till I turned round after seeing Sullivan stabbed; I then saw him sitting on the steps of the Navy Arms, with his head on his knee, and bleeding from his side—I immediately gave notice at the dock-yard gate that these men had been stabbed by three foreigners, who had run down Dock-street—a constable immediately went after them down the street—the prisoner was the first man that was brought back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This was rather a dark foggy night was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not very foggy, nor very dark, because it was close by the lamp where Sullivan was stabbed—I did not see a brother of the prisoner afterwards; I cannot swear to <hi rend="italic">e'er a one</hi>, only to this man here—I saw him when he came up to me-—the other two men were with him at the time—they did not talk to me, only this man; the other two never spoke a word—that is the only reason I have for being positive about him—Brosnahan hit the prisoner on the side of the head; it was with his fist, he struck at him with his fist, it was not a violent blow, nothing particular—he then ran down to the dockyard, calling for Sullivan—the three foreigners ran after him as Boon as ever he ran.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then Sullivan did not come over directly and find them fighting on the ground by you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was then that Sullivan ran after them—I saw Sullivan on the opposite side of the way before he was struggling on the ground—that was while we were all standing at the top of Barnes'-alley—I did not see him strike any of the foreigners before he was struggling on the ground; he ran after them and followed them up—he caught the pri<lb/>soner—I did not see him catch him, I ran down and saw him lying in the gutter—I missed sight of the man he was following—I ran up and saw what I have described, it was a momentary thing—the foreigners then ran away—the prisoner was the first man that was brought back—I cannot say whether Brosnahan was drunk, or whether Sullivan was the worse for drink—I had not been taking anything—Mrs. Dyball was quite drunk, she could not recollect anything of the transaction—she followed after me—there was no other woman standing with me at that moment—the prisoner was dressed as he is now; he had his coat buttoned, and he had a red shirt on; I could not tell whether they had all red shirts—I cannot say whether foreign sailors generally wear red shirts—the one I saw had a red shirt on, I did not observe the others—I did not observe at all how the others were dressed: I did not take notice of them—they were not struggling with any one that I noticed—after Brosnahan hit this man on the head he ran away, calling out, "Help, Jack Sullivan!" and then Sullivan ran direct across the road after the foreigners—there were no others running after them besides Sullivan and Brosnahan, only me and Mrs. Dyball—I was not screaming out till I went to the dockyard.</p>

               <p>his red shirt, and by his being a short stout man; his cap was off, and his hair was light—that was what I went by—at the time Sullivan was stabbed by the dockyard gate, I was close to him; I was not touching him, but I was quite close to him—I could have touched him; I did touch him on the hand about a minute after he was stabbed; I had not moved from the spot—the light was by the dockyard gate, I was close to that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The man asked you to go with him that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he did not take me by the arm—he asked me in a civil way, and I as civilly answered him, and then Brosnahan came across—the prisoner did not use any uncivil language to Brosnahan—the first thing between them was Brosnahan giving him a blow on the head, and as soon as Brosnahan struck him, he ran towards the dockyard—he ran away, to try to get away—I then heard Brosnahan call out for help—Sullivan went the same way—I did not see him come up to the prisoner—I saw them down in the gutter together—I had followed Sullivan, I kept him in sight the whole time they were struggling together, and Sullivan fell down first, and the prisoner fell down on him; the prisoner was down by the dockyard gate when Sullivan came down—I did not see whether Sullivan came up to the prisoner, or whether the prisoner went up to him; I did not see how it was till I saw them falling in the gutter—Sullivan ran down to the dockyard after the prisoner, and afterwards I saw them down together struggling; the prisoner got up first from the ground, he never stopped, only drew some<lb/>thing out of his pocket; he stood about a minute or so, close by Sullivan; he was close by Sullivan when Sullivan got up—from the time Sullivan was first called to, he ran from the corner of Barnes'-alley to the dockyard gate, that is not very far, not quite so long as this Court.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 154). I was on duty at the Dept<lb/>ford Dock-yard on the morning of 22nd Nov.—about half past 12 o'clock in the morning I heard a knocking at the dockyard gate—I opened it, and saw the witness, Mary Brady, there—she gave me some information about some men being stabbed—I saw a man standing there, bleeding—he was about six or seven yards from the dockyard gate—there was a gas lamp over the gate—it was not a dark night; it was dark in some parts where there was no light, but there was a very strong light over the gate—in consequence of what Mary Brady told me, I ran down Dock-street, and as I ran I saw some persons turning the corner of Dock-street—I ran after them—they were going at a very fast walking pace—I overtook them in Old King-street—the prisoner was one of them—I have not found out who the other man was—I took hold of them, and spoke to them—I cannot say whether they understood me—I came back with two of them in custody—I saw three men altogether; one was some distance ahead of the others when I came up to them—I laid hold of two, and the third, seeing me approach, ran away—the two men I laid hold of, came back part of the way with me, up Old King-street, about thirty yards—I was then assaulted by the prisoner, and they got away—I have not the slightest doubt that the pri<lb/>soner is one of the men I took—I never lost sight of him the whole time—when the two got away from me, one turned down Old King-street, and the other ran up Dock-street, towards the Dock-yard gate—sergeant Smith was on duty there, and he came out into the road, on my calling out to stop him, and he stopped the prisoner in the road—I took him to the station—Sullivan was brought there about half an hour afterwards, and he said, "That is the man that stabbed me"—the prisoner answered, "I had no knife"—I afterwards took a man named Akola, on the evening of the 22nd</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at Wandsworth police court. I was in attendance there on 15th Nov.—Mr. Beadon was the presiding Magistrate—the police sheet was laid before him in the ordinary course—I took a short note of what took place—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in my own writing—the defendant was sworn and examined as a witness in my presence</p>

               <p>—a person named Twilley was the defendant—Hume said, "This morning, at 20 minutes to 2 o'clock, at Merton Rush, the defendant came up very drunk, and began knocking a man about, and a disturbance was likely to ensue; I told the defendant to go; there were two policeman, Stephen Holmes and another, close by a beershop; I was not drinking with them; I saw pots about; he abused me, and knocked my hat off; I told him to go home, and he put his first in my face, and struck me in the mouth"—on that statement being made, Twilley, the defendant, made an excla<lb/>mation which was not taken down—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

When he asked me if there <hi rend="italic">were</hi> any beer and constables, I said "no," for which I am truly <hi rend="italic">sorrow</hi>, and deserve not any longer to be retained in the force. I have been in a fever ever since about it, and couldn't take my duty, all through telling an untruth. If it had not been the constables from Tooting, it would not have happened at all. They asked for beer, and <hi rend="italic">gote</hi> 2 pots of ale, and paid for it 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. There were 5 <hi rend="italic">P. C's.</hi>, namely, Hunt, Howe, Holmes, Eggs, and myself, were there about 20 minutes, or little more altogether. We were there a little time before Twilley came up. One of the Tooting constables called on Twilley, but which I don't know, and that was the way he came into the company. There about 10 <hi rend="italic">minits</hi> from the time of Twilley coming up till the <hi rend="italic">P. C's.</hi> left for Tooting. Just when they, the <hi rend="italic">P. C's.</hi>, were going to make a move, Twilley took hold of <hi rend="italic">P. C.</hi> Holmes' <hi rend="italic">cloths</hi>, and pulled him about; and he, Holmes, was not very well pleased about him doing so. He, Twilley, knocked off a <hi rend="italic">P. C.'s</hi> hat. I do not know of him saying to Twilley about it, but I said to <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to behave himself, and not make any disturbance; he, Twilley, <hi rend="italic">come</hi> and knocked <hi rend="italic">of</hi> my hat. I pushed him; he, being drunk, fell to the ground; and he <hi rend="italic">gote</hi> up, and struck at me in the mouth. I prevented him from <hi rend="italic">hiting</hi> me <hi rend="italic">hearer</hi> by <hi rend="italic">putting</hi> out my arm, and being drunk, fell to the ground the second time, and I took him into custody for assaulting me. The <hi rend="italic">P. C's.</hi> were on <hi rend="italic">there</hi> way home when Twilley was taken into custody. I cannot say more about the affair. I am truly <hi rend="italic">sorrow</hi> for what has happened. Did not know that Twilley would speak of the beer; he was the cause of the disturbance. I told a falsehood unwittingly, and am ashamed and <hi rend="italic">sorrow</hi> for it. I hope that Mr. Beadon will consider the case. It is the first time that I have disgraced myself. I expect to be dismissed the Police, and punished like<lb/>wise; but <hi rend="italic">there</hi> is pity in such a case; we are all ready to err from the path of duty. I hope Mr. Bicknell pity us. <hi rend="italic">P. C.</hi>, Geo. Hume."</p>

               <p>stopped, and he said, "Will you have any beer?"—I will not swear which of them it was, but I believe it was Howe—they were all standing there drinking at the door of the public house; it was then near 2 o'clock in the morning—the house appeared to be closed—they had got some beer in a can, and were pouring it into a pint pot; I drank some of it—one of them, I do not know which, said they had got half a gallon of ale—they were near enough together to hear what was said by any of them—we paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece round, me, and the five policemen; that made 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—no more beer was got from the house—one of them said to me when I was drinking, "Your pot is as good as anyone else's;" and I said, "I will <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a pot"—one of the others said, "We cannot have any more beer to-night; we hare just called them up, and got this half gallon, and we must not call them up any more"—I drank out of the pot, and gave it back to one of them, who drank again—after that we put the pot and can down, and all moved away from the house—after we had finished drinking we paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, the fire policemen and me—we were about ten minutes drinking at the door of the Leathern Bottle, and then all started together till we got into the road—the house lies a little way back—when we got into the road I will not say positively what passed; I might have got <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> with the others; we were all very good friends together, and the prisoner Hume tripped me up with his foot, and threw me down on my back—I think there were only three policemen present at that time, but I will not say positively whether the other two had gone or not—after Hume had tripped me up, I said, "Don't you do that again, or you will shake me all to pieces"—as soon as I had said that he tripped me up again, and it actually stunned me; I did not know where I was at that time—they got me up again, and when I recovered myself I said, "You mark my words, to-morrow morning I will report you for this"—as soon as I said that he took me by the arm, and said, "I will learn you to insult police constables; I will take you to the station house;" and he said to Howe, "You must come with me"—the three constables left with me were Hunt, Hume, and Howe—as we were going along to the station, one of them said, "I suppose you would sooner go home than go to the station?"—that was either Hume or Howe—I said, "No; you have begun it, you may keep on with it"—I went down to the station house, and the charge was taken by sergeant Reed—I heard Home give the charge—he charged me with being drunk and assaulting the policemen, and with striking him—I moved the iron bar up, went to sergeant Reed, and asked him if I was drunk; he said I was not—Hume was in the station at this time—he and Howe heard what I said to Reed—I said, "Am I tipsy?" and he said, "No, you are not now"—at the time I was at the Leathern Bottle I was not drunk; I might have been drinking a little drop, but I was quite capable of taking care of myself and knowing what I was about—I was kept at the station all night, and on Tuesday morning, the 15th, I was taken before a Magistrate, and heard the evidence that Hume gave against me for assaulting him; I then asked the Magistrate if he would allow me to speak, as it was false, and I told him the truth, that I got out of my brother's chaise to let a friend get up, and walked, meeting nobody till I got to the Leathern Bottle, when I met the police<lb/>men, who asked me to drink, and that I drank with them—the Magistrate adjourned the case for further inquiries till Monday, the 21st, when I went before him again, and he dismissed the case, and said he should put it before the Commissioners.</p>
