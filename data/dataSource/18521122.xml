                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, St. James's-terrace, Harrow-road, and am a corn and flour factor; I have been carrying on business in London since last June; previous to that I had carried on business at Reading. I know Keene; I knew him when he was in the service of Messrs. Avex and Terry—in July last I saw him at the corn market; he told me be could recommend some good customers, who would buy some flour of me—he said he had left the house of Avex and Terry, and was living on his income, which was between 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I told him to bring no customers but those he knew; he said he would bring me none but the very best—a friend of mine had some transaction with him about some sacks—about 6th Aug. I saw him again in the market—he said he had an excellent customer, a man very trustworthy indeed, who was going to open a shop at 10, Southampton<lb/>place, Camberwell, and he wished me to send ten sacks of flour there; he gave me the customer's name, and I wrote it down as he spelt it to me, "William Jerrard"—I have the name here, which I wrote down at the time—I asked him if he was a man of property, and trustworthy; he said, "Yes," he had known him many years, and done business with him, and he had always paid uncommonly well—some few days afterwards I sent the ten sacks of flour by my carman—on 12th Aug. Keene and Jarrett came to my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185211220006"/>
               <p>house together; Keene introduced Jarrett as his friend, who wanted to buy some oats—he said, "This is my friend Jerrard"—Jarrett then handed me his card—I said, "Why, this is spelt Jarrett?"—Keene replied, "That is right," and said he had made a mistake when he gave me the name of Jerrard—I asked him how he liked the flour—he said he liked the flour in my sacks better than that in the sacks marked "Longford"—I asked him some ques<lb/>tions about his business—he said he had a very good business, an excellent shop; the lease previously was worth 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had got it under peculiar circumstances, and should be able to do a good business, and he should want to buy a larger quantity of flour—Keene and he looked at some samples of oats, and directed me to send in ten quarters—he then said he should be a buyer of a larger quantity of flour, for he had some money, and he might as well lay it out in flour—I told him I should be very glad to sell him some, if he could find the money for it; they then both left—I saw Keene on the market, two or three days afterwards; that was the third time—I asked him what he thought of Jerrard—he said he was a man of plenty of money, and was going to buy some flour, and he had seen him with three 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes the night before, and he was sure he had plenty of money—Jerrard came again two or three days afterwards, with a person, whom he introduced as a neigh<lb/>bour and friend, and who I have since learned is named Nicholls—he said he had come to buy fifty sacks of flour, if we could deal—I said I should be very glad to sell him some, or Mr. Nicholls either—Nicholls said he was not a buyer at present, but he should like to buy some hereafter—I sold Jerrard fifty sacks; he asked me what I would allow him for fetching it away—I said I generally did it myself—he said he had a horse and cart—I ultimately consented to allow him fourpence a sack—he said he would pay me for the flour, I think, on Monday week—he said he wanted to buy a considerable quantity, as it would improve by keeping in his shop, as he was only doing a small trade at present—he and Nicholls ultimately left my house together; they afterwards came back again; Nicholls stood at the door and said, "My friend Jerrard left home without money, and as this is to be a money trans<lb/>action I will give him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money for this <hi rend="italic">deal</hi>, and he has promised to pay me when we return home"—I told him no, I was not desirous of receiving the money yet; and Nicholls said it would be inconvenient for him as he was going to pay his millers, and should have to go all the way to Camberwell to receive the money of Jerrard—on the following day, the 24th, I think twenty-five of the sacks were fetched away; the other twenty-five were delivered on the following day—Jerrard came to me, I believe it was on the day after the delivery of the flour, and paid me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that reduced the account to 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he gave an order at the same time for twenty quarters of oats, at 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and thirty quarters, at 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said when he had the oats he would pay the balance altogether—some time after that he wrote me a note, in consequence of which I sent half a load of hay; I did not send any straw, because I had none—on my return home that night, my man told me something; in consequence of which I went that same night to Keene's house, in Harriet-place; I think Southampton-street, Camberwell—I found him at home; he said he was just coming up to my house—I asked him what this was that I had heard about Jerrard; that I heard he was gone to gaol, and that Jerrard's wife took in the hay, and she was drunk; that I could not under<lb/>stand it—he said she was very much excited about her husband's going to gaol, and that he was gone for being security for a person for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "What does Nicholls know about Jerrard?"—he said he would go with me</p>

               <p>to Nicholls; he got into my gig, and we drove up to Nicholls's shop—Keene stepped out of my gig and went into Nicholls's, and then into his bakehouse; he was some time there, and they both came up together—I asked Nicholls how long he had known Jerrard—he said, "About a month"—I said, "I thought you must have known a great deal of him;" that was in Keene's presence—I asked him if he had heard that Jerrard was gone to gaol, and how he came to offer to lend him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he thought he was a respectable man, and he had not known him long—I asked him if he would go with Keene to Jerrard, and get some particulars as to what arrangement he meant to make regarding my debt—he promised me he would go, and with that understanding I left—next day I saw Keene at the market; he said Nicholls had been to Horsemonger-lane and had seen Jerrard, and he brought a note from Jerrard to me—he said the money would be all right, and Jerrard was coming out of gaol next day—he said nothing about what had been done with the flour—I saw Keene once afterwards in Mark-lane, but not since; I asked him where Jerrard was, as he had not been to pay according to promise—he said be expected he would have been with me before, and no doubt he was over at the Elephant public house opposite; he went to look for him, returned, and said he could not find him—I went to look for him at another public house, but never saw him afterwards—on 8th Sept. I went to Jerrard's shop; the place appeared in a general state of confusion; I saw no flour there; there were a few twopenny loaves there—I have traced fifty of my sacks of flour to Nicholls's shop, and the corn and oats to a man named Brown, who is here—when I heard of Jerrard being in gaol, I asked Keene how he came to say he had seen three 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in his hand—he said it was a mistake, that they were three fives—I was somewhere in the neighbour<lb/>hood of Bayswater, and saw Jerrard through a public house window, as I was sitting in my gig; I went into the bar, and he was gone; I went into the back premises; he came out from an outhouse, and I gave him into custody—Keene was taken some time afterwards at Gloucester.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Southampton-place, Camberwell, next door to where the prisoner Jarrett opened a shop about the beginning of Aug. On or about 9th Aug. I saw ten sacks delivered at the shop, and on Friday, 13th Aug., the ten sacks were taken away between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning—Mr. Keene was present, but I did not notice who else—I noticed the shop during the whole time it remained open—I do not think the oven was lighted more than twice—I recollect seeing some thirty quarters of corn or oats delivered early in Sept.—I rather think it was Thursday, from Mr. Pin<lb/>nock's van, it was a large van-full, I suppose about fifty or sixty sacks—two sacks go to a quarter—they did not remain long, they were taken away on 7th Sept. by Mr. Brown's van, the prisoners were present—I cannot say whether they were delivered in Sept., or on the last day of Aug.—I also saw two sacks of flour taken away in a barrow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Alger's employ. On Thursday, 21st Oct., about 4 o'clock in the morning, I left my master's house with a load of straw—I was to take it to Smithfield, or sell it going along, if I could get a fair price for it—I met the two prisoners in Old-street; Tavener came up first,—he asked me if I would sell my straw, and said he would give me 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load for it—I told him I could not take less than 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said a man named Hobbs authorized him to buy a ton of straw, that it appeared to him just as it had come from the barn door, and he was quite sure Hobbs would have it—I had a ton in my cart; fifty-four trusses—Smart was following the cart, which was still going on—Tavener said to me, "Come down here;" that was down Tabernacle-row—we went down there with Smart and the cart—I was by the side of my horses—the prisoners turned up a gateway, where there were folding doors; they came back and said, "Hobbs does not live here, he lives down lower"—when we had got a little further on, Tavener said, "Stop here;" that was still in Tabernacle-row—he said, "He lives just up the street here, leave the horses here"—I called a boy to hold my horses, and told him I would give him a penny—Tavener said Hobbs lived just up the street, and I could go up there with him, and see Hobbs myself—I went with him up a street, which leads out of Tabernacle-row into the City-road—he said, "Don't give any more boys a penny, Smart will stand by the horses"—Smart remained by the cart beside the boy—when we got to the top of the street I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "A little further"—I said, "I shall not go further away from my horses"—he said if I waited five or ten minutes he would fetch Hobbs to me—I waited five</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Goswell-street. I have carried on business there thirty years—the prisoner was in my service—he has been so full a twelve month—he left me for a period of two months, and returned to me—before he came to me he lived with Mr. Sowerby, a pawn-broker of Chiswell-street—he was acting as my foreman in Oct. last—I left town on 15th Oct., and left the prisoner in charge of my property and busi<lb/>ness—I returned in the evening of 26th Oct.—a person named Finch was in my employment—in consequence of something I discovered with respect to the accounts, I looked about me to see how things had been going on in my absence—on 28th Oct. I found some duplicates on the counter—they related to books that had been in pledge, and were out of time—the books are here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are a portion of them—there were several parcels, some containing twelve or fourteen, but they had been all mixed together—when I left town those books were upstairs in the warehouse, packed in parcels; when I returned they had been opened—I found five books deficient—one of the duplicates was for a Bible, and a case of drawing instruments—I inquired for that Bible, and searched for it—I did not find it—the duplicates were my own, used in my own business—duplicates are generally affixed to the bundles in which the things they relate to are contained—I was told that some volumes of the "History of William IV." were missing—I do not know it of my own knowledge, I only learned it by inquiry—on comparing the duplicates with the bundles, I found out that five books were deficient—we do not particularize the articles in the duplicates, except in this case the Bible was named—we say "two, three, or six books;" or "one book"—I came to town on the 26th, and on the 29th I spoke to the prisoner about this—I called his attention to this parcel of duplicates—I do not think I showed them to him; I said, "There are some books missing, and here are a lot of duplicates, and I understand there was a Bible and a "Life of William IV.;" I don't see them"—he immediately went and brought a small Bible, and opened it, and found a mark in it which showed that it was not the one, and he said, "Oh! that is not it;" but he said, "I know nothing about them"—I said, "Here are also some numbers, parts of a Bible, that ought to be here; I don't see them"—I cannoti recollect that he made any reply to that—I then gave him into Inspector Brannan's custody—I afterwards went with Bran<lb/>nan to the prisoner's lodging—my young man then pointed out some books—the prisoner was not present—they were the books which I had mentioned to the prisoner, and which he said he knew nothing about—they were a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185211220017"/>
               <p>Bible, two volumes of the "Life of William IV.," and the "Tourist in Italy, by Roscoe," which had a mark on it, I believe in my own handwriting—I believe that was one of the books forming a part of these—he had no right or autho<lb/>rity to take those books to his lodging—I remember examining my cashbox on the 29th; Finch stood by the side of me, it was a few minutes before dinner, we dine about half-past 1 o'clock; there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it in gold—I am sure there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner had gone out at that time—that was after I had spoken to him about the things—he came in while we were at dinner—he dines with myself and family—he came in I suppose, a little before 2—he came and sat down at dinner—Finch dines after him—after the prisoner had bad his dinner, he went out—I did not see him go out—I did not afterwards examine my cashbox, but I was told there was no cash in it—I believe Brannan came to the house between 2 and 3—the prisoner came in while Brannan was there—I went down immediately I heard he had come in, and told him I wanted to speak with him upstairs—I then stated generally, the circumstances of the accounts—I then said to him, "About this gold watch; you ought not to have taken it"—I had asked him about that gold watch in the morning, having found it had not been delivered—I said, "How is it about that gold watch, that you have not given it?"—he said, "Oh! I have taken it home to try, and I have left it at home"—I said, "Well, bring it tomorrow, you should not have taken it home, there was no need"—in the afternoon I said to him, "You had no right to take that watch"—he replied, pulling it out of his pocket, "Oh I here it is"—he said he had been home for it—I then said, "There are these books, and the numbers?"—he said, "Oh! I suppose I must pay for the Bibles; some of them were in numbers"—I made no remark—I have since seen the watch—I have also seen another watch; they are both mine—before I left home, I left a gold lever watch in' the window—I did not miss it till about ten days after the prisoner had been in custody—that was the watch that Brannan took from the prisoner on searching him—I saw it taken from him, it had an Albert chain with it—there were two watches taken from him—one he produced, and one Brannan took from him—I had no suspicion that the watch he was wearing was my own—I have since examined it and find it is mine, I have no doubt at all about it—that is the watch with the Albert chain; the second watch was found on bim immediately on his being taken into custody, but I did not examine it then—Brannan has since produced it to me, and I identified it—the desks I had never seen.</p>

I saw the prisoner come home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, about half past 5 o'clock—Mr. Peachey called him into a private room where I was—Mr. Peachey asked him to render an account of the deficiencies in his goods—the prisoner said, "If you don't like me, Mr. Sowerby will take me"—Mr. Peachey then said, "About the gold watch belonging to one of the customers?"—"Oh!" he said, "here it is,"pulling it out from his waistcoat pocket and placing it on the table—he afterwards said, "I have been home to get it"—Mr. Peachey then said, "There are some books and numbers of Bibles missing"—he said, "Oh, yes! I took them; I left them to be bound; I suppose I must pay you for them"—Mr. Peachey said, "But you took them without my autho<lb/>rity"—he said, "I will pay you for the numbers; they are at a little sta<lb/>tioner's shop, in Old-street, to be bound"—Mr. Peachey said, "Am I not going to have any further explanation about the deficiencies?"—the prisoner said, "Mr. Peachey, if you don't like me, Mr. Sowerby will take me; he gave me that ring," alluding to one he had on his finger, which J now pro<lb/>duce—Mr. Peachey then left the room to go for some books, and while he was absent the prisoner said to me, "Do you think they will find me guilty?"—I said, "I really don't know"—I then took possession of the watch which he placed on the table, which I produce—I then took him to the station and searched him—I found on him the watch with the Albert chain and the ring—the watch is gold—he said, "Is it necessary to take that from me, as it is mine?"—I said, "I must take all"—I found on him a duplicate of a watch pledged that same day at Mr. Vaughan's, in Oxford-street, which I also produce—I afterwards went with Mr. Peachey and his young man to the address given by the prisoner in Duke-street, Oxford-street—I found the name of Whitaker on the door, as he told me I should—in the one pair back room in that house I found four printed books, which I now produce, namely, a Bible, two volumes of "William IV.," and "The Tourist in Italy," also two desks and two vases—I saw other property there which I did not then take possession of, but I did afterwards—on the evening of 3rd Nov.

                  </hi>. I live at 11, Mollineux-street, Edgeware-road. I knew Charles Baker, he lived at 17, Mollineux-street—I was there on Friday, 5th Nov.—I am not a relation of the Bakers—Charles Baker had had his dinner, I was sitting in the corner by the window, and he was by the table—William Baker, the prisoner, came in, and Charles said to him, "You have no business to come in at this time, and you shan't have a clean knife and fork;" there was a dinner knife and fork on the table—the prisoner said he should come in at what time he liked, and take what sort of knives and forks he liked—they bad some words with each other, and threatened to tell their</p>

               <p>mother—the deceased said he had no business to be playing out with Guy Fawkes—(that was the reason he was late)—the prisoner then sat down at the table to his dinner, and took up the knife and fork; Charles took up the lid of a saucepan and hit the prisoner on the back—I do not know whether it was very hard, it did not seem to hurt him; he did not say or do anything—Charles went towards where he was standing before, and William had the knife in his hand, and threw it at him; it went into Charles's left side and stuck there; it did not fall to the ground, he pulled it out, and gave it to the prisoner, who laid it on the table, and told him he did not mean to do it, but Charles told him he had done it—Charles ran downstairs into the first floor room; clung round a woman's waist, and told her that William had stabbed him—William was about two or three yards and a half from Charles when he threw the knife.</p>

Mrs. Johnson, forgive me, I did not mean to do it"—I said, "Run for a doctor," which he did—a doctor came, and the deceased was taken in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Hospital—I have known the prisoner from a child; he is a very kind-hearted good boy, but very passionate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live in Sykes-terrace, Mile<lb/>end-road.

In consequence of what I dis<lb/>covered about the note, No. 70989, I went to the prisoner's house on 29th Oct.—he is a cheesemonger and grocer, in Claremont-place—I do not recol<lb/>lect producing this note to him, but I asked him where he took the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that he paid to Mr. Dawson, or whether he did so—he said, "Yes, I did pay him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, but I cannot say where I got it from"—I requested him to come to the Post Office with me—he did so, and I took him before Mr. Peacock—it was explained to him that this was one of the notes that was obtained for a check for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was enclosed in a letter, posted at his house on the 13th, and he was again asked if he could tell from whom he received it, and he said he could not—at that time I had not been able to find Mr. Lomas—the prisoner was not detained on that occasion—I left him at the Post Office, and proceeded to try and trace out the other note (26631), that is endorsed by Miss Everett "Mr. Harrison, Brixton, Oct. 14th"—I was not able to trace that note at that time—I returned to the Post Office, and Mr. Peacock and myself both asked the prisoner if he had changed a note in the neighbourhood of Camberwell on the 14th Oct., or within the last three weeks—he said, he was quite positive that he had not done so—it was mentioned to him that Dr. Cronin had enclosed the check, and that the check belonged to Dr. Cronin—he was allowed to go home on that occasion—I went a second time to Camberwell to make inquiries, and ulti<lb/>mately traced the second note to Miss Everett—I then took the prisoner into custody—I told him that he must accompany me again to the Post Office, to explain the matter again—he said, it was a mysterious affair—when we got to the Post Office, he was again told that a check had been enclosed in a letter, and that the second note had been traced to him, and I asked him whether he could explain that—he said he was confused, and could say no more—he was asked whether he made up the 3 o'clock collection on 13th Oct.—he said, "Yes"—he was asked whether he made up the 5 o'clock col<lb/>lection—he said he could not recollect, it must have been either himself or his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he not on the second occasion, when you ex<lb/>plained to him that you had traced the note to Miss Everett, say, "Oh, yes!" that he had changed a note there, and that he had seen Miss Everett write his name upon it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did.</p>

               <p>was stated to him that the second note had been traced—it was after he had said he was confused, and could say no more.</p>

The check was never in my possession, and I think I can give clear evidence who paid me the notes, which have been traced to me.")</p>

               <p>wished to give us a turn, as we had lost a good deal of money by him—I asked him what name; he said, "Oh, Allen"—I knew him by the name of Watson in Castle-street—I think the goods came to about If. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after I had made out the invoice, and whilst the goods were being packed, he asked me if I could change him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he had got his hand in his pocket at the time, <hi rend="italic">junking</hi> some money—I said to <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, one lad, who was serving him, "You have not change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, have you?"—he said, "No, I have not, Sir"—upon that I told the prisoner I would get him change—he said, "No, never mind; I have got money"—he had the note in his hand, and I fancy he put it in his pocket again—I supposed it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, but I did not take it out of his hand to look—just at that time Mr. Harris came in—the prisoner said, "How do you do, Mr. Harris? I am going to open school again, and I wish to lay out a little ready money; I know you have lost a little by me before, and I wish to lay out my ready money with you"—he said, "Have you got the difference of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note?" Mr. Harris said, "Yes, certainly"—the prisoner then gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—he handed it to Mr. Harris, and he gave him change—the prisoner had ordered some maps; we had not those maps in stock, and I said I would bring them to him on the Thursday or Friday—when the parcel of slates and books was made up, I said I would send them up next morning; he said, "Never mind, I must take them myself"—he said he was in a very great hurry, and he should want them very early in the morning—on receiving his change, he took the parcel, and went out—in three or four minutes after<lb/>wards, Mr. Harris thought he had made a mistake in the change, and sent Tripcony after him—he was absent about ten minutes, and then returned without the prisoner, but with the parcel which the prisoner had taken—I did not see the prisoner again until he was in custody—on the following day I went with Archer, the constable, to the house in Castle-street, where I knew the prisoner had carried on business—I did not find him there; he was not living there—I made inquiries, and could not find anything of him.</p>

I had given him a sovereign too much, I sent Tripcony after him—he returned in about ten or twelve minutes, with the parcel, but without the prisoner—in consequence of what I learned from him, I marked the note—this is what I wrote on it, "David Allen, Oct. 4, 1852"—I believe that is the prisoner's correct name—next morning I sent the note to the Bank, and it was returned to me stamped "Forged," as it is now—I then delivered the note to Archer, the constable, and gave him a description of the prisoner—I saw nothing more of the prisoner until 2nd Nov., at 7 in the evening, when I went to the Bagnigge Wells police station, and found him there—I there charged him with uttering the forged note; I said, "Mr. David Allen, you are caught at last"—he said that misfortunes had been showering upon him so thick, that he did not care what became of himself—next morning, previous to going before the Justice, the prisoner sent for me—I asked him</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Harris. I remember the evening of 4th Oct., when the prisoner came for some goods—in consequence of instructions from Mr. Harris I went out after him, and overtook him facing Nicholson's distillery, in St. John-street—I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "Mr. Allen, Mr. Harris thinks he has made a small mistake in your bill, will you be kind enough to step back with me"—he said, "Yes"—he then said, "Have you got the bill?"—I said, no, I believed he had got it in his pocket, or else it was in the parcel—he turned round to return with me—he asked me to carry the parcel, it was rather heavy—we had not got a dozen steps before he asked me that—I took it from him, and we went on as far as Compton-street; he then said to me, "Just wait here one minute while I go round the corner to ease myself"—I waited perhaps three or four minutes—he went round the corner—finding he did not return I went round the corner to seek after him, and found he had disappeared—I waited altogether perhaps ten minutes, and then went back with the parcel to my employer, and commu<lb/>nicated to him what had happened.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). On 4th Oct. I went to the shop of Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185211220040"/>
               <p>Harris, with whom I had dealt seventeen years, for the purpose of purchasing some school stationery. I gave Mr. Harris a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note to pay for the things, which he put into his trowsers pocket. He went to the till to get change, which he opened, but before he began to count it out he took something out of his trowsers pocket, and handed it to the shopman, Tripcony (which I believe to be the note I gave him), who went out of the shop, but did not return during the remainder of my stay, which was five or six minutes. After I had left the shop, bearing somebody running behind me, I turned round, and observed Tripcony; he said, "Mr. Harris thinks he has made a mistake in your change; "I said, "Has he? I do not think he has." I turned back with him, intending to go to the shop; when we arrived at the corner of Compton-street, having occasion to leave for a minute or two to attend to nature's call, I requested Tripcony to hold the parcel; I found that the bill contained my change, and it was quite right; and then re<lb/>membering how I became possessed of the note, the thought momentarily struck me that it might be a stolen note, or something wrong about it, accordingly through fear I did not return, but proceeded homewards; as to its being forged, I had not the slightest idea of such a thing, as I was not aware there was such a thing in existence, and I having given change for it. How I came pos<lb/>sessed of the note was as follows: on Saturday, 2nd Oct., I went out for the purpose of purchasing some school fixtures, and took with me five sovereigns, two half sovereigns, and silver. I met a person who was formerly a lodger of mine; we went into a public house in the Borough, and bad some refresh<lb/>ment; we were nearly an hour and a half there, during which time I got into conversation with some men who were standing drinking at the bar; one of them asked me if I could oblige him with change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; he took from his breast pocket a pocket book, out of which he took seven or eight notes, and handed one to me, saying he should feel much obliged to me if I would; I replied, "Certainly," and gave him four sovereigns and two half sovereigns in change for it, which I should not have done had I been sober, but I was intoxicated. I partook of something to drink at his request; I wrapped the sovereign in the note, and asked Mrs. Wilson, my old lodger, for a pin; she gave me one, and I pinned it in my watch fob; we finished what we had, and left the house, Mrs. Wilson going her way, and I mine. Had I known the note was a forgery, is it likely I should have taken it to a person that had known me so long, and who, I might be sure, would recognize me, and recollect the transaction? I do not know that the note produced is the same I gave to Mr. Harris; if it is, it bears the marks of the pin holes, if it does not, it is not the same. Mr. Harris swore at the police court that he com<lb/>pared it with ten or fifteen others, and is it not likely it might have got changed?</p>

               <p>to a wine-vaults in the strand, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, and from thence I went to an Alton alehouse near Temple-bar, at something like 6—I met the prisoner about 6, near Temple-bar, on the way to the Alton ale-house—I had about me three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and twelve sovereigns—when I met the prisoner she came up and asked me to treat her, or something of that kind—while I was talking to her the policeman came to Mr. Albright and Mr. Ray, friends of mine, who were with me—the prisoner was not near enough to hear what the policeman said to my friends, but she was near when Mr. Albright spoke to me—he said the policeman had been, and asked if I was a friend of his, and told him the prisoner was a noted thief, or something of that kind—the prisoner was standing close by at that time—in cones<lb/>quence of that I left her, and went back through Temple-bar again to the other side—the prisoner came to me a second time, while Mr. Albright was gone to buy some meat to have something to eat at the Alton alehouse—Mr. Ray was in the street standing by—when the prisoner came up to me in a similar way to what she did before, I said, "I am going into this house" the Alton alehouse—I walked through the bar into a little room behind, and the prisoner followed me—we had a pint of ale there—I cannot exactly say how long we were there together—perhaps half an hour, or something like that—Mr. Albright came and stood at the front of the bar; he looked round, and as soon as the prisoner saw him, she jumped up and ran away directly—I paid for the ale—I had a pint of ale, and she took a part of it, I believe—after she was gone I made the best of my way home after a time—I did not leave immediately after her—I did not sit drinking, and go to sleep, I made the best of my way home—I went out to Fleet-street—I remained there some time—I then got a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and made the best of my way home—I was not asleep in the alehouse after the prisoner left—when I got home, I missed my money—I found in my pocket one sovereign and two shillings—I had had three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and twelve sovereigns in gold, which was the money I received from the bank—I had found it safe in my pocket just before I went in the alehouse with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>the Bank—we staid there perhaps half an hour or more—they were selling some land—there was a crowd of people—from there we went to a horse repository, near Blackfriars-bridge—Mr. Albright and Mr. Ray were with me, and Mr. White, who keeps an inn in Black friars-road—we had some gin at the bottom of Fleet-street—I think the name of the public house is the Bell—we did not stay there ten minutes—we then went up Fleet-street, to the Strand, and went into Short's wine vaults—Mr. White had then left us—Mr. Albright and Mr. Ray were with me—we stopped there some time—we did not have any beer—we had several glasses of wine; I cannot exactly tell how many I had to my own share; it might be half a dozen—it was drank in front of the bar—there were persons coming in and going out—that was the second time I was there—I paid for a part of that wine—from there we came back towards the City—I went into another public house, between Short's and the Alton ale house—I had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin there—I should say it was then somewhere about 6 o'clock; it might be a little later; it was not 7—I staid there ten minutes perhaps—I saw no woman before the bar of the public house while I and my friends were drinking the gin—when we had finished the gin, I found my way through Temple-bar, and into the Alton ale house—as soon as I got into the house the prisoner followed me—Mr. Albright came almost immediately afterwards, and the moment he entered the house the prisoner went off—I treated her with a pint of ale to drink in a room in a line with the bar—there was no other person in the room except the waiter who brought the pint of ale—I saw no more of the prisoner after that—she might have been half an hour or three quarters of an hour in the back room, drinking the pint of ale—Mr. Albright was standing in front of the bar, with some victuals that he had got—after the prisoner had disappeared, I did not stay long in the Alton ale house; it might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—Mr. Albright did not stay with me; he left, and went home—Mr. Ray went away about the same time—he wanted to get to London-bridge—they both went away about the same time, and left me in the Alton ale house—I was there sometime—I then went out, and walked up and down Fleet-street—I did not know Mr. Albright and Mr. Ray were gone—I thought I should see them for some time—while I was walking up and down Fleet-street I did not speak to any one, only to a <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi>—I might perhaps be an hour or longer walking up and down—after that I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, at the top of Fleet-street, to take me home—I did not indulge in a little sleep before I got home—I live at Pimlico, in a private house, which I rent.</p>

On 1st Nov., about half past 5 o'clock in the evening, I was passing along Brick-lane, Spitalfields—I had with me twenty-nine yards of doeskin cloth—I was carrying it on my shoulder—I remember passing the door of a public house—the prisoner was standing at the door of it, and two persons along with him, and I dare say there were two or three persons inside—the prisoner said to me, "Old friend, you are too proud to speak to me now"—I told him he had the advantage of me, I had not the pleasure of knowing him, and I walked on, I should say forty or fifty yards, before anything happened—I was at the corner of a street, when I was caught round my arms from behind by somebody, and another man came behind me and pulled the cloth off my shoulder—it was taken by a man, but I could not identify the man that took it—I could not swear that I had seen that man before that night—I saw him take it from my shoulder, and he gave it to another, a younger man, a few yards Off, and he went off down Fleur-de-lis street—I caught hold of the man who was holding my arms, and it turned out to be the pri<lb/>soner; it was the roan who had said, "Old friend" to me—I held him, and called out, "Police!"—I wanted to go after the cloth, but I would not let the prisoner go—I had hold of him, and was going with him between 200 and 300 yards—I had an opportunity of seeing him so as to know him again—at the end of that 200 or 300 yards he came opposite to a lodging house—he dragged me into this house, and then he <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> through a door that is in the side of the house—that door led into a court—I let go of him when he got through that door; after he went through the door was shut—I did not venture to go through—I waited there, calling, "Police!"—two policemen came, and I went with them through that door, which led into a court where there were six or Seven little cottages, and out of one of the cottages the policemen brought the prisoner to me—I said in his presence that he was the man, but he had changed his coat—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old; my mother keeps a public house in Fore-street. On 23rd Oct. the prisoners came together—Thompson called for a pint of beer and a pickwick—he gave me a shilling in payment, which I put in the till and gave him the change—there was no other shilling in the till—they drank their beer, went to the door, remained there about ten minutes, and then came back and had another pint of beer, for which Thompson paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they then had a third pint of beer, for which Palmer paid me with a shilling—I had not change, and gave the shilling to my sister to get change—she took it out, and brought back some change—soon after she came in, while the prisoners were still at the bar, Mr. Carter, a neighbour, came in, and said the shilling my sister had brought was a bad one—he had it in his hand, and gave it to me—I put it on the engine, and then went to the till, took out the other shilling, gave it to Mr. Carter, and that turned out to be bad also—there was no other shilling but that in the till; no one had been to the till but myself—one of the prisoners, I believe Palmer, but am not certain which, took the shilling off the beer engine—a constable was sent for, and the pri<lb/>soners were given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Crane. On 15th Nov., about 12 o'clock at night, I got out of an omnibus at the Mansion House—I had two half crowns, sixpence, threepence, two halfpence, and three farthings loose in my dress pocket behind me—I stopped to look at a fire, and the prisoner stood by my side—I had never seen her before, but am sure she is the person—I observed a pair of scissors drop down, which fell against my foot nearest the prisoner—I do not know where they fell from—I then put my hand to my pocket, and caught hold of the prisoner's hand, which was just going out of my pocket, and called out, "Oh, you have robbed me!"—I missed all my money from my pocket; there was only my handkerchief and a key left, and there was a hole cut tight through my pocket—this is it (<hi rend="italic">showing it</hi>)—it has been cut—it was not so before; it was quite a new dress—the pocket is attached to my dress—I caught hold of the prisoner with both arms, and some gentleman by said, "Give up the woman the money," and he picked up the scissors, and asked who they belonged to—she gave me back some of the money—a policeman came up, and I gave her into custody.</p>

I went to bed about half past 11 o'clock—I and my wife went to bed together—we were the last persons up in the house—the house was then safe—the back parlour window was shut up, but I will not say whether the catch was fast or not—about half past four in the morning I and ray wife were awoke—I laid a little longer—I then put my arm round towards my drawers, and I put my hand on a man's arm—I seized hold of him, and said, "I have got a thief!" and I told my wife to get a light—the man got from my grasp, and got under the bed—it was dark all this time—my wife got a light, and the first sight I saw was the prisoner lying all his length under the bed—I armed myself with the poker, and got under the bed and seized him—I held him till my child got a policeman—when I first laid hold of the prisoner he was at the drawer—I felt the drawer open—I reached</p>

               <p>out my other arm, and seized his other arm, and he and I, and the drawer, all came down together—I missed two syringes and two cravats out of the drawer, and two sixpences, two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, and two 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, out of my trowsers pocket; they were found on the prisoner—the parlour window of my house was open large enough for a man to get in—there bad been some currants in a sieve in my back parlour, and they were found on the top of a party wall, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of halfpence was taken from the top of the drawers in my room—they were found on the wall with the currants—he must have been in my house some time to have taken the halfpence out of the room, and taken them to the wall, and come back again—he had come over five yards before he came to mine—his shoes were found there, and two saveloys.</p>

After the prisoners were taken, I went into Mrs. Plane's house, and found the window open—I found a cord jacket, a waistcoat, a cap, and a lucifer match, the end of which was burnt, and also three spoons lying on the window ledge—in the front parlour I found the shutter thrown up, and a lucifer match lying down by the window.</p>

On 19th Nov., about a quarter to 3 o'clock, I was walking in Fleet-street—I felt a pull at my pocket, looked round immediately, and saw the prisoner close beside me—there was a man close by, who pushed me, which made me stumble—he appeared to be with the prisoner—I recovered myself, ran after the prisoner, and seized him—I missed my purse, which contained 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., from my pocket—I had had it safe five minutes before—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I seized the prisoner, and said, "You have got my purse"—he said he had not—I insisted that he had; and he took it from his pocket, and held it in his hand—I afterwards saw a lady pick it up, and she gave it to me.</p>

On 1st Nov., about half past 2 o'clock in the morning, I was passing down Holy well-lane, Shoreditch, in company with a friend—I had been drinking with some friends, and was not exactly sober—we saw a public-house open, and went in, and had some spirits—I remained there with my friend a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—as I was coming out, the prisoner was standing with his back against the door, and I pulled out my watch to see the time—it was then 20 minutes past 2—I went out at the door, leaving my friend inside, talking to a female—I crossed the road, and the prisoner came, pushed me by the side of my shoulder, and I fell down—I do not know whether he struck me, or only pushed me—he went down with me, and before I got up again there was a policeman at my side, and I missed my watch—the prisoner was brought to me in lest than two minutes, and I recognised him as the man immediately.</p>

I am in partnership with two other gentlemen as stationers and booksellers, in Ave Maria-lane; we carry on business under the old firm of Whittaker and Co., and occupy 13, 14, 15, and 16, Stationers'-court; 13, 14, and 15, are warehouses, and are in the parish of St Martin Ludgate. The prisoner has been in tour service, I believe, about fifteen years; his wages at first were one guinea a week, and latterly 235. a week, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the duties of locking up—it was his duty to be last on the premises at night and first in the morning, he had the keys for that purpose—he had no authority whatever to be on the premises</p>

               <p>on Sunday—I had not forbid it, but there was no necessity for it—there was no necessity for his being there on Sunday 31st Oct.—my dwelling house is in Gloucester-terrace, Hyde-park—on Sunday night 31st Oct, about 10 o'clock, the prisoner came to my house, and stated that the warehouse in Ave-Maria-lane had been broken open, and a considerable quantity of pro<lb/>perty was gone, and bills and half bank-notes were strewed about, which he had picked up as well as he could—he said, without being asked, that he was on his way to church about 6 o'clock, and found the door of the warehouse open; he also stated that being fatigued with magazine work the night before, he had not been from home till church-time that eeening—he was excessively nerv<lb/>ous at the time—he produced this seal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), stating that I should know what that was—it is a crest seal, and had been in my private drawer on the Saturday evening when I left—he requested me to return to Ave-Maria-lane—I did so; on coming to Stationers'-court the prisoner unlocked the door of No. 13, of which a policeman was in' charge—there is no other outside access to the warehouses when they are properly closed for the night, ex<lb/>cept at 13—there was no keyhole or latchhole to 14 and 15—they are closed by bars and bolts inside, and 16 has no door at all; that you can only get to from within; but it is a distinct house—if it had a door it is many years ago—the prisoner got a light at my orders, there was nobody in the warehouse—the prisoner said that he considered the thieves could only have been out very shortly when he first found it, and he wished he had been a few minutes earlier as he might have <hi rend="italic">tackled</hi> them—he said, at my house, it must have been done by some country bands, not London ones, as it was very bung<lb/>lingly done—he got the light at the entrance; there was a candle and lucifers there; that was not the place where they were usually left—we then went to the second house, No. 15, where I found the safe open, the bolts of the lock shot as if it had been locked; it did not appear to have been forced in the least, both doors were wide open—there was not the slightest appearance of vio<lb/>lence, so much so that I remarked, "This must have been done by some person in the house;" by which I meant somebody that bad a key—I always kept the key of that safe; I left it on the Saturday night in a private cem<lb/>partment in the drawer of a private desk which pulled out; it was locked with a Bramah lock, and on drawing it out there was a compartment of three or four inches which lifted up, and underneath it the key bad been kept for many years; it was a secret drawer, it had been forced open and was taken on to the stairs some distance from the counting house; my Bramah key was in my pocket—when the drawer was taken up, and the little compartment lifted up, the key was gone, and I believe was lying on the table on the outside—I did not find it, the prisoner found it—I believe I saw him find it, but I cannot say as to that, because there was so much confusion; but he cer<lb/>tainly brought it to me—I cannot speak positively to my seeing it on the table, but the prisoner brought it to me and said, "This was on the desk."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Those are two very different propositions, his finding it in your presence, and his bringing it to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but I was so confused at the moment that I cannot say positively—the contents of the safe were all gone, with the exception of the bills; a box of silver-gilt plate was gone, consisting of spoons, forks, and knives; I do not know the exact quantity, they had a crest on them, not the same as was on the seal, but a griffin's head erect—the box was about a foot square—it was a large safe with double doors—I also missed six halves of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes besides, consisting of a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, I think, but I cannot be positive—I know they were there at 1 o'clock on the Saturday but I did not see them afterwards; that</p>

               <p>was all that was taken out of my safe; it was all very portable, with the exce tion of the box of plate; other things were thrown about—I locked the safe on Saturday, somewhere about 4, and placed the key in the usual place—when the drawer is taken out of the private desk that would not expose the secret part, unless some violence were used to the drawer—(<hi rend="italic">the witness here pointed out the position of the secret part, on the drawer of his Lordship's desk</hi>)—the cover of the secret part was not actually fixed, but unless it was pulled out violently it would not expose the key; it would fall out if you turned the drawer upside down, but the papers in the drawer did not appear to have been taken out—the cover of the secret place was taken out and left exposed, it was thrown to the back part of the drawer; the cover lifted entirely out; it was a sort of box which fitted in; you could lay hold of the box and lift it up; anybody who was feeling about could see it was a box; they might have acci<lb/>dentally found the key—that key would open the safe if they knew where it applied to.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there a skylight in the leads? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Adjoining the leads; it lights another counting house below—the <hi rend="italic">chevaux de frise</hi> goes each side of a square, and the skylight is farther away, where there is no use for a <hi rend="italic">chevaux de frise</hi>—when you get out of the window the leads are immediately underneath, but the skylight comes nearly close under the window—it is a flat of leads, twelve or fourteen feet from the window—the skylight is not flat; it comes close under the window from which the entry was said to be made—there are two or three feet between the window and skylight when you get out.</p>

               <p>exit of any person; it was impossible for a boy to get in there—the sergeant of police was with me, and the man was underneath—we next went up to my private counting house, which is on the first floor of No. 13—that is where my desk was where I kept the key of the safe—the prisoner knew that I kept it there—there were five safes in the house, but only mine had been opened—I observed a large bunch of rusty old keys lying on a corner of my table, and pointed them out to the sergeant of police—they belonged to the old locks, and had formerly been used in the warehouse—they had been kept in the desk of our foreman, Smith, in No. 15 house—they were keys which the prisoner knew; he had been in the habit of working near that desk for some years—we had a gentleman in our service named John Forster—he had a safe in his charge on the ground floor of No. 16 house, close against the entrance—he had the keys of it; they were in duplicate—I found the duplicate key of Forster's safe in No. 15 house, exactly opposite my large safe—I did not look at Forster's safe on Sunday night; I saw it on; the Monday, and the pins of the lock in three places had evidently been broken—I do not mean the interior of the lock, but the outside pins—they are large box locks, and there is a pin at the four corners, in the same places as you put screws to a lock—that lock bad been attempted at the pins, according to my belief—I tried the key of that lock, and found it would not open the safe—there was a piece of biscuit or some hard substance in the tube which pre<lb/>vented it going home—the safe was unlocked on that Monday, and it had not been disturbed—there were many valuables in that safe—there was a safe also in charge of the prisoner that contained a ledger and books—it was in No. 16 house—I examined it on Monday—it had not been attempted, or in any way disturbed—there were valuables in that safe which no one knew anything of, except the partners—there is a well in it which nobody knew anything about but ourselves—the prisoner had no access to the well; it was closed with a strong lock and covered over, so that nobody would know that there was a well there—No. 15 warehouse door, the prisoner said he found open—that door has no keyhole outside whatever—it is secured by inside bolts and bars, and a padlock inside to the door, which was taken off, and the bar was removed and the bolts drawn—the padlock was found by Smith the warehouseman next morning, in a drawer close by, away from the door altogether—it was not damaged, but was unlocked, and was away from the hasp, which was not broken—I was not present when it was found—the door was just as if there had been no padlock, except that the key was in the prisoner's possession, and it was his duty to lock it—there was no access from without, at the door of No. 15, after it was fastened of a night, but in the day<lb/>time, when we were carrying on business, there was a latch with a handle through the door, which governed the latch, by which it might be opened from outside, and on business days it was left unfastened, for persons to come in; they could turn the latch and walk in or walk out—the prisoner left of a night through No. 13, and locked the door after him; that was the only way by which he could leave all secure—a bar went across the door of No. 15; the door fastens in with an iron catch on each side—the staple and padlock were perhaps a foot or a foot and a half above the bar—the staple was fastened to the jamb of the door—you put the hasp over the staple, and then put the padlock in.</p>

I know the prisoner—on Sunday night, 31st Oct., he came over to our place at a little after 6 o'clock, and asked if one of the young men might come over to their place, for it had been broken open—I went, and the prisoner opened the door of No. 15 by the handle—when we were just on the threshold of the door, I said, "We had better have a constable"—he only said, "Very well"—I came away, and he came after me, shutting the door—he remained out<lb/>side the door of No. 15, and I went for a policeman into Ludgate-street, when I met my fellow-servant (Ann) with a policeman (Kent)—she had not heard what the prisoner had said to me; it was in consequence of something the barman said—I returned to Stationers'-court, and found the prisoner where I</p>

               <p>had left him—I, the prisoner, and the constable went in by No. 15 door—the prisoner said he would get a light—he went to the other side of the warehouse, and got feeling about there, about fifteen or twenty yards from the door; he could not get a light—it was the prisoner who suggested that there should be a light—he said he could not find any lucifers—I did not afterwards see where they were—the prisoner went over to our place to get some—the policeman said, "Make haste, and let us have a light"—then he came over to the Daniel Lambert, and we got a light and lit a candle—he came to where the policeman was, and we three together barred the door of No. 15 again; the bar had been taken from the door—we found an iron chest open—I think it was in the second division of No. 15—there was a cash box on the table; it was broken open—I went for the sergeant, and did not return—when the prisoner came he only asked me to go over the way with him—he said he found the door of No. 15 open, as he was going to church—when I and the policeman went with the prisoner to the premises, he said, "It is no use looking for the thieves, for this is the way they have got out"—that was the door of No. 15—before he had got any light he seemed very agitated—he kept running about the warehouse to get the light—before he got the light he said every blessed place had been broken open—I am quite sure there was no light then.</p>

On Sunday evening, 31st Oct., one of the female servants from the Daniel Lambert came to me—in con<lb/>sequence of what she said I went, having met the potboy, to these premises in Stationers'-court—it was about a quarter past six o'clock—I walked up to the door of No. 15, and there I saw the prisoner standing by the door, he told me the place had been broken open—I immediately took charge of the door by taking hold of the handle; the prisoner went over across the lane to the back of the Daniel Lambert—I had asked him for a light; he came back in the space of half a minute without a light—then I, the prisoner, and the potboy went into the premises directly, still without a light—I asked him again to get a light, and he said he would—he walked about that part of the premises, but got no light—he said, "Oh, here is every blessed place broken open, and every farthing of the money gone"—I said, "Well, man, I wish you would give us a light, we are here in the dark and cannot see anything"—after the space perhaps of two minutes, he did give us a light—he struck three or four lucifers first and let them burn out, and showed himself a light at the further end of the warehouse, but he did not light any candle or gas—I said, "Why do not you get us a light man, you must be mad keeping us here in the dark?"—he had struck a lucifer, and had it lighted in his fingers when he said every blessed place was broken open; and after that was burnt out he struck another and looked about again—I am positive he had struck two lucifer matches before; and when he came back I struck another and lighted a candle which he found somewhere up close behind the door—he said the door No. 15 was where the thieves had got out, and he did not believe we should find them there—he then put up a large bar across the door of No. 15,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185211220080"/>
               <p>and told me it should also be fastened with a padlock, and that he him self fastened it at 10 o'clock on the previous night—I asked him why he came there; he said he came there every Sunday since he had had the situation, except one Sunday—I asked him how long he had had that situation; he said three months—I asked him if he always came at that time on the Sunday; he said, that would be just as it happened, he sometimes came at one part of the day and sometimes at another part—I asked him if he brought the keys with him on a Sunday—he said, "Sometimes I do"—I said, "Have you got them now?" he said, "No, I have not"—we then went on down the warehouse; he took us first to a safe, that was open—I do not know whether it was broken open—I think it had a double door, the lock was shot, but the safe was open—I looked at it, and said to him, "Oh, this is not broken open"—there was a cash box lying on the table, broken; the prisoner said the thieves must have got in where the attempt was made before—he told me it was on the first floor, the back window—we went upstairs to the window, and found the shutters open, and the bar down—the prisoner was walking in front of me; he closed the shutters, put the bar up, and said that was how it was fastened—I took the bar down, and found the window was shut, but not fastened—I am not positive whether there was a fastening to it or not, but I slipped it up without touching any fastening—we could see no footmarks outside, it was dark—I observed a skylight of glass underneath the window—I could see that a smallsized pane of glass had been either broken out or taken out of it; neither a man nor a boy could have got through it—we went nearly all over the premises into a variety of rooms, where the desks were broken open—we found a large key lying on a table, I think on the first floor—I cannot say of which house—I was never there before or since, but it was opposite an iron safe (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Hood here stated that there was no safe there, but that it was on the ground floor</hi>)—this was on the first floor—we left it there, I did not try it to anything—the prisoner told me he rather hoped there was no property gone, as his governors sent to the Bank every day—in another room we found three bundles of keys, some of them were rusty; that was on the first floor, not in the same house—when we came to the iron safe, the doors of which were open, I told him I did not believe it had been broken open, and asked him if he did not think it had been left open—he said he was sure it had not been left open (we had not found the key then)—I afterwards examined the safe; there had been no violence done to it whatever—I did not leave the prisoner from the time I went to the house, till my brother officers came—the prisoner found nothing while I was there that he named, and I did not see him pick up anything—when the keys which were partly rusty were found in the room, and the other loose on the first floor, the prisoner said, "These are the keys the burglars must have left;" or, "the thieves must have left"—we had got a candle at that time, and could see that some of them were rusty and some not—I told him that the keys were not such as burglars would use, that they were not picklock keys or skeleton keys, and asked him if he did not know the keys; he said he did not—I said, "Do not you know whether they are your governors' keys?"—he said, "No, it is impos<lb/>sible for me to know all my governors' keys"—I went away about 7, and did not return any more—I left my Inspector, Mr. McLean there, and sergeant Roberts with him, and the prisoner.</p>

On Sunday, 31st Oct., I went down and spoke to my landlady, who said Mrs. Cooper was very unwell, and asked me if I had got a powder—I went into the prisoner's sitting-room, as near as possible at 11 o'clock—the bed-room door was half way open—I could see into it perfectly, and in coming out of the front-room I saw Mr. Cooper, standing in his shirt-sleeves, shaving himself—I only staid a few minutes—I went up again to get a powder, and brought it down.</p>

               <p>from information I received I went to No. 1, Unicorn-court, Mint-street, with sergeant Wood house, and two other constables—we found the street door open, and went up to the first floor—we had a little boy with us who knocked at the door—some one inside said, "Who is there?"—the boy said, "It is all right," and the door was opened by, I believe, the prisoner Kelly—I entered alone, and saw all the prisoners—Kelly and Fisher were stand<lb/>ing up and the two women, and Minns were standing round the fire—it is rather a small room, the light was in Fisher's hands—it was about half past 6 o'clock in the evening, the fire was alight—I saw a mould in Kelly's hand when I went into the room—I seized it, and took it from him, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believe it is only half of a mould, it is for a half crown—here is half a crown sticking in it now, which I believe is good, the head is next to the mould, it has never been taken out yet—this pipkin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was on the fire containing melted metal quite hot—there was a quantity of broken up plaster of Paris on the hearth, more than enough to have formed the other half of the mould, there was enough to fill a quart pot—I picked up three bad shillings and a sixpence in an unfinished state, from among the plaster of Paris on the hearth, they were quite warm (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found on the mantel piece part of a galvanic battery, and a broken Britannia metal spoon—in the cupboard I found an iron ladle—as I entered the room I saw Brown rise up from where she was sitting, and run to the foot of the bed—I went there afterwards, and found this part of a bad half crown under the bed—I asked Kelly who occupied the room, he said he did—when I took hold of Kelly, Fisher attempted to run down stairs—he was stopped, and brought back—I took the prisoners into custody with the assistance of the other constables—Minns was sitting by the fire for some considerable time, I had desired them all to remain where they were—Minns and Field did not move, it was close to their feet that I picked up the bad money—one was silting on one side of the fire, and one on the other.</p>

I was sent for to James's-terrace, Commercial-road, Peckham, where I saw sergeant Quinnear, who directed my attention to the privy—it had a pan and pipe to it, which were removed by Quinnear, and I saw the palm of the right hand of a child lying on the surface of the soil—Quinnear brought me afterwards the other parts of the body, the head separated into two portions, the left shoulder and arm, the right hand and fore-arm, the ribs were divided from the spine on the left side, dividing the body again between the vertebrse—there were about eighteen pieces—the right arm from the elbow to the shoulder, the brain, and the liver were deficient—the heart was there, but detached from the body—the Jungs were there, and appeared to have been inflated, they decrepitated; the hip was divided, and on comparing the left hip with the left thigh, I found that it was a female child cut up in the middle of the body.</p>

I am the nurse who attended Mrs. Lapham in her confine<lb/>ment—I left some short time after, and returned again—I left on 19th Oct., and returned on the 20th—I had not been there constantly up to the 19th—she was confined on 13th Oct., and I attended her three weeks—I had left eight days, and was sent for again, as the child was very ill—I left on 19th Oct. for one day—the child was five weeks old when this happened—on 19th Oct. I missed a bottle of medicine from the mantel shelf in Mr. Lapham's bedroom—it was a sort of brownish stuff, in an ounce phial—it was used for the baby to have a dose of it every three hours—at the time I missed the bottle the child had only had one dose from it—I gave it two teaspoonfuls—there were a good many doses in the phial—I asked the prisoner if she had seen this bottle, and she said she had not, and I and the prisoner then together made a further search for it, and in the course of the search I missed her holy water bottle from her mantelpiece in her bedroom—this is the bottle (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—she had had the holy water bottle all the time I was there, until the last day—it always looked the same—the medicine bottle was smaller than this one—when I missed the holy water bottle I spoke to the prisoner about it, and she said she supposed them that got the one bottle had got the other—I asked her if she had taken the bottle away—I supposed she might have taken it down to wash it—she said she had not—I made a further search, but did not find the phial—on the evening of the next day (20th) I was sent for again, and went to Mrs. Lapham's—I got there about 8 o'clock in the evening—the child was then very ill, all foaming at the mouth—I noticed a mark on its mouth, and on various articles of linen—I know what oil of vitriol is; I never saw any about Mr. Lapham's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at Lambeth-terrace. I attended Mrs. Lapham in her confinement, and I attended the child subsequently—on the evening of 20th Oct. I was sent for—I sent my assistant first, and then went myself—I got there between 10 and 11 o'clock—I found about two thirds of the child's tongue, the whole of the right side covered with a thick</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185211220095"/>
               <p>white fur, and the inside of the right cheek, against which the tongue was lying, was in the same state—the outside of the right cheek was burnt; the skin was destroyed, and of a bluish appearance all down the side of the cheek to the handkerchief, which I took off the child's neck—it streamed out at the corner of its mouth, and descended to the neck—when I took the handkerchief off the child's neck I found several holes in it, but not so many as there are at present, because the handkerchief was very damp—I put my tongue to it, and it tasted strongly of acid—it proceeded through the folds of the handker<lb/>chief to the bedgown which the child had on, which was also burnt through the holes of the handkerchief—judging from the taste and appearance, my opinion is that it was burnt by oil of vitriol, which coincided with my opinion in the first instance—it tasted to me like vitriolic acid; it was a corrosive acid—I was quite positive, in the first instance, when I saw the ehild, that it was a corrosive acid—the strings of the nightcap were burnt in two or three pieces by the same sort of acid, and the child's thumb was a little burnt in a similar way to the cheek, and the lips were similar to the tongue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far inwardly in the mouth was the tongue burnt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as I could see up the right side; I had attended the child since 10th Oct., for inflammation of the trachea—on 20th Oct., and for some two or three days previous, it was quite out of danger from the inflammation—it was weakly, from the effect of the inflammation, and the remedies applied—it had been able to take the breast freely for those two or three days—after the 20th I recommended its mother, in the first instance, to put it to the breast, with a view of endeavouring to heal its mouth—I thought the nourishment from the breast would be the most soothing thing to its mouth; but it had great difficulty, and could not take it freely, as it had before—whatever it was that produced it, no doubt it must have given the child great pain—it was not at all like the thrush; it completely covered two-thirds of the tongue, on one side—the thrush would have been in small white specks, and particularly on both sides of the cheeks, inside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> To what cause should you attribute this want of power to take the breast? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the administration of the acid, it was so far deprived of the power of taking the breast as to exercise a prejudicial effect on its health; it could not take sufficient nourishment—I continued to attend it till its death—it improved gradually; the appearance of the tongue gradually wore away, but on 3rd Nov. convulsions and fits came on—I had never heard of or observed any convulsions before—I attribute these symp<lb/>toms to the administration of the acid; no doubt it was a great shock on the nervous system—the child could not take sufficient, nourishment for its sustenance; it was wasting away, and the want of proper nourishment increased debility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Convulsions frequently come on in young children, do they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, very frequently; it is one of the most prevalent disorders in the bills of mortality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You continued to attend the child till its death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and after that I made an examination of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose the immediate cause of death was the convulsions and fits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unquestionably; increased debility might make a child more subject to them than before—convulsions very frequently come on from teething; that could hardly be the case with a child seven weeks old—children are sometimes taken ill, and die suddenly, from convulsions, without any apparent cause; it may be caused by a shock to the nervous system, or it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185211220096"/>
               <p>might be caused by some other and independent matter; it is impossible to say.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">put it to the Jury whether, on this evidence, they could be satisfied that the death was caused by the unlawful act of the prisoner: in order to convict, they must be satisfied that the convulsions which produced death were caused by some act on her part.

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at 3, Hargravc-terrace, Ber<lb/>mondsey New-road, in the parish of St. Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey. On 28th Oct. I went out after 9 o'clock at night, and returned about a quarter or twenty minutes past 10, and when I got a few paces off my door, I saw a man just outside the door—I went towards the door, and it was gently opened as I was in the act of ringing the bell, and two young men came out loaded with cloth—I can identify Smithers as one of those men, but I have some doubt as to Toomer—I saw that my shelves were stripped, and the shop in disorder—I did not go into the shop—I looked in, and then pursued them, crying, "Stop thief"—I followed them to the bottom of Webb-street, where there is a chapel, and a turning to the right, and another to the left—the man I had seen outside the door turned to the left, and the two others turned to the right—it was then called out to me that they had dropped the goods, and about seven or eight minutes after I saw them in custody of the police.</p>
