                  </hi>. I am a colourman, living in Bowman's-buildings, Marylebone.

Murder!"—he then got up, and ran away—I ran after him, till he turned down a lonely place, where there, are some old ruins, and I would not follow further—I did not see him stopped—I am sure he is the man; I saw his cap and his coat by the public house lamp, as he ran away—he was dressed as he is now.</p>

I am not related to the prisoner—I live at No. 34, Stephen-street, Lisson-grove—the prisoner lived in the same house—I lodge there with Mrs. Barry—Mr. Dwyer keeps the house, and lives there—I and Mrs. Barry occupy the first floor back room—the prisoner occupied the back kitchen; that is on the ground floor, in the area—there is a floor between his room and mine—I was at home on Sunday night, 26th Feb.; Mrs. Barry was also at home—I saw the prisoner at half-past 8 o'clock, and remained in his room till a quarter or twenty minutes after 10 o'clock, with Mrs. Barry—the prisoner was there the whole of that time—I was sitting down, talking with Mrs. Barry, and the prisoner was reading his book—he had his coat off, and likewise his boots—Mrs. Finnon was in the same room; she lives at No. 9, Stephen-street—she came into the room, and wanted to see his mother—it was about a quarter to 9 o'clock when she came in, and she remained in the room till the prisoner's mother came in, which was a few minutes after 10 o'clock; she had been out—his mother lives there with him, in the back kitchen—about twenty minutes past 10 o'clock me and Mrs. Barry left the room, and went up stairs to our own room, after Mrs. Barry had spoken to Mrs. Rowe—I do not know what became of the prisoner after that.</p>

               <p>out again, and then, by going up a water spout he could get to the parapet of the house, and then could easily get where I found the prisoners—the water spout is perhaps twenty feet high—it would not be a very easy ope<lb/>ration, particularly if a person had had a great fell—I found marks of blood on the water spout and over the roofs of the houses; the whole distance to where I found the prisoners there were drops of blood and marks of hands—on the same morning I found, on the parapet of No. 11, three small keys—after the prisoners were committed, I went on the 14th to examine the place again—I examined the whole of the roofs, and at the spot where I apprehended the prisoners I found, between the tiles, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of Eng<lb/>land notes, stained with blood—I also found three keys on a desk in the office of Messrs. Magnus and Marshall, who occupy the first floor—there was also under the tiles a French silver coin, a French copper coin, and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a woollen draper, at No. 118, Holborn-hill. The prisoner was in my employment—he left me in Jan.—on Tuesday, 7th March, I gave him into custody on a charge of embezzlement—he was taken to the station-house in Smithfield—I went there also—I was on horseback at the time, and I rode to the station—I there made the charge</p>

               <p>—the officer was told to search the prisoner—at that time I was standing with my back to the prisoner—I heard a report, and distinctly felt a ball pass over my head, or I suppose it was the current from the ball, but it went so sharp that I felt the pain from it for half an hour afterwards—I thought it had taken the skin off my head, but it had not; it left no mark whatever—I immediately turned round, and saw the prisoner staring with the greatest possible astonishment to see that I had not dropped—I found that the ball had passed through the window immediately behind me, lower than my head—I was surprised how it could have got over my head without having hit it, but he stood a little higher than I was—the ball struck the wainscoting and penetrated to the extent of about an inch, the wainscoting being firm against the wall caused the ball to rebound—the prisoner was secured by the officer, and I saw a pistol in the officer's hands.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police inspector</hi>). I recollect the prisoner being brought to Smithfield station on Tuesday, 7th March—he was charged by Mr. Umpleby with embezzlement—I was entering the charge, and my head was close to Mr. Umpleby's while I was doing it—just as I was putting down the amount, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I felt the bullet pass my head—it did not touch my head; I felt the sensation of its passing me—Mr. Umpleby was standing by the side of me, and it passed from the back of his head to the front of mine—I was a little behind him, leaning to the desk—I turned round, and saw this pistol (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the prisoner's hand—he was in the dock at the time—that is higher than the place where I was standing—I went into the dock, and threw the prisoner down, and another constable picked up the pistol—I traced where the ball had gone through the window, and into the moulding—I have brought the bullet and the moulding too—after the prisoner was fully secured, I asked him why he wanted to injure me—I think I said, "What did you want to fire at me for?"—he said, "I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> On 7th March I had been down to Lower East Smithfield, and on returning home I was walking up the Kingsland-road; I happened to turn round, and saw Mr. Umpleby on horseback, and to avoid him I walked up this turning that he terms a court; he came up to me, and said, "What are you doing here? I have been looking for you for some time; I want to have some conversation with you;" I said, "Very well;" he said, "Where can you got" I then condescended to walk with him, I suppose pretty well a quarter of a mile, or nearly so, till we saw a policeman; he called him, and gave me in charge; we went to the police station at Smith<lb/>field; the charge was entered; the policeman was desired to search me; I had the pistol now produced in my pocket, and when the officer was told to search me I pulled it out of my pocket in a hurry to lay it down, and it exploded; the inspector called out, "Police! murder!" and sent for assist<lb/>ance, and I should think not less than twenty policemen came in, most of them with their jackets off, and each of them took a very active part, or tried to do so, in searching me; I had a pair of gaiters on at the time, and they were trying to take my boots off without taking my gaiters off; I could not help smiling at the time; I was told to stand on my legs; that accounts for Mrs. Marshall saying I was laughing; I might have smiled, for I could not help smiling to see so many able bodied men trying to get my boots off with<lb/>out taking my gaiters off; they searched me and found some money on me, and they locked me up; about an hour after I was locked up in the cell, inspector Teague came in, and said, "Now you seem a little more cool than you were a short time back, is there anything you want?" and he said to the housekeeper, who was standing outside, "Let the prisoner have anything he wants, any refreshment or anything of the sort," and pretended to make me very comfortable; he sent up stairs for a mattrass to lie upon, which I thought was very kind of him; he rubbed his hands, and said, "I don't know whether you meant this for me, but you gave me very short notice;" this conversation took place in the cell, I have no recollection of any other; I said, "It is not likely I intended it for you, neither did I intend it for Mr. Umpleby;" it is not likely, if I had intended it for Mr. Umpleby, that I should have said so to inspector Teague; Mrs. Marshall hearing Mr. Teagues statement at Guildhall, as a matter of course states the same thing, it is natural; having bought the pistol the same morning that I saw Mr. Um<lb/>pleby, it does not appear at all probable that I bought it for the purpose of shooting him with it; if I had intended to take his life, I should have been prepared weeks before, or days before at all events; having bought the bullet mould for the purpose of making bullets, it does not appear very much like intending it for one particular purpose; my object was to have left</p>

On 16th March, I was at the Fortune of War, about 10 o'clock in the evening; I sow the prisoner there—I did not know him before—Mrs. Moseley and her son came in, the son had a piece of paper in his hand—the prisoner had then left the bar—Mr. Moseley said something to me, and went into the skittle ground—in consequence of what he said to me, I watched the prisoner; he ran into a neighbour's yard in Georgiana-street, at least he walked at a mid<lb/>dling pace—I walked down the yard to him—Mr. Moseley came to me—the prisoner was round the corner of the yard, behind a dead wall; I asked him what he was doing, he said he was down there for his own convenience—I asked him to be kind enough to step along, with me, and he refused to do so—I told him he had no business down there, that he was a trespasser on the property of a neighbour of mine—he said to hoped he was doing no harm—Mr. Moseley came up, I asked him if this was not the man that was in front of the bar, and he said it was—Mr. Moseley asked him to step along with us, and he did so—when we got to the house, Mr. Moseley said to his mother, "Is this the man that gave you the note?" she said, "Yes; it is"—a policeman was then sent for, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

The packet in which I engaged a berth you will not be able to go over further than Paris, because, being a minor, you require a passport, countersigned by the Consuls in London, which you will not obtain without giving full information as to who you are; for Paris and Belgium they are not so strict. Therefore, if you leave London on the 14th, you can be in England again on the 18th very comfortably. In the mean time your outfit and all shall be ready on board for you, and you can remain until the last moment.

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Harefield. On Saturday night 18th March, I was in the tap room at the Six Bells public house, it Ruislip, in company with George Rogers and William Brown—the prisoners were there—I knew them by sight, but did not know their names—I was not drinking with them—I pulled out my purse to pay for what I had—that was between 10 and 11 o'clock—Lavender said, "Mate, your pone seems rather heavy"—I said, "There is not much in it, besides a few half-pence"—I left the house at 11 o'clock with Rogers and William Brown, And went across the fields towards Harefield—when we got over the stile into the road Rogers left us, and went into his own house—the boy (William Brown) and I went on, and about ten minutes after Rogers had left us I heard some persons coming behind me—I slackened my pace whilst they overtook me, and Lavender and one of the other prisoners, I cannot say which, passed me—they walked along just before me, and the other behind me—as I was going on he came up opposite me, and began pushing up against me, reeling from one side of the road to the other—he came up against me five, six, or seven times, and then began sparring round me, and saying, "Will you fight?"—that was either Tobutt or Bray—I said, "I don't want any fighting, there is plenty of room for you and me along the road without pushing against me, I want to go on home about my business"—I attempted to go on again, and either Bray or Tobutt stepped behind me, put his foot against my leg as I was walking on, and I fell down on the road on my face—after I was down the three men got across me, there was not a word spokes—I said nothing to them or they to me—the hands of the one who threw me down, were in my left pocket; he did not find anything there, and he thrust his hand into my right pocket And took my purse—</p>

I recollect seeing him serve the prisoner with a pennyworth of spruce on 1st March—my brother went out—I saw the prisoner again in about five minutes after my brother had gone out—she then came for a pennyworth of gin—I served her and she gave me a sixpence; I put it in the till—I observed there was only one sixpence there before that, that made two—I saw the prisoner again in a few minutes, she came for change for a sixpence—I gave her change, and put that sixpence in the till, that made three—I am sure there were only three sixpences there—the prisoner came again in a few minutes, and asked for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy, she put down a sixpence—I put it on one side while I served a gentleman with some beer—I then looked, and found it was bad—I received another sixpence from some sailors; that was good—I did not mix that with the other three sixpences—I pot the one that the prisoner gave me by my side and said to her, "You gave me a bad sixpence"—she then gave me a shilling—I said to her, "I believe you have given me some more bad ones"—she said, "I have not, I will go and ask my husband, he gave it me "—she ran out, I sent a person after her—she was brought back by an officer in a few minutes—I gave the officer the three sixpences out of the till—from the time my brother left the bar till I gave the three sixpences to the officer, no one could have gone to the till—they were the only three sixpences that were there when T took them out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I was in Messrs. Hutton's employment; and have pleaded guilty to robbing them (<hi rend="italic">see last Case</hi>)—I have been in their employment turned eight years, as a silk skeiner—it was my duty to work on it, but not on the premises at Newgate-street—I had not access to the bulk of silk on the premises; the prisoners had, they were packers—in Jan. I received from Coombes 7 lbs. of silk, such as this produced—I had occasion to go to the warehouse two or three times a week to ask for employment—it was packed in brown paper—Coombes said, "Here is 7 lbs. of silk; we want 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound for it"—that was him and Wells—Wells handed the silk from the cellar to Coombes, who was within hearing, and he handed it to me—I was to pay them at dinner time in the warehouse, if it was sold—I sold it that night to a man named Beale, who keeps the Black Swan public house, Church-street, Bethnal-green, for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this was on Saturday; I did not settle for it till the Monday—I think I settled for it to Wells in the warehouse, but am not quite sure—I gave him at the rate of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound—I did not pocket 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. myself—there was an allowance made to the person who sold it for me—he did not actually buy it of me; he obtained me a purchaser, and gave me the money, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave a young man there 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and kept the rest myself—about a month after that I received 18 1/2 lbs. of the same silk, wrapped in paper, which weighed 15 ozs.—Coombes told me to meet Wells at dinner time at Westmoreland-buildings, Aldersgate-street—I met him there in the open street, and we went into a coal shed, and weighed the silk with the paper, after which it was delivered to me, and they told me to meet them at 8 o'clock at night at a public house opposite, where it was weighed; I do not know the sign—I took it to a man named Buggies, who received it of me, and sold it in two lots—he brought me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the first lot; the weight was short, and they kept back 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or it would have been 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he sold the rest the same afternoon, and paid me for it at the rate of 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound—he gave me two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and some odd shillings—I took the money home, turned the notes into cash, and went to the public house appointed at 10 minutes past 8 o'clock—I found the prisoners waiting there, and paid them at the rate of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound, according to agreement.</p>

Hutton's just upon nine years; I was in their service before the prisoners—I used to skein different silk to this, dyed silk—I am charged with stealing gimp—I only saw Mr. Hutton once while I was disburdening my mind—I saw somebody else from Mr. Hutton's, and disburdened my mind to him as well—it was Mr. Sleigh, a partner in the house—he also said it would be better for me to disburden my mind—the name of the publican where I sold the silk is Beale—he took it away out of the house, and sold it—I did not give him anything for selling it—I gave the young man half a crown; no, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—his name is Arnett—I mean to represent that Mr. Beale sold it for me without any remuneration—I have not known him twelve months personally—I did not tell him I had stolen it, or that I had come honestly by it—I told him I had got a lot to sell, and he laid, "I will take it, and see if I can sell it for you"—he did not know where it came from—he did not know where I lived—he is not a dealer in silk that I know of—he kept it the best part of an hour—I think he went out of the house to sell it—this was on a Saturday night, just after Christmas—the house was open—we were in the parlour—it was past 9 o'clock at night—there were, I think, other persons present.</p>

The prisoner had been about two years and a half in our employment when this robbery was discovered—prior to Wright being examined before the Magistrate I had an interview with him, and from information I received from him I went to Wells's lodgings, with Harvey, a policeman—Wells was not there; we found a child and two females, one of whom said she was his wife—we did not search much; Harvey looked about a little, and found this hair seating (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was wrapped up in brown paper behind a couch, in one corner of the room—I then went home, and called Wells into my private counting house, and said, "How could you prove such a rascal after the kindness we have shown you; Wright is in custody, is there any person else that is connected with this matter but Coombes?" he said, "No"—I asked him how the horsehair seating came on his premises—he could see by that that I knew something about it—he said one of the porters must have taken them there, and he hedged about and prevaricated a good deal—I said, "It is quite impossible; you had better tell the truth; did not you take it yourself?" he said, "I did"—all I said was, "You had better tell the truth."

                  </hi>. I am manager of the silk and jewellery department These bracelets produced are such as we have in stock; I buy such goods at Birmingham for my employers, and believe these to be theirs, as also this cigar case—there is printed German paper in the lining of it; that is in it when it comes from Germany—we had some samples of this description in October last, and when we came to mark off the goods we missed them—they were sent to us from Berlin.</p>

I knew his wife from the time they were married—on Friday, 17th March, he and his wife passed the evening at my house—they, had been married thirteen years—I have seen a good deal of them all that time—they were a very happy couple, and very affectionate—they left my house between 10 and 11 o'clock on the Friday night—they drank tea and supped there—they seemed on their usual affec<lb/>tionate terms, and left to go home—the prisoner took some porter; he had half a class, and then drank out of the mug rather hard—some six years ago he was under a physician at St. Bartholomew's Hospital for his head—he was quite incapable of work, and childish, almost like an idiot—for the last two or three months before this happened, I observed him parti<lb/>cularly; we have all been terrified by his manner and the look of his eyes—his wife had had no rest for a month—he made curious faces, and had a wild look; I was frightened of him, and had been for some time—it was our wish that he should be placed somewhere, but his wife could not bear to part with him, she was so fond of him—this is the fourth time that he has been in this way—I saw him on the Saturday morning this happened—I was just out of bed, and some one brought him into my room, somewhere about 9 o'clock—he was dressed; his clothes were wringing wet; he had been in the water—I pulled off his clothes, and he got into my bed—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the London and North Western Railway Company. I was on the line, near Primrose-hill, between 5 and 6 o'clock on Saturday evening, 26th Feb., at the mouth of the Primrose-hill Tunnel—I saw the prisoner there nearly the whole of the afternoon—about 200 hundred yards from where I am stationed I saw him get on the line at five minutes past 5 o'clock—I called out to him, and he went off the line—the 5 o'clock express came down a few minutes afterwards; as soon as that had passed and entered the tunnel, he came on to the line again; and about a quarter or twenty minutes past 5 o'clock, I saw him placing bricks on the line—as I knew that the quarter past 5 o'clock express was coming out directly, I ran up the line and caught him as he was getting up the wall to get away—I pulled him back across the line,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030051"/>
               <p>and made him knock some of the bricks off, and I knocked some off myself—they were on the rail—there were two bricks on the down main line, three on the up main line, and three on the goods down line; one of them just in at the end of the point—before we had got them off the down express was coming; it came past in a moment—it was coming through the arch of the Camden station, at the time I had hold of the prisoner: there was an up train coming through the tunnel at the time—it was about two minutes' distance from the spot where he put the bricks, and there was a down engine coming down the points to get behind a cattle train, on the goods line—the brick on the goods line was placed between the points, so that they could not close, the consequence of which would have been that the engine would have been thrown on to the up main line, and there would have necessarily been a collision, as the engine would have been thrown in front of the train that was coming up—I saw passengers in the carriages.</p>

I went out and went up to the prisoners; they were sitting on a window sill, five doors from my house—I said to one of them, "You have stolen something from my place"—she said, "No"—I did not feel satisfied, and put my hand under her shawl, and took a pair of brass curtain bands from under it—they then each of them struck me, and one of them said, "Now let us have her b——earrings;" and one tore one out of one ear, and the other out of the other ear—only one of them succeeded in getting it, which she took away; the other lodged in the net of my hair—one was afterwards found on the ground by a little girl.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a beer shop keeper, of the Prince of Wales, Beech street, Barbican. On Tuesday night, 21st Feb., I had about seventy-one or seventy-three sovereigns, I am not quite certain which, in a cash box upstairs in my bed-room, on the second floor, which is the floor above the club-room—between 12 and 1 o'clock on the next day, I heard a female voice screaming; it was my wife—I ran up stairs—a man rushed by me on the stairs, saying he was going for a policeman—when I got a little further up, I saw my wife struggling with the prisoner Williams on the landing, outside the club-room door—I laid hold of Williams—my wife called to me to hold him tight, for he had got all the money—at that moment Johnson came from the parlour, as I was struggling with Williams on the stairs below—Johnson said, "Hold him tight," but at the same time striking and kicking me on the arm, as I was standing on the stairs below him holding Williams—he then rushed by me into the street, and I saw no more of him—Williams took a sovereign out of his mouth, and said, "This is all I have taken"—I had seen them both before at my house; Johnson I had seen several times; and on this morning they came together, and called for a pint of ale, which they drank together in front of the bar; and then Johnson asked me if I had got a room in which they could sit down—I said there was a room up stairs, but there was no fire—they went up stairs together, and were served with a pint of ale up stairs—I went into the club-room, and served them myself—they were drinking together when I took them up a second pot of ale—Williams wanted me to let him go very badly—he was given in charge, and a policeman brought Johnson back—I examined the bedroom door—the lock had not been touched, but a drawer in the bedroom was wrenched open, and the lock was lying inside, wrenched right off—I had locked it myself, a few minutes before, and taken out all the sovereigns but one, which was then missing from the cash-box, which was left—it had not been locked—I found it open, and the papers strewed about the room—if parties were in the club-room, they would, without difficulty, get to the bedroom, up the staircase—I have not lost any money.</p>

               <p>for about a minute, still looking at the shop; Macey and Huskins went down Beech-lane; Bendz then ran after them—I called Packman, another officer, and then went into Mr. Ward's, after which I followed the prisoners, and took Huskins; Packman took the other two—Huskins turned eleven pieces of silk out of her pocket at the station, which made fourteen hand<lb/>kerchiefs, as some pieces contain two handkerchiefs—in her basket there were two cambric handkerchiefs—I asked her if she would account for the possession of the handkerchiefs, and she refused—Packman asked Bendz his address, and he refused to give it; I afterwards ascertained where he lived, went there, and was present when Packman found four silk handkerchiefs, which were shown to Bendz in my presence; he said two of them were his, and one he bought in the country—I did not examine to see whether they were made up; we found them at No. 56, Orchard-street, Westminster—they form part of the goods stolen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am now living in London, I do not know the name of the street. In Nov. last year I was residing at Brussels, at No. 18, Rue de la Marche, with a Madame Louise—I was following the occupation of a milliner—I saw the prisoner there—I do not recollect about what time, it was in the autumn—I had been living at Brussels about three months, or three months and a half, when I first saw the prisoner there—before that I had lived at Lille; I was between six and seven years of age when my mother died—my father died about two years ago—I believe myself to be sixteen years and a half old—I was in the habit of keeping my birthdays, since two years I have not done so—it was on 16th Aug., two years ago, that I last kept it—my sister and several other parties made me some presents on that day, I was then fourteen—that was the last birthday I kept—I first met the prisoner in the gallery de St. Hubert at Brussels, I was with two or three of my friends at the time; they were girls about my own age—he did not say anything to me on that occasion—one of the young girls I was with knew him—I saw him again one or two days afterwards, at the same place—I think he spoke to me on the second occasion; he asked me if I would like to go to a house of business where I would gain plenty of money, and be well off and work at my profession—my friends were with me at that time—I answered that I did not know if I should go, that I did not much like to go—I did not like to go, I did not consent—while the prisoner was talking to me about this the girl he knew was present, and she told me a great many things in order to determine me to go; I do not recollect exactly the words she said, but I know there were a great many things in order to engage me to go; I saw the prisoner again, I think it was the next day or the day after—I had not then made up my mind to go, I was not determined, but I had it in my head to go—he said on the third occasion, that he would give us money on the railway before starting—there was another young lady with me—he showed us a purse filled with gold, or at least with some gold in it, and said, "I have received a letter, and I must start immediately"—he then took a railway ticket, and then he said he had not enough money—it was on the third occasion that we went to the railway—I saw him in the</p>

               <p>gallery of St. Hubert, and we went together to the railway—he took three railway tickets—the young lady who was with me asked him for the money which he had promised to give, and he gave her a twenty-five franc piece, but nothing to me—he said he had not money enough, or he would see if he had money enough when he had taken the tickets—the companion who went with me went by the name of Leoni.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Harrison came to dine every day, did you hear him and Madame Denis talk together about the clubs, or anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; very often Madame Denis said to him, "Have you been to my lord this or that name? have you been to the clubs?"—he then said, "Yes, I have been;" or, "They are in the country, and it is no use to go there"—besides the clubs, the park was mentioned, and something was said about the houses of parliament; one day Madame Denis said to the prisoner that he ought to go up to the houses of parliament, and say some hard words to, or blow up, one of the gentlemen there, because he did not pay—after I had been there about a month, Madame Denis introduced me to a gentleman—before that time I had suspected a little what sort of a house it was, but I was not quite certain—from the day I entered the house, up to the time that I escaped, I could not have got away; I never found means to do so, because I did not like to speak to the little girl Elvire, fearing she would tell it to Madame, or speak to Madame</p>

               <p>about it—I could not come down stairs and go out of the house; any time that I was going down, they made me go up instantly; and Madame was always watching down stairs—often it was the father (Deseaux), and often it was Madame Denis who said, "Will you go up stairs directly!"—Deseaux was the whole day with us in the room which we inhabited—he allowed us to go out of the room, but not to go down—he did not say anything if we went out of the room into our bedroom, but he did not allow us to go down—he used to smoke, to read, and to walk about the room all day; if we went to the window, he took us by the arm and made us go back—he said, "Go back directly from the window, because ray daughter will see you, and will scold me"—Madame used always to be in the dining-room; that is quite near to the street door—if any one went out at the door they could be heard from the room where Madame sat; they could not alone hear, but see, because the door of the room was oftener open than shut—after I had been there about a month, Madame introduced me to a gentleman, who was called the Greek prince; he was in the drawing room—Madame said to him, "I introduce you here to my sister"—when I went down into the drawing room there was Madame, the French girl, and the Greek prince present—the French girl had gone down first; I went down a very long time after her—after Madame introduced me to the Greek prince, she opened my gown—the French girl was not then in the room; Madame and me were alone with the prince—she undid the hooks, opened my dress, took the hand of the Greek prince, and showed my breasts, and said, "Look here, does she not resemble me? she has quite the same breast as I have"—Madame took his hand and put it on me, and made his hand touch me—the prince said, "Let me alone, you dirty procuress; she is not more your sister than she is mine"—I went out of the room, and went up stairs, and Madame afterwards scolded me, and said, "You have no manners; you are a stupid fool"—I did not consent to the prince or Madame doing this—I heard Madame tell Harrison, either that same day or the next morning, that the Greek prince had been there—I do not recollect what Harrison said to it—I was not introduced to any man there after that—some days before we went to Paris, Madame asked the French girl to come down; something was wanted, to try on her dress, or something—I went down, and saw an old gentleman there, near the fire; Madame said it was the old marquis—Harrison came up once to the room where we sat, to write a letter for Leoni to her mother, and then he came several times on a little commission, to fetch a dress for Madame, or something—Deseaux was there at the time Harrison came up; after that I went with Monsieur and Madame Denis to Paris—Madame said she wanted to go to the country to see some friends, and as it was me she liked best, she wanted me to accompany her—she did not say where she was going; she said to the country, to some friends—I went to Paris, in the company of Monsieur and Madame Denis—while I was travelling from London to Paris, I was not out of the control of Monsieur and Madame Denis; she was always at my side—I had never been to Paris before—I knew nobody at Paris—while I was there I knew no one but Monsieur and Madame Denis; we went to the Hotel de Valois, Rue Richelieu; we occu<lb/>pied the first floor—whilst I was in Paris, a man was introduced to me by Madame Denis—I do not know who he was—that might have been one day or two days after we got to Paris; I rather think it was two days after our arrival—that man had connection with me; it was without my consent—Madame Denis was present at the time—I heard Madame Denis say to him, "I have a bill to pay, and you must give me so much"—I am not quite</p>

               <p>certain, but I think the sum mentioned was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and she said, "To my sister you do not give so much as you gave to that little girl Marion"—I returned from Paris with Monsieur and Madame Denis in a fortnight—from the time I went to Paris to the day I returned to Denbigh-terrace, I was always under the control of Monsieur and Madame Denis—I went back to No. 3, Denbigh-terrace—after we came back, Madame wanted to give me some medicine, but I did not take it—she said, "If you don't take that, you won't have anything to eat"—I saw Harrison afterwards; he had a dispute with Madame—I did not see him so often afterwards; he did not come any more to dinner—the dispute between him and Madame was, first of all, that he did not guard the house well in her absence; and secondly, that he had let the servants know or see that the Greek prince came—Harrison said that he had kept and guarded the house well, and that he only left it for a little message—the other subject of dispute was about 100 francs, which Harrison wanted from Madame, as his part of the money she had received in Paris—Madame told him that he had spent a great deal of money in her absence, and that he had drunk or taken a bottle of Cognac, which was sent for a sample—I do not recollect what Harrison said to that—after I returned I was again taken to the Greek prince by Madame—he was in the bedroom that time; it was between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening—the Greek prince was in bed—Madame pushed me near to the bed where the Greek prince was lying, lifted my dress up, and put the hand of the prince on my legs—that was without my consent—on the first occasion when this happened to me, I complained to Madame, and told her that I was not brought up for this, and that I did not like it—I had always thought to escape since a long time back, but eight days after my return I was quite determined—I spoke to Elvire Cerckell—after that, I remained oftener up stairs in my room than before—during the last eight or nine days that I was there, after coming from Paris, I was constantly crying; not always, but often—Madame saw me crying, and one day she took my bonnet and shawl and locked them up, and said, "If one thinks to escape, one will not do it."</p>

               <p>a house where they did nothing in it—they did not sell wine or brandy or anything—I lived there with a widow named Louise—Madame Louise had the whole house, I lived there, and I had a bedroom to myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did other girls live there besides yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only myself, and a little daughter of Madame Louise—I only worked at home with her, no-where else; I was not paid for my work, I worked with her—the agree<lb/>ment was that I did not work for anybody, nor any particular sort of work; I was to work in the house, and my sister paid for my food—my sister went away before I met Harrison; I do not recollect how long before—I do not know exactly when my sister left, but it was a few days after the arrival; she left directly, she left an address where I was to write to her—am I obliged to give it?—I should not like to give it, my business is not that of my sister—I owed Madame Louise some money when I left Brussels, it was money which she had lent me to buy some ribbon for my bonnet; I do not know how much, only some francs—I left Brussels without letting Madame Louise know that I was going—I do not even myself know why I did so, because Harrison put some fine things in my head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you thought you were going to a millinery business, why could not you let Madame Louise know? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because she would not have allowed me to go—I have two sisters—the other is travelling with an American family—it was between two and three in the afternoon when I met Harri<lb/>son in the Gallery of St. Hubert—the girls I was with were some friends—I cannot recollect where I met them—I cannot recollect all these little particulars; if I had known I was obliged to recollect them, I would have given more attention to it—when you were of my age, where did you find your friends? I made casual acquaintances, and through one I made ano<lb/>ther—it was a girl named Louise that was a friend of Harrison's, she said she was a friend of his; it was Louise that persuaded me to go—she said the same that Harrison said; and besides that, she said that several other girls who had been with Harrison were very well off, and that Harrison was a very respectable man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said, that when you were in Denbigh-terrace, you heard Madame speak about going to the Clubs; just tell us what you actually heard her say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said to him, "Well, Harrison, have you been to the Clubs?" or, "Have you been there?"—she did not say for what purpose; but he said, "I don't think that he is in town"—it was after this that I went to Paris—we went by the railway to Folkestone, and to Boulogne—we had to pass the Custom-house—I thought at that time that I was going into the country—Madame said that we were going to the country, in Scotland, and that we had to pass that way—I was doubtful at the moment; and when I heard them speak French, I said to her, "They speak French very well here;" she said, "Yes; it is a little town in France which we have to pass to go to Scotland"—I did not believe that Boulogne was the way to Scot<lb/>land, I doubted it very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you willing, or not, when you got to Boulogne? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was going to the country, and the country was great pleasure.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What, with Madame Denis, after you had been treated in the way you have stated with the Greek prince? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, because I thought to go for a pleasure party—we went to the railway station at Boulogne—I found that they spoke French very well there, for Scotch people—Madame took me to the Hotel de Paris, at Boulogne, and said to me, it was just because it was the Hotel de Paris that they spoke French—afterwards we went to the railway, I did not hear anybody speak there at all—I did not give</p>

               <p>any attention to it; I could not hear, because Madame Denis and I went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the railway, and when I went out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> Madame Denis took me by the arm instantly—she did not go to get the tickets; M. Denis fetched the tickets, and Madame went direct with me into the railway carriage—I certainly heard somebody speak at the railway, but I did not give any attention to it, because Madame said, "We are passing a little town, in order to go to Scotland"—I had no idea that we were going to Paris, but I thought it very curious that we had to pass France in order to go to Scotland, which belongs to England—we stopped at Amians, and had something to eat and drink—I was surprised at the language they spoke there, but I always doubted the whole time—she always made the same answer as before, if I asked her, that we were going to an old castle in Scotland—I heard of Amiens several times while I was at Lille—we got to Paris in the evening—I did not think that we had arrived at the castle in Scotland—I said to Madame Denis that we were now in a French town, because the soldiers had red dresses—I had nobody there to whom I could complain—Madame took me by the arm, and passed me as her niece, and I certainly would not go and complain to a stranger, or any one passing by, or the soldiers—in the way from the railway to the hotel, Madame kissed me, and told me we were in Paris, but begged me very hard not to say so, or tell anybody—she promised me a great many nice things, and begged me very hard not to tell anybody, not even her father or Harrison, when we came back, that we had been to Paris—the Hotel de Valois is a large hotel; it is a public hotel; it is an <hi rend="italic">hotel meublee</hi>, a furnished house; there was not a common dining room—Madame and M. Denis and myself dined together—I did not know that a gentleman would come to see me, but I knew that a gentleman would come to see Madame Denis—I swear that the man had connection with me entirely against my will—that was the only time he had connection with me—I saw him afterwards, I think it was twice; I saw him often when he came there—he had connection with me twice afterwards, on different days—on both those occasions it was against my will—the gentleman gave me eight pieces of gold; Madame Denis took that away from me—he also gave me a bracelet, a cross, and a ring; Madame Denis allowed me to put on those things the day the gentleman came, but the day before we started she took them away from me, and said that those things were of no use on the voyage—I was not angry at her taking them away from me; I did not care about it—I knew we were coming back to Eng<lb/>land; Madame told me so—I did not make any communication to anybody on my way back; I could not, because I was always seated between M. and Madame Denis.</p>

I know the prisoners; I believe they are cowkeepers, and term themselves slaughtermen—they live at No. 8, Mitcham-street, Lisson-grove, about ten minutes' walk from my premises—I have a cow shed in Burwood-mews; I had three cows there on 13th Feb.—I had bought the last two about three months ago, they cost me 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—two of them were very full of milk; one was very forward in calf—early on the morning of 14th Feb. I went to my cow shed in Burwood-mews, and found the three cows gone—they were the only cows I had—I had a servant named Robert Amos</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. George Potter and another, lime merchants, at Purfleet-wharf, Earl-street, Blackfriars. On Friday, 17th Feb., I went to the London and Westminster Bank, in St. James's-square, between 3 and 4 o'clock; I received there 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and some silver—I had the money in my hand, and my hand in my pocket—when I was in St. James's-square, the prisoner and another man ran by me—the other man</p>

               <p>ran by me, the prisoner was by my side, and something was dropped like a sovereign—the prisoner picked it up—it sounded like a sovereign; I had not time to see what colour it was—the other man said, "That is that boy's sovereign"—the prisoner said to me, "Is it yours?"—I directly took my money out to count it, and the other man came and knocked my elbow, and all the money fell into the road—I picked up some, and the prisoner's com<lb/>panion came and assisted me to pick up some—he gave me two sovereigns and some of the silver—I thought that the money was all right with the two sovereigns that I had picked up, and I put it in my pocket—the pri<lb/>soner and his companion walked on to the corner of Charles-street, and I was informed they then ran—I did not see them run—I went on to the corner directly, but I could not see them—I thought the money was right, and I went on to the Strand—I there thought there might be something wrong, and I went into a jeweller's shop, Messrs. Vaughan's, and I showed Mr. Hitchcock the money—he told me there were two bad sovereigns, and he told me to go back to the bank, and tell them—I went back and told them—I then went home and gave Mr. Potter all the money, the good and the bad—he gave me the whole of it back the next morning—I kept it in my possession for about a fortnight, and then Mr. Potter said he thought we should hear no more of it, and I gave it him back again—I do not know that there was any mark put on it at any time.</p>

I took out my money to count it—the prisoner was standing close by my side, and the other man knocked my arm, and then the money was taken up and given me—I had not seen either of the men before.</p>

               <p>and the other man whom I had been watching, near him—I saw them busily in conversation with him, and I saw some sovereigns drop from the boy's hand—I saw the prisoner and the other man stooping down, pretending to assist the boy in picking them up, and in a moment after I saw the prisoner and the other man go to the corner of Charles-street, and then they ran away—J spoke to the boy Cook; and then I ran after them, but was not able to overtake them—I came back to the boy, and he showed me the money, and I saw two of the sovereigns were bad—I am positive the pri<lb/>soner is one of the persons I saw.</p>

On Saturday, 1st April, I and Shepherd were going by the White Hart Inn, at Hayes, with two dung carts; Shepherd was driving, and Red-worth, who is ostler at the White Hart, took a sack with something in it out of the end of Shepherd's cart and carried it into the stable of the White Hart.</p>

I have got into a wrong <hi rend="italic">bus"</hi>—on that I told my father to touch the conductor, to let her out—Mrs. Mullins put out her hand, and said, "Stop a minute, I have lost my purse"—on that Siddell seemed very much agitated, and wanted to go out; she leaned backwards, placed her hand behind her, and passed the purse to Pearce—I immediately called out, "The male prisoner is an accomplice, the purse is passed!"—Pearce heard that, and looked at me—the omnibus was stopped, and a policeman came—I saw the purse in the female prisoner's hand, and saw her put it into the male prisoner's hand, and she said, "Say, you have dropped your purse; say you are my friend."</p>

               <p>I cannot tell what we talked about, I was not there above half a minute—I do not recollect his saying, "It shall not put Mr. Smith to any expense, the county will pay it, certainly not"—all I have stated took place at the com<lb/>mencement, and it was in the hall of the theatre, not in the tavern, we were not half a minute in the tavern; after having the glass of ale I returned—nobody else came to see me about this prosecution—at the same time that I delivered this message to Mr. Smith, I remember asking him about a private box for somebody—I do not know whether the person was waiting for an answer, but the message was sent to me while I was in the hall; one of, the men opened the door, and said, "Mr. Smith says it is all right, Mr. Wild"—I did not repeat the words, "It is all right," because the party was not there at the time; I was to send it to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you, putting a benignant construction upon this matter, might not Pull have misunderstood that answer as applying to his errand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> certainly might, but I applied it to a private box—it was one of the carpenters that passed, and said, "Mr. Smith says it is all right"—I had asked him for a private box, or taken a message to him; it had nothing to do with this—Pull was there—he might have misapplied it to his errand; this was in the hall of the theatre—I recollect Mr. Serjeant Adams calling—I did not know the gentleman—he called on Mr. Smith—I saw him in Mr. Smith's room—I do not know whether he came for a private box—he was in the room previous to my going there—I was sent for, and Mr. Smith put the question to me as to what answer I returned to Mr. Pull, and I said, "I am quite certain he had nothing whatever to do with it"—the gentleman had his face to the fire, and he turned round and said, "I am quite certain you are speaking the truth, for you don't know me," and then I was introduced to him as Mr. Serjeant Adams—I was in character at the time, for this happened to be during the performance of the "Corsican Brothers "—I am quite sure he made that observation.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The brief was here read, as follows. It was endorsed</hi> "Middlesex Ses<lb/>sions, Westminster, 27th Feb., 1854.—The Queen, on the Prosecution of T. Smith, against George Carter.—Brief for the Prosecution.—Mr. Horry, one guinea. S. C. Horry.—Costs allowed.—Six months' imprisonment. C. T. Jones, 125, Long-acre." <hi rend="italic">The contents were as follows;</hi>—"West-minster Sessions, 27th February, 1854.—The Queen, on the Prosecu<lb/>tion of Edward Tyrrell Smith, against George Carter.—Brief for the Prosecution (see Indictment).—Case—The prosecutor in this case (Mr. Smith) is the lessee of Drury-lane Theatre. The prisoner was one of the bill distributors and supernumeraries at the theatre, in the prosecutor's employ, and his duty was to distribute and stick up the bills of the performance in various parts of the metropolis and suburbs. From in<lb/>formation which came to the knowledge of the prosecutor (see depositions), the prisoner was given into custody. It was ascertained he had been in the habit of selling the bills by <hi rend="italic">wholesale</hi>, for waste paper, stating that they were his perquisites. No one can tell the loss sustained by the lessee, not only of this but of other theatres, by such conduct, as there is no doubt the sys<lb/>tem has been carried on by others to a very large extent Whether or not Drury-lane was crammed to the ceiling every night, and whether or not many were unable to obtain admission, has nothing to do with the prisoner's conduct. Mr. Smith has no personal feeling against the prisoner, he has taken the matter up on public grounds. Counsel will be pleased to ask the learned Judge to take the case as soon as the bill has been found, on the ground that Mr. Smith has particular engagements at Drury-lane Theatre. Since writing the previous sheet, we are informed by Mr. Smith (through Mr. Wild) that he is not bound over to prosecute, the Magistrate con<lb/>ceiving the evidence sufficient without troubling Mr. Smith to appear. The case will therefore take its usual course, and there' will be no occasion to ask the Court to take it out of its turn. The bills in question were <hi rend="smallCaps">VERY LARGE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">posting</hi> bills, and coloured, and therefore very expensive. The prisoner disposed of them (it appears) to another party, who sold them for waste paper; yet Mr. Smith was charged weekly with the expenses of dis<lb/>tributing, posting, (fee.; so that altogether, what with the charges for the bills, and the charges for posting, he was a loser of several pounds per week. In one packet was found twenty-six lbs. weight of them, purchased by a Mr. Cook, a waste-paper merchant, in Lambeth-walk, to whom it was stated they were perquisites, being out of date. He (Mr. Cook), we think, was much to blame for not making inquiries, when the course he might have adopted was so simple. There is, we are informed, another indictment to be preferred against Carter, by a Freehold Land Society, for similar con<lb/>duct respecting their bills; but with that this case has nothing to do. Indeed, we may also observe, that <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> has suffered in the same way; but in his usual good-humoured manner, we understand, he has declined to interfere. We say again, the matter has been taken up on public grounds by Mr. Smith, as there is no doubt the managers of all the London theatres, as well as all public companies who have recourse to similar means of advertising, have been victimised in like manner. There are two witnesses in this case, Mr. Keeley and Mr. Dunning, who are engaged at Drury-lane</p>

Proofs Mr. Keeley.—To prove that witness is the inspector of bills at Drury-lane Theatre; that several bills (from information witness has received) were afterwards found, which ought to have been distributed; that witness knows the costs of the bills to the lessee of the theatre (Mr. Smith); and will prove what those found at Mr. Cook's (another witness) cost him. Call John Quinn.—To prove that witness received the bills of the prisoner for the pur<lb/>pose of sale, and afterwards sold them to the witness Tingay. Call Gillis Tingay.—To prove that witness bought the bills in question from the witness Quinn, and afterwards sold them to the witness Cook. Call Gus<lb/>tavus Dunning.—To prove that witness is employed at Drury-lane Theatre, and as such gave the bills in question to the prisoner for distribution and posting. Call Mr. Riley, for Cook.—To prove that witness bought the bills of the former witness, Tingay, who said they were, 'perquisites' allowed to the bill distributors at the theatre. Witness is a wholesale waste-paper dealer, carrying on business in Lambeth-walk. Call John Baker.—To prove that witness is a policeman of the F division, 118 F; took the prisoner into custody, and the prisoner said nothing to him, except that he 'knew nothing about the matter.'")—<hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> When Pull said that the costs had been applied for and allowed, I said I had heard no application for them—I had not left the Court at all—I referred to my note book, and found that there was no entry—Mr. Horry's name was endorsed on the brief as it is now, and Pull told me that Mr. Horry had applied—I said, as I had not heard it, he had better request Mr. Horry to renew the application—Pull then went to Mr. Horry and spoke to him, and Mr. Horry spoke across the Court to me, and said that he had made the application—that does not at all alter my opinion on the subject—I said, that having no entry in my book I must request him to renew the application—Mr. Horry then made the application, in the presence of Pull—he said he renewed an application that he had made in consequence of the officer of the Court not having heard it—Mr. Serjeant Adams referred to the depositions, and then allowed the costs, for which I subsequently signed the order.</p>

               <p>—that order would not have been granted except on the assumption that the attorney had been properly instructed to prosecute—if the Judge had been aware that no attorney had been instructed, he would not have allowed it—on the Wednesday following, 1st March, something occurred which in<lb/>duced the learned Judge to ask a question of Pull—it was on another matter, and Pull was asked by the Judge if he had been concerned in any case that sessions before that day—he said he had, but he could not remember what—upon being pressed, he said it was Carter's case—the Judge then asked him whose clerk he was (he having previously said he was an attorney's clerk)—he said he was the clerk of a Mr. C. T. Jones, of No. 125, Long-acre—(I never saw Mr. C. T. Jones myself)—he said he became Mr. Jones's clerk on the preceding Saturday, the 25th—the Judge asked him whose clerk he was before, and he would not tell—he asked him whose clerk he was when he obtained instructions in Carter's case—he would not say—it ended in the Judge saying that he should make inquiries into the matter, and see whether his statements were correct—those inquiries have been instituted, and have resulted in the present inquiry.</p>

C. Horry, costs allowed, six months imprisonment," to be Mr. Horry's handwriting—you must be better aware than I am whether it is usual for counsel to receive a brief after a plea of guilty—properly, an attorney should receive written in<lb/>structions before he acts upon them—briefs have been delivered to counsel, and costs allowed, in cases where prisoners plead guilty, on the immediate application of counsel—when a prisoner is arraigned, the counsel who appears for him usually mentions it in the ordinary course, so that the Court is aware at once whether counsel is retained or not; that is, if he is in Court—I am not aware that there was more than the usual confusion at the time of this arraignment—I have often heard counsel laughing and making a noise at such times, and at other times, also—counsel usually rise when they address</p>

               <p>the Court, and I should have seen Mr. Horry, had he risen—I was occupied in taking the pleas of the prisoners—I cannot swear that no application was made within an hour of the plea of guilty—there was none to my hearing, certainly—I can only depose to my own knowledge—the application that I did hear certainly took place more than an hour after the prisoner had been sentenced—I could not at all judge whether this brief bad been written the day before it was presented to me; I could not, of course, swear that it had not—I saw no counsel appear when Carter pleaded guilty—I was busy—the business goes on with celerity—I made out the order for the payment of the money; the treasurer pays none without an order—the direction of the Court is my authority for giving the order; I received Mr. Serjeant Adams' direction in this case—I heard Mr. Horry apply to the Judge for the costs; that was more than an hour after the plea—he stated that he renewed the application.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at No. 3, Brunswick-place, Shoreditch. I know the defendant—in consequence of an advertisement I saw in a newspaper, I saw him at the place where I now reside about the middle of June, 1852, and agreed to purchase his business—during the negotiation, he stated that he was a physician of the University of Edin<lb/>burgh—when I went there, this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in a frame on the mantelpiece in the front sitting-room, where the patients came—during the negotiation, he stated that he was a graduate of medicine of the University of Edinburgh, and that that was his diploma, pointing to it—he and I car<lb/>ried on business together for twelve months, at the end of which time he left, and two or three months after that I discovered that it was a forgery—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030099"/>
               <p>during the twelve months the diploma remained in the place where I first saw it—when I discovered that it was a forgery, I went to him, at No. 2, Amwell-terrace, Claremont-square, Clerkenwell, where he was carrying on business—on two or three occasions before that the diploma was the subject of remark, and he distinctly stated that he had been to Edinburgh—I pressed him more closely, and he told me he really was an M. D. of Edinburgh—I asked him if he had been to Edinburgh; he said he had, but that he was not there more than thirty-six hours—on another occasion, I pressed him more closely, as I could not understand how he had avoided the residence-clause, which was necessary, and he then told me he really had been to Edinburgh, that he had been examined in a room by three gentlemen, and was told to retire; was afterwards called in, and told that he had passed, and that he then and there paid the fees, amounting, I think, to about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he was told that the diploma should be sent to him by post—he said he had avoided the residence-clause by means of presenting a thesis—when I went to him, I told him his diploma was a forgery—he said, "for God's sake, don't mention it; I have been deceived, but I can at any time go to Edinburgh, and point out the house where I was examined"—I then communicated with the authorities of the University of Edinburgh, and for<lb/>warded them this diploma.</p>

Scotch diploma could he had by communicating with the party referred to; I have heard of diplomas being advertised for sale, but not specifying Scotch ones—I have not myself dealt in diplomas.</p>

D." for a certain sum of money—when I discovered that this was not a genuine diploma, I required that the defendant should withdraw 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the premium—it was a matter of two agreements; he agreed with me that he would accompany me in the business, and attend to the business with me for twelve months; he performed that agreement—this diploma was put up over the mantelpiece, so that it might be seen by all his patients; I cannot tell how many of the patients could understand or read Latin—I have walked Guy's Hospital; I have always understood that there is a necessity to reside in Edinburgh for a certain number of months, and there is a cer<lb/>tain course of study necessary at Edinburgh for twelve months after passing a London examination; if a student enters on the first occasion, he must reside there four years; but after passing examinations here, I believe twelve months suffices—you must be nominally apprenticed for five years in order to become an apothecary—I served three—you must walk the hos<lb/>pitals for three winters and two summers—I am not the prosecutor, and I believe the authorities at Edinburgh are not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gunner and driver, in the artillery stationed at Woolwich. The prisoner is a gunner in the same regiment—on 20th Feb. I received a letter from my father, with an order, but it was not correct, and the sergeant advised me, in the prisoner's presence, to send it back, which I did on 21st Feb.; and not receiving any reply, I wrote on 5th March, and received an answer—I afterwards went to the post office on the 6th, and found that the order had been cashed—on 24th Feb., the prisoner had charge of the barrack room; that is, he was cook during the day, and had to take care of all things belonging to the men, and deliver them when they came from drill—we were all out on drill on the 24th, and he was alone in the room—when we returned, I found him there, and asked him if he had received any letters for me, and he said "No"—it was his duty to receive the letters—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the order.</p>

I am a bombardier in the artillery; that is the first promotion from the ranks; it is between a private and a corporal—there, are no bombardiers except in the artillery—I received the letters in the month of February—the man who has charge of the barrack room during the absence of the men on drill, is not supposed to quit the room except on duty; and if he goes out, he is supposed to lock the door and carry the key with him—if he goes out to a shop, or to the cooking house; if any letters are left in the room, he has charge of them—he is in charge of every thing, and receives letters for the men when they are out on drill—I do not recollect the prisoner being in charge on the 24th—I recollect well delivering a letter to the artilleryman in charge of the room, it was the first letter which contained the post office order, which did not agree with the letter of advice—I think I delivered a letter to Westron about eight days after the first—I think those were the only two letters—Westron was in the hospital when I took the first letter; but finding that he was dis<lb/>charged, I took it to the barracks—about a week afterwards I delivered another letter, directed "James Westron"—I know it was in the same writing, for he has letters very often.</p>

On Thursday, 24th March, I was on duty in Greenwich-road, and saw the three prisoners together—Cummings went into a pawnbroker's shop in the Broadway, came out and nodded her head to the other two, who were standing on the other side; she then went into the shop of Mr. Tigh, a pawnbroker: not into the pawning box, but into the shop—she came out in a few minutes, and they all went down High-street, Deptford, to Mr. Harris's—Cummings went in, came out again; and they went to Mr. Patty's, in the Lower-road, Deptford—at each place the others waited outside for her—I noticed that she had her hands under her apron—I got assistance from the Dockyard, and took them all into custody—I searched William White, and in his jacket pocket found this shirt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Cummings had a basket with her.</p>

I lived, on 11th March, in King-street—on that day the prisoner Lynch came to my shop, between 12 and 1 o'clock, for 3 lbs. of potatoes; my wife served her in my presence—I saw her pay a sixpence; my wife gave her three pence change, and she left the shop—my wife turned the sixpence over, and handed it to me; I saw it was bad, and I called Lynch back, who was twenty or thirty yards off—I said to her, "Where do you live? this is a bad sixpence "—she said she lived nowhere—I asked her where she slept last night; she said some-where in the Borough, and she got the sixpence from her nephew—I was bending the sixpence in her presence, and she said, "Don't destroy it; I must take it back to my nephew, where I got it from "—I marked it, and bent it, and gave it her, and she left—I followed her, and saw her sit down at the corner of King-street, Old Kent-road, for about twenty or twenty-five minutes, and then the other two prisoners came up to her—she got up, and they had two or three words together, and went away together—I afterwards saw them in Surrey-square, which is 300 or 400 yards from where Lynch had been sitting—I gave information to a policeman—I then missed the prisoners for a short time—I saw them again in King-street, about 150 yards from Surrey-square—I saw Jones and Cowderoy leave Lynch, and go into Mr. M'Donald's, in King-street—Lynch was coining towards where I was standing—I saw Jones and Cowderoy come out of Mr. M'Donald's shop—I cannot say that they joined Lynch, but they went into Mrs. Herbert's, which is a few doors from Mrs. M'Donald's—I after<lb/>wards saw the prisoners taken; I went to the station with them—when Lynch was taken I observed a sixpence drop from the side of her; No. 209 picked it up, and showed it to me—it was the one I had been hammering and marked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the G division of police. On Thurs<lb/>day, 23rd March, I went with other officers to No. 32, York-street, London-road, about half past 2 o'clock in the afternoon—the front door of the house was open, and we proceeded up stairs to the back room on the first floor; the door was opened by sergeant Richards, and we immediately rushed in, I saw the three prisoners sitting at a table which was close to a clear coke fire—Richards seized Matthews, and I saw Nevill seize the female prisoner, who had this plaster of Paris mould in her hand; and Evans seized Thomas; Nevill handed me the mould, which was so hot I could scarcely hold it, and in it was a sixpence and a great, as they now appear—on the fire I found this pipkin, which was then whole, but has since met with an accident—it had in it white metal in a state of fusion—on the table I found this teacup, containing fifteen sixpences in some sand and water—there was also on the table these two pieces of paper, with plaster of Paris adhering to them—I believe they are used for malting moulds—I found on the table this file, with white metal in its teeth—there was a saucer containing some white sand and water, and on the table was a jar containing some acid—I saved a portion of it—in a cupboard, in the room, I found this galvanic battery plate, with a piece of wire which has been used with solution of silver—I found a small portion of plaster of Paris in the cupboard, and on the table I found three shillings and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece, which were finished, and a sixpence which was unfinished, with the fragments to it not filed off—I found in the cupboard an earthenware dish with plaster of Paris adhering to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of the late George William Giles; he was a law writer, and was aged thirty-two years—we lived before this oocur<lb/>rence, in Feb., at No. 1, Princes-street, Commercial-road, Lambeth—I have one child. On Saturday night, 25th Feb., he came home about 12 o'clock at night—in consequence of what he said he and I went out together, a little after 12 o'clock; we went to the end of the Cornwall-road together—I saw the prisoner, who was then a policeman, <hi rend="italic">L</hi> 103—my husband said to him, "103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will go and report you"—the prisoner took hold of him by the collar, and said, "You are come out again, are you? now I will take you"—I put my hand on the prisoner's shoulder, and said, "Don't take him! don't take him! he will not report you"—the prisoner said; "If you don't get away, I will take you both"—my husband struggled—I had bold of his right arm, and he had a roll of paper in his right hand—he had' no stick, only a roll of paper—I believe he struck the prisoner with the roll of paper, but it must have been very slightly, for I had hold of his right arm—the prisoner had bold of him all the time—when my husband struck him, or was supposed to strike him, the prisoner said, "That will do, old fellow; that will do, old fellow; come along, old fellow; come along, old fellow;" and he took his staff out of his pocket, and struck my husband across the head twice—he struck him behind the left ear, towards the back part of the head; the blows were very severe—when the prisoner struck my husband he dropped the paper, and took hold of me with both hands round the waist, and I and my husband both fell on the ground—it was the weight of my husband taking hold of me made me fall—I heard some one say, "You are exceeding your duty, policeman;" that was said at the same time that the blows were given, or directly afterwards—I did not see the person come up who said that—when I and my husband went down, I remember the prisoner kneeling on one knee by the side of us—I am sure no one but the prisoner struck my husband—the prisoner sprung his rattle, and another officer, <hi rend="italic">L</hi> 181, came up—the prisoner took my husband to the Tower-street station, and I went there too—my husband was locked up and in the morning I procured bail, and he was liberated—I brought him; home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, about half-past 10 or 11 o'clock—he complained very much of his head, and he went to bed directly after he got home—he did not get up till tea time—I called him to get up, and he again complained—I felt his head, and found a lump on his head behind the ear, on the left side; that was the position in which the blow was given, in which the staff came down—the blows were delivered very near together—from that time down to the time my husband died, he very often made complaints respecting the pain in his head—he complained at times, and at times he went to his work—he did not go to his work continuously, as at other times—he was irregular, and one week he stayed away entirely; that was the middle week—he complained of his sight failing; he said his sight was going away—he often complained of being giddy, and of a weight in his head—I requested him to go to a surgeon—on Sunday, 19th March, I went to the station, in Tower-street, about 10 o'clock in the morning—I found my husband there; he did not know me, he was quite unconscious—from there he was taken to the workhouse; they would not allow him to go to the hospital—he never spoke to me again—he expired the next day.</p>

I have to attend on the sick, and dispense medicine to them—I remember the deceased being brought into the workhouse by the police, about 11 o'clock on Sunday morning, 19th March—I immediately had him conveyed to bed—he was in a fit of apoplexy, as it appeared to me—I sent for Mr. Real, the surgeon, and he arrived in a few minutes afterwards—by his direction I shaved the deceased's head—Mr. Juke, Mr. Real's partner, was present—they examined the deceased's head, and I exa<lb/>mined it—I saw a swelling behind the left ear, and a discolouration about three or four inches—the swelling was a puffy swelling, about half a quarter of an inch high, and about two inches in breadth—I subsequently saw one of the surgeons make an incision, and cut out the extravasated blood from that swelling—there was a great deal of it, and it was coagulated—they made an operation, and took. away part of the scull in my presence—I assisted to hold the deceased man—the piece of the scull they took away was about the size of a shilling, and they removed the coagulated blood—the part of the scull which was pressed down was attempted to be raised up</p>

               <p>again to its position—the deceased exhibited signs of consciousness about 2 o'clock in the morning—I never left him at all—as I sat on the bedside he lifted up his eyes and looked at me—I said, "Where do you feel the most pain?" he could not speak—I said, "Is it your head?" he nodded his head—I took his hand, and said, "Can you place my hand where you feel most pain?" he lifted my hand, but he could not do it—he died at 5 minutes before 2 o'clock in the middle of the day, on Monday—I see a great many accidents—this was a fracture, one part was under the other—I saw the fracture after his head had been shaved—the fracture was where I saw one portion under the other—that was immediately under the puffed swelling—I am quite sure that after they took the scalp away, I saw the scull was fractured; it was a long fracture, running along about the midway to the ear—it was a fracture that would come from external violence—there was a little mark below the ear, as there will be after a blow has been given some time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and am assistant to Mr. Juke; he is the medical officer of the Lambeth workhouse—I saw the deceased man on Sunday, 19th March, between 11 and 12 o'clock; he was labouring under compression of the brain, arising from an effusion of blood and serum—I treated him for compression of the brain—I caused his head to be shaved, and afterwards examined his head—I found a long, puffy swelling on the left side above and behind the ear, about 3 inches in length, and 2 in width, and about 1/4 of an inch deep—an incision was made in the swelling, by Mr. Juke; a large quantity of coagulated blood was found in the swelling, which was removed—on further examination we found the edges of a fracture—he continued to grow worse—we thought it necessary to trepan him, which was done with a circular saw, and immediately under the bone of the scull coagulated blood was seen, very firmly coagulated, and as far as we could find out, a very large quantity—as much of this blood as possible was removed, but the man never rallied—he died on the Monday, a little before 2 o'clock—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination made in my presence—we found the brain was healthy—immediately below the fracture the dura mater had been separated from the scull; that would be separated by the effused blood, and that was very firmly coagulated—the scull was found to be very extensively fractured—a fracture, from 5 to 6 inches in length, extending along the side of the head above the ear, from front to back, on the left side—I observed more carefully the character of the external bruise—I believe the bruise had existed for some days—I do not think that coagulation of the blood could have taken place on the Saturday night—I should think it had been coagulating for several days; for a fort-night, or perhaps more—the fracture might have been occasioned by a blow or a fall—I should think a common fall in the street would not have caused it—supposing it was done with a short stick, like a policeman's truncheon, it would have required considerable force to cause it—there was a rupture of one of the vessels of the dura mater—the cause of the man's death was compression of the brain, brought on from external violence—supposing that force had been used two or three weeks, and a slow effusion was coming on, the effect would be dimness of vision and giddiness almost constantly—if a man were to hold his head down, the effects would be disagreeable; it would produce giddiness and pain—the effect of such a blow on the brain would cause excitement—it would appear like the excitement of intoxication.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Mitchell, a saw sharpener; we live at No. 38, Cornwall-road, Lambeth; we occupy the first floor. On 26th Feb., between 12 and 1 o'clock, I and my husband were taking supper—I heard a noise, and I put the blind on one side to see what it was, and then put up the window—the disturbance was just under the window—I was able to see distinctly what took place—I saw the persons, whoever they were, before any policeman came up—I did not know the deceased by sight—I did not know either party—the people were quarrelling—I thought it was two or three men and a female; they were quarrelling and making a disturbance—I threw up the window and saw the policeman come from the corner of the Commercial-road—the prisoner is the young man who came to me afterwards—I did not see him that night—it was a policeman came, and he desired them to be quiet—they went in a doorway, and the policeman was trying to make them be quiet—he told them not to make such a noise—I then saw a man hit the policeman with a stick or cane; I cannot say which—he hit him three times—after that they all got out of the doorway—the policeman's hat fell off, his foot slipped, and the whole three fell into the road together off the kerb—there were two men and the policeman—I saw a female, but I did not see whether she fell or not—the policeman fell underneath—I am quite sure about that—when he was on the ground, I saw him hit the man, but what with I do not know—I suppose it was his staff—I am sure he was on the ground at that time, and the man he struck was upon him when he struck—the policeman then got up, and the man blasphemed awfully after he had the knock—one man ran away—I do not know Mr. Scott—it was dark—the man who was struck called the man who ran away "a b——y coward and he still went on blaspheming awfully—my husband called out, "Lock him up, policeman, for disturbing the neigh<lb/>bourhood"—to the best of my belief, I have stated everything as it occurred.</p>

                  </hi>. I recollect the night of 25th Feb., when there was this disturbance—I and my wife were sitting together; we had just finished supper; I heard a disturbance—my wife went to the window and looked out, and then threw up the window—she was at the window previous to my being there—she said, "Here are some men going to fight"—I said, "Is there?" and I went to the window—she said, "There is a policeman coming round the corner"—I went to the window that my wife was at, and there were two men and a female, and the policeman had just come up under the window—I passed from that window to the other; I thought I should have more view—by the time I got to the other window they were all huddled in the doorway, the policeman, the female, and two or three men, and they were striking the policeman over the head with a stick, or cane, about the size of a man's fore finger—I had a good view of them—I could not see who it was struck the policeman, but he was struck twice or thrice—he ran, and got hold of one man by the collar, and pulled him from the doorway—they were all knocking against the door, ready to break it in—the policeman pulled him away from the door—the female clung either to the policeman or another man, and the policeman pulled him out with violence, and they all fell backwards on the ground together, and the policeman was undermost—they had scarcely been down a minute or two before I saw the policeman's arm go upwards—I then heard some one call out, "Murder! by a b—policeman, 103!"—he still continued these epithets for five minutes or upwards, and during that time the policeman sprang his rattle three distinct times, and the bystanders were uttering the most offensive epithets, and told him they wished his b——soul were burning in hell—I considered that the policeman acted with great patience, according to the way in which he was treated—from the time he got on his legs he did not strike any blow or utter any epithets, to my knowledge—from the manner in which he was lying down, with those persons on him, there was a difficulty in his getting up, because he was lying down on his back—I had sufficient light to see that he was undermost—I saw one man run away—I heard the other man call him for that a b—coward—I saw another man come to the police<lb/>man's assistance, and I heard him say, "I give this man into custody;" but what man it was I could not see—inquiry was made about me on the Monday month afterwards—I was at my work—I was called for, and was examined before the Coroner—I told the same story—I am quite disin<lb/>terested; I never knew the prisoner or the sergeant—I called out of the window, "Lock him up, policeman, for disturbing the neighbourhood"—my wife said, "He is taken to the station house," and she said to me, "You had better come to bed," or I would willingly have gone down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furniture dealer, at No. 33, New-cut, Lambeth. I have a warehouse in Windmill-street, New-cut—I had in that warehouse a new Waterloo bedstead, two new tent bedsteads, a second-hand four post bedstead, and others—I saw them there safe on Thursday, 9th Feb., about ten minutes after six o'clock—the warehouse gates were shut, and fastened with a new padlock—I locked it myself, and left it secure—a few minutes after 9 o'clock I found the padlock gone, and missed the four bedsteads—the gates were then shut, but not locked—I received information on Saturday morning, and went before Mr. Norton the Magistrate—I after<lb/>wards went with Romain and Smith, two officers, to the prisoner's premises—I saw him, and asked him whether he had got four bedsteads, or whether he had bought four—he said no, he had nothing of the kind—I told him I had been before Mr. Norton, and I had got a witness to prove that he had four bedsteads in his possession, and he had moved them on the Friday from where he used to keep his truck and his cart standing—he said, "You can do as you like, Mr. Crawley, but I have not got them, and have not seen them; I moved four bedsteads, but these were the four," pointing to four bedsteads in his shop—they were not mine, and I told him so, and said, "What is the use of your denying it so?"—he said, "You can do as you like, I tell you I have not got them," and with that I gave him into custody—I assisted in searching his premises, and found several parts of the four post bedstead behind a lot of wood in the kitchen under the front shop—the officers were then up stairs—I went down into the kitchen by myself—it was in the front kitchen, but the back as you go down the stairs—the staircase is at the back of the house—I brought the pieces of bedstead up stairs, and the prisoner then said, "Mr. Crawley, I will fetch you your four posts; they are round at the turner's, going to be altered"—I asked him what he had done with the rest of the bedstead—he stood a minute or two, and at last he said, "I have cut it up, and burnt it"—he said, "Mr. Crawley, though you don't know me, I know you, and I will fetch you your three new bedsteads, and whatever you like to charge me I will pay you for it; but drop this case, and I will make you a new frame for the one that I have burnt"—I told him whatever the officers or the Magistrate did I should be perfectly satisfied with, but to alter the case I would not—I will not say whether I said I would not alter the case, or whether I would not take it out of their hands—I remained at the prisoner's house while the prisoner and Smith the officer</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chair maker, and live in Robert-street, Waterloo-road. About nine o'clock in the evening of 9th Feb. I went to fasten the gates that shut my yard where I put my trucks, and saw four bedsteads there, standing up against the wall; they were two tents, one Waterloo, and a four post—the prisoner puts his cart and truck in that yard—I saw him there next morning, between 8 and 9—he came in and said, "Here is a job, I am obliged to take these three bedsteads back, because I cannot get the money for them, so I have brought them back; better have them than have no money"—he was alluding to the three new bedsteads which belong to the prosecutor: as regarded the four post, the prisoner said, "I hardly know what to do with this; what do you think?"—I said, "I don't think you will sell it in London; you will have a much better chance with a country dealer," and mentioned a man at Ewell—he said, "I think it would be a chance to sell it to him"—he then went away he returned in about ten minutes, bringing a letter in his hand, and said, "Here, I have just got an order, and I can work it up"—I said, "Work it up I"—he said, "Yes; with a little alteration, it will answer the order that I have got just come in"—I said, "Can you? well, you are lucky!"—he began to untie it, but could not, and asked me to lend him a chisel, which I did; he cut the cords top and bottom, and took a portion away; his boy took another por<lb/>tion, and returned twice for the other; it was a very heavy bedstead—he took them all away—I have seen the bedsteads produced here, and believe them to be the same; but I did not take so much notice of the others as I did of the four post, and there is only a portion of that here.</p>

Between 11 and 12 o'clock on Satur<lb/>day, 11th Feb., I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's house, in Gibson-street—I told him I had come from Mr. Norton, the Magistrate, respecting four bedsteads he had in his possession belonging to Mr. Crawley, and that there was a witness to prove that he had them; that Mr. Crawley's place had been broken into on Thursday night, and the bedsteads were brought over by him and his boy from the yard where his cart and horse stood, to his premises—he said he knew nothing at all about them—I asked him where those bedsteads were that he removed over from the yard; he said, "There they are," pointing to some that stood just inside the door—Crawley was present; I called his attention to them, and he said they were not the ones he had lost—I told the prisoner he must consider himself in my cus<lb/>tody, and I should commence to search the place—I left him in Smith's cus<lb/>tody, went down stairs to the kitchen, which is used as a workshop, and saw Crawley's attention called to a portion of a bedstead, which he iden<lb/>tified (two men were at work there)—it was brought up stairs into the prisoner's presence; and I said to him, "It is of no use your denying this any further, here is a portion of it found, and, to save anything unpleasant, you had better state where the other portion of it is"—he then said he had taken the posts to his turner's to have them altered, and that the other bed-steads were removed to his polisher's in the Waterloo-road—I remained in the prisoner's house, and Smith went with the prisoner and brought the two post bedsteads back; the prosecutor saw them, and said in the prisoner's presence that they were his.</p>

G. W. Fletcher.")—the card had on it, "G. W.

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Langdon. On the morning of 10th Jan. I was present when Gollop came into the shop—I heard him say he had got a gentleman from the country, who wanted to purchase a quantity of things, and he gave the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> a card—I believe he said he wanted to purchase a quantity of second hand goods—the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> said it would be better to have new, and gave him a card—that was all I heard at that time; he went away—they were in the counting-house; there might have been more pass—in the afternoon I was absent at the time the prisoners came into the shop—when I returned I saw Kelly there; I think it was somewhere about 3 o'clock—I did not see him bring a card—he brought a few articles that had been selected, and helped me to tie them up—I wanted to clean them, but he said it was not necessary—he represented himself as servant, or something, to Mr. Fletcher, and he would clean them when he got down to Southampton—the things were packed up in parcels; there was no one in the shop at the time the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped at the door—the door was left open, and Kelly conveyed them out of the shop into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—there was no one in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> that I saw—there were two or three with the <hi rend="italic">cab;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove up after Kelly had gone out of the shop—he took the things off the board, and took them into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Gollop and Fletcher were in the shop at the same time—they all three came in when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped; I did not notice whether they all assisted in putting things into the <hi rend="italic">cab;</hi> a saddle, bridle, horse cloth, and other things were put in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Carter-street, Walworth. On 3rd or 4th March I was living there alone—I had some money in the house; I had it in two different boxes—one was a common deal box, and the other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030137"/>
               <p>a japanned deed box inside—they both had Chubb locks to them—the money was in the deed box—the other was merely a case—it amounted at least to 1,631<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, chiefly fives; there might have been a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note among them, for aught I know—the sovereigns were not loose in the box; there was one paper parcel, which may be called loose; it was in paper, but the others were in bags—I should say there were seven canvas bags; they were of various sizes, they were common canvas bags, such as bankers use to keep sovereigns in—any one could handle them with facility—the door of the room was locked with a common lock, and a small padlock as well; that was the middle room, first floor—the outer door of the house required a large key, and a smaller one to unlock it from without—on going out it merely required pulling to; in order to get in you had to use both keys together, one would not undo it without the other acting at the same time—on Friday, 3rd March, I went out somewhere between 12 and 1 o'clock—I remember pulling the outer door very firmly after me—I returned home about 9 o'clock in the evening, and in putting my hand to the door I found that it had been considerably loosened by falling back, but it required the use of the keys notwithstanding to open it—I fastened everything up, and went to bed, and next morning, somewhere about 11 o'clock, I examined the deed box, and found everything perfectly correct and safe—on that Saturday morning I observed marks on the outer door, as if some instrument had been put to the side of the door, and chafed or dented it—to the best of my recollection I saw marks both on the hinge and lock side of the door—I did not notice the lock—I went out on the Saturday, I think, close upon 12 o'clock—I fastened the door very fast indeed, particularly so, and had locked the bedroom door—I am quite certain of that, and the box was all safe—I returned somewhere between 8 and 9 o'clock—I found all apparently safe in unlocking the door, but on getting up stairs I was surprised to see the front door of the first floor room vide open, and on turning to the left I saw that the middle door, where the money was kept, was also open—I found the two boxes, one beside the other, broken open, and the money all gone—I have never seen any part of it again—the boxes are here—the prisoner Eliza Bacon was in the habit of charing with me, her business was to be with me daily—I engaged her for the purpose of doing up one room merely—she did not always come, but she did occasionally—I cannot tell the last day she came, but in consequence of having received a very severe wound it was my fault perhaps that she did not come, if she did not find me—to the best of my recollection, I should say she came on the Wednesday before the robbery.</p>

               <p>are not trees on each side, it is merely a sort of passage that leads to the street door at the right hand side, and there is a pantry door in the front—there are neighbours' houses adjoining—the door of the room in which I kept my money was always locked, and I always kept the key in my pocket—the window of that room looked into the garden in front of the house—I have occasionally gone to the public house opposite—I have not been in the habit of going to public houses for the last five or six years; but within the last six weeks I think I might have been somewhere about a dozen times, I may say—I have been to two houses, and I have been to a third twice, to the best of my recollection—I did not sit and talk there with the rest of the people—I carried a good many sovereigns about with me the last part of the time—I was not in the habit of carrying a large amount of gold in my waistcoat pockets, but about that time I did so; but it was out of sight—the greater part of them were in a green purse—I will not be posi<lb/>tive how many I might have; some in a small bag as well—I had about ninety; I divided them into two, and carried them in my waistcoat pockets; I also had a purse and a few shillings in it in my pocket—when I went to these public houses I might be an hour there—I certainly took, something to drink during the time, chiefly sherry; not a bottle, sometimes a pint at the most, and very often much less, I think it was a quartern—I never con<lb/>sidered that I wanted a companion to guide me home; I was led home one night, but there was no occasion for it—I cannot say whether I have been led home more than once by some stranger; I will not swear I have not—I had not counted my money for some time, but I had seen the inside of the box and the bags correct.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Bennett-buildings, Kennington-lane. On Friday-afternoon, 3rd March, I was standing outside the Beehive public house, at the end of Carter-street, Walworth, talking to the potman, Edward M'Fell, who was cleaning the windows—it is about eighty yards from Mr. Harvey's house—about half past 4 o'clock, I saw Norns go in at Mr. Harvey's garden gate—there is a little garden in front of the house—I saw him go inside the garden gate; it is a very small garden—it is about three yards from the gate to the house—at the time he went in, I saw Hilton and Brunton standing at the corner of Carter-street; the same end where I was, on the other side—Norris remained inside the gate about a minute, and then came out and joined Hilton and Brunton—they had three or four minutes' conversation, and Norris then went back again to Mr. Harvey's house, and staid for about the same time—he went inside the garden gate, and remained about a minute—Brunton and Hilton were standing a few yards from where they were standing at first—Norris went back to them, and they all went down Manor-road together—I saw Norris go into a house there; he took a key out of his pocket and put it in. the door; he then put it back into his pocket, and took out another key, and entered with the second—it was an empty house—he remained in there four or five minutes; the other two remained standing at the top of Manor-road—Norris then came out and went up to them—he then went back, and was going into the empty house again when a lad spoke to them, and they all three ran away—I do not know the lad's name, but I have seen him since (<hi rend="italic">looking at a lad named Newberry, who was called into Court</hi>)—I think that is the lad, but he was in a different dress—this was on the Friday—on the Sunday following, I heard of the robbery; after hearing of it, I went into the Sir William of Walworth public house—I there saw Norris, Samuel Bacon, and another party who is not here—they were sitting down in front of the bar drinking together—I do not know what they were drinking—I heard Bacon say to Norris, "Is it to be wine again?"—I did not hear Norris make any reply—I have seen all the prisoners before, but not within two or three months of the robbery—I have seen Samuel Bacon and Norris in company together where I used to live, and Brunton—I think I have seen them repeatedly</p>

               <p>together—I saw Eliza Bacon on the Sunday—she came into the public house and whispered something to her brother, Samuel Bacon, and called him outside; that was while Norris and the others were there—I enrolled myself in the Militia, and was taken for desertion, and imprisoned—while I was in prison I saw Norris, while he was in custody under this charge—I was coming out of the school, when he came from two or three and spoke to me—he said, "If you will say Quinnear put you up to say what you have said, I will buy you off, and give you a <hi rend="italic">fin</hi> to spend"—I do not knew what a <hi rend="italic">fin</hi> is—I did not make any reply—he said if I thought he knew anything about it, why did not I come to him instead of going to sergeant Quinnear, that would be much better than having three months for the Militia—I think this conversation occurred last Thursday week.</p>

                  </hi>. On 25th Feb., about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the female prisoner and another woman came to my shop—Rogers asked if Mr. Rowbotham was in—I said, "Yes"—she said, "Can I see him?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "Is your name Rowbotham?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "Mr. Nash has sent me here to see if you will buy some tea"—they said they had been dealing with Mr. Nash for two years, and he had sent them, and had written my name on a piece of paper, which she showed me, and I recognised Mr. Nash's writing—she then showed me some samples of green and black tea, and said that their husbands worked in the docks, and this was their perquisite—Rogers was the one who had the samples—they both spoke—the other woman said that they lived in Friar-street—they said the tea was sweepings—I said I had never bought such things before, and I did not know why Mr. Nash had sent them to me—they said there were two half chests of it—they did not give it any of the trade names—I asked them if it was in chests or parcels; they said it was in parcels—after some conversation, I said they might bring it down about 6 o'clock, and I would look at it—about 6 o'clock the three prisoners and the other woman came—Rogers brought one half chest in—Holding had the truck, and I believe he brought in the other—they were nailed down, and covered over with sugar bagging—I asked them what they wanted for it—Margaret Rogers said 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I thought that there was a large quantity for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I should like to see it—the two men were not in the shop at that time, they were outside—I asked if it was tea—Margaret Rogers said, "What else do you think it is?" and she moved about an inch and a half off one of the chests, and a small quantity of tea could be seen—I said, "I have not sufficient money to pay for it, and I should not like to pay it all down; I should like to have it examined first"—the other woman said, "We will see what we can do; we will go outside, and see the men; I could trust you 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself but the men want the money to-night; they have got some particular use for it"—the two females said they had known Mr. Nash a length of time, and had dealt with him originally—I said, "You had better go up to him, and ask him if he can give you the balance," and that I should not like to pay them any money until I saw the contents of the chest—they went out again for a few minutes, and came back again with John Rogers—Margaret Rogers then said, in his presence, that if I would give them the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they would wait till Monday morning for the rest—I gave Margaret Rogers 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which she handed over to John Rogers in my presence—I paid that as a deposit on the two half chests,' on the faith of the representation that they contained tea sweepings—they were to come again on the Monday morning—they went out, came back again, and said it was not sufficient, and they would not leave them unless they had the whole amount of the money—they said, it was Holding that was dissatisfied, and that he was drunk—they did not mention his name, but John Rogers said their mate was dissatisfied—Holding made a blustering noise, and said, "I am not satisfied"—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030146"/>
               <p>said, "Well, bring the truck, and take them away"—he brought the truck to the door—I said, "Give me the money, and you can take them with pleasure; I am only sorry that you have got hold of my money; why Mr. Nash should have sent them to me I am at a loss to conjecture"—I said to Holding, "I have half a crown, and if you like to take that, and go about your business, I will give it to you"—that was in addition to the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they said they would take the half crown, and come back again on Monday morning—they then went away—I paid the half crown on the same account (they said they did not bring the tea in a bag, because it would, be more convenient to bring it in chests)—about half an hour after they left I opened the chests—one contained about three quarters of a pound of tea leaves, which had been used and dried, and was filled up with brickbats and sawdust; the second half chest contained about the same quantity of Canton green tea, which had been used; it had a mixture of pebbles with it, and was filled up with brickbats and sawdust—the chests were worth 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the sawdust 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the chests appeared quite new, as if they had just come out of the docks; a channel was made with lead, the tea was put there, and then a piece of board was hammered over very tightly, so that if you put your finger in you found tea; but it was only about half an inch deep; that was the case with both chests.</p>

On Wednesday, 1st March, from information I received, I stopped the two male prisoners in Harnett-street, Lower Marsh, Lambeth—Holding was wheeling a barrow—I asked him what he had got there—he said, "It is a right"—Rogers directly came up, and said it was all right that the barrow belonged to him—I was in uniform—I said, "I must know what there is there"—I took a skewer out, unfastened the sacking, and found a chest of tea on the barrow—I asked Rogers what he had got there—he said "Ornaments"—he then broke open the top of the chest, and I saw that it contained tea—I took them to the station—Holding said he knew nothing about it, he was merely employed by Rogers—I told them I took them for having the tea without being able to give a satisfactory account of it—I opened the chest at the station; it contained a little tea in front, where it was broken open, on a small ledge, about two inches deep; the rest was bricks and sawdust—the prisoners were present, and I think Rogers broke it open himself; he assisted; he was very anxious to break it up, and show what it was—he assisted in breaking up that part which contained brickbats and sawdust; he put his hand to it, and helped to lift the other part up, and show what it contained—he did say, "Do not break, them up," and that he got his living by them, and if people bought them it was only the biter got <hi rend="italic">bit</hi>—on the following morning I found the female prisoner in custody, for being drunk and creating a disturbance, at the station.</p>
