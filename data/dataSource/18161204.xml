On the 22nd of August I went to levy a distress on the premises of the prisoner. Mr. Fotherby, and his man, went with me, between ten and eleven in the morning; when we got there the prisoner was not at home, his son went and brought him, and we told him that we had got a warrant of distress for £2 5s. for that house. Mr. Fotherby tried to persuade him to settle it; he swore he would not, and seizing a sword which hung-up in the shop, declared he would kill the first man that came in or seized any thing. Mr. Fotherby told the prisoner if he would say "he would pay him again," he would pay the rate for him, and not make any charge for the expences, and he was sure that I did not want any recompence for my trouble, but he would not let Mr. Fotherby pay the rate for him. We staid a long time, and at last was obliged to take an inventory of the goods. I gave him a copy of the inventory. While we were taking the inventory he sent out for some gin, he put the sword down and went into his parlour, as I suppose, to take the gin; when he came out he was very abusive to me. Mr. Fotherby said, we must take the goods away, for it will not be safe to leave them. Mr. Fotherby told me to stop with his man while he went to get an officer and a cart, I remained until he came back-the officer came in with him. The prisoner was there at the time with the sword in his hand. The officer asked me what I did there, I produced my warrant, and the officer endeavoured to persuade him to settle it, and read the warrant to the prisoner; the prisoner swore he would not, for he had appealed and could get no redress, and would defend his property to the last drop of his blood. After waiting sometime, I desired Mr. Fotherby's man to take the goods away, he endeavoured to move them and the prisoner pushed him away. I told the prisoner that it was of no use, for if he would not let the man take them that I must. I went to move some chairs when the prisoner made a thrust at me with this sword(producing it), it was directed to my body.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of your body - A. To my belly, I parried it off with my left hand, and it cut me in the thigh. He stabbed me in the thigh.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it penetrate your thigh - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. To any depth - A. No; it just rose the skin. It went through my pantaloons and drawers, penetrated the skin and drew blood; in the scuffle he twisted my finger back, I thought it was broke. The officer took him in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he before that day a sufficient opportunity of knowing that you was a collector - A. He had. I had been several times before for the money; he knows me well; I have seen him several times, and knew him as a neighbour; he is very passionate. This was in the year 1815.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it not on the 25th that you brought the warrant - A. It was the 24th to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOTHERBY. I am a broker, and live in Gray's Inn lane. On the 25th of August, 1815, I went, in company with the last witness, to make a distress in the prisoner's house; I proceeded in the regular way with the distress. The goods were not more than sufficient to pay the amount, with the expences. They were the shop goods that were seized, we did not take any thing that was used by his family. I knew the prisoner before. I offered to pay the money for him if he would say he would pay me again, and charge nothing for my expences, and Teasdale said he would take nothing for his trouble. I told him I must impound the goods, and left him a notice of the place to which I was going to take them. My man laid hold of a chair, and the prisoner thrust him aside. - My man was afraid and would not touch the goods again. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040004"/>told Teasdale to take them, and the prisoner made a thrust at Teasdale, and he was wounded. I have known the prisoner seven years; he is rather passionate.</p>

            . I was the constable that year. The account given respecting the wounding by Mr. Fotherby is correct, I was present. The prisoner had a sword in his hand; when I went in I saw the scuffle. I saw the sword in Mr. Teasdale's thigh, and the prisoner had hold of it.</p>
               <p>JOHN CRANCH. I live nearly opposite to the prisoner. As I was passing I saw the prisoner with a sword, scuffling with Mr. Teasdale; I rushed forward and seized the sword from the prisoner, and locked it up in my house. I have known the prisoner sometime; I believe he has not been altogether right in his mind since the execution of Holloway and Haggerty, his son was killed in the crowd, and he himself was taken up for dead; since that time I have known him doseveral things which a man would not do if he was in his right mind. I have seen him beat out the brains of a dog as it casually passed along the street. I have also seen him beat his son, who is blind, most cruelly with an iron rod. I also understood that he had a straight waistcoat prepared for him, and that he was deranged. At the time that this offence was committed I saw no difference in him from his usual appearance. I never knew him to be confined as a madman.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At the time this offence was committed what do you suppose to be his state of mind - A. I think if had been in his right mind he would not have committed such an act.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The present prosecution against me is by Mr. Teasdale. For many years past I have had several persons conspire to cause my ruin, and they have brought several actions against me. Mr. Teasdale said, that if these did not do, he would spend a hundred pounds a year to be my ruin. I had not, before the transaction, seen Mr. Teasdale for a month. When I came in and saw him, I asked him his business, he told me; and I replied, that I had appealed once, and had been rated by spite, and not by the commissioners. The magistrate said, it was not with his consent that I was over rated. I had tendered the money and it was refused. Fotherby asked me the price of the sword, which was the cause of my taking it down; I stuck it in the boards and there I left it. I requested them to leave a man in possession, but they refused. Teasdale was taking the goods away, I said, I would not suffer them to be taken. Mr. Fotherby refused either to take the goods away or to let his man do it. He sent for a constable, but I neither molested one or the other; about an hour after the constable came Teasdale requested him to keep the peace. Teasdale took hold of the chair on which I was leaning with one hand, the other hand being on the sword, which was stuck in the ground; he struck me once or twice, and I caught hold of his finger in my hand: he called to the constable to interfere; the constable requested me to let go the sword, and I let go of the sword and his finger. Teasdale called out he has stabbed me, and requested the constable to take me to Hatton Garden. I went before the magistrate and he bound me over.</p>

            . I lodged with the prisoner, and was present when the scuffle ensued; the prisoner offered to pay what he had been rated at before, in consequence of which Teasdale told Fotherby to seize. The prisoner requested that a man might be left in possession, which was refused. The prisoner was leaning with one hand on the sword and the other on the chair; Teasdale said, let go the chair-the prisoner refused; upon which Teasdale struck him on the ear, and then on his shoulder, in consequence of which the prisoner fell.

               <p>Q. Then at the time the man was wounded it was quite impossible for the prisoner to do it - A. I saw no wound; he might or he might not be wounded; I am sure the prisoner was in the kitchen.</p>

            . About a year and a half ago I lodged with the prisoner, and was present when Teasdale came into the shop; the prisoner was out, and I sent for him. When he came in he produced the money, saying, he would pay a just and true debt. He said he would immediately pay the rate of 9s. 4 1/2d. in the pound. Teasdale said he was authorized to seize; the prisoner wanted him to leave a man in possession, but he said he would seize immediately. The prisoner took down the sword, saying he would defend his property; Teasdale struck him twice, and was going to strike him again, when the prisoner caught hold of his little finger, and he cried out, I am murdered. The sword was sticking in the ground at the time. The prisoner was very much abused.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he put down any note, or say he would pay-it A. He did not; on the contrary, he said he would not pay it, but defend his property to the last. He flourished the sword over my head several times. I am perfectly sure that his hand held the sword at the time I was wounded.</p>

               <p>EDMUND JORDAN. I live at Harmondsworth. On the 20th of last month, in consequence of information I had received, I went down stairs about four o'clock in the morning, and observed my pantry window (which was a lattice, and not made to open), broken open; it was safe at eleven o'clock the preceding night; a small man could get through the hole which was broken-the pantry is part of my house. I searched and found I had lost the articles enumerated in the indictment; they were taken from different rooms in my house, I am sure all the articles were safe the night before. I also lost two loaves out of my bakehouse, which was locked the night before, and is part of the house.</p>

On Saturday, the 16th of November, I gave orders for my shop to be shut-up, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I got the prisoner at the bar to assist in shutting it up, I waited till it was secured, and was the last person on the premises, and locked the door, there was an iron bar over the shutters, which was secured inside, the shop is part of the dwelling-house, I then left; I am sure the part which was broke open was safe when I left.

When I locked the door I told the prisoner that nobody slept on the premises, and desired him to keep an eye over them, which he promised to do, I then left him. On the Sunday morning I was informed that my premises had been broke open, I went to the premises and found two shutters broken down, but they had been put up again in a temporary way; I found I had lost two bonnets, I saw them afterwards at the constables.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I slept in Blackfriars-road that night. I have another house there; I have only had those premises a fortnight, I have slept there several times, and my son has too.</p>

             GEARING. I am constable of the night; about half past one o'clock on Sunday morning, the 17th of November, the prisoner brought two men into the watch-house, charging them with taking down two shutters, with intent to rob, but he could not tell the number of the house; the two men, named Riley and Saunders, were locked up. Shortly afterwards I went to look at the premises, before I could get up to the prisoner, whose box is just by the premise, he put his hand into the box and presented two bonnets, saving, he had found them in his box. I found a square of glass broken in the window. I told the prisoner to look about, and perhaps he would find something more. I afterwards came back again, and he produced another bonnet. I asked him where he found it, he said down behind his box, I borrowed his lanthorn of him, and going behind his box, I said, is it down here that you found it. He hesitated, and then said, up there; I said where, he replied, tied to a bar. I asked him whether that was the place, because it was very wet, and expected if he found it there it would have been wet. I asked him if he sprung his rattle for assistance, he said no. I asked him where he left his lanthorn when he first discovered this, he replied, that he had left it with the watchman at the bottom of the court. This was about half past two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was on duty, the first alarm was the prisoner bringing in the two men, accompanied by the patrole. Riley was brought in first, by M'Carthy, and two minutes after the prisoner brought in Saunders.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might the prisoner be in the watch-house making the charge - A. Not more than five minutes; during which time there was nobody taking care of his box; it is not usual to have any body in the box while he is away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a person might easily come in and place any thing rhere - A. Yes; I don't know where the prisoner lives, nor how long he has been a watchman; the bonnets were all that was missed.</p>

            . The bonnets were two or three inches from the glass, so that they might have been taken through the window.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL ROBERTS. I am the watch-house keeper; I was called up about a quarter before three in the morning by Furzeman; I went down to Mr. Hanks's premises and examined the glass, I found the pin of the shutter had been taken out. The prisoner was in his box, which is close to the window, he has a good distance to go when he calls the hour; he has to turn down several courts. There were no marks of violence on the shutters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The prisoner has been a watchman two or three years; he lives near Red Lion-square.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had stolen the bonnets might he not have conveyed them home if he chose - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>JAMES MULLINS. I was going down Holborn about a quarter past one o'clock on Sunday morning, I saw the shutters down, I asked the prisoner about it, and he produced two bonnets; the constable of the night asked him about his lanthorn, and he said he had given it to the watchman; the prisoner was standing outside his box at the time, he had been in his box before. The bonnets were brought out after I had left him. We looked behind the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after or before the second hat was produced that you looked behind his box - A. We had looked before, there was no bonnet there then, and when he was told it was a watering-place, he said it was tied to the iron bar.</p>

I want to speak to you, I went back to him, and he said you are one of the bakers, I said, what of that? he said he should take me into custody; I went with him, and he gave me to another man; I was kept in the watch-house; the prisoner came in with another man in about seven or eight minutes.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my beat is near Lincoln's-Inn-fields; as the prisoner was calling half past one, he called to me, saying, Cowell I want to speak to you. I said, what, have you got a prize? he answered, come along, and I will show you. He took me up the court and showed me the shutters. I asked him how it was done; he said, I do not know; I said, it looks very bad; he replied, I have got a man to take to the watchhouse, and I will leave you in charge the while. He left me and walked quite slow towards the watch-house; he had no man with him. I thought it very strange; I looked behind his box, and every thing appeared right. I did not look in his box; there was nothing behind it but an iron bar, which belonged to the box; there was nothing in it. He came back at about ten minutes past two o'clock; he said, he had taken up two; I said, you told me you had only got one; he replied, that he had caught another, and one of them was a baker. I then left him. About a quarter of an hour afterwards he called to me again, and said, he had got two hats; I asked him if they belonged to the two men; he said, they are ladies hats. He shewed them to me in his box; they were put very carefully in one another. I left him again, and he called me a third time, saying, he had got three hats; I told him he had but two before; he said he had found the other in the box; I told him it was not there when I left him; he made no reply, and I left him again. About six o'clock he asked me to go to the watch-house with him; I refused, saying, it looked very black. He said he had left a lanthorn in my care; I told him, that he was a false man to say so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He walked away quite easy; he was gone about forty minutes; I had my own lanthorn, not his.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was gone did you observe whether the glass was broken - A. I cannot say; one of the shutters was down, and the other was leaning against the glass; he shewed me the hats in his box of his own accord; he did not shew me the third hat, he only told me of it after the constable of the night had been; when I told him it looked black, he could not answer me a word.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Where was your box - A. Down Lincoln's-Inn-fields; there was no box at the bottom of the court; I did not look at the windows; there was nobody passed by, all was quiet.</p>

I went and examined the premises, and found the back-door had been broken open, as well as the front-room door; he said he suspected the prisoner. I went in pursuit of him, but could not find him. On the 15th of November, Benjamin came to me to say, he had taken one of the prisoners. I went to the house and found him in the custody of Forester, the officer; as we were going to examine his lodgings we met Noah, and took him with us; he wanted to persuade a young woman in the house that he had not been at home; but she persisted that he had just gone out. We went into his room and found a crow-bar and a pair of gloves in the fire-place, covered over with ashes. I took him into custody. He said he knew nothing about it. The next morning I went to him with his father, who persuaded him to tell where the things were. He took me to several places, and at last to Mr. Davis; he said he had sold some things there; Mr. Davis gave them up to me; he then took me to Mr. Levy's, in Hollywell-street, where he had sold goods to the amount of of 1l. 16s.

            ; on the 25th of October I was at my father's house, at Islington, I saw the prisoner at the bar there; he sold me some apples, for which I paid him a three-shilling piece; another person, who was with him, gave me 2s. in change. About ten minutes after I saw the prisoner getting out of the parlour window; I did not see him get in; I suppose he must have got in at the window; I saw the window about an hour before, it was shut, but not fastened; I had been in the kitchen all the time, and I believe my mother and the servant had been there all the time too. I think nobody in the house could go into the parlour without my knowing it. I saw the prisoner getting out of the parlour window, his hands were on the window, and his feet had not touched the ground. He asked me to buy some apples; I told him, no. What do you do there? He made no answer, but went towards the garden gate. I followed him, and caught him. The servant asked me where my geranium was; I asked the prisoner, and he said, there it is, hastening to the garden gate. It had been thrown down from the ledge of the parlour window. He got from me, and went out at the garden gate. I saw no more of him. As I turned round I saw a silver milk-ewer on the window-ledge. I ran into the parlour, and missed one pair of spoons off the sideboard; another pair had been removed to the table between the two windows, and a pair left on the sideboard; there ought to have been three pair of table spoons on the sideboard; a silver milk-pot and sugar-tongs; nothing was taken away but a pair of spoons, all the rest were only removed from the sideboard to the table under the window. I had seen them in their proper place about an hour before. I did not see the prisoner with any property in his hands.</p>

            . On the 25th of October, I was going to Town with a load of goods in my waggon; I had my servant with me, and my saddle-horse, which I occasionally rode; being unwell I went into the waggon, and remained there until about three o'clock in the morning, when my man told me he missed the horse. I got out and sent him back to see for the man who had taken it. I saw the horse six days after I had lost it. I saw it pass the Coach and Horses Inn, Holloway. I saw the bridle and saddle the day before. It was in possession of a milkman, who lives in the City-road; I have sold the horse to him since. When I saw the horse, I stopped it. I am sure it was my horse. It had a complaint, which made it constantly shake its head, by which I knew it to be mine.</p>

            . I am servant to the last witness, and was with him that night. He told me to drive the waggon, and to ride the pony. I did not ride it. The prisoner was coming towards London, and so when I knew him, I told him he might ride the horse behind the waggon. I had no authority to lend it to him. He mounted the horse, and took my lanthorn. I told him to call me if any thing fell out of the waggon. He followed me till we came through Kennington; the things appeared safe, and I took the lanthorn from him before we came to Kennington; he asked me for his stick, which had been put in the hinder part of the waggon; I gave it to him; we had then passed through Kennington; when we had got about a mile further I looked back, and missed the prisoner and the horse; it had a saddle and bridle on it. I did not see the prisoner again until the 23d of November; I saw him then at Chichester. I have not seen the horse, nor the saddle or bridle, since. I believe he must have passed me when he went away. When I took the lanthorn from him I told him not to leave the waggon.</p>

            . I live at Holloway. I know the prisoner. I saw him on the 25th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; he had a brown mare with him; she was saddled and bridled; he stopped at my house and offered the mare for sale to several people. I purchased it of him; I gave him 2l. for it. It was not cheap at that; it was not worth more. I did not buy the saddle; the bridle was given in with the horse; my hostler bought the saddle. I do not remember seeing Mr. Farndell till after the horse was stolen. Mr. Farndell showed me the horse, and I said it was the one which I purchased; she appeared very heavy about the head; I can swear that the mare he showed me is the one that I purchased of the prisoner.

On the 12th of November, I went to bed about eleven o'clock; I was the last person that was up, the doors were locked, and the windows were fastened. I left the key of the outer door on the ledge of the window, under the shutters, in order that my son (who was out), might let himself in; I had left it there before, but not often. The prisoner knew that I sometimes left it there for my son, for he has sometimes come home and slept with him. My husband got up at a little before seven o'clock the next morning; I got up soon after him; when I got up I missed the articles which are mentioned in the indictment.

               <p>THOMAS PARKER. I am the son of the last witness. On the night of the 11th of November, I was in company with the prisoner, at a public house in the Minories, till about twelve o'clock; I then left him and went towards home; on my way home, I went to a ball at the Auction Mart. I remained there till about four o'clock. When I got home I found the key in the door. I used to find it in the window. The prisoner has slept with me twice, when I have found the key in the window. I went in and went to bed directly; I took the key in with me, I locked the door; I got up after my father and mother in the morning. Several things were gone; none of the windows were unfastened, so that the person must have entered at the door, and with a key. When I went in, I took the key inside, and found it inside the next morning.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SUMMERS. I am headborough of St. George's; I found the pelisse, work-bag, and tea-caddy upon the prisoner, about three o'clock in the morning, he was in Ratcliff-highway, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house, I was waiting there for him, as I had information that a man had engaged a bed at the Bunch of Grapes public-house; I went there, and asked him what he had done with the bundle, as I understood he had one. He brought down the pelisse, tea-caddy, sheet, gown, two waiters, and a work-bag, they have been in my possession ever since - He said they were his property. I was taking him to the watch-house, when we had got a little way in he wished me good morning, and set off with the bundle, I pursued him, took him, and locked him up.</p>
               <p>LAMMAS CAREY. I am a patrole in the Commercial-road; on the morning of the 12th, the prisoner passed me with a bundle, I called to him to know what he had got - He ran off; I called out stop thief; it was about twenty minutes before three o'clock; he had a box tied up in a white cloth, he flung it down, and said you may take it, I do not know what is in it; he got away, I did not see him again until he was taken. It was moon-light. I only saw one side of his face, he had a blue coat on; I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Court. How then can you swear to his being the same man - A. I charged him with it the next morning, and he never said a word, either one way or the other; I opened the box, and found a parrot in it, alive, and a bason of soup, which appeard to be victuals for the bird. He was coming from Batty-place way.</p>
               <p>MRS. PARKER. The things were safe the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been with Thomas Parker; I was looking about for a night's lodging, and as I was going in I found the things by the step of the door.</p>

My master sent me out on the 9th of November; I called at Somerset-street, where my master lived until the day before; he had left the house without any person in it; the things had not all been removed. As soon as I had put the key in the door I heard something drop inside, I went in and shut the door, but I did not fasten it, I felt about to see if I could find any thing, and I found a skeleton key, I then came out and procured a light; at that time Mr. Bamfield's coachman came up to the door, and accompanied me in; we went into the back-parlour, and found the shutters open. We thought we smelt tobacco, and went down stairs, when we had got about half-way down we heard a noise, sounding like bottles rattling; we turned back, meaning to lock them in, some person pursued us up-stairs immediately, before we could get to the door. Mr. Bamfield's butler was outside the door, and said we were thieves, and shut us in; I got out, and told the coachman to come out also, and not to let any body else out as he came, but the prisoner got his head out, which we pushed in again. I am sure it was the prisoner, I saw his face distinctly, I had a candle in my hand at the time. The coachman had hold of the door, the prisoner made the coachman let go his his hold, and he got out; we laid hold of him, he knocked the coachman down, and I tumbled over him and let go of the prisoner; He crossed the street, we ran after him, crying stop thief, and he was taken at the corner of Bride-street, in Henrietta-street; I returned to the house, and found a dark-lanthorn laying on the kitchen-stairs, four baskets about three bottles of wine, and a bottle of furniture oil. The cupboard under the kitchen stairs was broken open; the wine-cellar was also broken open; on one of the binns there was a lighted candle, and several of the corks were out of the bottles, and seven bottles of wine had been taken from the back-cellar. I found two pair of my boots had been removed from the pantry into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Mr. Kingston now lives in Gloucester-place; he formerly lived at this house, and had not removed all his furniture; his family had all left.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner ran away, did you keep sight of him-A. No; I lost sight of him for about a minute. I had a candle in my hand when I saw his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear to him-A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the wine that was taken - A. The day before, as late as four o'clock.</p>

I am Mr. Bamfield's coachman; I went with the last witness to Mr. Kingston's house: I saw the wine in the state he has described it; we were going to get assistance, and I heard some person run up-stairs-Smith ran out and closed the door, and I was left in the house with the prisoner - He tried to get away; I was let out, I shoved the prisoner back and held the door; the prisoner put his foot between the door and the frame, I could not shut it - He struck me with an iron crow-bar, I was obliged to let him out, I followed him; I had no candle, but I could see his face by the light of the lamp. He struck me with the iron crow and I fell down; I am sure the prisoner is the man, I saw him plain enough to swear to him. I ran after him, and cried stop thief, the watchman stopped him; I saw him all the time. He was taken to the watch-house and searched, there was a to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040016"/>bacco-box, one long piece of whalebone, and two small pieces, found on him, and a knife; the two small pieces of bone were cut.</p>

            . I am a watchman at St. Giles's; on the night of the 31st of October, when I had called the hour of twelve, I saw the two prisoners standing on the pavement with Mr. Skillern, I knew the prisoner M'Cawley before; I asked what business they had with the man. He said, we are going to see him home. I asked them where he lived, but they did not know. I took up my lanthorn, and saw that his pockets were turned inside-out, and he was bleeding at the mouth; I took M'Cawley to the watch-house, and my brother-watchman took the other. We searched them, and found a 3s. piece on Flannagan, but nothing on M'Cawley. The prosecutor being ill, could not appear against them until a week afterwards; M'Cawley, when at the office, had the hat on his head which I have produced. We took Mr. Skillern to the watch-house also.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was he - A. He was very bad, his lip was swelled, he seemed sensible, but did not say what had happened to him. When he got to the watch-house, he said, that he had not got his own hat on. He was stupid, but I think it proceeded from the blows he had received - He bled very much. Neither of the prisoners attempted to run away, we secured them directly - They had no opportunity of escaping.</p>

            . I live at No. 18, Wild-street; on the night of the 31st of October, I was returning from Drury-lane Theatre, as I was coming through Broadcourt, Long-acre, I saw Mr. Skillern lying on the iron bars of an area, the two prisoners, and a tall thin young man, were standing by him; two men came by, and asked what was the matter with him; they said, they supposed he was drunk. The two men said they would contrive to get him home; they stooped to raise him, but he seemed quite lifeless. M'Cawley struck one of them, and he asked who it was, M'Cawley laughed, and said, it was only fun; the men then left, and one of them said, he was afraid they were after no good with him; I followed the men a little way. When I returned, the two prisoners had got Mr. Skillern up against a door-way; they searched all his pockets, I saw them do it, but what they took I cannot say; they held out their hands once or twice to the tall man, I saw them give him a handkerchief; I do not know what else they gave him. The watchman came up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040017"/>immediately, and the tall man ran away; the watchman asked them what they were doing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Court. How long have you lived in Wild-street - A. I lodge there, I am a servant out of place, I had lived there five days then. I have been out of place ever since the 20th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. How many different places have you lived at within the last two years - A. I had lived with my aunt antil I went to Mr. Selby's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left him, why did you not go back to your aunt - A. I left my aunt in July, in consequence of a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this-A. About twelve o'clock; the Play was over about twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go straight home - A. I stood talking with some young women who had been to the Play with me; I had not been to the Play for four years before. I went before the magistrate about this, and was told they were all gone. I heard no more of the business until the watchman came to me.</p>
               <p>Flannagan's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury - I had been at Drury-lane Playhouse on that evening, and coming up Drury-lane, I met the gentleman, there were a crowd of people round him. The watchman came up, and he was told to take him to the watch-house; he refused. They then told us to take him along Drury-lane; immediately two watchman came up and took us; they asked him what he had lost; he first said £40. then 40s. and then 8s.</p>
               <p>M'Cawley's Defence. I gave 8s. for that hat, at the corner of Drury-lane. The hat-maker says, he knows he sold it to me; but as there is no stamp in it, he cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Jury to Skillern. Did you see the last witness - A. I remember seeing a woman standing by, but I do not know whether it was her or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the Play with her-A. No; I never saw her.</p>
               <p>Court to M. A. EDWIN. How came you to go to lodge in Wild-street - A. Because I knew the people who lived there. I gave my master warning myself.</p>

I locked the safe about four o'clock-the box was there then. The prisoner left me the beginning of July last; he had been at the office several times between that time and the 19th of November. I had paid Mr. Bourdillion two notes, on the same morning which I received them from Mr. Stone.

            . I live with Messrs. Bourdillion and Hewitt; I know the prisoner, he left their service about June; since that time he has been to the office two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from him what he was doing after he had left - 
               <persName id="t18161204-30-person278">A. </persName>
            He did not state to me what he was doing. In consequence of what I had heard. I applied to him for two orders for the boxes, as I heard he belonged to the Play.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to the office on the 19th of November-A. Yes; at a quarter before nine in the evening. The office in which I write leads into Mr. Bourdillion's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon his coming in, what did he say - A. One of the clerks asked him if he wanted to see Mr. Hewitt? He said, is he at home? I said, John, do you remember you promised me some tickets; he went backwards into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040018"/>yard; I was standing in the passage, and he said, go into the office, and I will bring them to you. He then came in, pulled out his pocket-book, and said, he would write me one. I said, I thought that would not do; he said, he had got a friend just by, and he would go and get me two. He said, he had got a pain in his stomach, and went into the yard again, he did not take a light at that time. He returned again through Mr. Bourdillion's office, asked for a light, and said, he must go again. He went again, through Mr. Bourdillion's room, and returned, pretending to be buttoning-up his cloaths, said, he must go again; he went again, banging Mr. Bourdillion's door after him. This rather excited my suspicion. I rested a little while, then went to the clerk's desk and listened, but heard nothing. Presently I heard the glass-door bang and some person go out. The prisoner did not return through the office as usual. He went out to the privy four times in all. He returned about ten minutes after nine; he put his head in at the door, and said, I have not got the tickets, I am coming here to-morrow morning to Mr. Hewitt. After he had quite gone away, I took my light, thinking that he might have taken some papers. I went to look into Mr. Bourdillion's closet, and I saw the iron-safe half open, and the cash-box gone. I had not been into the room before to see if the safe was open or not. The prisoner did not come the next morning.</p>
               <p>ANN IRELAND. I first became acquainted with the prisoner about six months ago; I then resided with my father at Case-Orton, I afterwards came to London with the prisoner, on a Monday, it was near a fortnight before this circumstance took place; we first lodged with Mrs. Baines, in Shepherd's-market; the prisoner said, he was a player at Drury-lane. While we were with Mrs. Baines we wanted money, we had only a few shillings. Mrs. Baines applied to the prisoner to pay his rent; she kept a public-house; we had no money to pay her.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect Tuesday, the 19th of November-A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18161204-30-person279">Q. </persName>
            Did the prisoner say any thing to you about going out with him-A. Yes: after tea, it was after seven o'clock. I went out with him, he said, he was going to see two or three friends, mentioning Mr. Hewitt's name; he left me at a public-house. I do not know what direction we took when we came out of Shepherd's-market; I have no acquaintance with town. When we were in the public-house he called for a pint of ale, and left me there; he came back again in about half an hour.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18161204-30-person280">Q. </persName>
            When he came back did he bring any thing with him - A. Yes; he brought something tied in a handkerchief; we left the public-house shortly afterwards; as we were going home, I asked him what he had got; he said, a box. When we got home he undid the handkerchief, and I saw a tin box (a box produced); it was not so big as that (another produced), it was about the size of that; he opened it with a knife; he opened the lid of it at the hinges. I saw him take bank notes out of it; as well as I can tell there was a 50l., a 30l., a 20l., a 10l., a 5l., a 1l, and some silver; there were other papers; he made me get a candle and they were burned. I asked him where he got them; he said at Mr. Hewitt's. After he had opened the box he took me out; he left me at Mrs. Barne's; he returned and told me that he had thrown the box into some water; he paid Mrs. Barnes her bill with a 5l. note; this was on Tuesday; he remained at home the next morning; he was in the public house all the afternoon, and in the evening he went out of town, to my father's; he said he would go and fetch my clothes; he returned on the Thursday morning, my father and my uncle came with him; he came to my room door when I was getting up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what he had done with the notes-A. He told me he had hid the notes, in my father's privy, between some boards.</p>

            , Jun. I am the son of James Ireland, Sen. and brother to the last witness. I know the prisoner; I remember his coming down to my father's on the wednesday evening. He spoke to my mother and she went out. He then went down to the privy, which is in the back-yard; it is no great distancefrom the house; he stopped there about ten minutes; he took a light with him; he returned in about ten minutes for another candle, as his own was burnt out. He got another, and went to the privy again, and remained there about ten minutes longer. His stopping there so long excited my attention; I was playing with a dog at the pig-sty, which is about ten yards from the privy. He had got his back turned towards the door, standing up-right in the privy; I could not see what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Harmer coming down - A. Yes; they searched the same privy, in which I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>DANIEL BISHOP. I am an officer of Bow-street. I went with Mr. Harmer, on the 23rd of November, to search the privy; we found the following notes:-one 50l.; one 30l.; one 20l.; and one 10l.; they were between the boards of the seat.</p>
               <p>(Produced.)</p>
               <p>MR. BOURDILLION. This 50l. and 10l. notes were paid me by Mr. Hewitt the same morning: they have the name of Stone written upon them by Mr. Hewitt.</p>

On Wednesday the 27th of November, about half past three o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming from our clerk's desk, which is in the middle of the shop, I observed the prisoner walking out, and leaving a woman behind, who came in with her. I though her left arm, which was under her shawl, seemed encumbered, I followed her; she was walking very fast down Creed-lane; I came up to her, and looked her in the face; she endeavoured to walk slow and get behind me; I kept close to her side; when we came to Water-lane, opposite the shop of Mr. Carrick, I wanted her to go back with me; she refused, and endeavoured to get away; I put one arm round her, and with the other I endeavoured to take hold of her shawl to see if she had any thing there; she took the satin from under her shawl and endeavoured to hold it from me; I took it from her; and at that moment Mr. Carrick opened his door and pulled her into his shop. I delivered her into the custody of the officer, with the satin.</p>

            . I am shopwoman to Messrs. Ellis and Brown. The prisoner came into the shop with another woman, and asked for some cottage lustres, and some poplins; I showed them to her; they purchased a dress; while I was measuring it the prisoner walked out; the other remained; she said she had lost, or left her purse; she gave me a guinea, saying she would fetch the remainder; they came to 1l. 3s. 4d.; I gave her the guinea back, and told her we would send her the poplin; she then took the guinea, was going out, and said she would fetch her purse. I followed her to the door to persuade her to let me send the poplin. She gave me the guinea back, and told me to keep it if I was afraid; she has never returned for the poplin since; the shop was crowded from top to bottom at the time; there are 18 or 20 shop-people. I served both the women. I did not see the satin. I have heard that a young man was next to me showing satin to some ladies. I am sure he did not serve the prisoner. I am sure the prisoner is the person who came in with the other woman.</p>

In a few minutes he threw a sack out of the window. The room is over a coach-house; he got in by climbing up the doors; he jumped out after it, and carried it away. I believe he was not upon good terms with his mother. The mews forms a square; his mother kept two rooms over the stable; the door is at the side of the coach-house; it is called America-mews.

I went to the cellar, where the wine is kept, about half past four in the afternoon; as I was going down the stairs I met the prisoner; he was coming up; I asked him what he wanted there; he replied, he was looking out bottles with Charlton, who is one of our servants. I told him to return with me to Charlton, who was in the cellar, which he did. I called for a light, and asked him what he had taken; he said, nothing, and that I might search him. On looking round, I saw two bottles, on his right-hand, on the dark side(from the candle). The bottles were full, and as much concealed as they could be. I sent for an officer, in the presence of Charlton and several others. He said he knocked them down from the binn; that they were breaking, and he caught these two to save them.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he to the binn then - A. About five yards from it. There was no appearance of the bottles being knocked about. There was no bottles broke in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. From the situation in which the prisoner was found did it appear that he was going to return the bottles - 
               <persName id="t18161204-34-person307">A. </persName>
            Certainly not; he was more than half way up the stairs; he had no business either in the cellar or in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Had he not dealt with you for empty bottles - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. He has dealt with you to the amount of 40l. in a year - A. I do not know. Charlton was in the cellar with him. I do not think there was any empty bottles in that cellar. We call ourselves the Commercial Hall Wine Company. I met him on the cellar stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. When he was going with you, might he not have put the bottles down if he choose-A. He might, perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, you have kicked against some bottles; and you said, come along with them-bring them along - A. I heard some bottles rattling, and I told him to take care or he would break them. There were binns on the side of the cellar. Other persons might have put bottles outside the binns if they choose. Several persons had been in the cellar. When I asked him what he had got, he said, nothing.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you see if he had got anything when he was on the stairs - A. No; I could not keep up to him. He had no business on the premises. He afterwards said, that he had picked the bottles up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Do you mean to say they were under his coat - A. Yes; he had his hands under his coat; that part of the cellar is not payed. I believe he has dealt with us for empty bottles. The cellar is quite separate from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an extraordinary thing for persons to come into the cellar - A. There has been such a thing. We did not keep empty bottles there.</p>

               <p>RICHARD HARLAND. I was near Mr. Abbotts when he called for a light. Mr. Abbotts asked the prisoner, what business he had there; he said he had come down for bottles. Mr. Abbotts asked him, what he had got; he said, nothing, you may search me. He searched him, and found two bottles on him.</p>
               <p>(Produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went and bought some bottles of them on that day. When I had looked them over, I went back, and asked if there were any more; I was told there was in the cellar, in the binn, No.10. I went to look for them; as I was coming out of the cellar, I met Mr. Abbotts; he asked, who is there? I said it was me. He called for a light, and we went down together. I knocked against some bottles; he told me to take care; he then turned round and asked what brought me there; I said business; he said nothing, but sent for an officer, and gave me in charge.</p>

We stopped there until about half past ten o'clock at night; we had very little to drink; on my way home I went to another public-house, and had some gin and water; I then left to go home; it was about eleven o'clock. When I had got about one hundred yards I came to a dark place. The prisoner and three more were standing there, with their hands over their faces. The prisoner struck me several times, trying to knock me down. I fought with him as well as I could. He made three or four attempts at my seals; he got them at last. He ran up New Pye-street, and I followed him, crying stop thief! I never lost sight of him. I saw him taken by the watchman; nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. He was searched by the watchman. I do not know the other men. I was quite sober. I am sure he is the man. Some of the other men struck me behind; I should not know them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the magistrate, that you did not know which of the men it was - A. No. I have no expectation of a reward; I did not know there was one. He said he would cut my seals; but I do not know whether he did; the ribbon appears as if they had been forced off. I did not tell the magistrate that he cut them. The seals and key were gold; they hung out quite easy to be seen.</p>

             M'CULLEN. I am a watchman; I heard the cry of stop thief! I came out of my box, which is at the corner of Pye-street; I stopped the prisoner; he was walking; I did not see him above six yards from my box. There were other people in the street. Murrell came up in about five minutes. I called four or five times for him before he came; he appeared to be in liquor; he was sensible enough to know what he was about. The prisoner made no attempt to get away. Murrell said, he was the very man that knocked him down; he did not say what he had lost; he told the constable of the night, that he had lost his seals and key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I cannot say whether any body had gone by my box before I came out. There might be. There were people going backwards and forwards. The prisoner was walking. It was a very dark night. The place where Murrell was robbed is very dark indeed.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TRIPP. I am constable of the night; I searched the prisoner, but found nothing on him. Murrell appeared as if he had been drinking; he was very dirty.</p>

I could see that they were sailors, by the reflection of the lamp. I did not see their faces. The watchman sprung his rattlc. It was about half past eight o'clock. I only know that they were sailors.

I could hear footsteps before me, but could not see, it was so dark. Blundell's box was between Frances's-barn and London; he had stopped the prisoner. Mr. Knight came up without his hat; he said he was sure that he was the man, and that he could swear to his being the man who held his hands over his eyes. The prisoner said, that he had come from Barnet, and was going to Greenwich to receive prize-money; he said he had no papers to show; he said that he had slept the night before under the shambles in Fleet-market.</p>

I knew it must either be the prisoner or my lad. I spoke to her on the Saturday about it; I gave her no reason to think that she would not be prosecuted. When she was charged with it, she said, she had stolen it; this was on a Sunday night.

I suspected them, and I asked the prisoner Nowland what I could serve her with; she said she would wait until I had served the people whom I was attending to. They were in the shop about twenty minutes before they were served. When the people went out, Nowland asked for some muslin, I server her with it, and some course cloth and cambric, they came to 3s. 1d. altogether. They left the shop in company - I did not perceive them take any thing. I followed them, and came up with M'Dougal, she had got my umbrella; I told her she had stolen it, and asked her to let me look in her apron, which she had up. I looked in, and there were some Irish and print, and a shawl, which I saw on Mrs. Nowland's arm when she came into the shop; I brought M'Dougal back to the shop; she said, Nowland had given her the things. I did not see Nowland afterwards. I had seen both the articles, I am sure, about an hour before in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. There were people in the shop when they came in.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Nowland dressed - A. Not as she is now; she was dressed much better than the other prisoner. M'Dougal said, that the muslin was for her. Nowland had the shawl when they came in; I afterwards saw M'Dougal with it, and my umbrella.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040023"/>Q. When you charged M'Dougal with the robbery, did she not say, if there is any thing wrong, Mrs. Nowland lives at such a place, she gave me the articles to carry-A. No; she said, God bless you, do not hurt me! the woman gave me one shilling to carry it for her. When she got to the shop she gave me Nowland's direction, which I afterwards found to be true.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I did not know where Nowland lived. She dealt with me for the articles, M'Dougal was standing by, and said, that the muslin was for her. When I went out M'Dougal was standing up for the rain; she had no umbrella of her own with her. I officiate sometimes for my brother. I do not know whether Nowland was a frequent customer or not.</p>

               <p>(Produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Nowland has dealt four or five times at my shop; she once paid me a note and gave me the name of Martin, Barbican; she never gave me the name of Nowland. It was about a fortnight before this transaction. M'Dougal gave me Nowland's direction, and she was found there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. When she gave me the 1l. note, I offered to send the things home; M'Dougal was there, but she would not let me. I am sure that when she gave me the name of Martin, that it was not the name of the person from whom she received it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was M'Dougal in hearing when she gave you the name of Martin - A. She was; they would not let me put the goods in paper, which made me suspicious. The linen is worth a 1l.</p>
               <p>THOMAS VAN. I am an officer; I received the linen from Mr. Spooner; M'Dougal told me that Nowland lived in Gould-court, Stepney-green - I went and found her there; she said, if M'Dougal had property it was nothing to her. M'Dougal told Nowland that she gave her the property; Nowland denied it.</p>
               <p>Nowland's Defence. When I paid him the 1l. note he did not ask for the name; and when I bought the things the gentleman asked if I was in a hurry. I know nothing about the goods.</p>
               <p>M'Dougal's Defence. I certainly had the property, and received it from Nowland; she gave me them to carry, and said she would be after me directly, when the gentleman came and took me. I am sure she gave them to me; I went into the shop with her, I wanted nothing myself.</p>
               <p>Court to JOHN SPOONER. How far had M'Dougal got when you overtook her-A. About three hundred yards, she might have got farther if she had not stopped for the rain; I found her standing up, under cover; I am sure that Nowland had the shawl which I saw in M'Dougal's possession afterwards.</p>

            . I am the wife of George French. In the month of June I had the keys of Mr. Cholmondeley's house; I went from time to time to look at the house; I went on Thursday, the 21st of November, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I had been about five weeks before, and my husband has been since; I did not see any thing amiss on the outside, the windows were all shut and the shutters to; when I got in I found some fire-irons in the hall, and that the house had been robbed of a great deal of property. I went and got my husband and one of the lodgers to accompany me; I was there with Nichols. The table was in the drawing-room and the chairs in the dining-parlour in the morning; the bed-furniture and some hats were on the great landing, and there was some silk on the ground-floor belonging to the book-case. I went with Mr. Wellet, a little after five o'clock, and walked about the door; I observed the prisoner, Smith, standing close to the Duke of Cumberland's wall, and passed him. In the course of a little time I saw him near Mr. Cholmondely's door, he then went away, and I saw him come round the corner of Cleveland-court, and go up to the door, as if he was going into it. I observed a man with a porter's knot, very near the house, go round by the Marquis of Stafford's stables, he had the knot under his arm, a light coat on, and a green baize apron; I saw him walk round by the Marquis of Stafford's stables, which comes round by Mr. Cholmondeley's door - I did not see him afterwards there was no thoroughfare. I did not see the other man until he was taken; I went away, and when I returned I saw the door broken open - I then went in. The table and chairs which I had seen in the morning were removed into the hall, with the hats and bed-furniture, they were packed up in a green baize, and a porter's knot was in the hall, on the table, the prisoners were in custody, I saw all three of them at the suttling-house; I knew Smith, and the other was dressed exactly the same as the man I saw in the street with the knot. I have every reason to believe that he is the same person. It was very dark.</p>

            Did you find any thing in the house which had not been there in the morning - A. A dark-lanthorn was found there, which was not there in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. You had not been to the house for sometime-A. About five weeks before; no person lived in the house - I kept the key. It was a few minutes after five o'clock when I first went to watch. I did not see Smith directly, he was standing still when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040024"/>passed him, with his face towards the railing; I had no opportunity of seeing his face at that time; I saw him twice. I am certain, by his dress, that he is the same person.</p>

            Then it is by his dress that you speak to him - A. From his dress and height, more than from his face.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. How far were you from Wells - A. A very little way. If I had stopped I could not have seen his face by the light of the day. I could see the colour of his dress as I passed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Without the light of the lamp you could see colours, why could you not see features as well - A. Features are more difficult to see than colours; the lamps were alight.</p>

            . The keys of Mr. Cholmondeley's house were sent to my house. On the 21st of November my wife went there, and I followed her; I saw that the things were taken away which I had left safe ten days before; I went to Bow-street, Nichols came to me, and we went and looked over the house together. I was there in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave in the morning-A. About three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18161204-42-person371">Q. </persName>
            Were the chairs and tables in the hall then - A. No; I returned in the evening. We had left the shutters in the same manner as we found them. One of them had been forced, and a bar was found under the windows; all the other shutters were fastened. There was a patent lock of Bramali's taken off the door, and another lock on the door which we left locked; I returned in the evening and came down to a post to meet Nichols; I gave him the keys, and he desired me to wait there while he went for assistance. I do not know whether he saw any person go in; Wilders came back with him; he put the key into the door; I was close to the door - He found it fast on the inside; Nichols and Wilders forced it and went in. They had lights. The men had made their escape out at the top of the house. I did not see the prisoners until they were at the suttling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any difference in the hall when you were there - A. The chairs and table were tied up, and the bed-curtains and hats were in the green cloth, and the porter's knot by the side of them. I saw the prisoner, Quinland, examined; a piece of silk was found on him, which I had seen in the house in the morning.</p>
               <p>WILLIM NICHOLS. I am an officer of Bow-street; in consequence of information which I received, I went to Mr. Cholmondeley's house, about half past two o'clock. I gave directions to watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go in the evening - 
               <persName id="t18161204-42-person372">A. </persName>
            About five o'clock. I observed the prisoner, Smith, standing at the corner of the Lord Chamberlains Office, which is nearly opposite the door. I went further on, and passed Wells and Quinland; Wells had a porter's knot, and an apron on. I was in disguise. I got behind the pillar of the Lord Chamberlains office, and I saw Smith go to the door; he was close against it, with his face towards it. I was not near enough to observe him do any thing. He went away, and in a few minutes returned again, went up to the door, with his face towards it; he then walked away, and the other two prisoners crossed over to the door. I lost sight of them. Smith went away, and I was obliged to go, for fear of being seen. I ran through Palace-yard, and went round into Cleveland-square. I then told French and Wilders to go away. Smith returned; went to the door, watched a few minutes, and then walked towards St. James's-street. I followed him, laid hold of him, and said where are you going. He said that he was going home; that he had just come from Westminster, and had been drinking with some Molls, and told me not to tell his wife.</p>


               <p>Court. You knew him then - A. Perfectly well. I told him that he was my prisoner, and must go back with me; he said that he had got nothing about him. I took him to the Suttling-house, and returned to the house. I got some assistance; I listened at the door, and heard a noise, as if things were being removed down stairs. I told my assistants to remain at the door, for their coming out. During this time the door was opened a little way from within, but immediately shut to. I took the key from French; I tried it, and the bolt was immediately closed. I heard a noise like running up stairs. There was a cry in the street, that they were escaping out at the garret window. I desired the Marquis of Stafford's porter to tell the neighbours to watch them. I forced the door, and followed them up stairs. I was followed by some soldiers, we went from roof to roof. The garret windows, were open and broken. After passing over several roofs, the prisoner, Quinland, rose up close to me. I took him into custody, and Ashworth took Wells by my direction. I asked Quinland where he was; he said he must not tell. Quinland said, I know Nichols, and will go with him any where; I must answer for what I have done. I secured him, and found a piece of silk in his hat. I found the articles mentioned in the indictment in the ball: a porter's knot lay by the things; they were packed ready to be carried away. I am sure that the men who were taken on the roof, are the same that I saw walking about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. There were a great many people collected.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened the door some persons might get in, whom you did not see - A. They might; I did not see them go in.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18161204-42-person373">Q. </persName>
            Among the persons who went in, might not the prisoners be two-A. No; I am sure they were not. I gave directions to the porter, and looked into the parlour, before I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did you see the men before the door was opened - A. It might he half an hour.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WILDERS. I was upon the watch that night.</p>
               <p>PETER ASHWORTH. I am in the guards, on the 21st of November, I went to the top of the house and took Wells into custody, he was laid down in a gutter.</p>
               <p>(Lanthorn and silk produced.)</p>
               <p>MRS. FRENCH. This is the lanthorn which I found in the house; and this is the silk. I have looked at the hats, and other things; they are Mr. Cholmondeley's.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I know nothing about it; I was taken about one hundred yards from the house; Nichols took me into custody; I had been to drink a pot of beer with a friend.</p>
               <p>Wells's Defence. I had been to Pimlico. I ran to the top of the house; was walking about, I saw a man, he said, I was the thief, and brought me down.</p>
               <p>Quniland's Defence. I was coming along with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040025"/>other prisoner; I went in and met Nichols at the top of the house. He said that I was one, and took me into custody.</p>

He came between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, and slept there. I got up between six and seven o'clock the next morning; he was then gone; it was hardly day-light; the articles mentioned in the indictment were gone; they were let to him with the lodging (produced and sworn to); the sheets were not quite finished. I was the last person up at night, and fastened the door. The windows were safe in the morning. I am sure the prisoner is the man; he called four or five times before he took the room. He said he had just come from the country, and referred me to a public-house. They could not say much about him; I took him more from his saying that he was a printer at the Star-office. I have since learned that it is false.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you swear to the blankets-A. I can; the sheets have my own mark in them. When I awoke it was dark; if he had gone down after I awoke I must have heard him.</p>
               <p>JANE SHIELDS. I lodge at the last witness's house, in the next room to that where the prisoner lodged. I heard him moving about, as though he was getting up, about five o'clock in the morning. I did not go to sleep again; I did not hear him go down stairs. As I was going out of my own room I observed his door open, I looked in and found the things gone, and I told Miss Whales of it. The street door was wide open. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I put the things on the bed the night before. There were two other lodgers in the house.</p>
               <p>PATRICK CROWLEY. I am a watchman; I stopped the prisoner at a little after six o'clock in the morning, at the corner of Drake-street, Drury-lane; he was running from High Holborn; he had a bundle under his arm; he got off the pavement to pass me; I asked him what he had got; he said clothes, and that he brought them from Whitechapel Church; he said they belonged to his father. I took him into custody; he offered me half of them to let him go; we searched him at the watch-house, and found the sheets round his body.</p>

            . I am a solicitor's clerk. I and Mr. Paddon had been spending the evening with some friends until three o'clock in the morning; in our way home we went to the Britannia Coffee-house. The prisoner entered into conversation with us, and asked the prosecutor for drink, which he gave; it was about six o'clock. The prosecutor took out his pocket-book to pay the reckoning; the prisoner was sitting by, and could plainly see him do it. His pocket-book fell down, he picked it up, and put it in his pocket. We went into another room to have some meat, and the prisoner followed. I was laying my head on the table, I looked up and saw the prosecutor with his coat off. The prisoner took the coat up to help him on with it, and as soon as he had got his arms partly into it, I saw the prisoner take a pocket-book out of the side pocket and run away. I pursued him, and took him between the stalls in the market; he offered me the book and money if I would let him go; he gave it to me, and tried to get away; I told him to beg the prosecutor's pardon, and he should be forgiven. I only told him so to get him secured.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the coffee-house when the two men came in; the prosecutor was drunk, and offered to play any body for 5l. He sent me out of the room, and called his friend a d-d thief. He came to me with the pocket-book, and said I was a thief. He went to the house, and sent his friend out, saying, I had stolen his pocket-book.</p>

She paid me the rent regularly. I went into the room to borrow something of her; I missed the furniture off the bed, and the other things. The prisoner was out. I sent for an officer.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. To deny this charge would only be aggravating the offence; I had no criminal intention in taking the property; I had been pressed for a small debt. I pledged the property, meaning to take it out when I had more money, which I very soon expected. The money was offered to the prosecutor to take the things out of pledge, but he would not accept it. The magistrate wanted them to refrain from prosecuting me, and take the money. I earnestly implore the court to have mercy upon me; I hope I shall never transgress again.</p>

               <p>MARY FLYNN. I am the wife of Hugh Flynn; he is in Greenwich College; the things were taken out of a chest in the room adjoining where the prisoner slept; but there was no lock on the door. I lodge at No. 20, Maidenhead-court, Moor-lane. The prisoner came to my place on a Monday evening, after I had lost the things; I charged him with taking them, and he denied it; but at last he owned it, and gave me two duplicates; one was for my own gown, the other belonged to a person whose things are in my care. I gave the officer the duplicates.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JOHNSTON. I am a butcher. On the 9th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in New-street; I saw the prisoner and another boy with him; the prisoner had a bundle under his arm, in his blue apron; I looked at him, and the other boy ran away. I followed the prisoner, he ran up a court, and I secured him; he said it was meat that he had got, and that he bought it for 6s., at the White Horse. It weighed ten pounds and a half; I took him to Hatton-garden; I afterwards found that it belonged to the prosecutor. It could not be bought for less than 6d. per pound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. I saw the other boy run away. I did not go to the White Horse.</p>

I stooped for the carpet, and he got away. I called out stop thief! and he was taken by the last witness; when he got from me he ran down a street and I lost sight of him. I am sure he is the man that I stopped with the carpet; the carpet laid on another, and might be taken away without a noise. I did not see him take it; it was worth 35s.</p>

There was a crowd round the door; he broke the windows with his elbows. I saw him do it; and he was stopped directly with the biscuits in his hand. Mr. Winder stopped him, the biscuits were picked up; there was no name on them.</p>

               <p>MICHAEL WINDER. I am a watch-maker. I was coming down Holborn, and saw a mob coming down towards the procecutor's house, with the prisoner at the head of them. He came up to Mr. Cornish's, and said, here is a baker's-shop, come along; he immediately folded his arms together and broke two pains of glass with his elbows; he took out a quantity of biscuits from the window; I laid hold of him; he said, I am grabbed, rescue me; the mob came round, and I, with my son's assistance. took him into the shop.</p>

On the 15th of November, about a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening, a crowd, principally of boys, assembled round my windows, calling out, a loaf! A man called to me to hand him out a loaf and they would be gone; I gave them three; my windows were broken, and some bread was taken. I saw the prisoner in custody about two hours afterwards. I did not see him with the crowd; the mob had sticks with them; I saw one small black-looking stick.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street; I was out, on the 15th of November, with Maidmant, Wilson, and Townsend; we were at Mr. Morrison's at the time the mob were crying out bread or blood! I heard the windows break, and rushed forward among the mob; I saw the prisoner, with a small stick, with a hook to it, breaking the windows; he put his hand through one of the panes, which he broke himself, and was in the act of taking a loaf from the end of the counter; I seized him by the collar; Maidmant came to my assistance; the mob cried, rescue! He did not make a violent resistance; we took him to St. Martin's watch-house. Maidmant searched him; I saw him find some pieces of cemented mortar in his pocket; they corresponded with the piece found in Mr. Morrison's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. There were about three hundred persons. I was close to the shop; he was surrounded by a crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the stick here - A. No; I did not take it; I suppose he dropped it. I am sure he held the stick; he did not resist; when I went up, he was in the act of breakiing the glass; I saw him in the act of drawing a loaf from the counter with the stick; he had nearly removed it from the place on which it stood. I should not think that any part of it stood on the place that it did before.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAL MAIDMANT. I am an officer. I saw the prisoner close to the window; when I seized him he said nothing; but the mob cried out, rescue! I did not see what he was doing, because Esthelby was before me; I searched him, and found upon him two bits of mortar and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040030"/>a hymn-book (producing them); the mortar was in his coat-pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. There was many persons surrounding the shop - A. There was; my attention was directed to the whole group, not to one in particular.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I beg to state that I am perfectly innocent of the charge; I trust, when my witnesses are heard, that you will think so. It is very unlikely that a person in my situation of life should be guilty of stealing a loaf: my situation in life has ever been respectable. Esthelby is the only witness I have to complain of, he has not said what it true. I have been a Yeoman in the Guards, and have been always ready to exert myself for the public good.</p>

            . I am a cordwainer. I was present at Mr. Morrison's shop; there were several windows broke on both sides of the shop. I saw the prisoner previous to my arrival at the house; he had no stick in his hand. I know the prisoner slightly before this evening; I had seen him in the company of his brother, who live with Messrs. White and Co. in the Haymarket. I was on the steps of St. Martin's Church; I followed the crowd; I met the prisoner at the corner of Hemmings-row; he was going with them towards the Haymarket. He told me that he was going to see his brother. I went part of the way along the street with him. The pressure of the crowd was so great, that we parted. If he had a stick with him I must have seen it. I went on with the crowd to Mr. Morrison's, which is a very short way from Leicester-square. The windows were broken. White and Co. live next door to the Theatre.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. In what state were the windows when he come up - A. They were broken before he arrived. There was nothing remaining in the window; I did not see him throw any thing. The mob was pushing about. I was there where he was taken into custody.</p>

I went home; the door was open; the latch I lifted up, and saw a light up stairs. I went up, as I thought it was my brother; a man came out of the room, and put the light out, and came down stairs.

            , Sen. re-examined. My little child was not in the house. My son came back and told me what he had seen. I went home; my chests were both broken open. I had lost a little bag of silver, to the amount of about 7l., and a pocket-book; some duplicates and other things. I had left my brother in charge of the house. I apprehended him and another, and they were tried here last sessions and acquitted, because I could not trace the property. I had not seen any part of it until the 13th of October, when Mr. Sowerby, who is a pawnbroker, sent for me down to his shop; when I got there the prisoner was in the shop. He had produced two duplicates to redeem two articles; the pawnbroker shewed them to me in his presence. The prisoner asked me if I had lost them. I told him I had lost them and a great deal of property in a red pocket-book, and with some money. He said that he found them in a red pocket-book, which he had at home; but that he lived at Chatham.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040031"/>He said had several more which he picked up with them. He produced them. They were the very tickets which I had lost. We went to Worship-street to know how he came by them, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. My keeping my money in a chest was no secret. The prisoner said he found them at Chatham, and he said that he had more. I have heard that the man who was tried with my brother had been at Chatham.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe that the prisoner committed the robbery - A. No; from what I have heard since I don't think he did. I should know the pocket-book again (produced by the prisoner). It is mine.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Sowerby, who is a pawnbroker. The prisoner came into our shop to redeem some pledges. I found that I had notice from the prosecutor to stop any body who offered to redeem them. I asked him how he got them. He said that he had bought them of Mrs. Edwards. I sent for her. We were not particular in detaining him; he might have got away if he liked; he did not seem at all agitated. The conversation took place that Mr. Edwards has related. I was at the office, and Mrs. Edwards was there.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she say-A. She said that she had not sold the duplicates, and the prisoner confessed that was the only part in which he was criminal. He said, he intended to redeem the property, that the perosn who had lost them might have it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The property was pledged in the name of Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q. If he should tell you that he had found the tickets, you would take them away - A. No; we should stop the property. The prisoner staid very quietly in the shop.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Wornack. Last Monday, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, there was a great crowd round the house. I had been out. When I came in, I found them there. There was three men with bludgeons in their hands. The shop was full of people, taking the bread. I was alone in the shop. It was shut up before I went out. I left the door upon the latch; they asked for bread. As they were going out I saw the prisoner with some loaves; I laid hold of him, and he dropped them. He had two loaves under his arm.</p>

When I got up I dressed the child, all but its shoes, before the prisoner came down. When the prisoner came down the child was out; it was taken out by an old lady, who was in the habit of taking it out. She has been dead about six weeks; her name was Bennett. When the prisoner came down she asked for the child. I told her Mrs. Bennett had taken her out. The prisoner asked me why I let her go, as she wanted to take her a walk. The prisoner took hold of the child's shoes, and went out, saying, she would go and seek her. I told her where she was gone. The old lady came back in about an hour without the child. The prisoner did not return nor the child, or the clothes. She had a black frock, two petticoats, and a shift on; the shoes were never brought back again.</p>

            . I am a private in the first regiment of Foot Guards. On the 12th of November last, I was in the stables, which belong to Hyde-park barracks, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I heard somebody at the top of the barracks; I went out to see who it was; I climbed up, and saw the two prisoners cutting the lead off the gutter. I did not think that they were doing wrong. The prisoner. Washington, came down with me; I pointed out a pipe in the roof of the stables where the rain came through; I went up again with another man; I then observed that the lead was fresh cut, and sent for the clerk. I went down a second time, and returned again; the lead was then cut off and gone.</p>

            . I am also a private in the same regiment. I went up to the top of the barracks, and saw that the lead had been cut away; I saw the prisoner, Baron, coming down, with a basket, from the top of the building; I did not suspect him; I afterwards saw him standing by the dung-hill; I went there, and found the lead hid in a basket, covered over with dung; there was also a knife in the basket.</p>

               <p>JOHN BRAGG. I am clerk of the works at the barracks. The prisoners were employed at the barrachs; one as a bricklayer, and the other as his labourer; they had no authority to move the lead; it is not their place to do any thing with the lead; Baron is the last person that I should suspect.</p>
               <p>Washington's Defence. The man spoke to me about a pipe being stopped I went up to look at it, and saw the lead cut; I told the other man of it, and he took it to the barrack servant.</p>
               <p>Baron's Defence. We went to the top of the house; the other prisoner told me the lead was cut; I was going to take it to the servant, but not directly; I put it on the dung-hill, and it must have sunk down; I did not cover it.</p>

            . I am an officer; about one o'clock in the morning, of the 5th of November, the prosecutor came to the watch-house, saying he had been robbed. I apprehended the prisoner about two hours after; he was concealed in a coal-shed, in Denmark-street; I took him to the watch-house; he had the prosecutor's jacket on his back. We went to the coal-shed, and the man who keeps it produced a bag, which the prosecutor claimed, with its contents; next morning the prosecutor brought a coat, which he said he had found in his cabin, and the prisoner claimed it as his, and he put it on to go before the magistrate.</p>

My friend told me that it was the other man who had picked my pocket. I followed him, and could have seized him, but the prisoner stood in a menacing attitude, and prevented me. I saw the prisoner by a shop, where there was a very strong gas-light, so that I cannot he mistaken in his person; they got off. I had occasion to go by the same place for two or three nights following, and was hustled every time; in consequence of which I gave information at Bow-street, and the prisoner was taken about a week afterwards. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>MR. GEORGE ANDREWS. On the 14th of November, I was walking along Coventry-street, with the last witness, I saw a man close behind us, and the prisoner and another man behind him; the first man was in the act of picking Mr. Silver's pocket; I am sure the prisoner saw the man take the handkerchief out; he appearcd to put his hands behind for the purpose of giving it to the other men; of whom the prisoner was one. Seeing that we observed them, they did not receive it, and it fell on the ground, at the prisoner's feet. The men ran off, and the prisoner passed us, and stood at the corner of a dark place, called George-yard; The man who took the handkerchief ran up the yard; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I am a clothes-salesman, and live in Rosemary-lane. The two prisoners came to my shop between one and two o'clock in the day, on the 5th of November, and offered the silver articles for sale. Brook was the man that offered them. I asked him where he got them; he said he had brought them from abroad. I told him I did not think that they were his. He said they are mine, if you will not buy them, give them back to me. I refused, and he told me to send for an officer. He could not have gone away without jumping over the door; I do not think he attempted it. I went for the officer, and left them in charge of my wife and man. The articles are worth thirty shillings.</p>

               <p>EBENEZE DALTON. I am a police officer. I searched the prisoners, and found the boots, one shilling and two-pence three-farthings, in farthings, and ten-pence halfpenny, in penny-pieces and halfpence, and two children's thimbles on Brooks; and on Franks I found one shilling and sixpence, in halfpence, and four-pence halfpenny, in farthings and penny-pieces. Brooks said, that he bought the boots in Petticoat-lane, for his little brother, and gave sixpence for them. Franks said, he found his things at the back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040036"/>of the hospital in Whitechapel-road. I found a chisel in the bar of the house.</p>
               <p>Court to MRS. ROBERTSON. Did you lose any thimbles - A. I cannot say; my children have thimbles.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you as much as two shillings in farthings - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Brooks Defence. On the 5th of November I was coming from Stepney, and fell in with this boy. We were talking together, and he blacked my face in the fields. I had a stick in my hand, and I pushed it into the ground to get up a turf to heave at him, and I rose the spoons up. They were buried in the ground. I went to Petticoat-lane, and bought the boots; they gave me the farthings in change. As I was going down Rosemary-lane I saw a boy, who asked me if I had any thing to sell; I gave him the spoons, and they sent for an officer.</p>

I went home, and my mother not being at home, I went out again. As I was going over London Bridge, I met the prisoner; it was about twelve o'clock in the day. He asked me where I was going, and if I would have something to drink. He was going to East Smithfield, and I was going to Cornwall-street the same way. I went with him; I had never seen him before. He took me to the sign of the Crown, in East Smithfield; he gave me a quartern of gin. I drank the whole of it, as I was very wet, and had had no victuals for two days. I do not think that he drank any of it. We came out together. He then wanted to carry the bundle; I would not let him. He did not want to carry it before. He struck me in the stomach; I fell down, and as I fell he

             the bundle from under my arm, and ran away. I got up to look for the bundle, and it was gone. I cried out stop thief! I could not see any body. A gentleman went after him. About a quarter of an hour after, I saw the gentleman come back with the bundle; I stopped in the same place all the time. Mr. Moses shewed me the bundle; it was covered with my apron. I can swear to the apron. It was in the apron when Mr. Moses brought it to me; he gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not ask me to go with you - A. No. He said he was going into East Smithfield, and I said I was going to Cornwall-street. He said, that was the same way; and if I would go with him, he would give me something to drink; and he asked me if he should carry the bundle.</p>

            . I live in Parsons-street, East Smithfield. I am a slop-seller. I was standing at my brother's door, which is opposite the Rose and Crown public-house, on the 26th of November, I observed the prosecutrix come out of the public-house with the prisoner, at about a quarter before one o'clock. At the instant they came off the steps, I saw her fall into the Kennel, and the prisoner take a bundle from her, and run away. I did not see him do any thing else to her. We pursued him, and overtook him. I saw him run all the way till I took him. I asked him what it was; he said, it was a bundle that he was going to carry home to the person whom it belonged to, as the woman he had taken it from had stolen it. I took him back to the public-house, and sent for an officer, and gave him in charge. The bundle was given to the officer also. We took him to the magistrate; the girl swore to the bundle. the bundle which I took from him is the same that I saw him take from the girl; it contained four unmade sailors jackets, wrapped up in a check apron.</p>

In about a quarter of an hour my daughter called me again(this was before six o'clock); I got up and opened the the window, the watchman was calling half-past five o'clock - I called him; I looked into the street, and saw a man standing about eight yards from my house-it was not quite day-light. I called out, "Who is there?" the watchman was still advancing towards the house; the man came forward, and stood under the window out of which I was looking, and looked me full in the face; I called the watchman again, the man then walked down the street, and I saw no more of him; I should not know him again. I returned to bed, and got up in about twenty minutes, being alarmed by my servant, this was after six o'clock; I went into the parlour, and found the furniture in great disorder. I missed a table-clock, a pair of pistols, two flutes, an old time-piece, and three umbrellas; the door between the parlour and the shop was forced open. I conceived that they must have got in at the parlour window, as it was open. I also found the cellar window forced open; the cellar doors lead into the street - they are folding-doors which fasten by bolts, that go into the flap, the place was large enough to admit a person through, there were no marks of violence on them, so that it must have been opened from the inside. There was no other place open but the parlour window and the cellar doors. The cellar is part of the house. I have seen some of the things since.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the last witness; I heard a noise between half-past four and five o'clock, and called to my father, what he has said is correct. When I went down stairs in the morning, the parlour shutter and window were open; my observation was the same as my father's; the cellar windows were shut about half-past ten o'clock the night before; I held the light for the servant to fasten them; they shut with two folding-doors and fastens with a bolt; they were quite safe. My father missed the articles before me.</p>
               <p>HANNAH SHEPHARD. I am servant to Mr. Blenkinsop; I rose first in the morning; the cellar windows were quite safe the night before; when I came down stairs they were shut close, but the bolts were broken. I saw them before my master, they were broken open after I had seen them the night before, so that a person must have been into the house. I missed the clock and the umbrellas; there was a time-piece besides the clock, which was also gone. I did not miss the other articles. I know nothing of them.</p>
               <p>MR. BLENKINSOP Re-examined. I only missed the articles which I have enumerated, at the time-they were in the house the over-night. I afterwards missed the other articles out of the shop. I cannot say what they were; the spoons were missing that morning, they are worth 5s.; the pistols are worth 10s.; the flutes 5s., and the three umbrellas 20s.;</p>

            . I am the beadle of St. George's Parish. On the 30th of November I met the prisoner in Old Gravel-lane, knowing them before, I looked after them. They were carrying something in their hands; they looked round at me, and I at them. The prisoner Clarke altered the position of his bundle, and put it in front, which made me suspect him. I went to them, and asked Clarke what he had got; he said, it was his own property. I felt it, and found it to be pistols; they were tied up in a handkerchief. I asked him where he was going with them; he said he was going on board the Eliza, which lay on the other side of the river. I told him I must take him where he must give a better account of them. I took them to Shadwell-Office; while they were there I searched them. Baines wished me to let him go, as he said he was no acquaintance of the other prisoner. I found a German-flute, a watch and appendages, and a steel purse, and some orders for the free and easy clubs on Baines. I then searched Clarke; I found on him a tobacco-box, a bad three shilling token, and the pistols. I found out who the property belonged to, and they were committed. I afterwards searched Baines's house, and found a bunch of keys in his room; one of them fitted Mr. Blenkinsop's portable desk, another his till, and another fitted a door in his shop (I took the lock off the desk, and produce it).</p>

               <p>Baines' Defence. I was going along Ratcliff-highway, and met the prisoner, who asked me to go to Execution-dock, Jackson came to stop him, and he took me too. I bought the flute about seven months ago.</p>
               <p>Clarke's Defence. Jackson asked me where I got the pistols from, and I told him that I bought them for 10s.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way were you going-A. I had got half-way down the street. I was coming form Piccadilly into Swallow-street, then across Hanover-square, Bond-street, into Grosvenor-square. When I was in the square, S. Bond came up to me, and asked if I had got any money? I said, No; she then took my neck-handkerchief. The prisoner Smith took hold of my hands, and told Bond to look for my money. I called out to the watchman, and he came up; Bond ran away, but I took hold of Smith, and gave her in charge; I had lost my handkerchief, and 1s. 5d. in money, which was in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bond. Did you not give me the handkerchief - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. Did you not give me the 1s. 5d. - A. I did not; I was quite sober at the time.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GAFFER. I am a watchman; I heard a cry of watch, about a quarter past eleven o'clock; I saw the prisoner, Bond, run round the corner of Grosvenor-street, into Bond-street, shortly afterwards I saw the prosecutor come out of the Half-Moon Coffee-house, which is three doors from Bond-street, he had hold of the prisoner Smith; he told me that she had taken 1s. 5d. from him, and that another girl had taken his handkerchief. I told Smith to give him the money, she said she had not got it; I took her to the watch-house; she did not say he had given it to her. It was after eleven o'clock. Smith was not searched; she said that Bond had got the handkerchief and money. I found Bond, in Bond-street.</p>

I belong to the watch-house; Smith was brought in by the watchman; when the prosecutor came in, he said, that she was not the girl who took the money, but he charged her with assisting the other girl. I could not understand him. Bond was brought in afterwards. They were put into the lock-up-house, in which there is a water-closet; it was a cold night, and I ordered them up to warm themselves, when I found this handkerchief in the water-closet. I do not know which of them put it there.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and went to the prisoner's, Dowding, house. I asked him what he had done with the man's shutters; he was confused, and gave me no answer. He was standing by his door, in the act of moving the shutters, having both in his hands. Elves was with me, and claimed them. I asked the prisoner, Dowding, who he bought them of, and he said, of a girl, and gave 1s. 6d. for them. I asked him if he should know her; he said, he had bought a number of things of her. I asked him to show me where she lived. He went to the house where he said her father and mother lived. I could not find her out. We took them to Lambeth Police Office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner told me that he had bought them of the girl, and that he knew where she lived, and accompanied me to her father's house.</p>

The prisoner Moor is brother to my man-cook; he returned from sea about four months since, and has been in the habit of coming to my house to see his brother. He had heard me say, that I had lost some spoons. I had information that some of my things were found in a room occupied by the prisoner Wells, in Harford-place, Drury-lane. I got a search-warrant, and was accompanied by Hutt, the officer, to the room; we found six knives and two forks, and several duplicates, some of which belonged to my property. I asked the prisonor Wells, if she had received my table-cloths from the prisoner Moore; she acknowledged that she had, and said, she had pledged one of them in Holborn, and the other in Drury-lane. I went to a pawnbroker, and saw one of my table-cloths. Hutt took the prisoner Moor into custody, searched him and found a duplicate of a silver tea-spoon in his possession.</p>

            . I am an officer. I accompanied Mrs. Knott to the apartment of the prisoner Wells. I told her I had a search-warrant; she said, she had no objection to it. I found six knives and two forks, which she said, were her property, and that they were brought by a person of the name of Moore, who made her a present of them. I asked her if she had bought any table-cloths of him; she said he had brought two for her to pawn for him, which she had done, and had given him the money. She went very willingly to shew where she had pawned them. One of the pawnbrokers had not got any; the next had one. I secured her, and went down to the prosecutor's, and took the other prisoner. As I was taking him along, he made an attempt to take something out of his pocket; I found he had got a duplicate of a spoon. I asked him how he came by it; he said it was thrown out in the street. He afterwards confessed that he had taken the things, and had taken them to the prisoner Wells.</p>

We stopped them at Bridge-street; I asked Turner what he had got; he said he did not know. I put my hand in the bag, and found it was leather. The prisoner said it was leather which was left at his house, by a person, to take over the water. I asked him where; he said into the Borough. He would not tell me the person's name whom he was going to take it to. We took them to the watch-house; I then opened the bag, and found it was a bullock's hide. He then said he was going to take it to Mr. Scott's, River-street, Gravel-lane; we took them to the Counter. I then went to Mr. Scott's; he said he had not bought any leather, nor did he expect any. I at last found that the leather belonged to Mr. Hadley. Turner was discharged by the magistrate, and the prisoner committed.</p>

               <persName id="t18161204-93-person733">A. </persName>
            He said he would challenge any man to play for 5l. I had ceased to play then; the cards were on the table;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040043"/>I was picked out by a man of the name of Ingram to play with him. I said I did not want to play with him, as I did not know him. The prisoner appeared to be very little in liquor. When I said that I would not play him, he said I had got no money. I then said I would play him for 5l. He said he would play for 1s., and something to drink. I laughed at him, and said, then you have got no money in your pocket. He made no reply, and I said, I would play him. He borrowed 1s. of Mr. Knight, and put it down, and I gave my money into the custody of Rawley. The landlady then came in, and said, she would have no playing so late at night. I gave her my cards up, but the prisoner was not willing to give her his. The prisoner said, I think you will get drawn as you go home. I said, I do not think that you will draw me. In the course of the evening the prisoner addressed himself to the deceased. The deceased sat by the prisoner while I was beginning to play with him. The prisoner Anderson offered to play him for 5l. The prisoner spoke first to the deceased. The deceased was laughing at what we were saying; when I told the prisoner I was not afraid of his drawing of me. The prisoner offered to play the deceased, and the deceased said, what is the use of playing you, you have no money in your pocket. The prisoner then said, you bl-dy snot, I will produce 5l. within an hour. The deceased said, I will not play you for any thing; I see what sort of a chap you are. The prisoner said, d-n your eyes, I will bl-dy well lick you, if you talk in that way! The deceased said, it would take a better man than him to do it. The prisoner challenged him to fight; he said, will you go out to fight? The deceased said, no, I will not. Then he asked him to play at cards, the deceased said, no, I will not; and called him a foul-mouth-fellow, and said, he would call the landlady to bring a mop and pail to mop his foul-mouth out. The landlady came in by chance, and the prisoner got up, and said, d-n your eyes, I will cut your bl-dy head in two! They were both sitting down before this. The prisoner then made a blow with the pint-pot in his hand, towards the deceased's face, but he checked it; so that it did not hit him. The landlady then attempted to turn the prisoner out; he caught hold of the door, and would not let her. He came back and challenged the deceased to go out and fight; the deceased said, he did not want to have any thing to do with him. The prisoner repeatedly challenged him again, and the deceased said, I suppose I must have a turn-out; I must tight seemingly. They then both agreed to go out and fight. They both went out; the deceased went out first, and the prisoner followed, but not immediately. Nothing more passed after they agreed to fight. I know that the deceased went out first; I went out with some more, and left the prisoner coming out, as it were behind me. But when I got out, he did not follow directly; there might not be a minute between his coming out and mine. I saw the deceased out at the door. When the prisoner came out, he had his hands behind his coat; they were under his coat, behind him. The deceased said, I do not wish to fight here, it being muddy; I will fight you on the turf if you like. There was a field about two hundred yards farther on. The prisoner said, d-n your eyes, you b-r, you shall have it here, and ran at him! The deceased hit out immediately, and they closed; both fell; the deceased was uppermost. They got up by themselves; no sooner had they got up, than they closed again; they both fell again, after a little fighting, during which they were closed all the time.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did that round continue - A. It might last better than a minute; the deceased was uppermost again. The deceased got up, and the prisoner laid on the ground. I saw the deceased get up, and stagger towards a shop, which might be about two yards from where they fell. He fell into the hands of Hutton; I did not hear what he said. Hutton called out that he was cut. I went up to him; the prisoner was laying on the ground all that time. I looked at the deceased, he made a noise as if he was fainting; I saw the blood running from him very fast indeed. He seemed to me to be fainting. He was then carried off to Mr. Taylor's, the doctor; I helped to carry him there; it is about one hundred and eighty yards. I did not hear him speak again; he died in Mr. Taylor's shop; I do not suppose that he lived above two minutes after he got in; it might be about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes from the beginning of the fight to his death. I then went to look for the prisoner, and found him standing near the place where they fought; he was all over blood, and the watchman was standing with him. I told the watchman to take him into custody for murdering the man. The prisoner made no reply. The watchman took him; others told him to take him as well as me. I did not hear the prisoner say any thing. We then went to the watch-house; the prisoner said, who is the man that will give charge of me? Mr. Knight came in, and said, I give charge of him. Mr. Knight had been with us at the public-house; the prisoner was left in custody. The deceased was a silversmith. I observed the prisoner with his hands behind him as soon as he got out of the door. The deceased then said he did not wish to fight; neither of them stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the prisoner had his hands behind his coat, could you form any opinion what he was doing - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. You had been playing at cards from seven till eleven o'clock, and had been drinking - A. I had; our spirits might be a little elevated; the company were my friends; the prisoner was known to some of them; he wanted to play for 5l.; I smiled, and said, he had no money.</p>
               <p>Q. You meant this as a taunting expression, or as a retort-A. I did. I was not warm in the least when I said, I was not afraid of his drawing me. I meant that as a taunting expression.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think that he meant to steal your watch-A. I did; and meant to convey that opinion to him. He asked me where I lived; I thought it strange. I meant to convey to him that I thought him a pick-pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased called for a mop and pail to mop his foul-mouth out - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. They fought - A. Yes; they fought two rounds; there was no seconds, all were standing round, about a yard and a half or two yards from them. After the first round the prisoner fell undermost.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the deceased getting up did he say he had been cut-A. I did not hear him. They closed again in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040044"/>stantly. If he had made such a complaint, I should suppose, we should have heard him.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have seen it-A. No; it was dark. I observed the prisoner's head was cut when he was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. The blood which covered him might be his own blood - A. No; because his clothes were all bloody in the front.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wound in the head given in the first or second round - A. I should think the second; for he fell tremendously heavy; he was undermost both times.</p>
               <p>Court. During the time they were fighting was any person near, so that they might have given the deceased a blow-A. No; I did not see them. There was no ring formed.</p>
               <p>Q. What length of time might the first round occupy-A. Near a minute; the second round was more than a minute, it lasted about two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might the prisoner be on the ground the first time he fell - 
               <persName id="t18161204-93-person734">A. </persName>
            About a quarter of a minute; as soon as they separated they got up.</p>

            Had you your eye upon the prisoner when he was on the ground, after the first round - A. I observed them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the prisoner, after he was down the first time, take anything out of his pocket-A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he, without you seeing it - A. I do not think he could; if he had I must have seen it.</p>

            . I was at the Cart and Horse public-house on that day; I went there about eight o'clock. I was in company with Levy, the deceased - He was a silversmith; I had known him for two years. The prisoner came in between eleven and twelve o'clock. As soon as he came in, he said, I'll play any body at cards, for 5l.; several persons said, there is a young man who will play you, pointing out the last witness. I observed that the prisoner was a little intoxicated. Hollier said, that he would play him for 5l.; and the prisoner said, he would play him for a shilling, a glass of liquor, or a pint, I do not know which. They sat down together to play, and the prisoner borrowed a shilling of Mr. Knight; the money was deposited in Rawley's hands. The prisoner then said, Knight, lend me another shilling. Knight said, lose that first. The landlady came in, and said, that there should be no more playing that night; the cards were put up, and the prisoner turned to the deceased, I do not think they had spoken to each other before; the prisoner said, I will play you for 5l., speaking to the deceased, and I will make it good in an hour. The deceased said, how can you do that, you have no money, what do you talk in that way for? The prisoner felt himself agrieved, and made use of very bad language; he took up a pint pot, and said, d-n your eyes, you b-gg-r, I will split your bl-dy head open. The deceased said, do not do that, it will be a pity. The prisoner then said, he would bl-dy well lick him. The deceased told him it would take a better man than him to do it; and said he would call the landlady in to get a pail and a mop to wash his foul mouth out. He put the mug on the table again; the landlady came in at the time, and caught hold of the prisoner, and tried to turn him out; he put his hands on the door, and prevented her. The prisoner then said, several times, that he would fight the deceased. Levy agreed to go out and fight him. The landlady tried to persuade them not to go, but they would. Levy went out first, and the prisoner followed him. Several people went out with them; I was with Levy, before the prisoner. When they came out they walked a little way. Levy said, he would not fight there, it being muddy, but he would on the turf. The prisoner said, no, you b-gg-r, you shall have it here. They went at it directly, no ring was made at that time. The prisoner rushed at him, and they closed directly and fell, the prisoner being under the deceased; they both got up immediately, closed, and fell again, and the prisoner was then under the deceased. The deceased got up, between a stagger and a walk, and went to the other side of the way, against a green-grocer's shop; I caught hold of him, he said, my face is bloody; I took out his handkerchief, and while I was wiping his face, he said, he has cut me. The prisoner was on the ground, I do not know whether he heard him. I immediately helped to take him to Mr. Taylor's.</p>

            When they were on the ground the first time, did you observe any thing particular in the prisoner's con duct - A. No; nor the second time either.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had put his hands in either of his pockets, were you in a situation to see him - A. I was.</p>

               <persName id="t18161204-93-person740">A. </persName>
            Nine or ten. The deceased did not live a minute after he was carried into Mr. Taylor's. He did not speak after he spoke to me at the green-grocer's door. I went back to the place the next morning, there was a great quantity of blood on the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. How long had you known the deceased - A. One or two years; I did not know the prisoner more, than from seeing him once or twice. I went to the house about eight o'clock, and was there when the prisoner came in, which was about half-past eleven; he might be in liquor; a man was picked-out to play with him, whom the company thought was the best player.</p>

            He had several against him-A. No; the landlady endeavoured to persuade him not to fight. I went out with Levy, he went out before the prisoner.</p>

            Did all the company come out of the room - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any come out with the prisoner - A. They followed after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner out, and the landlady trying to keep Levy in-A. No; the deceased was capable of thrashing the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner strike with both hands - A. He rushed at him directly, they closed, and the prisoner was underneath both times; his head was in the mud, I saw it afterwards, it was very bloody. I was about two yards off from them; when they fell their feet were towards me. I cannot say what the prisoner was doing with his hands; I saw nothing in them at any time.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Did you hear any person persuade the prisoner not to go out to fight-A. That was Mr. Warder.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before he left the house - A. It was at the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040045"/>Q. Did Mr. Rawley persuade him not to fight also - 
               <persName id="t18161204-93-person743">A. </persName>
            He did; he had been playing with him, he sat at the same table.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Rawley and Warder persuade him not to fight before Levy left the room - A. It was before I went out; there was no person near them while they were fighting. I am sure nobody could have cut the deceased, but the prisoner; if they had, I must have seen them. I am sure no person was near enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your eye upon the prisoner. from the time that they began until Levy staggered; and did you notice, so as to be able to see if he did take any thing out of his pocket - A. It was impossible, the time was so short.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it impossible to take it from his pocket after they first began - 
               <persName id="t18161204-93-person744">A. </persName>
            Impossible; when he was down he got up directly, so that there was no time then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in your judgment, if the prisoner cut the deceased with any thing, it must have been in his hand, at the time he began fighting-A. It must, I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

            . I am a jeweller; I was acquainted with the deceased; I was in his company at the Cart and Horse, on the 9th of November last. I was there about eight o'clock. The prisoner came in about a quarter before twelve o'clock, to the best of my recollection. I had been drinking. We were all sober; we had drank about six pots of porter among seven or eight persons; we had been playing at cards. When the prisoner came in, I thought he was rather intoxicated. When he had been in about six minutes, he began talking to us. He challenged to play any one at cards for 5l. Some person told Hollier to play him; and Hollier said, he would play him. They sat down, and agreed to play for a shilling, and something to drink. The prisoner asked Knight to lend him a shilling; when the landlady came in, and said, that there should be no more playing. Hollier put the cards down. The prisoner rose from his chair, with the cards in his hand, and said, I will play any body for 5l. I thought he addressed himself to the deceased. Levy said, if I play you for 5l. you have no money. The prisoner then said, d-n your eyes. The deceased said, bring in a mop and a pail, that I may wash his foul-mouth out, for it is very foul. The prisoner then took up a pint pot, and said, I will cut your bl-dy eyes out; addressing himself to the deceased. The deceased seeing him coming, rose up, and said, do not do that, for it will be a pity; and put himself in a posture for defence. The prisoner said, I see you are fightable, are you? The deceased said, no, I am not; nor do I wish to fight. The landlady took hold of the prisoner's shoulders to turn him out, saying, you shall not stop; he came back to the place where she had drove him from, and insisted on fighting with the deceased. Levy sat down afterwards; he was in his seat when the landlady was turning the prisoner out. When the prisoner returned, he said, will you fight? The deceased said, he would not. At last the deceased said, I see nothing else will do, I will go out and fight him. He got off his seat to go out; he went out before the prisoner, I, and some others, went out with him. I saw the prisoner by the door, he stood with one hand behind him, under his coat, in this way (Here the witness put his right-hand under his coat-flap, near the waist); there were several standing by the side of him. I told the deceased he had better not fight on the stones. He said, I do not want to fight at all, but if I do, it shall be on the turf; the prisoner then said, you shall fight, and rushed at him; some blows were struck on both sides, and they got nearly into the middle of the road - They both fell; Levy was at the top; they both jumped up, they were not down a second; they rose directly; I did not observe whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand at the time; there was nobody near enough to strike them all the time-no person interfered to pick them up. They began fighting again; they closed as soon as they got up; I saw the prisoner had his left arm round Levy's neck, and his other hand as if striking him, when they fell again; Levy was uppermost; he rose of his own accord, and staggered about three yards-he said nothing in my hearing; they might be about a minute on the ground the second time.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there then time enough for the prisoner to take any thing out of his pocket-A. No; I do not think he could, I was near enough to see him; I do not think at that time he could; I went to assit Levy, and heard some person say that he was dying. I found him lying on the ground, bleeding very fast. The prisoner lay in the middle of the road; Mr. Knight ran and picked him up. I attended on Levy, and went to Mr. Taylor's with him - He died there very soon. I returned with Mr. Knight, to look for the prisoner, and found him standing near the place where we left him. Somebody said, "Why Bill, you have killed him." I did not hear him make any answer. The prisoner was then very bloody. I observed the blood run from the back part of his head; there was also blood on the front of the prisoner's clothes. He was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. You knew the prisoner; there was no pretence for any body to say, that he was a thief-A. Nobody said he was. I saw them the whole time that they were fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. If, at the commencement of the battle, he had a knife in his hand, you would have noticed it-A. No; I should not have noticed, whether he was striking or cutting.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18161204-93-person746">Q. </persName>
            After the first round Levy sprang up-A. Yes; and as soon as both were up they began fighting; there was no time for any complaint; if he had been cut, I suppose, he would have desisted. They were down, the second time, about half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Half a minute was a sufficient time for a man to draw a knife from his pocket - A. I should suppose so; I did not see him do it.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, then, that the thing was impossible to be done-A. No; I do not mean to say so.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not see, that the prisoner took any thing from his pocket, from first to last-A. I am certain I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was possible for him to do it when he was fighting - A. I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for him to have done it when he was on the ground the first time-A. I do not think it was possible.</p>
               <p>Q. The second time - A. It was not impossible, but I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for the prisoner, during the time they were on the ground the second time, to have cut the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040046"/>deceased in more places than one - A. He might have done it, and I not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. There was time enough while he was on the ground to have got the knife out of his pocket, and cut him - A. There was time; but I should think he could not have got it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18161204-93-person747">Q. </persName>
            This might depend on the pocket it was in - A. It might, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. You think it improbable, but not impossible - A. Not impossible.</p>

            . I was at the Cart and Horse public-house on the 9th of November; I have known the prisoner five or six years He came in about a quarter before twelve o'clock; I did not know that he was coming; he appeared intoxicated. I was of the same party as Levy. When the prisoner came in, he joined the party at our table, and said, who will play for 5l. A person of the name of Ingram pointed Hollier out; they agreed to play, and I lent the prisoner a shilling; he was, at that time, perfectly in good humour. The cards were produced, but the landlady insisted that there should be no playing at so late an hour. The prisoner would still keep challenging the company to play for 5l.; he addressed no one in particular, that I saw; there was a wrangle between the prisoner and the deceased, I was at the same table with them. I heard the deceased say, what is the use of playing you for 5l. you have not got a shilling about you. There were some expressions used by the prisoner, but I cannot say what they were; after that, the deceasad said, ring the bell for the landlady to bring a pail and mop, to mop his foul-mouth out. Then the prisoner said, I will cut your bl-dy head in two, taking up the pint pot at the same time. The landlady came in, or was in, and she took the pot out of his hand, and insisted on their not fighting there, and did all she could to turn the prisoner out, but she could not. The prisoner returned to Levy; I do not know what he said. It was the wish of the prisoner to fight - They agreed to go out and fight; the deceased went out first; I detained the prisoner at the parlour-door, and said, "Bill do not fight, for you are in the wrong, he gave you no particular offence, why should you fight?" He said, d-n me, I will fight. I then let him go; I went first, and he followed behind me. I stood to see what followed. When I got out the prisoner got before me, and stood before me. I heard the deceased say, I will not fight here - I will go upon the turf. The prisoner answered, d-n you, you shall have it here; and immediately set to. They fought, and the prisoner closed with the deceased in the first round. I saw the deceased fall, but did not see the prisoner fall. They had a second round, and were closed all the time. The whole of the rounds did not exceed two minutes and a half. They fell the second time-the prisoner was undermost. I assisted the prisoner in getting up, and placed him against a wall, my attention was chiefly directed towards him; I do not know whether he was bleeding at the time. Levy was against the door of a green-grocer; the witnesses were attending him - I assisted in carrying him to Mr. Taylor's, I observed him blecding very much, and there he died; I had left the prisoner at the corner of Sutton-street, I went back, and found him in the same place; his clothes were covered with blood. All the front of him, from his head to his boots, were all bloody. He was given in charge. Several persons examined the spot where they had been fighting, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Was the prisoner searched in your presence-A. He was; there was no instrument found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in the passage dissuading him from fighting, were you alone-A. No; there was somebody else, but I do not know who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out of the passage before him, did he follow directly - A. I stood on the step, and he got before me; it was all but going out together. I did not observe any thing in his hands at any time, nor did I see him take any thing out of his pocket. He had the appearance of being drunk; we persuaded him not to fight. I heard no complaint made by either after the first round; nobody went within a yard and a half of them. The deceased was shorter and stouter than the prisoner. When they fell I was on the prisoner's left side; his right-hand was out of my observation; I saw him at the watchhouse; he had a cut on his head, and his hair was discoloured with blood.</p>
               <p>Court. You was with him in the passage; can you tell whether he had, or had not, a knife in his hand -

               <p>Q. Do you know whether the cuff of his coat came over his hands - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. During the fight was there any body sufficiently near Levy to cut him - A. I believe not; I cannot answer that positively. I saw them all the time, and I do not recollect seeing any body sufficiently near.</p>
               <p>Q. From first to last, did you see the prisoner take any thing out of his pocket - A. I did not; I should think he could not do it without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that it was impossible he should - A. I do; for it must have taken up some time; I am possitively sure, that when they fell, the last time, there was nothing taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you so positive - A. The time was so short.</p>

               <p>GEORGE PAYNE. I am a jeweller; I was at the Cart and Horse, on the night of the 9th of November; the prisoner came there, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock. I was not with Levy's party; I was in the same room; when the prisoner came in, he was rather abusive, and appeared to be in liquor. I did not particularly notice his conduct; a quarrel arose between the deceased and the prisoner; I think it was about cards; somebody advised them to go out and fight; they went out; I followed them; I believe I went out with them; when I got out I was on the side of the deceased; he said, he would fight on the turf; I did not observe the prisoner in particular; I am not certain, but I think the prisoner was out first; I believe I went out after him. When I first saw the prisoner, after I had got out, I believe he was standing; when the deceased said, he would fight on the turf, the prisoner said, he would fight there, and commenced fighting; I do not know how they began to fight; I did not see the prisoner take any thing from his pocket.</p>

            Could it be done, while they were fighting, without your observing it-A. I think it could; I do not think they were together two minutes; they closed and fell, and got up, and fell again; the deceased got up and staggered towards the shop; he was all over blood; I did not observe the prisoner, my attention was directed to Levy; he articulated something, I do not know what; I went to Mr. Taylor's with him. I saw the prisoner at the watchhouse, his clothes were very bloody in front; I did not see them behind; his clothes were very much stained with blood, rather upwards; I did not observe any blood on his legs. He did not complain; I was a stranger to both of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Did you see the whole of the fight - A. I did; they both fell, and got up at the same time; they closed, and made no complaint; if he had been cut, he had an opportunity of saying so. I did not observe the blows; when the deceased got up, the second time, I saw blood upon him. I did not observe any blow after the first round; I had no opportunity of seeing.</p>
               <p>Q. Though the prisoner had not time to take a knife out of his pocket, had he not time to take it up in his hand, if it laid on the ground near him - A. I think it might be so.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw no knife in his hand, before they began fighting - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the contest do you think the prisoner might take up a knife-A. While they were on their legs.</p>

I am a watchman, in Goswell-street, close to Sutton-street; I knew the prisoner; on the night of the 9th of November, I found the prisoner, leaning against a post, at the corner of Sutton-street; I said, hallo! what do you do here? - he said, I have been used exceedingly ill; there were nobody by at the time. I said, who has used you ill; he said, nobody, but a set of rascals have cut and beat me. I asked him who they were; he said, he did not know. I lifted my lanthorn up to see if there was any body near. I saw he was bloody; I said, you are covered with blood and mud, and have no bat on; he said, I am cut all to pieces; I said, where; he said, I am cut over my head, and bruised all over; a man came up and said, here is your hat; the prisoner took it, and said, it is not my hat, take it again; I asked the man, whether he knew him; he said, no; another man came up with another hat; I took the hat from the man, and put it on the prisoner's head; the prisoner was given in charge; I took him to the watch-house; there was a great quantity of blood on the pavement, where he was standing; this was about twelve yards from the Cart and Horse.</p>

I have Levy's clothes also; his shirt is very bloody; the stockings, in particular, are bloody; the pantaloons, down to the shoes, are very bloody. There are about nineteen cuts or stabs in the coat, in different places; in the collar, back, and side; they appear to be done by some instrument; all the cuts appear to be done in the same way. (I produce both Levy's clothes and the prisoner's.) Levy's clothes have nineteen cuts in the coat; five in the waistcoat, and three in the pantaloons; there is also a cut in his neck-handkerchief; the cuts in the waistcoat and coat correspond.

I saw the prisoner there between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening; the prisoner was sitting down; he had a knife, which he took out of his pocket; when he had used it he shut it up, and put it into his right-hand breeches pocket. I cannot say what sort of a knife it was; I only saw the blade, it appeared to be about two inches and a half long, like mine (producing one).

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Goswell-street. On Saturday night, the 9th of November, the deceased Levy was brought to my house; he was in a dying state when he was brought in. About a quarter of an hour after his death, I examined his body; I first examined his head, and found a transverse cut, of about three inches in length, which must have been done by a sharp instrument; a knife would have done it. Between the mouth and the ear, on the left cheek, there was a crucial incision, which, I consider, had been done by an instrument. There were several more wounds on the chest and other parts of the body, in the bowels and on the hip;(I did not observe any on the neck) and on the upper part of his right thigh there was a wound of about three quarters of an inch in length, and about one inch, or one inch and a half, in width; on the other thigh there was another wound of about half an inch in depth, but merely muscular. I have no doubt but that the wound on the right thigh was the cause of his death; the main artery of the thigh, which we call the farmicular artery, was cut through, which, if not immediately stopped, death is certain. A man would bleed to death in a quarter of an hour from such a wound. His dress was so muddy that I did not take any notice of it. His right-hand was wounded between the thumb and fore-finger; they were cut through, and separated. It appeared to be done by a sharp instrument being drawn through the hand; all these wounds appeared to be fresh, and all to be given by the same instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Would such a knife as that produced have made these wounds-A. I should have thought it was rather narrower than that blade.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a man to be fighting, might he have gone on another round without knowing that he was wounded-A. I should think he might, providing the wound in the thigh was not given, or the other wounds, altogether eight of them, might have been given without a man's knowing it. If he was fighting, he might have gone on, they would not be felt at the time. It very often happens when a mortal wound is given that it is not felt at the time.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18161204-93-person761">Q. </persName>
            Would any of the wounds prevent articulation - A. The wound on the face would. I did not probe the head, as I thought it unnecessary.</p>
               <p>Court. The deceased could not have died from the breaking of a blood-vessel, or from apoplexy - A. He could not. The greatest depth of the wounds was an inch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. My feelings are so much hurt at this most dreadful calamity that has happened, that I cannot say any thing; I therefore leave it to the court.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in Crown-court, Cheapside, on Sunday night, the Ist of December, about half past ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner tying the things up in two or three aprons. I asked him what trade he was; he said, he was in the coach line, and that they were his own. I suffered him to bring them out of the court, and when he came to the corner of Queen-street I saw the watchman, and then took hold of the prisoner. He threw down the bundle, and made a blow at me, and got out of my grasp. The watchman, whose name is Taylor, ran after him, and secured him. I secured the bundle, and picked up some more tools which he left behind in his hurry to tie them up. When he was taken to the watch-house, he had some more tools in his pocket, and three old keys; the keys will not fit any part of the premises. I learned, the next day, that the tools belonged to Mr. Wilson. The prisoner said afterwards, that he was hired to carry them, by a person in St. Paul's Church Yard, for one shilling, to East Smithfield. They were claimed by the several persons who have seen them to day.</p>

I took one of them; he walked faster than me. As I was coming down Cheapside the watchman stopped me, and said, he suspected me. I threw them down, and endeavoured to escape.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday, the 4th of December last, Mrs. Cummins gave me information that there was some things at her house, at Dock-street, East Smithfield. I went and found three stocks, one saw, ten pieces of brass-edging, some plates, and centre bits, and one apron. I went and apprehended the prisoner, and found him at a public-house, in Rosemary-lane. I charged him with the robbery; he said, that the last prisoner had got over the place. I found six duplicates on him, of things belonging to the workmen.</p>

            . I was a sailor; I am now out of employ; I live with my father, in Queen-street, Chelsea. My father had sent me out, and I went past Mr. Nichols's house; I saw the prisoner, Sheen, and two others, Davis was one, standing opposite the door; I cannot speak as to the prisoner, Thompson. When I came back I saw them in the same place. I went home, and was sent out again; as I went past Nichols's, they were near the door; one was rather away from the other two; this was nearly ten minutes afterwards. I saw them again, rather further up the road. I went home, and had my tea, and went out again, and heard Mr. Nichols's house had been robbed. I told what I had seen. I saw the prisoner, Sheen, in custody, the same evening, and said, he was one; I also saw Davis, and said, he was one.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square Police-office; I took the prisoner Sheen, in New Pye-street, Westminster, between eight and nine o'clock on the Wednesday evening, Green was with me; I charged him with stealing the china; I had been informed of it by Nichols. Nichols had some boys with him to look for the prisoners, two of the witnesses were with him; soon afterwards I apprehended Davis. The prosecutor promised to forgive him, if he would say where the China was. I went, by his direction, to the house of Michael Carney, and found the prisoner,

            , there, Nichols was with me; it was a dog's-meat shop. I told her I came for the China which the boys had brought there that evening, and for which she had paid 3s.6d., the said, she had none. I said, I would see; she then said, some boys had left some there, but she had not bought it; and that they were to call again in the morning for it. I went into a back-room, with Mr. Nichols, and found the articles mentioned in the indictment there. Mr. Nichols claimed them. I gave them to him; and we took them, with the prisoner, Carney, to a public-house, where we had left David Davis, and some other boys. I took her into the room to see if she saw any of the boys, who had brought the China; she came out, and said, she did not. I took her to Bridewell, and sent for the prisoner, Sheen; she charged him with being the boy; she said, she could swear to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. You asked her for the China, which she had bought - A. No; I said, I had come for the China, which she had given 3s.6d. for; she said, she had none. The things were on her table. She said, that they wanted 10s. 6d. for them, and were to call again, in the morning, and bring the top of the jar.</p>
               <p>Q. When she saw the prisoner, Sheen, she knew him - A. She did. I did not suspect her before.</p>
               <p>EDWARD GREEN. I am an officer. I was with Bly; we were on different sides of the way, in Pye-street; Sheen, Thompson, and Davis had got to the top of Pye-street. I caught hold of Thompson and Davis. Sheen was behind us; one of the boys said it was Sheen. I let go Thompson, and caught hold of Sheen. He said, he knew nothing about it, and that he had got them from Paddington. I did not say any thing to him about the robbery. I searched him, and found a 1s.6d. token. and 6d. on him. When the prisoner, Carney, came, she said, it was some of the money she had given him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, THOMPSON. Will you swear, that you laid hold of me-A. I will; I left him with one of the boys, and he ran away. He was taken the next morning. I am sure it was him, that I laid hold of.</p>
               <p>JAMES BLY. I took the prisoner, Thompson, the next morning.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Sheen's Defence. I met a man, and he gave me a shilling to carry the things to Strutton-ground. He took them into the shop himself, and then came out and told me to come in, and say, that I belonged to him. I did; and the woman gave him 3s. 6d., and I was to eail for the 6d. in the morning, in part of my shilling. I was coming down Pye-street, and Green laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Thompson. I was in bed by six o'clock that night.</p>
               <p>Carney's Defence. I had no intention of buying them. I told the boy to call when my husband was at home.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL GREEN. I live in Church-lane, Wellclose-square. On the 30th of October, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I was going home; I had been drinking, but I had my senses; I met the prisoner, Sinclair, in White-chapel. I went to a house with her, which was in <placeName id="t18161204-108-crimeloc593">Rose and Crown-court</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18161204-108-crimeloc593" type="placeName" value="Rose and Crown-court"/>

I had my watch in the room with me;it is worth 2l.15s. I had the other things mentioned in the indictment, in my pocket; my watch was in my fob, in my small-clothes, which I put under the pillow. I went to sleep, and was awoke by the noise of a person coming into the room. I heard him walk up to the bed, and draw my small-clothes from under the pillow. I heard the voice of a man say, if he stirs, I will do for him. I was alarmed. The prisoner, Sinclair, was awake; she turned round. I waited until I heard persons about in the streets; I then asked her, for a light; she got up, and said, she had no matches; and then she said, she could not strike a light. She said, somebody must have been in the room. In about half an hour she got me a light. My watch and the other things were gone. I gave her in charge of the officer. The prisoner, Blues, was taken afterwards.</p>
               <p>CHRISTIAN MATHEWS. I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner, Blues, pledged this watch with me, on the 30th of October, for 25s., in his own name. I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL WILSON. I am a constable. The prosecutor gave the prisoner, Sinclair, into my custody. The door appeared to be broken open.</p>

            , is it he? I do not know him. I knew them all before. There was a great light. Warren told two of them to seize me, and they immediately seized me by the throat. They thrust me back into the shed; they took hold of my legs, and threw me into the lime. Two of them held me, and another cut off my breeches pockets, which had my money in them. They then went away; Curtis said, let us go back and kill him. I did not know him till he was apprehended. I then knew him to be the man who seized me. He told them to take out a knife, and take my head clean off. Another said, we will do it another way. They held me, and he beat and kicked me. I think they had been joined by some others while they were in the yard. I thought there were seven of them. I lost a great deal of blood; they tied my head with a handkerchief, and then left me. I begged of them to save my life. Mr. Cranch hallowed out of a window. Curtis said, I wish we had killed him; and Warren said, it did not signify if we had, for what he did to me. They then left me. I had also a protection box, and two tobacco boxes. I have seen the watch since at the Thames Police-office, about a fortnight ago, when Curtis was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoken of Curtis, Warren, and Dee, did any body else hurt you - A. Yes; the prisoner Gates was one of them. I am sure he is one of the men who robbed me; and the prisoner Baker was one also. I heard him say, when they were going away, "he does not know me, for I got in the dark; I do not think I saw him." I heard Warren say, he only knows two of us; they got over the wall, and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. You kept a great deal of money about you-A. I did. They went over the wall; I am sure there was six men; I did not lose my senses. I only knew Curtis by sight; he was dressed in a blue coat, light waistcoat, light breeches, and white handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were examined here, on Warren's trial, did you not say that you only knew him - A. I said, I should know two more. Curtis is the man who wanted to kill me.</p>

            Recollect yourself; did you not say, that if Warren(who has suffered) had not said, that Baker was there, you should not have known it-A. I worked with him for two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have found him at the time of the robbery if you chose - A. I could. I am sure it was Baker, by his voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is by the voice that you attempt to swear to Baker - A. No. I knew where to find him, but did not take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that they were all tall men - A. I did not say any such thing. I did not know Gates before.</p>

               <p>Q. What reason have you for swearing to him - A. He is one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, when you first saw Gates, that you could not swear to him - A. No. Mr. Goff asked me, and I said, he was not the man that tied me, as I thought it was another. Gates was taken up on the 20th of last month; I knew him as well as I knew Curtis; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see Curtis before Gates was taken-A. No. I saw him the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear to Gates before Curtis had said any thing to you - A. I did. I had talked with Curtis at the Police-Office.</p>
               <p>Court. Before you swore to Gates, did Curtis tell you he was one of them - A. I believe I did not hear him say so till afterwards. I saw Curtis at Union Hall.</p>

There were only five of us. We met at the Spread Eagle, and then went into the lime-yard, and saw Millard. Baker and myself got him down, and the others took his money. I did not see him struck more than twice. I do not know how much money there was; I was to have 16l. 8s. for my share, but I did not get it. It was left in the prisoner Gates hands, in order to employ a solicitor, if any of us were taken up. I got between 11l. and 12l.

I charged the prisoner with taking it, and he told me to search him. I followed him till he came to Little Earl-street, and seeing some people about, I gave the alarm, and he ran away; he was secured. I never lost sight of him, I am sure he is the man. I saw my handkerchief in his hand.</p>

               <p>JOHN HINDE. I am patrol of Hackney parish. On the 18th of November, about a quarter past eleven o'clock at night, I met the prisoner, Lowther, he had a green bag on his shoulders; I asked him what he had got, and he said, some pears, that he had brought from the country. I took him to the watch-house, he then said, they were given to him, and then that they came from Walthamstow; after he was locked-up, he said, he had them from Mr. Collins's gardener; he said, that he had met the gardener at the Queen's Head. I took him to Worship-street Police-Office, before Mr. Giffard.</p>

I have a house at Stamford-hill; the prisoner, Kellaway, was my gardener - He had the care of my tool-house; on the morning of the 19th of October, he asked leave to go out for an hour, which I gave him; I then came to town, and about twelve o'clock the same morning, he came to my office, in Spital-square, and told me, that a countryman of his had called, and he had given him a few pears, and that the patrol had stopped him; he wished me to write to the magistrate, to say, that I did not object to it; he said, he might have given him half a peck. I was sent for to the Police-Office directly after, the prisoner, Lowther, was at the bar, and Kellaway standing by him, the peas were produced, and I knew them to be mine. Kellaway said, he took them from the tool-house. The magistrate committed them both.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. The prisoner, Kellaway, had lived with me two years and a half.</p>
