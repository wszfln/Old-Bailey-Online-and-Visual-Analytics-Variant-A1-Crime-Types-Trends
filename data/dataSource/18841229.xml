                  </hi>. I am a builder, of 240, Graham Road, Mare Street Hackney—I was employed to fit up the premises of the International Fish Dinner Company in Barbican—for that purpose I went to the office of the Company, 7, Oxford Mansions—I went with a person named Chudleigh—before going I had received a letter from Cheshire—I had a conversation afterwards with Cheshire and Errington—I went to Oxford Mansions in consequence of the letter; I was introduced to Errington as the promoter of the Company, and who was likely to withdraw as soon, as it was done—it was through him I got the job—I saw Cheshire with Errington at the office—the offices had not been fitted up in Oxford Mansions when I saw him; I spoke to Errington with regard to them, and gave an estimate—I agreed to do it for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as near as I remember, there were extras done afterwards—I was to be paid directly the work was done—while doing this work at the office Errington spoke to me about Barbican; he asked me to give an estimate, and said if I would remunerate him he would get me the work—at that time I had not not seen Hughlings—I was introduced to him some time after I had fitted up the greater part of the Barbican place—I gave this estimate (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) for fitting up the Barbican place, it comes to 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is signed "H. Hughlings, Manager and Secretary, International Fish Dinner Company"—I was given to understand Cheshire was only secretary for the time being, that Hughlings was to be secretary and I asked for his signature to be on it—after that I saw and was introduced to Hughlings—the estimate was given to me already signed—this also has Cheshire's signature on it, by my request—I was to be paid for the Barbican job by a bill for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when part of the work was done, and I was to have a bill for the rest when the work was done—the bill for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was at one month, and the bill for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at two months, that was without extras—I commenced the work at Barbican—I saw Hughlings, Cheshire, and Pope there, and one of the witnesses acting as a clerk—I saw Pope more than once—I supposed he called as a friend—in doing the work I had to do more than was in the estimate—by Hughling's authority I supplied fish kettles and other things, he giving me to under<lb/>stand if there was extra work I might as well have it—on 26th August I got this letter from Errington.

(<hi rend="italic">This stated that he (Pryor) had mentioned the bill to his client, who consented to do it, requesting the bill to be sent.</hi>) I had not left the bill—I went to Parliament Street and gave Pryor the bill, and he gave me this receipt for it, signed "Barnard and Co."—I next saw Pryor at his office; I went there with a view of getting the money—I saw the clerk first; I waited some time before I saw Pryor—he gave me a cheque, I believe, on that occasion of a man named Benham for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me to understand as his reason for not giving me more, that his client had called and only left 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said I could have the balance during the week—I passed the cheque through the London and County Bank—I believe it was a cheque on the Grosvenor Bank—it came back marked "Refer to drawer"—when it came back I saw Hughlings, and by Errington's instructions he took me down to Parliament Street—Errington was present at Barbican when I spoke to Hughlings—when we got to Pryor's office Hughlings went in first and saw Pryor; a few minutes after I was called in, and Pryor said to Hughlings "You had better go round to the bank with him"—Hughlings went with me to the Grosvenor Bank—Hughlings there spoke to a gentleman who came out of the office—I was given to understand he was the manager—I don't identify him—he advised me and Hughlings to pass it through the bank again—I did, and it was paid—afterwards I got from Pryor money which with the 10<hi rend="italic">.</hi> made up 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he deducted 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the introduction to Benham—the three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheques were on the Grosvenor Bank, drawn by Benham—I never got the balance for fitting up the Barbican premises—I sent in the bill for 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had one bill for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is still owing on the assump<lb/>tion that I had been paid the 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through Pryor, and two or three 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheques—54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is what I say is still owing;—I took shares in the International—the understanding was if I got the job I should take 25 shares—I took two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shares in consideration for the cash I got for the Oxford Mansions job—I gave notice to the Fish Company that they were not to meet the 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, as I had not received the money for it—afterwards a, writ was issued against me by Mr. Benham—I then went to see Pryor at his office; he was not there—I walked down, and found him coming out of the Grosvenor Bank—that was soon after the bill had become due; when they issued the writ—I told Pryor Benham had issued a writ against me, and I gave him to understand that I had not had the money, and I did not intend leaving him till I did have it—I followed him to two or three houses, and up to his office—I said "Well, you can't</p>

If passing on Monday will you look me up?"—the Barbican place was not shut up then—the last time I had been there was when I saw Cheshire and Pryor's clerk there, with the fittings gone—the place was just open and that was all—I never saw Cheshire after I saw him at Barbican—when I got that letter I think I missed going, and he wrote me another—I saw him; he told me he was going to start the London Fish Dinner Company, and he wanted me to give a price for the fitting up—he wanted to do me a kindness in con<lb/>sideration of what I had lost at Barbican—he said Madam Potter intended to invest 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I need not be afraid of getting my money—he said it was entirely in his own hands, and he said "I have got none of that gang here now; Cheshire is not in it, nor Hughlings; I suppose you know where Pope is"—I said "No"—he said "That's where he is," and gave me his address at the House Distribution Society—I gave him a price for the job, and he gave me to understand that if I did the job he could put me into a good thing in the Isle of Wight Sanatorium—he asked me to be as lenient as possible, as he did not want to draw on Madam Potter till the thing was started; after that the money would be all right—on 13th March I received a letter from him asking for an estimate, and on 22nd March I had this.

                  </hi>. I am single—in September or October last year I was with Hughlings and Errington at 7, Oxford Mansions—Hughlings was described to me as the secretary of the International Fish Dinner Company, and Errington as the promoter of the Company—I saw Cheshire there afterwards—I was taken there to speak about the appointment as manageress for the New Kent Road branch—they said I should have to take shares to gain the appointment, both Hughlings and Errington said so—I said, "How many shall I have to take? I don't understand anything about companies; about five?"—they smiled and said, "Oh no, the waitresses would take five shares, and Mrs. Thomas, who was managing Barbican, had taken 100 or 150,"I don't know which—I said, "Then I will take a hundred"—I was to receive 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and apart<lb/>ments on the premises, two rooms on the first floor, and everything was to be found—I paid 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the shares—I have an aunt; I did not know that she had taken shares—she knew about the appointment I had taken afterwards—I forget the date of my appointment, but it was the same day that I paid the money; I have the receipt—I paid the money at Oxford Mansions—this is my aunt's writing, and this is mine. (<hi rend="italic">Referring to a book</hi>)—I signed this application for 100 shares about 19th November (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was in Oxford Mansions when I paid for the shares—Mr. Errington took the money, 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and paid it to Mr. Hughlings—I gave the receipt to Mr. Brown, the solicitor—I went to New Kent Road about a fortnight afterwards—it was a large place downstairs, occupied by Mr. Errington and his family—Mr. Welch, the builder, was putting in the fittings—a room was allotted to me to sleep in—I was there two or three weeks before it was opened, and Mr. Hughlings said that the gas could not be put on, as the gas company wanted too much deposit for the meter; he had given 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they wanted more—in consequence of the delay I went to 7, Oxford Mansions, and saw Mr. Riddell, the chair<lb/>man, and Messrs. Austin, Overend, McKinlay, Coates, Hughlings, Erring<lb/>ton, and Cheshire, and asked how long it would be before I could enter on my duties—they said that they should be able to open in a few days, but it did not matter to me, because my salary had commenced and I was not losing anything—I bought things and furnished my room—two waitresses were engaged, but I had nothing to do with engaging them—I frequently spoke to Errington; he said that the place not being open had nothing to do with him, he could not help it; he was living in the house, but he was not supposed to be there—he said that they could not find the money to get the gas put on, and there was no money to start it with—in a few days I saw the chairman there, and I said that it was a very great shame—he said that he was very sorry, it was not his fault, but Mr. Riddell's—the first evening I was there Errington asked me to give him change for a cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as it was Saturday and the bank was closed—I saw it was one of the Company's cheques, and he said that I could have the money in the week—I gave him the two guineas, and never got them back—when I had been there a week Mr. Errington said that there had been a sale at the Barbican premises the day before, and everything was sold, and some of them were very well sold; he said that Mr. Pryor had taken it—I said "Had I known it I would have been there"—Errington said that the Sheriff was put in for rent, and of course he had the sale—I told the chairman in Errington's presence, as the engagement had fallen through, and I had taken shares on the faith of gaining the</p>

               <p>appointment, I ought to have my money returned to me—he said of course I ought to have it, but it was impossible, there was no money to pay it with, and he did not know how the affairs were standing—I said that it was his place to know; he said they never could get the bank book—I told him they had meetings, and they ought to know how the affairs were going on—I went in one evening, and Mr. Austin, one of the directors, had been there and taken the linen away—Errington said that he did not know who had my money, he never had any of it, it was used amongst them, and went to pay for different things, and he said "You must ask Mr. Hughlings, he knows all about it, some of it went to pay expenses"—I said "I think you are all one as bad as the other"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I asked him about my aunt's money, who paid the same as I did, and said "You ought to have done some good with it, you ought to have opened this place"—he said "It went to pay for things at Barbican"—he used to say that he could not make Mr. Hughlings out—some of the cooking utensils were sent back, and Mr. Weekes took the tables away before Christmas, 1883—besides the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I gave Hughlings money for his wife's sake when they were really wanting anything—some time afterwards Hughlings said that they were going to start another company, and asked me why I did not take the Kent Road place myself, it would be a very good thing if I did, and the builder asked me if I would take it off his hands and pay him for the fittings as I could—I refused—he said "The new Company will be very different from the last, we shall have no Hughlings, no Pope, no Cheshire, it will be a straightforward thing, and you had better take an appointment in it, and that will be the means of your getting some of your money back," and that they had taken premises in the Strand—I was introduced that time to Mr. Broad, a solicitor—he said that the best thing I could do was to wind the Company up—I said "I have nothing to do with it"—he said "You can do it because you are a shareholder and a creditor, if you go and see Mr. Broad we will see what we can do for you"—I went, and a liquidator was appointed—Errington went with me and acquiesced in the International being wound up—the new Company was started, and I said "That is why you wanted to wind up the old Company, you could not start a new Company till it was done"—the gas fittings were taken from the Kent Road to the Strand, which was not fitted up when I went there, they were making arrangements with different builders to take a contract—after I went there the first three trans<lb/>actions were with Major-General Wolfe, Mr. Traher, and Mr. Cordery—Mr. Errington or Mr. West gave me a cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I would not change it myself, but said I would see if I could get change—I did not, and Mr. Errington sent some one to ask me to come back, and I gave the cheque back—he said "I would rather it should not go into any one's hands but <hi rend="italic">hers</hi>"—275, Strand, was opened for business in April or May—I lent Mr. Errington 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that, two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that the secretary would pay me back 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week from the takings of the business till it was paid—before the place was opened Errington gave me this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said that the money was on his own account, it had nothing to do with the Company—it is dated March 8th; that was about the time—he said that he had an account at the Birkbeck Bank—I never got the money back or any of the takings—after that I advanced 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to</p>

I am a publisher at 58, Crayford-Road, Holloway—at the end of August, 1883, a friend of mine, Mr. Selman, gave me a prospectus, and introduced me to Hughlings with a view to my taking shares in the International Fish Dinner Company—Hughlings said it promised to be a very good thing, and he would advise me to take a few shares according to how I felt disposed—I said I thought I would do so—Hughlings said it would probably pay 10 per cent, in January—I agreed to take 50 shares, and drew a cheque for 50 shares at the rate of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a share—at a subsequent meeting Hughlings told me they were in want of another director, and that if I took 150 more shares I should be appointed, and that there was a fortnightly fee of two guineas for directors' meetings—in January I took the extra shares, about 275 altogether, 200 for myself and 75 for my brother, and paid altogether 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after taking my first lot of shares I went to the Barbican—the business appeared to be going on in a very flourishing way as far as I could see; afterwards I went and found bills in the window stating that the fixtures were to be sold, and that the business was in liquidation—I saw Errington, Cheshire, McKin<lb/>lay, and Hughlings at the Barbican—I don't remember Pryor or Pope there—after I saw the advertisement in the window I went to the Com<lb/>pany's office, 7, Oxford Mansions, and met two other directors at a Board meeting—Riddell, Overend, and McKinlay were there—I forget the other names—I and my solicitor had an interview with Hughlings soon after the Barbican was closed—he wanted me to advance 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on deben<lb/>ture bonds to save the Company—my solicitor objected, and I did not—I attended no meeting as a director till after the Company had collapsed—that would be about 18th December—shortly before Hughlings was arrested I met him in the Strand with Mr. Titcomb, to whom he intro<lb/>duced me as the manager of the City and Suburban Bank—Hughlings pulled out a prospectus of the City and Suburban Bank, which he was about to float, with the address altered to 97, Leadenhall Street, and asked me if I would take some shares in it—I said I had had enough of shares. (<hi rend="italic">The prospectus stated that the capital was</hi> 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in</hi> 50,000 <hi rend="italic">shares of</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">each,</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to be paid on application,</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on allotment, and the remainder</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a share on a call, there being no liability beyond the amount unpaid on a share, and that the directors were Captain Fish, Messrs. Pharsnage, Healey, and Andrew Heard; C. Titcomb being general manager and secretary.</hi>) I declined to have anything to do with it—I asked Hughlings what had become of the Fish Dinner Company—he said they were trying to put it straight—I asked him by what means—he shifted it off somehow, and said they were trying to tide it over, but gave me no satisfactory answer—I next saw him in custody.</p>

Hughlings asked me to take 200 debentures to save the Company; he made no secret of its state—I went once to the office at Oxford Mansions; I there saw letters, books, and all the usual things I should expect to see where a genuine business is being carried on—I saw people dining at the Barbican the three times I went, and once I dined there myself—it was open two or three months, I think—I think I gave Hughlings one cheque—I was led to suppose he had the orders of the directors in what he was negotiating with me.</p>

I am an architect and surveyor, of Argyle Street, Regent Street—I saw an advertisement in a paper with regard to the International Fish Dinner Company, and applied for 100 shares on 12th October—this is my application—after I had taken some shares Hugh<lb/>lings came to my office, and said they would probably want some surveys made for them if I would do them, and if I would take some more shares; that they were doing a good business at the Barbican—on one occasion, I won't say if on this, he said they proposed to pay an interim dividend—I never heard how much that was to be—I made one or two surveys for them—I looked at the Barbican after it was open—I parted with 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether on shares—I was not called on as a contributory to pay any more—I was let off 5 per cent, by paying for my shares in full—I should have done so in any case, I think—I lost the 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never sent in my claim for making the surveys, and have not been paid for them—I received letters from time to time from the Company.

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Hospital Saturday Fund—I had a prospectus of the International Fish Dinner Company—before I applied for shares Hughlings called at my office, 5, Mitre-Court, Temple, and said he had called upon me as he understood I was likely to take a few shares in this Company, and he wished me to take sufficient, 200, I think, to qualify for a seat on the Board—he showed me several circulars relating to the proposed Company, and among others Mr. Coates certified that the Company had been in existence and working at Barbican for some time previously, and that a profit of not less than 7 per cent, had actually been made by the working—the figures on the circular show a profit—it was a printed statement by the auditor which Hughlings showed me—he spoke as if there was no doubt of there being a considerable profit later on—I might have seen this circular between the time of paying my first and second cheque—I wrote this first cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 28th September, at the same time as my application; it has come back through my bankers endorsed "International Fish Dinner Company, Cheshire Hon. Sec."—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my second cheque—I believe Hughlings gave me back a receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the same time that I wrote out the application, on 28th September.

(<hi rend="italic">The cheque was endorsed and the receipt signed by H.

I live at 266, Walworth Road, and am a traveller in the fruit and potato trade—on 27th July, 1883, I saw Errington and Cheshire at Oxford Mansions upon my application to become manager of the International Fish Dinner Company—Errington asked me what my qualifications were—I told him, and he seemed satisfied; in fact, he told me that I was the right man in the right place, supposing my application was entertained—I had to see him again; I saw him on various occasions—I had to send in references, which were accepted, and I was then sent out to different tradesmen to get estimates for all necessaries for the conducting of a large business, and I was to endeavour to induce them to take shares; I had also to go and look after premises, and all matters of that description—I saw a large number of trades people in reference to these estimates; only one applied, Mr. Staines, a baker in Aldgate; the others did not; the potato people in particular were very reticent—I asked 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, but Errington said he thought that would be too much to commence with, and it was arranged that I was to have 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and so much for each branch that was opened, because I was to undertake the entire management of the affair—I never was manager, you may call it "messing about," that was all—I was at the unfortunate dinner when Mr. Errington got me kicked out—I was to take shares in order to qualify, 25 to begin with, but those I never took up because I did not find the money fortunately for paying the deposits, and another arrangement was entered into between myself, Errington, and Cheshire, by which I was to take 50 shares, which was to be deducted from my salary in the event of my remaining—I was paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a week after the opening dinner—I put in a claim, which was admitted, for about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a bottle of champagne was the cause of my leaving—Errington offered me a half-sovereign or something to get a cheque changed; what it was or whose it was I do not know—I was to get it changed anywhere I could—I put it in my pocket, took a little stroll, and came back again—I was supposed to have friends in Bond Street who would probably change it—a great many people came to the place in answer to advertisements, females especially—I was at Barbican when what was called the Press dinner took place—the only party connected with the Press that I saw there was a party I have seen on a waggon on Clerkenwell Green.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Paignton Lodge, Alexandra Road, St. John's Wood—early in July, 1883, Errington, who I had pre<lb/>viously slightly known, called on me and called my attention to a pro<lb/>jected company, the International Fish Dinner Company, Limited—he produced a prospectus with the names of Mr. Overend, Mr. McKinlay, and Mr. Chichester, who he said was the eldest son of Sir Arthur Chichester, of Yuleston, North Devon—I knew something of the Chichester family, and I think that operated with me as an inducement to join the directorate—he also told me that Mr. Overend was a barrister of the northern circuit, and Mr. McKinlay was a wealthy and respectable merchant in the City—on those representations I consented to become a director, but not till after some hesitation and long conversation with Errington, who explained to me the <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> of the intended Company—it was sub<lb/>stantially the same as in the prospectus, but I told him I thought it promised too much, and was being carried out with a very limited capital—I paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a share upon twenty-five shares, I think—this is my application for twenty-five shares, dated July 19th—I afterwards had the allotment and paid the money—my first interview with Errington was on 10th July—I paid the money to the secretary, Cheshire, and he had orders to pay it in to the bank, whether he did so or not I do not know—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the minute book of the Company—the 21st July was the first meeting I attended—Errington afterwards showed me a letter from Mr. Chichester, who was then in Ireland, saying he could not attend; the consequence was his name was struck off the prospectus—I also attended a meeting on 4th August, Errington and Cheshire were present and I was elected chairman of the Company—there is an entry "The Company's solicitor reported that the agreement between the Com<lb/>pany and the founder had been duly deposited at Somerset House"—the "founder" was Errington—there is this further entry "A letter was read from Mr. Pope offering to underwrite a certain number of shares. Re<lb/>solved, that Mr. Pope's proposition be accepted"—the solicitor was in<lb/>structed to take the premises at Barbican on that day (4th August) at 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Mr. McKinlay, Mr. Overend, and Cheshire were present at that meeting—on 4th September, the next meeting, I was present—Errington and the honorary secretary were there, and Hughlings's ap<lb/>pointment as manager at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum was confirmed—I do not know that Errington said he had appointed him; the entries are not always very correct, still I did not cavil with them, I signed them as correct as near be—Errington introduced Hughlings as a man quite competent to undertake the management, and after a long conversation with him he was appointed—the 11th September was the next meeting, and the statutory meeting of the Company was ordered for Tuesday, 2nd October—there is this entry: "The secretary reported the progress made at Barbican, and was instructed to have the premises opened, if possible,</p>

               <p>for dinners on 3rd September"—the Press dinner for Saturday, 16th, was spoken of; I do not think there was any regular resolution passed with reference to it—I was present at the meeting on 17th September; the founder Errington, and Hughlings the secretary were there—the secretary reported that the premises were opened on the 13th, on which day 120 dinners were served, the following day 253—the inaugural dinner took place on Saturday the 15th, and proved a great success. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>

Spalding and Tucker, were willing to advance suffi<lb/>cient money to relieve the Company from its present difficulty—those two gentlemen were to be written to requesting their attendance at the next meeting—it was stated that the manager had made arrangements to keep the premises open, but the directors resolved that 67, Barbican, he closed until further orders—Hughlings was then the manager of those premises—I do not think he told us about letting in Pryor—I had asked in vain at a recent Board to see the pass-book of the Company, but it was kept from me by Hughlings—at one time he said it was at the bank, and had not been made up, at another time Cheshire had locked it up, and had left the office—there were all kinds of excuses; therefore I did not know what amount we had at the bank—it struck me that about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid in in December; there ought to have been a very good balance, otherwise we would never have entered into the agreements to take Fleet Street and other places—I don't think I ever saw the banking account since the end of September—the first thing at every Board meeting which the directors did was to see the financial position—that is what they ought to have done, and what I always insisted on doing, but what I call phantom excuses were made, and we could not see it—I know nothing about the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill; it was not given with the sanction of the Board—on 15th December, 1883, Messrs. Broad and Broad were appointed to nominate an accountant to investigate the affairs of the Company in conjunction with Mr. Coates—the first time I knew Pryor had got possession of the place was in December, 1883—we had given no authority to anybody to take possession—the lease was signed by us; no deposit was paid—I was told by Errington and Hughlings and Cheshire that the profits were about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I had only their word for it—that was over and above all expenses, except rent and taxes—we were continually asking Hughlings to give us some state<lb/>ment of accounts—I wanted to know what the actual takings were, and what the actual expenses were, and how they had been met, but I could never get any account whatever from Hughlings—there was a takings book; that is, Miss Gordon who took the money kept a book; all the money taken was paid to her—Thomas was the manager, but Miss Gordon sat in the box to take the money from those who entered—she was cashier—I think there were four waitresses besides—I never saw the cash-book—Hughlings never supplied me with the account—I never saw a letter of his setting out on one side the cash receipts and on the other side the expense of carrying on the trade at 67, Barbican—Errington told me he</p>

               <p>could sell the business for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I chose—I think he told me that after the general meeting in October—the taking of the premises at 61, New Kent Road was suggested both by Hughlings and Errington—I forget what the rent was—I think Mr. Sorman had commenced an action against the Company at the time of the statutory meeting—Mr. Henry was the solicitor of the Company—he served the Company with two writs; one from Sorman, and the other from a Mrs. Vaughan, who had been engaged by Errington, but who had not been appointed—those two actions were brought by the solicitor to the Company himself, and we thought it such unprofessional conduct that we asked him to send in his resignation—Mr. Gibson succeeded him—Mr. Henry, the director, was brother to the solicitor—Mr. Henry stands very high in the City as an accountant, and he was very much dissatisfied with the way in which the books were kept—I remember the New Kent Road matter, and the bill of sale to Coates—I don't know by whom that was suggested; I suppose by Hughlings—he was present when it was discussed at the Board—I am unable to say what the suggestion was—I find this resolution on 24th November: "That Mr. Gibson be instructed to prepare a bill of sale on the plant at 61, New Kent Road"—it must have been to Coates; it does not say so here—I paid very little attention to the Kent Road affair—I always set my face against its being opened at all, but I was overruled—I did not think the situation an eligible one—I went to see the premises—I knew nothing at the time of an advance made by Coates in reference to the bill of sale—I was informed of it afterwards—I do not know what the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was for; it was never ordered by the Board—I never saw Pryor with regard to a bill for 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never saw Pryor in my life till I saw him at Southwark Police-court—I don't know that I saw Errington about the bill, he had nothing to do with it; he told me that Pryor had been hawking the bill about at several public-houses, and that he said he had got Riddell's name to it now, and if he did not pay it he would make him a bankrupt—the Board had an intimation that eight or nine cheques had been issued by Hughlings without the knowledge of the Board to various persons, and that those cheques had been returned dishonoured—I was very much disgusted when I heard of it, and I proposed a resolution upon it on 24th Novem<lb/>ber, 1883, which was carried—I spoke to Hughlings about it afterwards, and I think he said they were for pressing claims, or something of that sort—there were two directors on the Board who were friends of Erring<lb/>ton's Mr. Overend and Mr. McKinlay, and they signed all those surrepti<lb/>tious cheques without the knowledge of the other directors—I remon<lb/>strated with Mr. Overend about it privately, and he said he was very sorry for it—I received this letter of 31st January, 1884, signed "W. Allen," and wrote this answer. (<hi rend="italic">Inspector Marshall proved finding certain papers at Pryor's place</hi>, 14, <hi rend="italic">Parliament Street, which he handed to Mr. Musket, clerk to Messrs.

               <p>the International Fish Dinner Company—we were informed by Hugh<lb/>lings, I think, that you had made that offer—I had never seen you at that time—I don't know whether you did place any shares—at the statu<lb/>tory meeting it was first proposed that the directors should be elected collectively; you proposed that they should be elected separately, which was carried—I presume you were the Mr. Pope who had the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill; it was given to you without the knowledge of the Board—I don't know what became of it, whether it was ever presented or not—I never knew you to have any official connection with the Company.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WARBURTON</hi>. I think I was in the chair at every meeting I attended; I don't think we held more than about two dozen meetings altogether—I have been director on several companies, perhaps eight or ten, and chairman on four, I think—I was a barrister, but I left the profession in 1838—I was a person of considerable means, but I am not now—I had 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I am a man of some means still—some of our meetings were very long, some not; they were conducted very regularly when I was in the chair—I did not know Mr. Overend or Mr. McKinlay before—I am sorry to say that those two gentlemen gave Hughlings authority for these cheques—it is a question whether they had authority to sign them—I think I must take that view of it, if a case were very pressing—whether these were pressing cases is more than I can tell—it is the rule in most companies to authorise payment upon the signatures of two directors, countersigned by the secretary; but the secretary ought to report it to the Board at the next meeting—he did not do so—all the cheques that were returned dishonoured we knew nothing about—I have dined at the Barbican premises two or three times—I went once only before the premises were opened; afterwards I went there and took lunch; I did not pay for it—I saw a good many persons dining there, and a regular business carried on—I think 253 were dining there on the second day—I was told that the Sheriff seized some of the takings—the cheque-book was not at every Board meeting; I swear that—I never saw it at all except when I signed cheques in it; it may have been in Hughlings's pocket—I did not know that Mr. Henry's brother was suing the Company; he was employed as solicitor for persons, and issued writs against the Company for them, but he was not suing the Company on his own account—Hughlings appeared to me to do all he could to further the Company: I believe he was more at Barbican than at the office; I don't know what he did there—I signed a good many cheques at the Board—Cheshire was the first secretary; Hughlings was elected at the second meeting, on 4th September—he was introduced by Erring<lb/>ton—I asked him if he had any credentials, he said he had, but they were not produced—I did not see them—I was not connected with the London Fish Dinner Company; the International was the only company in which I was connected with these people—I never drew a farthing at the meetings; I was not anxious to get money, I knew what the financial position of the Company was—we knew that the fish dinners at the Health Exhibition were a great success, and Errington said he thought it would be equally a success if it was established in London instead of Kensing<lb/>ton, and I thought it would turn out well.</p>

               <p>nothing further to do with it afterwards I believe—before taking shares in the Company I had a long conversation with Errington—I thought him a very respectable man; he appeared to me to be a thorough man of business—I saw the prospectus and knew that he would act as promoter of the Company by agreement—he superintended the fitting-up of the first dining-room-practically his connection with the Company ceased when business commenced—there was a general agreement between him and the Company, which was filed at Somerset House—I have a copy here—he was to have a percentage on the capital—his interests would be best served by the success of the Company, and not by its failure—certain moneys were due to him from time to time under that agreement—he received several cheques—I think he was rather overpaid than otherwise—he claimed 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a share on 1,700 odd shares; he did not get it—I don't know how much he got altogether; I don't think he got 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because the agreement states that he should not be entitled to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a share till the allotment money was paid—a good many of the appli<lb/>cations were mere bogus ones; they were repudiated by the parties whose names were given—the banker's book will show you how many shares were actually paid up—before the meeting of the 21st the agreement was taken from the office, and when he sent in his account it was not satis<lb/>factory till the agreement was produced—we asked Errington to let us see it, and postponed the meeting till the next week—I knew that the agreement was filed at Somerset House, and we instructed Hughlings to get a certified copy—Mr. Henry, who had been solicitor to the Com<lb/>pany, got it for us, and I handed it to Mr. Wontner—I became chairman of the directors of the Company—it is for the officers of the Company to see that the resolutions of the Board are carried out, the directors are not bound to see that for themselves—I never asked Errington to give me a statement of the financial position of the Company, it was not his business to do that—the first thing we did after the minutes were read was to ask the secretary to produce the pass-book—I never saw the cheques signed to Overend and McKinlay till the Official Liquidator showed me the book with the cheques pasted in—I did not see the payees' names, and if I had I should not have been a bit the wiser—I never heard that two directors called every morning to sign a cheque for Billingsgate for with, nor have I the slightest knowledge what the cheques were for—I never saw the cheque-book or the pass-book during the last three months—Mr. Gordon kept a book—I do not know what has become of it, it may be in the Official Liquidator's possession—for a very considerable time after I joined the Company I thought it was likely to succeed, there was nothing on the face of it which made success unlikely—I believed its objects to be legitimate and likely to be remunerative—the prospectus was printed the first time I saw it; three Directors' names were printed, and I was asked to be the fourth—I believe the auditor examined the accounts once or twice a week; that was his own suggestion—he had no authority to inquire how the money was appropriated, or to disallow any payment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Pryor.</hi> I was not influenced by you to take shares in the Company; I never saw you till I saw you at the police-court—the first intimation I had of proceedings was the Sheriff taking possession in November—Messrs.

               <p>for the Fleet Street premises, and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for the lease to get in—the purchase money was 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I had an interview with the actual lessees, Messrs. Evans and Dudley, of Basinghall Street, who offered me the premises for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., instead of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which they wanted from the Company, but I declined—a Mr. Russell Crow was to discount a bill for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he returned it—I endorsed it, but never accepted it—I think Mr. Hugh<lb/>lings accepted it privately, not in the name of the Company—it was drawn to pay 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the Fleet Street lessons—here are two minutes in the book respecting it; one is, "The secretary reported that he had put it into Mr. Crow's hands, and could not get it discounted, and he was ordered to keep it"—afterwards, when we found he had parted with it to Walford on 13th December, here is "Resolved that the bill for 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the bill for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., given without the sanction of the Board, be both delivered up to the Board before the next meeting"—we paid the first quarter's rent in advance at Barbican, I believe—I think we took the premises on September 1st, and the Sheriff sold the property on December 13th—he was not in possession for rent, but to satisfy a debt—I will not pledge my oath that the landlord was not in possession too—I knew nothing of what was going on—we paid a half-quarter's rent in advance on 29th September, and 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. may have been due—Mr. Errington explained an arrangement which he had entered into with a person named Walford—that is not entered in the minute book, you will find it in the agenda. (<hi rend="italic">Reading it</hi>)—the bill has never been negotiated, nothing was ever paid. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner here called for the agreement, which Mr. Besley handed to him</hi>)—Mr. Hughlings had no authority to enter into such an agreement; all agreements must pass the Company and have the Company's seal—he should have called a special Board and laid the matter before the directors, but he did not do so till after he had entered into that stupid agreement—it was done in defiance of the express orders of the Board—I do not lay any blame upon you—my idea was to close the place in the winter and open it again in the spring—the landlord may have seized the things in consequence of our repudiation, but I was kept in ignorance of what was going on—I did not pay the quarter's rent due on December 25th; I suppose the landlord paid himself by distrain<lb/>ing, but I know nothing about it—we ordered the premises to be closed on 18th December, and I fancied they were closed—I don't think we authorised a second cheque for the quarter's rent to the landlord—if the 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill had been presented at the Company's bankers there were no funds to pay it; it was a mere expedient to raise money—we repudiated our responsibility with reference to the bill after Hughlings, had parted with it—I did not say at our last meeting that' the Company must indemnify me—you have the minute in evidence already to which you are referring—the landlord did not distrain for his rent till 6th January—a man was not in possession in Oxford Mansions, but I think we met in Fleet Street in order to meet Mr. Farmer, the solicitor, and other persons respecting the taking the premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I never saw this agreement till it was put before me by Pryor before the Magistate, nor did I see any copy before the Board—it is dated December 13th, and signed by Hughlings—we had at that time forbidden Hughlings to part with the 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill—I am reading from a copy of the agenda which I think the Official Liquidator made from the book—I never authorised Hughlings to deposit by way of lien the bill</p>

               <p>of exchange for 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as a condition of getting the directors' assent to that agreement—after that was stamped on the 22nd I got a letter signed "Allen," claiming from me the full amount of the bill—I then wrote to Mr. Allen—there were many prospectuses with different names on them; my name did not appear on the first or second—I think Hughlings printed several additions in the prospectus—Mr. Weekes produced the one handed to me subsequent to the other—it is alleged there that M. Francatelli is the <hi rend="italic">chef</hi>, and he did act—he was introduced to the Board by Errington—he was to be paid—I was called to the Bar in, I think, 1831—none of the companies I have been in connection with, are in existence—in 1845, the year of the railway mania, I found my name put down to many companies which I knew nothing at all about—the Progressive Limited Company is in existence, and I have been a director of the Australasian Mines Investment Company since 1877—they used to pay a dividend—the Company was in a very bad state, and was remodelled, and I was one of the new directors; it is in a very prosperous state now—I never carried on any trading concern.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 5, Furnival's Inn, and in acting for Mr. Soman, a printer at Norwich, I came across Errington in June, 1883—he brought the International Fish Dinner Company to my attention, and asked me if I would act as solicitor to the Company—I said I was willing to do so provided the directors were respectable people—he had no printed prospectus then—on the second or third interview afterwards he showed me a printed prospectus with Riddell's and Cheshire's and another name on it—I was satisfied on seeing those three names as to the respectability of the directors, and con<lb/>sented to be a director—I was requested to attend and attended regularly a great number of Board meetings from the time of my appointment—I knew nothing of Hughlings and Cheshire before that—at a subsequent meeting on 4th August, the one before that at which shares were allotted, I found Cheshire there, and afterwards Hughlings was introduced by Errington—I made an objection about them to Mr. Riddell—on 4th August Cheshire asked me for a loan, which I thought rather strange—my brother joined the Board as a director before the meeting on 4th August—ultimately I was instructed to bring an action for Mr. Soman against the Company in respect of work done for the Company—I did not act for Messrs. Vaughan—I took 25 shares—I was asked to do so by Errington—I parted with 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, the deposit money—I did the Company's legal business up to my dismissal on 22nd October—about a fortnight alter I sued the Company for Soman for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I sued them also myself for about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for solicitor's charges—I made the outlay for the Company's registration and the stamp and everything—I lost some 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the Company—I have had no payment at all—to my knowledge there was no registration of members up to 22nd October—I and several others inquired about it on several occasions—I went to the Barbican once after it was opened—about the middle of November, after I was dismissed, I put in an execution in the judgment obtained by Soman—after everything was sold up there were several executions, the landlord distrained—there was a balance of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I got nothing.</p>

I know all about it, and also the manager, and I think it will suit you. I think it will be successful. Yours truly, H. Hughlings. "That was enclosed in one of the prospectuses of the City and Suburban Bank—I did not see Hughlings about it—Titcomb called on me after, and asked if I had heard of the new bank; Mr. Overend had mentioned it to me—I said "Yes, I have heard of the new bank from Hughlings and Overend"—</p>

I have been in the profession two or three years—the prospectus Hughlings left was printed, and I read it—I think the names of the Board were blank—I think Mr. Crowe, a char<lb/>tered accountant, was auditor—I thought the Company had prospects of success, especially after the explanation Titcomb gave of what he had done in other banks—he said he had a large experience in the Grosvenor Bank, and it was successful—he did not say why he was leaving; he did not say he was leaving in consequence of the Bank deciding that the loan business would not be carried on—he told me he was going to be content with trusting to its future, and he would not for 12 months draw any salary—the directors' names were afterwards filled in, and in my opinion they were names of respectable and responsible men, and I have had no reason to alter that opinion—I don't know Mr. W. T. Morphew, of King Street, Covent Garden, but I know the business he carried on, and I believe him to be a substantial tradesman—I don't know Captain Fish, of Tinley Hall—I believe Mr. R. P.

Fald<lb/>ing hold between them 275 shares, and it is alleged that both of these gentlemen are under age—the claims against the Company formally made to me amount to 675<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there are other claims of which I find evidence—the amount received upon all the shares is 468<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in rough figures—the only asset paid to me is 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the landlord of the Barbican premises; there are no means of getting assets unless I ultimately succeed in getting something from the shareholders—I made inquiry about the Barbican premises; I heard that Pryor was in possession, and I applied to him by letter to know upon what grounds—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—there is a letter before that—this of the 27th February was no doubt the first—he didn't call in answer to that letter, and on 2nd May.

               <p>the landlord's agent to know if I would surrender the premises; that was after the 25th March—it was after that that Pryor came to me, and in general terms he claimed the premises—on 2nd May I wrote this letter; I got no answer, and I don't think I have ever heard from Pryor from that day to this—I received this letter in answer to mine, stating that he held the premises under an agreement by Hughlings on behalf of the Company—my impression is that after that Pryor saw me, and we had some conversation about it, but I adhered to my view of the matter, and he left—I think eight or ten days elapsed before the sur<lb/>render was made—he had ample opportunity to take away any property of his—I sent a clerk with the keys, and I was told that the surrender was completed—there are some small books of takings here in reference to the Barbican business—I have not attempted to make up an account of the receipts—I believe the cash book shows the takings; it seems to have been kept anyhow—from September 13th to the end of the month the takings are 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day; the total amount for the whole of Octo<lb/>ber appears to be something under 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—for the first fourteen days in November it appears to be 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day—I found in the allotment book certain cheques of the first cheque-book supplied to the Company pasted in, and some of the second cheque-book, I think seven, they are all "to bearer" except one, which is to Erring<lb/>ton's order—"bearer" is printed and has been changed to "order"—the cheques are for from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—there is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for buying fish, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for wages, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for advertisements, and other sums—I had the Chief Clerk's authority to surrender the Barbican premises—I went down to 61, New Kent Road, very shortly after my appointment—I found Errington living there; he asked to be allowed to stay there a little while—there were some gas fittings and a few other things there—I told him I should want to sell them—I went there some time after<lb/>wards; the gas fittings had then been removed—I got no assets from that place at all.</p>

Norman, and the surrender was completed to them—if I were to sue the people and get in all that was due, it would amount to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—notices were sent to the chairman and everybody: he has not paid—my impression is that I found the keys amongst the papers, or Messrs.

(<hi rend="italic">These were orders for 1,000 prospectuses, a die stamp, wrappers, &amp;c., and requesting them to take shares.</hi>)—we did the work but did not take the shares—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prospectus we printed—we were to be paid upon allotment—we applied to Errineton and wrote to him several times pressing for payment, and eventually got this bill, dated April 19th, for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., drawn by Errington and accepted by General Wolfe—that is a trifle over the amount of our account—we kept it some time and then paid it to a whole-sale house; it came back dishonoured and I took it up—I was to hand Errington 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I got the bill, and I unfortunately parted with my 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Errington introduced me to Mr. Titcomb, and also sent me to the Inter<lb/>national House Property—on the day after Bank-holiday I got this letter from Errington.

I am a widow—I undertook to pay a rental for a counter at the London Fish Dinner Company's premises, 275, Strand, a shop just opposite Smith and Son's newspaper place; about 14 or 16 feet frontage, and running back into Booksellers' Row—my stall was in the lobby leading to the dining rooms—I had a knife machine, which Dr. Mark in connection with the Company agreed to buy; I was not paid for it—when I went to the Strand I saw Errington, Turtle, the travelling inspector, Wolfe, and Traher—the knife machine was taken to the premises; I was to have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—the last I saw of it was Mr. Jameson knocking it down at the auction—I cautioned him not to sell it, but he did—they made me take five shares for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in consequence of their not paying for the machine I did not pay any rent—I saw Hughlings, one of the directors—I was present at a meeting when Traher and Wolfe were turned out, and Cheshire and Hughlings appointed as directors—Pope was chairman at that meeting.</p>

               <p>Fish Dinner Company—I joined in ignorance of that Company—I attended Board meetings for four or five weeks—I was present at the first meeting on 23rd April, 1884—Edward Errington was then allotted 280 shares in respect of the agreement between him and the Company, and a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was signed and handed to Errington by the chairman—then I think there were estimates for floor-cloth and stoves, the appointment of Miss Potter, and the voting of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year to the directors—I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself, and was more than that out of pocket—at the next meeting, on 13th May, the prospectus was revised, and after other things the Press dinner fixed for Monday, 21st May; that was the real beginning of business—I had left long before Jameson came in on 3rd July—Errington managed everything, I think—on 14th May an account was presented for brokerage on 389 shares by Mr. Errington—Errington represented that 420 had been applied for—I believed that that was sufficient to cover all liabilities and leave a margin—I was not aware that there were only 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bank when the cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was passed—I did not see the bankers' pass-book till some time after—on 14th May they reported Miss Morgan's, Miss Robinson's, and Mr. Vale's applications for shares—I found the secretary had put an adver<lb/>tisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> for a director, in consequence of the retirement of Major-General Wolfe, who went to Basutoland as second in command—I objected to the Press dinner, and did not go to it—on 23rd May there was a notification of the transfer of Wolfe's shares to me temporarily—a number of cheques were signed then—Errington told us the allotment letters would bring sufficient funds to cover them—I was present at the statutory meeting on 29th May—Pope was voted into the chair—I knew nothing of him before; I had only seen him twice at the London Fish Dinner Company, where he came, I think, to see Mr. Errington—at the statutory meeting Hughlings, Philips, Scott, Cheshire, and Mark were proposed as directors—I retired at that statutory meet<lb/>ing, and have had nothing to do with the management of the affairs of the Company since—I do not know Cheshire—I have seen Hughlings once or twice at the Fish Dinner Company in the Strand—I signed this application for 25 shares—I afterwards got the letter of allotment—I paid no cash—I gave a short bill for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for shares for friends at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a share at the instigation of Errington—before the bill became due I said I thought the bill was not legitimately obtained, and I thought I should fight it—I have had no action brought against me in respect of the bill—I said to Errington I thought we had all been done by him, and I should fight it out—I then knew what sum had been paid into the bankers, and I was surprised it was not larger—I said to him that busi<lb/>ness could not be conducted on that principle, that the servants were the first consideration to be paid, that they had not been paid, and that there was sufficient money taken at the time to pay the servants at the place of business—I think Errington said there was nothing to pay anybody with, or something to that effect—Errington said he thought we should want money to finance the Company, and he knew a gentleman, Mr. Titcomb, the manager of the Grosvenor Bank, and that he would probably advance sufficient funds, and that we should make Titcomb a director—I objected to Mr. Titcomb on the ground of a trial then going on about a bill of sale and the Grosvenor Bank—that conversation was before General Wolfe's resignation, to the best of my belief—on one occasion I signed a</p>

               <p>notary, I think—I think a letter came from Pope asking me to take shares—I received these letters at different dates, and sent replies to them. (<hi rend="italic">A letter of</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th February from Pope to the witness, stating that the arrangement of his being made solicitor would be confirmed on his taking shares, and that he would be paid out of the Company's funds; and of</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th February presuming that he had registered the Company.</hi>) I wrote and said I had registered it—on 29th February Pope wrote to me about taking shares—I replied on 3rd March that I did not think I ought to take shares till the preliminary expenses had been repaid. (<hi rend="italic">A letter of 7th March from Pope was read, saying they had more than enough to cover the costs.</hi>) I had sug<lb/>gested I might get a client of mine, Mr. Schoot, to come on the Board; he did not join—on 9th April a short agreement was drawn up between the Company and Sormani, offering to appoint him secretary at 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I don't think I saw the prisoners between the meetings I attended—this agreement of 17th April for the new secretary seems in my clerk's handwriting—on 30th April I applied for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for stamps—I severed my connection with the Company by letter early in April, and resigned on 19th April—I got none of the out-of-pocket money nor my costs—I left my resignation at Pope's; he found me and asked me to explain my reason—I declined to give it—I had heard certain things which caused me to become suspicious—it was entirely through Titcomb's letter that I acted at all—after his letter I called twice at the Grosvenor Bank to see him, but not finding him in I relied on his letter—I did not see Titcomb at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Pope.</hi> When the scheme was told me I said the Company could not be worked in that way—I did not see any objection to distributing houses as profit—it was understood special articles should be drawn up—the action of Gauntlett v. the Grosvenor Bank went against the Bank; they were the bankers for the Company—there were articles in the leading papers commenting adversely on the Bank; that would not tend to enhance the prospects of the Company.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 36, Clifton Street, Albert Road—I became acquainted with Cheshire about three years ago, and Pope about two years ago—I knew of an office at 26, King William Street, being used for a "To Let Agency"—about February last I arranged with Cheshire to have the use of part of that house—I saw Pope afterwards, before I began to use the office—I did use it for the purpose of my business as a house and estate agent—I was to give one-third of my commission for the use of the office—this is my signature to the House Property Distri<lb/>bution articles—I subscribed for one share—I signed it on tie 21st Feb<lb/>ruary, 1884—I did not pay anything for the share, Cheshire gave it me, and he handed me a certificate for it—I continued to use the office till about April—I was present at some of the meetings of the Company; I saw there Titcomb, Pryor, Hughlings, and Rymer, and Mr. Crowe the accountant, and Cheshire the secretary—the Grosvenor Bank was the bank of the Society—I lent money both to Pope and Cheshire, from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. up to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Pope owed me altogether about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Cheshire about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it was much more than that—Cheshire gave me a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Grosvenor Bank to get cashed; I passed it to Mr. Green, who brought it back dishonoured—I spoke to Pope about it, and he said "Pay it in again and it will be all right; I have arranged matters with Mr. Titcomb"—it was a cheque by Pope on his own private account—I did pay it in again, and it was then paid—I spoke to Pope again, and he said "You can make it all right with Mr. Green and I will pay you"—I may very likely have had a cheque of Pope's for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his private account payable to me about the 6th February, but I never paid it to any one to get the cash for it—I may have paid it into the Grosvenor Bank and it came back, they have all come back—Pope gave me a cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay away to a Mr. Moore for money owing to him; that cheque was returned on the 12th June—I got a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to reduce the debt owing to me—I paid it away, it came back, I had to make it good—I took some shares in the London Fish Dinner Company; Cheshire introduced me to that Company—I did not pay any<lb/>thing in respect of those shares, Cheshire said he would pay them because he was owing me money—at one time I lived in the same house with Cheshire at Fenwick Grove for five or six months in the spring of 1884—I did not see anything of Cheshire at his residence after the August bank-holiday—I have been in the same place since then, but did not see Cheshire; I did not know where he was—I have never heard anything of him since, except in this case—this is the receipt that was given to me for my one share in the House Property Company.</p>

I am a commission agent, of 82, Wickersley Road, Lavender Hill—I know Pope, Hughlings, and Errington, and have seen them at 26, King William Street, where the House Distribution Society was carried on—I first knew the Fish Dinner Company at Oxford Mansions; I never went there—I lost sight of them, and next time I found them they were at 276, Strand—Errington was promoting that company, and the others were connected with him—Pope gave me a cheque and asked me to cash it for him, as he was rather short of money that night, and the cheque would be duly honoured the following day—I gave him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account, and he never called for the balance—I was told that he got the cheque back and tore it up—I was apprehended, and charged at Kennington Road Police-station—I was taken to Stone's End Police-court and remanded on my own recognisances—the charge was withdrawn—Errington said that Pope was a shareholder in the Grosvenor Bank, and could put a lot of business into my hands—he said he could overdraw his account to the amount of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by arrangement with Mr. Titcomb, the manager—I do not remember receiving a cheque from Pope for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received one for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I got that cashed for him, and he brought the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the following day and got the cheque back—Errington said that he could get me advertisements for several papers if I could put them in for him, to advertise the Fish Dinner Company—he said he was doing the same thing with Willing's—he said that Pope or Hughlings was promoting the House Distribution Society, and I think Cheshire, and the Grosvenor Bank, with which Titcomb was connected, was backing it up, and that Titcomb was taking an, office over the City and Suburban Bank, which he was going to open for lending money, and there was a lot of advertising to do, and he would put it all into my hands, that they should be advertising the bank largely, and would pay cash with all their advertisement orders—just before the August Bank Holiday Pope said, "I am going to withdraw my account from the Grosvenor Bank and transfer it to the City and Suburban" showing me at the same time half a dozen cheque-books, which he was taking to Somerset House to get stamped for the City and Suburban Bank, which Titcomb was going to open, and he said, "My cheques will be duly honoured because I have taken shares in the bank"—Pope said that he had one or two bills which they were going to discount at the Grosvenor Bank for him, and any cheques which he could not exactly meet at the present time would be met out of that—I introduced Pope to Pillinger—I was at the Equestrian Tavern when the cheque produced by Dewsbury was cashed—Mrs. Dewsbury refused to cash it that night, but she cashed it the next day—I received instructions from Errington to advertise for the Fish Dinner Company, the House Distribution Company, and the Empire House and Land Company, Gray's Inn Chambers, where Errington had an office as Henderson and Co.—I have been there, and besides Errington I have seen Hughlings there—several newspapers would not accept the advertisements unless I paid cash for them, but where they did accept them they were not paid for to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police inspector of the Criminal Investiga<lb/>tion Department—I knew Pope in 1880—I was present during many days' investigation into a matter of dishonoured cheques in which Pope was concerned—two persons named Pugh, father and son, were mixed up with it, but the father absconded and only the son was present—there were two others, Delmar and Cullner—there were 16 or 17 remands extending over 20 days—Pryor was present from seven to nine days, and on the final day of the investigation—I did not see Pope for some time after that, but I heard of him, I did not hear of him again in this country till April last—Price and Clifford both complained to me about 14th or 15th April about two cheques for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which were shown to me—I recognised Pope's writing, they were on the Grosvenor Bank—I went there and saw Mr. Penfold, and on 18th April I applied for a warrant, and by the Magistrate's order went on the same day and saw Titcomb at 22, Bedford Street—he occupied a back room there as an office, with his name on the door—he did not know me before, nor I him—I asked him whether his name was Titcomb—he said "Yes"—I said "I am Inspector Marshall, and to-day I have applied at the Westminster Police-court with two persons who have been defrauded, for a warrant against Pope and Weaver; I was directed by the Magistrate to enquire at the Grosvenor Bank as to Pope's account there; I did so, and Mr. Penfold attended at the police-court and deposed as to his account, but he produced a bill drawn by Pope to the Grosvenor Bank, and Penfold is unable to detail the particulars of how it came there; it is said that you accepted it when you were manager, and the Magistrate desires you to attend as well"—he said "I will come, I know Pope very well, but I am not satisfied with some of his dealings, I should like to go to the Grosvenor Bank first"—I said "Yes, I will drive you there"—when he said he was not satisfied he took up a letter which was in course of pre<lb/>paration and said "I was just writing this to resign my position of director of the House Property Distribution Society," of which I think he said Pope was the promoter—I said "Yes, your name is on the prospectus," taking out this prospectus (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from my pocket, "and I have been making inquiry about it"—I then drove him to the Grosvenor Bank in a cab—he went inside and had an interview with Mr. Penfold, I did not hear the conversation, I saw Pryor there—I then went to the police-court with Titcomb and Penfold and renewed the application, and Mr. Penfold produced this 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill; it is dated "March 10th, 1884," at two months for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for value received, to Sidney Cheshire, 26, King William Street, Strand. "F. Pope, accepted, payable at the City Bank, Sidney Cheshire," and in the corner is written "Account closed"—Titcomb then said to the Magistrate "When I was manager to the Grosvenor Bank I accepted this bill for Pope"—I believe he said "accepted," but he meant "received," "and I gave him permission to draw 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it"—the Magistrate refused to issue the warrant, saying</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188412290057"/>
               <p>that Pope might reasonably think he was entitled to draw cheques on it, and I failed—in a day or two other complaints came in and I renewed my application on April 22nd, but it was still refused on the same grounds—Mrs. Barrett and several others who are not here complained—on 1st August I took this letter from Titcomb's pocket or from a drawer by the side of which he was sitting at 97, Leadenhall Street. (<hi rend="italic">This was from Pope, dated</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd April</hi>, 1884, <hi rend="italic">making inquiries as to who held the</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">cheque</hi>). In July, I think it was, I saw Pope in the Strand with seven or eight others, Cheshire was one, the others were neither of the other prisoners—they seemed to be in consultation at the corner of King William Street, and when they saw me there was a general rush in all directions, but Pope came up to me and said "Halloa, Marshall, I hear you have been trying to <hi rend="italic">get it up</hi> for me again"—I said "I don't know if I have, I think you have <hi rend="italic">done me</hi> among you this time"—I took Tit<lb/>comb on 1st August at 97, Leadenhall Street on another charge—I opened the City and Suburban minute-book, and when I came to all these names I ran my finger down them and said "You have got a <hi rend="italic">rum</hi> lot here," and when I got to the name of Pugh I said "Is this Arthur or the old man?"—he said "It is old <hi rend="italic">Jimmy"</hi> that is the man who absconded—Pope's, Cheshire's, and Titcomb's names are down here, and others who I know very well by name—I took Pry or on October 1st in the street at St. Oswald's Road, Fulham—I could not find him at 14, Parliament Street, it was between 8 and 9 o'clock p.m., I saw him coming and crossed over to him, he had his umbrella up—as soon as he saw me he said "Well, Marshall, what is brewing now, seeing you here?"—I said "I have got a warrant against you for conspiracy"—he said "Read it"—I read it to him, and when I came to the name of Clifford he said "I don't know that man, and you know I would not conspire with Pope and am not likely to do anything to bring me within the meshes of the criminal law"—I said "I know you are pretty careful, but I find you introduced Pope to the Grosvenor Bank"—he said "I may have done, bat I am not so sure about it"—I found this pawn-ticket on him at the station, it is for a crimson carpet and office furniture, pledged at Mr. Bichardson's for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 27th September, 1884, by James Pugh, of 5, St. James's Street—I said "It is very curious that that furniture is pledged in the name of Pugh"—he said "Oh, there is nothing in that"—I fancy he said it was furniture from Parliament Street, and when I went there I found the furniture had gone, and from inquiries I found it was the furniture from there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Pryor.</hi> A witness is paid so much a day for attending this Court—when I said 20 days I was combining the whole inquiry before the Magistrate and this Court—if you only received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you must also have a certificate for your attendance before the Magistrate—I got the warrant about noon on the day of your arrest—I did not say that there was any difficulty in finding you—I do not know on what business you were at the Grosvenor Bank, but I had my idea; my ideas are not always right—the deposition is dated September 27th; that was the Saturday before quarter-day—the landlord wanted possession from you, and I eventually gave him the key—the furniture was all gone except a stool with a board laid across it for a table; the oilcloth was not there, the floor was bare—I brought a great many books and papers from your office, 14, Parliament Street, and some from your address in St. Oswald's Road—I have never had any trouble with you.</p>

               <p>here—I had no authority to take possession of it—I have not seen any letter from the Company with regard to Mr. Titcomb resigning—I have not searched the papers myself; there may be such a letter—Mr. Titcomb went to the Court on 18th April and made a statement to the Court, and it was inferred that he was influenced by the letter from Pope—that statement did not lead to his arrest—there is a mistake in the date, the information is wrong as to the date—I found the letter on Aug. 1st, with other papers; it is dated 22/4/84—that was four days after he made the statement—whatever the value of his conduct or statement on the 18th was, it is a mistake that he was influenced by that letter, for it was written four days afterwards—he said that some facts had come to his knowledge which induced him to waver in his opinion of Pope, but he did not say "and to have nothing more to do with him," but sub<lb/>stantially he did—Mr. Penfold was a witness for the prosecution before the Magistrate—I have not seen him here—I considered him an important witness as to my obtaining the warrant—he was the assistant-manager, and would act in Titcomb's absence—I cannot say whether he continued there after Titcomb left—I do not know the name of Fastridge among the <hi rend="italic">rum</hi> lot, or of Lewis—I should not like to say much about Dr. Marks, I should not like to give an opinion—I apply that expression to any one except those I actually know something about—I apply it to Pugh, Cheshire, and Pope—I will confine myself to those.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was in April that Pope said Mr. Titcomb was resigning his connection in consequence of what he had heard, and in July I called his attention to the <hi rend="italic">rum</hi> lot—in August Pope was carrying cheque-book to be stamped—I did not see this letter before August 1st—I cannot tell when the figures, 22/4/84, were put on the letter, there is no difference in the ink—Mr. Titcomb only went once to the police-court, and I am quite sure that that was on April 18th; whether those figures were put on later I don't know; I made the application on that very day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SEYMOUR</hi>. The account was opened with Pope in the deputy manager's handwriting—in the July previous there had been a letter from Hollis, the surveyor, reporting in his favour—two days after the account was opened with 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was charged against it on account of arrears of the loan, and the result of that was that one or two of Pope's cheques were dishonoured—I got instructions to do that from Titcomb or the deputy manager, and they would do that in the bank's interests rather than Pope's, as a matter of business—I should say bills discounted were entered in the discount book; I had nothing to do with that department, I could not say who kept it—if a bill were not discounted, but a sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced against it for a short time, I should not expect it to be entered in the discount book—Titcomb and Penfold used to manage the bills at that time, I think—none of the House Property Company's cheques were dishonoured—they were signed by the directors—the first cheque of the Company was issued by the Company on 1st April after Titcomb had left the bank—on 31st March there was 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the credit of the Company at the bank—on 17th March 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid in—nothing was paid in after 31st March till 8th May—while Titcomb was at the bank not a shilling was drawn out for the Company—the three cheque-books were issued to Pope on 30th January, 28th February, and 21st March—I believe Titcomb was attending to the bank business on 21st March—the action against the bank lasted some days—I cannot say if it began on 17th March or if it was on 21st March—I think Titcomb was in attendance at the bank the entire day during the time the trial of the action was on—I cannot remember who issued the book; if asked for it over the counter I might hand it over—I cannot tell if Titcomb was a party to issuing the third cheque-book—I should very likely give it across the counter, and a junior would enter it in the book—the numbers of the cheques would be entered in the cheques' book; that would give me no information as to who gave it out—Pope's account was eventually finished on 21st March, when there was the over-draft of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—nothing has ever been done since, and that still stands to his debit—Titcomb has given me authority to return Pope's dishonoured cheques—I should have told him how the account was on those occasions or he would have referred to it, and if it was overdrawn he would quite properly have directed me to dishonour his cheques—that occurred many times—sometimes money had been paid in, and then when cheques were presented they were paid if the account enabled them to be—I referred to the account for each cheque whoever it came from, and the cheques would be honoured or dishonoured according to its state—on 22nd March a cheque drawn by Pope for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Pry or was presented over the counter and dishonoured—I should think I did that on my own responsi<lb/>bility, knowing how his account stood—as a rule I returned or honoured on the manager's instructions, but he would give me instructions and I would frame my judgment at other times—I returned the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In consequence of his instructions, but I won't say I showed that cheque to him—he had told me some time before I must not honour any more, however small—Titcomb always had plenty to do; I should say he devoted himself with all his might and power to the bank's interest—there was an advertisement for a shorthand clerk in March—he never</p>

               <p>said anything to me about wanting another assistant—he did not complain to me of the way Penfold kept the accounts—he complained to Penfold that he had not done certain things, and several times of things he had not entered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Grosvenor Bank—after 31st March I succeeded Mr. Titcomb—at that time Pope's account was over<lb/>drawn to the amount of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not find any record in the minute-book of the Bank of the discount of a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I find in the rough minute-book an entry on the 6th March, "Pope, House Property Distribution Society, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., three months bill. February 28th"—that bill was dishonoured—it would be part of the manager's duty to attend upon the directors—the minutes should be read to the directors—if there was any trace of this bill in the minute-book it should have come to the knowledge of the directors—I found a 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill in the safe of the bank—it appeared that Pope was allowed to draw against the bill for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to about that amount—a bill-book was kept in the bank; there was no entry of this bill in it—the minute-book for November, 1883, is not here; the rough minute is here—on 22nd November I find this entry: "The International Fish Dinner Company, Limited, applied for a loan of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; refused"—that is in Titcomb's handwriting—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the form of application; it sets out the security, amounting to about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 20th September, 1883, I find an entry in the rough minute<lb/>book in Titcomb's writing: "Mr. Pryor, loan 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; refused"—I produce a cheque dated 31st October, 1883, for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payable to Mrs. Mary Pryor, drawn by Thomas Rintoul and A.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Pryor.</hi> I have only been manager to the bank nine months—I have only acquired my knowledge of the transactions from the books—previous to my appointment I had been an accountant; previous to that I had been in a bank some years, about 25 altogether—I was five years in the Consolidated Bank—if I said in my deposition 14 years, it is a mistake—I have not been anything else, I have not been a promoter of banks, I have assisted in promoting one; it was not a success, it was never offered to the public—I have seen your name in the books of the bank several times, I can't say how many, a great many—I have not compiled a book from your introductions; it is there, they amount to about 100 or 200 perhaps—I only find your name in the books coupled with one of the co-defendants', Mr. Pope's I think—you were a shareholder in the bank; you held 250 shares I think, 50 belong to your trustee in bankruptcy—the money was lent to Mrs. Pryor—I have seen her three or four times—I do not remember her bringing me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on her last visit—I remember your saying that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be paid on certain conditions—Mrs. Pryor said she had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I never saw the money, I have no doubt she had it, because I knew where it came from—I have never seen the furniture in question under the bill of sale—some time after my appoint<lb/>ment I found the accounts in confusion and the books irregularly kept—the books were kept by the clerks under Mr. Penfold—he was chief clerk or deputy-manager; he superintended them, and was responsible for them—I never consulted him as to the state of your account—I opened a new set of books in June, after the completion of the half year—I have made some sweeping alterations since I have been there—that did not include Mr. Holder, the chairman from his daily attendance, or Mr. Thompson, the vice-chairman, or three directors—it was impossible that I could be in a position to sweep away a director—we have eight direc<lb/>tors now instead of eleven—Mr. Cunningham, the auctioneer, will do no more business for the bank—he has done business with the bank since I have been there—I refused to have any business to do with you—I know that Mr. Penfold made a statement to the solicitor for the Treasury, I was present part of the time—he denied that this entry was interpolated—I say that it was, it was written at a different time, that can be shown from the ink, it is darker ink—this is the first time I have heard it stated that he was called away and left it to dry—there is nothing in the minute of 25th October that incriminates you, of course you could not have been present—I believe there is an indictment against Penfold—I believe that indictment does not include these alleged false entries—there is a cash statement at the end of the minutes, with the number and amount of the loans granted every evening—there is an entry there of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is not interpolated—the total of loans granted the evening of 25th Oct. is correct—there is no cash statement of the refusals—this is a cash state<lb/>ment supposed to represent the balance of the bank that week, and in that your 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is included—the entry in the rough minute-book on 24th October is "Pryor's loan refused," and immediately following there is "Pryor 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Spink and Hollis to report" in Titcomb's handwriting—that is two lines down—I don't say that that refers to your loan, I simply say it is there—I understood Mr. Spink to say he never reported—there was no application from Benham that evening—if the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid</p>

               <p>of course there would have been no prosecution—the directors are the prosecutors, not I—I believe Mr. Hollis has been connected with the bank from its commencement—he used to attend the weekly Board meet<lb/>ings—I should say that matters were not discussed at the Board which did not get on the minutes—this loan would very likely be incidentally mentioned—I should say Hollis ought to have entered his report—I have searched the report-book and so has he; he did not find one—I don't find Allen's name in the books of the bank—he is your half-brother—Allen and Cook claimed the furniture—I don't know either of them—we did not remove the furniture till after we had the order of Vice-Chancellor Bacon—I am aware that the costs were paid and the Sheriff withdrawn—the application for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan was found at Mr. Hollis's—it is not your writing—I believe all the defendants are customers of the bank, and most of them hold bills of sale, and their names appear in Perry and Stubbs's lists—you have paid off several loans, not amounting to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Hollis's report on Pope's loan of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is here—that loan was granted—I do not find any loan in the name of Cheshire—I knew nothing of him—in paying a cheque we should only refer to the autograph-book for the signature—Pope's current account was about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. overdrawn—Roantree's dishonoured cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. made the overdraft—I have not asked Roantree to pay it; I don't know him—I believe Pope is a share<lb/>holder—when he opened his account I think he had a 25 cheque-book—I have heard it stated in evidence that many of those cheques were dis<lb/>honoured; if so, I should say it would be imprudent to issue a second cheque-book—the last interview I had with Pope must have been before this prosecution was commenced—I saw him three or four times, and that was in reference to try and settle your matter of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to prevent this prosecution—I do not think I find your name connected with any of the co-defendants in the cheques or bills—your application of 20th September for the loan of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was' refused—this is the only application paper I have found in the books, and there is no date to that—I have not found a letter of 20th September.

When Titcomb brought forward Pryor's application for a loan he did so as manager, there was nothing extraordinary in it, it was his duty—the rough minute book has his en<lb/>dorsement "Refused"—in the second minute book it is "Pryor, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," it does not say "Granted"—the two preceding ones have "Granted"—Mr. Pryor's second application in the rough minute book referring to that was of an exceptional nature in that respect—following it is "Hollis and Spink to report," that might or might not refer to Pryor's loan, if it did it was Mr. Titcomb's entry for the protection of the bank—taking it as it now stands, I should say the words below referred to it—Penfold copied the rough book into the minute book, from the entry I gather it is an interpolation—I have not found in the book any interpolation in Tit<lb/>comb's writing—if it was Penfold's interpolation the corresponding entry in the column of figures would not appear to be interpolated—the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being entered in the column would not tend to shake my suspicion that the other was interpolated—Mr. Titcomb did not enter up the column—I find no entry by Titcomb in the minute book referring to Pryor's loan being granted—three directors, Ridgway, Birch, and Spink, signed that cheque—300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is rather a large cheque for our bank; we don't have many in a week so large—a director signing it would have his attention drawn to its object and cause; we may presume their attention was called to it—I believe the pass book is laid on the directors' table every week—I do not think it is their practice to go through it, only to look at the outstanding balance—the first legal proceedings in connection with Pryor's loan were against Pryor and his wife, then Bowlem took out a summons against the bank on 17th July, and technically succeeded—no criminal proceedings were taken before Titcomb was brought into it—the bank's present solicitors defended the bank against Bowlem prior to Titcomb being accused—it is a frequent custom for bankers to take customers' bills, which although not discounted, are drawn upon to a certain extent, and the bill is not then placed to his account, and that would explain that, with reference to the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, Titcomb said he would allow them to draw 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was not entered in the books; there should be an entry of the security in the bank books—the bill would not necessarily be entered in any book, but there should have been a book in which it would be entered; there was no book kept—deeds deposited at the bank to be drawn upon would be entered—Titcomb sent a letter after he left the bank asking for compensation—he did bills of sale after to left, not for the bank—he took bills of sale and afterwards mortgaged them to the bank—a resolution was passed by the directors that I was not to do any more bills of sale, but that I should take them as any other security on a mortgage—there was no arrangement made for Tit<lb/>comb to take the bills oi sale and mortgage them to the bank—Titcomb</p>

               <p>tried soon afterwards to start the City and Suburban Bank after this, it was to be a money-lending bank—I am not aware that he took any of his own connection to it—if Pryor's loan had been properly paid up, the charge of conspiracy would not have been known—the first cheque of the House Property Distribution Company was paid in on 28th February, and the first cheque drawn on 1st April, after Titcomb had left the bank—bad debts occur more generally to younger than to older banks—I have been connected with a smaller branch of the Consolidated Bank—I left because of a disagreement with the directors—I charged a man with forgery without consulting the directors—I said yesterday at Westminster Police-court it was on account of losses; the loss arose out of this—a loss incurred by a bank does not necessarily reflect on a manager; to some extent it does so—I had something to do with the Britannia Bank—it never was a bank except for being registered—I did not make 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it, it never had a shilling—I know Mr. Mordaunt—I decline to say if I got 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him—I think he had eoinething to do with pro<lb/>moting the Britannia Bank—I decline to say if I do not answer because it would incriminate myself—I decline to say if I stated at the West<lb/>minister Police-court that Mr. Mordaunt parted with 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me—I brought no testimonial to the Grosvenor Bank—I was appointed manager through the directors, no one gave or wrote me a letter—I did not say at the police-court I had had one—I am told an advertisement appeared for a clerk; I do not know if that was because Titcomb was overworked—when a loan was introduced and a report made on it, the report should be more important than the introduction; if Holis Us and Spinks reported on the loan their report would be the most important—I know nothing as to whether Pryor offered additional security on the second application for his loan—Vice-Chancellor Bacon gave an injunction in our favour with reference to that loan—if Titcomb introduced the loan not knowing the circumstances connected with it, it would be a valid one legally—among the bank papers I have found no cheques, bills, or negoitable in<lb/>struments coupling Titcomb's name with any of the other prisoners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This is the only proposal for the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan that I have seen—At is in Pryor's handwriting, and on account of the furniture at 56 Oswald Road—the answers to questions 10 and 11 are: "Have you any bill of sale or mortgage on your goods?" "No." "Any previous borrower?" "No"—the security is the bill of sale and joint promis<lb/>sory note of Mr. and Mrs. Pryor—this was issued in the interpleader action, where Allen and the Bank and Cook were different parties on 17th June, 1884—it shows the hire of the furniture for two years by Pryor from February, 1882—this is another document showing the pawning of some property of the same description as that in the bill of sale on 16th May, 1884—about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid in instalments, including the 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. overdraft—nothing came to the bank from the sale; we had to pay about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Benham was one of Pryor's intro<lb/>ductions—I believe that was a 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loss.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab proprietor of Westminster, and have been chairman of the Grosvenor Bank since it was formed—Titcomb was manager till the 31st March or 1st April—the application for a loan to Pope on Fuller's, his landlord's, security, is in Pryor's handwriting—Pope is described as a director of public companies—I don't think Tit<lb/>comb gave me any information with reference to Pope's respectability—Pope a tier wards opened a current account—I don't know who introduced him—that would be taken by Mr. Titcomb—it would be the bank manager's duty, if he took in a bill for an indefinite amount and there was an overdrawn account, to bring it before the directors, and not to enter it in a bill-book—I found that this 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was in the bank after Titcomb had left—he did not say he had that bill of Pryor's, or that he had allowed Pope to draw against it—I never saw Pope's bill for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till after Titcomb went away—I then found it in the bill case—I knew Pryor by sight, and as having a very bad reputation—on 20th September, 1883, I remember his applying for a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan—Titcomb brought it before the Board—I said we could do no business with Pryor, and it was not gone into—one of the directors put it; it was refused absolutely—we heard he was a bad character, and refused to have anything to do with him—the question of security was never discussed—the fair copy minute-book would be read at the next meeting—when Titcomb read them on the 27th I noticed nothing about the refusal of Pryor's loan—on 25th October I see in the rough minute book "Pryor, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and neither "refused" or "granted;" it never came before us—Hollis's report was never brought before us in September—the matter was only brought forward once, and then refused—in the fair minute-book, 25th October, I find the entry, "Pryor's loan, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; granted"—Titcomb would read the minutes from the minute-book for them to be approved and signed by the chairman—I should have known if he had read out Pryor's name—Titcomb did not read out from this cash account amounting to 488<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the details including "Pryor 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I should have known if he had—I did not consent to the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being given to Mr. Pryor—I always signed the cheques; I went to the bank every morning for that purpose—I was not aware that this cheque of 30th October for the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been signed—I did not know Pryor was paying instalments to the Bank—after Titcomb had left Pryor came round and said it was a pity to go on in this way; he wanted to make some arrangement—I said "The Sheriffs are in now for some one else"—he said "You can get them out"—I said I would not try to get them out; the case had gone too far, he had swindled us enough, and that "we must try the case now, it must go on—he brought his wife with him once—they said the things belonged to some party—I asked him how he came to swear they were their things—we went to action; the Court granted in our favour, but we lost more than the money by it—we got nothing by the security—Allen and Cook were the people claiming—I never saw them, and did not meet them and bring forward a claim—the tillings were sold, but the expenses were more than they realised—the proposal from the International Fish Dinner Company for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was refused—it was brought forward two or three times by Titcomb</p>

               <p>—Hollis brought it forward first—Titcomb said it was a good loan, and that the Baroness Burdett-Coutts was going to support it—I went over the place at the Barbican, came back, and reported at the Board meeting that it was a swindle on the face of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Pryor.</hi> I knew nothing about the internal affairs of the bank, only what I learnt from Titcomb—I did not know Pope was in connection with the bank before your introduction in July—I cannot say if I came across Cheshire's name before then—you were always hanging about the bank—you took no responsibility, I suppose, about the respectability of the people you introduced—the surveyor would inquire into a case and report—I am not aware he reported Pope as a good security—I should not look over the minutes before signing as a rule—you made no representations to me which induced me to refuse or grant a loan—you first spoke to me about it after Titcomb left—you came two or three times—I think you wanted us to go and <hi rend="italic">square</hi> the Sheriff; I said you must go yourself, I could not <hi rend="italic">square</hi> him—we had a trial and lost 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damages—I do not know if you had anything to do with that introduction—I am not aware our manager said he did not like contesting the Sheriff under Mrs. Pryor's bill of sale, and that you said you would contest it; you said you would give us 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to bring all the things away—I believe the bill of sale was contested in the County Court, I know nothing of it—Cook made no claim against the bank—I have not looked at the bill of sale, if I had seen it in Perry's list it would have come to my knowledge—I never saw Mrs. Pryor till she came with you—she made no representations—sometimes the directors looked over Stubbs's list—I believe no remark was made about the loan till after you had gone—we instructed the auctioneer to sell the furniture—we have never asked you for the deficiency—we are great losers—we consented, if you took the Sheriff out and paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, that we would wait—I am not aware when the Sheriff went out or when the goods were removed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STATHAM</hi>. Hollis brought forward Pryor's application—when a loan was applied for it would go into Titcomb's hands; he would give it to Hollis to report on, and Hollis would report on it to Titcomb, who would bring it before the Board—Titcomb has not complained of Hollis, I have complained to him, it has been the matter of mutual complaint between us—the surveyor's report is more important than the introduction; we are obliged to rely on the report and ignore the introduction to a certain extent—I have suggested to Titcomb that I was afraid Hollis was receiving a little black mail—we had no second application for the loan, it never came forward a second time—it was refused the first time because we had such a bad report of Pryor, and I said if we lent him money he would lend out money himself and cut our business away—we had a double reason—as soon as I made that suggestion the directors refused the loan, and the matter was never gone into—I do not think I saw Hollis's report—I know nothing as to whether the surveyor was to be paid if the loan came off—I believe his report was a formal one—a testimonial has been presented to me for my interest in the bank—Titcomb worked hard for the bank—he has complained to me that he had to pay the clerks out of his own pocket; I have made it up to</p>

               <p>him—he volunteered to show the bank that they had made 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loss or thereabouts; he brought the balance-sheet before us—his salary was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5 per cent on the net profits, it was therefore his interest that the bank should make as much profit as possible, as that was the main<lb/>stay of his income—I attended at the bank every day—for a short time I was paid for my attendance—I had sufficient confidence in Titcomb to sign cheques which he put before me without suspicion—I do not think Titcomb said that he had no opinion of Hollis as a surveyor—I have not complained of Cunningham—the bank generally charged 15 to 20 per cent for a loan, generally 20 per cent.—Titcomb did not complain of directors borrowing at a less rate—Birch borrowed at 7 per cent, under peculiar circumstances—the pass-books were produced at each meeting once a week—I have looked at the balance, I have seen the directors looking at it—very often the book was not there, we forgot it two or three weeks—Titcomb has never been with me to the Barbican—he said it would be a good loan, and it was two or three weeks after that that I went—I went inside.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Pryor.</hi> I never spoke to you in my life—I only made two reports for the bank, one was as to a person named Benham, and the other was in the Harrow Road—I can't tell when Benham's was, I have no means of fixing the date, it is not clear to my mind, except that I reported on the case—Benham's was not his first application for money—I have no idea what his first loan was, I know that he had had money from the bank; the directors felt uncomfortable about it, and I was requested to report to the surveyor; it was a much larger amount than 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not seen the bill of sale—it first came to my knowledge that you had had an advance of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a considerable time after—I did not see it in passbook, or notice it at the end of the minutes; it was not read in the usual way or I must have noticed it—the passbook was generally on the table, I don't know that I looked at it—I have frequently signed cheques for any amount that Titcomb put before me—the refusal was some time in September or October, it is entered in the rough minute book as September 20th—I have no knowledge of any application of that character coming before the directors but on that one occasion—I let a portion of my place to Mr. Payne, a solicitor—I am not aware that this bill of sale was carried out by him, he never mentioned it to me—I can</p>

               <p>swear that the minute of the acceptance of the loan was never read in my presence; I don't think it would have passed unchallenged if I had been there, because I had a peculiar idea with regard to your business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Titcomb.</hi> I don't say that you placed this cheque before me to sign, I have no recollection of signing it, but that is the only way in which I can account for it—the cashier has on two, three, or four occasions asked me to sign cheques, it is possible this may have been one; but where one was placed before me by the cashier, 50 have been by you—we opened the Islington branch some time in October, you devoted a good deal of attention to starting that; if you were not at the chief office Penfold would be in charge—I don't know that we were short of clerks at that time—I always looked on Mr. Holder, the chairman, as a businesslike man, I looked upon him as a very clever financial man, I don't think I ever called him a prophet—I cannot say that it was about the time of Pryor's loan that I was asked to report on Benham, or that it was about the time of our dinner at Highbury, it might be about that time—I recollect Pryor's loan being not entertained, I do not recollect it being placed before the Board afterwards—I do not recollect Pryor's application for 200 shares being placed before the Board—I believe he is a shareholder, whether these shares were allotted at that time or not I could not say, I don't recollect it; I could not say whether I was present at that meeting, I was frequently late in coming to the meetings and possibly I might not be present when the minutes were read—cheques have been omitted to be signed at the Board meeting, but it was not usual—there have been differences of opinion at the Board meetings, not what I should call dreadful rows—that was not about the time this loan was brought forward, I should think it would be before that and before the Islington matter—I never heard Mr. Holder say that he only knew what Titcomb told him about business; I know that he, as chairman, very often made reports—I was always under the impression that he was acting under your advice—I think the minute-book was generally on the table—the entry as to Pryor's loan looks very much like being interpolated; the thing is closed up—"loan of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and "granted" are on the same line, which does not occur in any other part of the book—that was written by Penfold—I find in the cash statement immediately following, these minutes an entry of "Pryor 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that does not look as if it was interpolated, the chairman's signature is immediately below that—I believe that was the only sum of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that evening—there is another entry of three figures, in bills, in the same column; there is a break off between "loans" and "bills"—this is the only three figures in loans—I do not know that Penfold has ever been asked about that entry—I have no recollection that the manager reported that he had spoken to Penfold about it—Penfold was not asked before the Board in my presence whether he made the entry—I do not recollect your writing a letter to the Board about the loan in July—I could not say whether it was read; I know there were several letters received from you from the time you left till four or five months after, but whether there was a letter of that character it is impossible for me to say—I have no such letter—I cannot fix the time when I made the Benham survey—I do not know if the surveyor's attendance book is here—I don't think I signed the attend<lb/>ance book as an attendance for making that survey; it was usual to do so, but I don't think I did.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If Pryor's name had come before me I should not have allowed the loan to pass unchallenged, because from time to time I had persistently opposed business introduced by Pryor—I could not positively say whether Ben ham was introduced by him, but I am under the im<lb/>pression that he was—I find Benham's name on 25th October in con<lb/>nection with twelve bills of exchange ordered to be discounted—it would be no part of my duty to report about those; I reported on a further application of his on a bill of sale—my report was with respect to Benham, not Pryor—I should not think that was on 25th October if it was with regard to bills—there was no application from Benham as to a bill of sale, only to bills, and I did not report upon those; it was with regard to some other transaction of Benham's that I had to report; I could not tell whether that was before or after the opening of the Islington branch—Titcomb always attended the Board meetings when I was there.</p>

I see in the rough minute book of 20th September the words "Pryor's loan refused," in Titcomb's handwriting—I remember the loan being refused—I believe it was my proposition that it should not be granted—I don't recollect why it was refused; I know why I refused it myself, it was because I had no faith in Pryor—that was the reason I gave when I proposed it—the loan was unanimously refused—I do not remember its ever being brought before the Board again—I never heard any minute read afterwards that the loan was granted—this is my writing on this cheque of 31st October for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mrs. Mary Pryor—on some occasions cheques were put before us to sign, not on a Board night, and it was said they were omitted on the Board night, and upon the faith of this cheque being drawn and signed by two directors I signed unknowingly; I did not know that I was signing a cheque to Mr. or Mrs. Pryor, I should have demurred to it—Titcomb never called my attention to the fact that that loan had taken 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the bank and was being repaid to the extent of 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had no idea that Pryor was returning money to the bank by way of in<lb/>stalments—I had no idea that he had had a loan—my attention was never called to the transaction by Titcomb—no money came back to my know<lb/>ledge with respect to the loan of Allen and Cook—this entry of "Spink and Hollis to report" is another case; I believe it was to view a house of a man of the name of Benham—I recollect proposing that Spink should accompany the surveyor—I see Benham's name appears in the minute-book—that transaction was all bills—it was on that occasion that Spink was asked to report.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Pryor.</hi> I believe on two occasions only was Spink authorised to report—you was not present when the loan was rejected—I have never spoken to you in my life—I could not tell whether that cheque was endorsed Mary Pryor at the time I signed it; I simply know that the two other signatures were there, and having confidence in Titcomb, thinking it was all right, unfortunately I signed it—I cannot possibly</p>

               <p>recollect the date on which I signed it—unfortunately I did at times sign cheques without reference to anybody, having confidence in Titcomb—they were mostly drawn at the Board—I might perhaps take up the pass<lb/>book at the Board to look at the balance at the time—I did not look at Perry's or Stubbs's Gazette—the then vice-chairman, Mr. Thompson, generally had to look over that—there is a book containing a list of shareholders and the date of allotment—I am aware that you paid something on some shares—I am not certain whether I saw Mrs. Pryor more than once—I never heard her make any offer to settle it; the object of her visit was to argue that she was right in allowing the furni<lb/>ture to be removed by Allen—he took it away on the hire agreement—I never heard of any claim more than this, that Mrs. Pryor said it was on a hire agreement, and that they had taken it away—you were not present on that occasion.</p>

I was to pay 10 per cent, for the other, and I ultimately paid the interest and every farthing of the capital back—I have not been asked to produce the deposit-book; I don't know whether it is here—I gave my promise that it should not be drawn out, and it has all been paid—I do not owe the bank any money now; the bank owe me money—I always received 10 per cent, dividend on my shares up to the time you were in the bank—we paid 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goodwill of the old Company, of which 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash was paid—I never heard that my father borrowed money of the bank.</p>

On Monday, 25th August, I went in company with Inspector Chamberlain and Sergeant Boswell to Gray's Inn Chambers, Holborn, and there saw Errington, Hughlings, and two other persons who gave the names of Tilbury, and the name of Henderson and Co. was on the door—I asked Errington his name—he said "Errington"—I said, "The name of Henderson and Co. appears here"—he said, "Yes, because I am trading here in the name of Henderson, it is my wife's maiden name"—he spoke to Liddle, and then to Hughlings, who said, "My name is Smith"—Chamberlain said he recognised him as Mr. Hughlings; he then told him we were police officers, and read the warrant to him, and said we were going to search the place—at this time there was no warrant against Errington—I asked Hughlings if there were any papers there belonging to him—he said "No"—we found a quantity of papers relating to various companies, which I handed to Mr. Muskett—the other three men then went away, leaving us with Hughlings—Hughlings said, "By what I can see of it I am the victim again," or something to that effect—he said Errington was the promoter of all of them, and he had acted as director and secretary—I took him to the station—he then gave the name of Hugh<lb/>lings, and said he was sorry he had said his name was Smith.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Queen's Walk, Castle Bar, Eating, and am a flour factor—the prisoner had been in my service as groom and gardener up to 6th December last, when I discharged him—I have been in the habit of going to London to collect money for a good many years—the prisoner used to go with me—I drove—he waited with the horse while I went into the shops—I brought home the money in a bag when it was too late for the bank—on 18th December I drove to London and collected altogether about 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, which I had in a linen bag when I returned home between 9 and a quarter past 9 o'clock—I drove up Mount Avenue, which runs by the side of garden—in the Avenue I noticed a man running up, and just as he got out of the dark I had a good look at him—he by the side of my garden paling; he seemed start out of the dark and run towards the garden near the entrance—I drove into the yard, assisted the boy in taking the horse out, and then I took the bag out of the trap and walked towards the house with the bag in my left hand—when I came to the gate between the pleasure-garden and the kitchen-garden, through which I had to go I found a rope tied across, which stopped me—I said "Hallo! what is this?"—I came a step further and met the prisoner; he got hold of me and felt about—I did not know what he meant to do—looked him full in the. face, and thought of giving him one—he gripped me by the right arm, which made me powerless—I noticed another man standing on one side one or two steps from me—the prisoner let go of my right arm and took hold of the bag and made a sharp snatch and had it out of my hand—he and the other man then ran off together—I ran after them, shouting</p>

"Thieves!" and "Murder!" as far as Karr's Fields, below my garden and a terrace of houses—when they got into Karr's Fields, which is rough with refuse and rubbish; I was afraid to follow them, being alone—while the prisoner was running away and within hearing I called out to him "I know you"—a gentleman came out of the bottom house—I ran after a cab and drove in it to the police-station and gave informa<lb/>tion, and the police came up with me to my house—we found the dog. a St. Bernard and bull cross, which was usually kept chained in a kennel by the stable, tied up in the lawn-tennis house—I had not tied it up there, and did not know of its being tied up—the policeman untied it, and it came straight to me; it was a fair watch-dog—I don't say it was friendly to every one; I don't think a stranger would untie it—it had been kept in the stable-yard while the prisoner was in my service; he fed him—I recommended the police to go to the prisoner's house, but they wanted me to drive to the station again, and afterwards we drove to North Fields, I believe, and then to the prisoner's house, 5, Sylvester Terrace, North Fields—the prisoner was up then, and went to bed again—one of the policemen said "You had better behave yourself, because you know me"—the policeman took him into custody, and told him what he would be charged with—I don't remember what the prisoner said—I saw the policeman pick up the prisoner's boots from the room in which he was sleeping, and after the prisoner was charged, I went with the police<lb/>man to my garden with the boots and saw the policeman compare the footmarks with the boots—one of the boots was peculiar; the policeman made a mark with it by the side of the footmark, and they appeared to correspond—we found the rope was partly clothes line and partly sash line; it had never been in that place before—the clothes line was hang<lb/>ing up in the garden, and a piece had been cut off it—I saw no more of the bag or money.</p>

I saw the prosecutor at the station at 10.30—I received information from him of the robbery, and went with him, made inquiries in the neighbourhood, and went to the prisoner's house, 5, Sylvester Terrace, Northfield Lane—the prosecutor gave us the address—I knocked at the door, the prisoner's wife let us in—the prisoner was in bed with his trousers off, partly undressed in the front room—I said "I suppose you know what I want you for?"—he said "No"—I said "This gentleman is going to charge you with stealing a bag containing about 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "I know nothing about it; I was at the Black Horse till 6 o'clock"—I noticed the prisoner's boots standing at the bedside, and saw him put them on—they were dirty and clayey, and there was dirt half way up the back of his. trousers and half way up his back as if lie had been running—I said "You have plenty of dirt about you, is if you have been running, and you seem to have soil on your boots"—he said "It is not soil; I was out in all that rain"—it had been raining previously—the Ealing roads are sandy and clayey, and there are fields—I took the prisoner to the station, where he took his boots off by my direction—I went with them to the prosecutor's house—I found one foot<lb/>mark close to the gate, and one close to where the struggle took place, and two inside the stable gate, not far from where the struggle took place, lead<lb/>ing from the stable yard into the Avenue Road, the way the prosecutor said the men ran in—I made marks with the boots by the side of those foot<lb/>marks; they corresponded in size and shape—the prisoner's left boot had had a toe tip with nails under it, and they corresponded with marks in footprints—on the right boot there was no toe tip, but a tip on the heel—I found corresponding marks for both right and left—I found a piece of clothes line and sash line at the front gate leading to the stable yard—one end was tied to an iron bar driven into the ground, and the other end was lying down right across the footpath, where the prosecutor said he as attacked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prosecutor did not appear overcome with drink—I noticed his left trousers pocket was turned inside out when he got up—I was 40 yards off when I saw the prisoner trip him up; I am certain I saw him, there is a lamp over the club door—I never saw the prisoner take the prosecutor's arm—he put out his left foot before he got up to him—I have made inquiries about the prisoner—he gave a correct address—he has been working at one place for six or seven years, and has been lately discharged on account of coming in late and keeping bad company—he said at the station "Even if I had kept the money till next day I should have given it back to him."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "He is a friend of mine. I did no harm to him. He treated me several times, and he was drunk and I was going to see him home. He fell and his money came out of his waistcoat pocket, and I picked it up and gave it to him, and the half<lb/>sovereign I held in my hand and was lifting him up when the constable came up."</p>

                  </hi>. I am gamekeeper to Mr. William Vale Knight, of Woodlands, Hatch End, Pinner—I have known the prisoners eight years—on 27th December, about 10.30, I was watching in Ruislip Wood; my master has the shooting there—Daniel Weston was with me—I heard a shot a little distance off, and 10 minutes afterwards another shot—it was moonlight—I told Weston to go to Arthur Robart for assistance—he came back in a few minutes, and we went 300 or 400 yards towards where I heard the shots fired—I then heard another shot, ran in that direction, and heard a fourth shot—I heard somebody walking in the underwood, and caught sight of three men apparently kneeling by three trees; they ap<lb/>peared to catch sight of us, and they drew back into the underwood—I went there and got within 12 yards of them—when we got within 5 yards of them they all three rose their guns, levelled them at us, and all three fired—I was struck on my left leg—they then ran into the underwood—I recognised them; they were the three prisoners—I followed them—I had this stick with me and made a strike at Walter Lavender, but one of them took the blow of the stick off and it came down just heavy enough to knock Walter Lavender's hat off—I then made a strike at Massey, knocking him down, and broke my stick in two—I got hold of him by the throat and said "D—you, <hi rend="italic">Jase</hi>, I did not think you would shoot at anybody," and hit him with my fist on the side of his ear and said, "Now if you like to go quietly with me I will take you quietly"—he said "You are mistaken"—I said "What do you mean, <hi rend="italic">Jase?</hi> do you think anybody don't know you?"—he had a gun in his hand—he said "Where are you going to take me, John?"—that is the name they call me—I took him outside the underwood and 300 yards down the broad ride, and heard somebody in the underwood, as if they were walking to get in front of me—I saw somebody coming down the ride and called out "Is that you, Weston?" I received no answer; the figure came on till it was within 20 yards of us, and then I recognised Walter Lavender, whose hat I had knocked off—Massey jumped on one side and Walter Lavender immediately levelled his gun at me—I said "D—you, <hi rend="italic">Joey</hi>, you are a d—lot of cowards for shooting at a man when he is doing his duty;</p>

I live at 21, Cassel Grove, Clapton—on 24th December I was in Gracechurch Street about 9 o'clock—I then had my gold watch worth more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. fixed to a gold chain, which I still have—I stopped to look at a sale of geese, the prisoner walked up to my side and stood by the side of me; he said "These are fine geese, aren't they"—I said "They are, they are cheap"—he said "Yes"—the man selling asked me to feel the weight of one; I did; the prisoner took one in his hand—I said "They weigh about ten or twelve pounds"—the prisoner patted his on the back and said "They don't smell very nice"—I turned back and walked a few yards out of the avenue; he said "I think I know you"—I said "I don't know you;" he said "My father is a farmer down in Norfolk, and he breeds these sort of geese; where do you come from, I am sure I have seen you somewhere, where was it?"—I said "Perhaps you have seen me at Old St. George's-in-the-East;" he said Do you know a man of the name of Pinchen"—I said I did by name; he mentioned several other persons—I said I did not know them—I moved along, he said "Come along and have a glass of something to drink," and he went towards the middle of the road; I said "No, thank you, I don't want it"—he said "Have a half-lemon or a</p>

I said "Yes, that man has taken it"—he said "He has run round the corner"—I went to the corner, he was just a few yards from turning the corner at the bottom of Lime Street—I ran very fast down Lime Street—he was walking round the corner—I put my hand over his shoulder, took hold of his collar, and said "You have stolen my watch"—he said "You are mistaken, I never saw you before, I don't know you"—I said "Never mind, come along"—I took him into Fenchurch Street—he went along quietly with me, protesting he did not know me, and had not seen me before—I held him till the constable came up, and then gave him in charge—I have no doubt he is the man; he must have run very swiftly to get to the bottom of the turning.</p>

               <p>kept them in has been stolen, and I have lost all of them"—I said "Some I person has redeemed some of the jewellery"—he said "I redeemed a gold buckle ring and pledged it again at Pockett's, near Farringdon Station, in my own name; I know nothing about any other property"—I informed the Magistrate of the interview and the prisoner was called as a witness, and stated positively that he knew nothing about any property: the ring had not been identified, and therefore the deposition was not I completed—on 10th December, about 8 p.m., I was with another officer and saw Northcote and his wife at their house, 9, Winchester Terrace, Tottenham; I said "I have received information from your son that he took the proceeds of the burglary to your coffee-house at Kentish Town, and from there to his mother's house at Tottenham, and from there to the place where it is at the present time; are you prepared to give me any information?"—Northcote said "Am I obliged to say anything to crimi<lb/>nate myself?"—I said "Certainly not, I have cautioned you before that I may use your answers against you"—he said "I had nothing whatever to do with it"—he afterwards said to his wife "It is all up, you had better tell them all about it, you had better show them where it is, or they will follow you"—Northcote and his wife then went to 5, Wingmore Road, Tottenham, the address of a friend of Mrs. Nothcote—Mrs. North<lb/>cote entered the house, and we three waited outside; she brought out a parcel and gave it to me, and we then went into a public-house, and in their presence I opened the parcel; it contained this leather bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) containing this silver coffee-pot and tea-pot, sugar-basin, milk-jug, and toast-rack, which Mrs. Day has identified—Northcote said "I have had nothing to do with that lot;" he then said "Will you meet me to<lb/>morrow?"—I said "Yes"—he said "If you will meet me to-morrow I will bring you the tickets for the remainder of the property, and tell you all that I know about it; but if I come to the station will you detain me?"—I said "I can't tell you; you are not obliged to come, you are not obliged to tell me anything; I can't promise you anything, I shall be guided by circumstances"—we arranged to meet at Tottenham Court Road Station next day, at 2 o'clock, and we parted—at 4 o'clock next day I met him; he again said "Do you intend to detain me?"—I said "I don't know—he then said "On a Saturday the boy came to my coffee-house at Kentish Town about 9 o'clock in the morning, he was in an excited state, he had a bag in his possession; I said 'Don't bring that here to get me into trouble, take it away;' he went away, but re<lb/>turned, and afterwards took away the property; before he went he gave me this lamp and cap and told me to throw them out of a train window"—they have both been identified by Mrs. Day—they were, in the bag—he also had a fish-knife and fork in a case, and two brushes, and he said to me 'These are no good to me, I am going to break them up;' I said to him 'No, don't do that, give them to me,' and I after<lb/>wards pledged them for safety because the boy should not get hold of them; here are the tickets"—the pawnbroker produces the things to-day—I pointed out to him that they were pledged in the name of Henry Newman, Hawley Road, and said "If you were acting honestly, why did you not give your correct name and address?"—he said "Because I did not want to get into trouble"—he also gave me these three tickets, and said "I asked the boy to let me have these to take care of"—they relate to a watch and chain, the proceeds of the burglary, and the others to a</p>

                  </hi>. I am the estimate clerk of Henry Blacklock and Co., wholesale printers of Farringdon Road and also of Manchester—I keep an order book—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is order book No. 3, I, also produce a work note A 3045—I recollect passing that through the order book in the usual way—Mr. Partridge would give me instructions, but there is no writing of his on it—I either enter it in the book myself or my assistant would do it, I should check it before it went into the department—the entry is made under my instructions, but I did not see it made—this word "House" in one of the columns of the order book in red pencil is Partridge's writing—the entry is "A. 3045 Robinson, Stacey, and Co., 5,000 <hi rend="italic">Illus.</hi> catalogues, demy quarto, and working 2,000 into the boots and 3,000 without, as explained to Mr. Graham"—this catologue answers the description of the one in that order—the word "House" is also written on the top of the work note, to the best of my belief that is Fletcher's writing—Partridge was general manager, a new customer would be referred to him, Fletcher was head of the warehouse and store department—when I had got this matter in order I passed it forward to the printing department—if the work had to go through more than one department it would go to each department in turn for the purpose of the different kinds of work—when the work is completed through all the departments it comes back to me to be filled up and charged out for me to price the articles; the work note shows the prime cost of all the articles in each department, and I put on a certain <hi rend="italic">per centage</hi> of profit and pass it on to Mr. Partridge—when it is all priced out I take it to him and he passes it into the counting-house for the price to be entered</p>

               <p>in the day-book under the heading of the particular customer—Partridge ought to sign it before it goes into the counting-house; 3045 is not signed by him—it would be posted from the day-book to the customer's account in the ledger—I have searched the day-book for that date, and there is no entry of that order—there is an account of Robinson, Stacey, and Co. in it on two pages, "bought" on one side and "sold" on the other, but I find no entry of these goods to their debit at any time—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the delivery books—there is an entry in the order-book for circulars A 3047—that is the next entry to A 3045, it is "Robinson, Stacey, and Co., demy quarto circulars," he does not say how many—this is Fletcher's lithographed writing.

               <p>price in the work note, and in this case the order was not completed, and until it was done the work note would not come to me—when I carried out the cost price on the work note I did not assume that the work was done, because I knew the thing had been stopped through their dismissal—I knew that it had not been done, but I assumed that it had been in order to carry out the cost—orders are not paid for before they are com<lb/>pleted unless we are paid by instalments—besides these catalogues some keys to them were printed; that was a separate order from Robinson, Stacey, and Co.—I think the catalogues would be to a great extent useless without the key, but not absolutely—the key is explanatory of each article enumerated, to give the price of it—I can't tell you the meaning of this"2,000 name" at the bottom, but Mr. Graham, to whom the memo<lb/>randa refers, will tell you—on the face of it it does not appear whose catalogue it is, but the key would explain that.</p>

               <p>I knew about the circulars was I was sent up on some business upstairs to Mr. Fletcher on Blacklock's premises, and he gave me about a dozen of them; these cards were placed inside the circulars; he also gave me them, and said he was sending out, or he had sent out, 1,700 of the cards and circulars—I kept various books at Robinson and Staoey's, and a little black book—Fletcher had the day book and ledger, I have seen them in his possession at his master's premises—he made a remark once about the price of the work, and I mentioned to him that he had over<lb/>charged; it was some building work or office fittings—a great number of letters and post-cards came after I had seen the circulars and after he told me he had sent them out—I recollect the catalogues coming to Goswell Road—I did not know that they were coming—they came in 40 parcels; I did not know what they contained; the carman spoke to me, I refused to take them, and he spoke to me again and I took them in—he did not present any delivery note, nor did I sign for the parcels—two or three clays after I took them in I saw Fletcher at the prosecutor's premises—I said, "I have shut Goswell Road, as I can't agree with you any longer as to the working of it," and I told him as to the 40 parcels of catalogues which he had sent over and I would not receive them—he pulled his coat up and said, "I have got somebody to put in your place "—he made an arrangement to come over at dinner-time and take die key and lock the place up himself—I waited for him till 1 o'clock; he did not come, and I locked the place up myself—I then went to him and offered him my card and address, and told him as he would not come over I had locked up the place—I offered him the key; he would not take it, and I afterwards gave it up to the landlord—on the Thursday, I think, he came over in the evening and went over the place, and asked me what it all arose out of—I said in the way he worked the business, I could not continue with him any longer—he asked mo if I would throw Mr. Partridge out and take the business up with him—I said "No"—in September I saw some of Mr. Fletcher's men removing the goods from the Goswell Road premises into a van—Fletcher's brother was there—I followed the van to 40, Hendon Street, Pimlico, where there was the name of "A. and W. Fletcher" on the side of the wall—I saw the goods delivered there—I had left the 40 parcels of catalogues at Goswell Road, retaining the key—there was no duplicate key to my knowledge—about a fortnight after that I went to the premises and unlocked them with my key, and saw one catalogue out of the 40 parcels lying on a bench—the 40 bundles were delivered on August 23rd—I had a settlement with Blacklock and Co. on July 16th, and received a cheque for 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount was taken off, which balanced the account up to that date, including, I believe, a settlement of all entries on their side—I took the cheque upstairs to Mr. Fletcher at Blacklock's warehouse, and gave it to him—he told me to go and get it changed, as he could not, and I did so; I brought back the money and gave it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutors' manager, I was ap<lb/>pointed on 11th September, about a fortnight after Partridge's dismissal—up to that time I had no connection with the firm—on September 30th I received a communication from Staley, and I informed Mr. Blacklock—I then requested Stacey to attend me in my private room on the premises—I showed him a catalogue with the name of Robinson, Stacey, and Co., 304, Goswell Road, London, in it, and said "Do you know anything of this firm Robinson, Stacey, and Company?"—he said "No"—I asked him again, and he still said no—I said "Do you know there have been some catalogues delivered to them?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Have you a signature for them?"—he said "No"—I said "Can you get the signature for them?"—he said "I can"—I said "I want it by to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock"—he left, and in the evening he came again and asked for Mr. Blacklock after he had left—next morn<lb/>ing he saw Mr. Blacklock and myself—I asked him whose canceling this was on the work sheet—he said "I wrote the word 'House'"—I saw him on October 1st, and he said "I can't get the delivery notes signed for"—I said "Do you think after this we can keep you in our employ? if I had seen Mr. Blacklock last night I should not have been here this morning: although you deny all knowledge of Robinson, Stacey, and Company, you are a partner with them"—he said "Yes"—he was asked if he was a partner in the firm of A. and W. Fletcher—he said "No"—I had not seen this circular or card on October 1st, nor had I seen any entry or want of entry with reference to them, or any erasure or can<lb/>cellation in the books, more than a line drawn through in the order book—as he left I said that he stood in a very serious position and it was open to us to give him in custody—he said "I hope you will not prose<lb/>cute me criminally."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Crow-examined.</hi> On 30th September I first discovered that these men were carrying on the business of Robinson, Stacey, and Company—I do not know that Garrett knew of it; he ought to have reported it to me or to Mr. Blacklock—I should not have allowed it—of these 6,000 catalogues, 2,000. went to Robinson, Stacey, and Company, and 4,000 are still with us—the entry in the book does not say that a portion of the 6,000 were for the house, and I have a very great doubt about it—the 6,000 would be printed at far less cost <hi rend="italic">pro rata</hi> than 2,000—above 2,000 of the catalogues have Blacklock's name on the slip.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commissionaire, 268, living at 2k, Victoria Dwellings, Battersea Park Road—I have previously been in the Army—on Saturday, 13th December, about 2.30, I was in King Street, St. James's, the prisoner came up, tapped me on the shoulder, and said "Are you doing anything?" I said "Nothing particular"—he said "Can you go a message for me?" I said "If it is not too far"—he said "Scott's Bank"—"I said "You mean Sir Samuel Scott's"—he said "Yes, I want you to get a cheque cashed for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and take it to the Naval and Military, Piccadilly; if I am not there wait; I am sure to be there, I am only going to Charing Cross"—he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and this unfastened envelope, with the cheque enclosed—he said "Look sharp, it is nearly 3 o'clock"—I said "I had better take a cab"—I did so and drove to the bank—when I got into the cab I took</p>

               <p>the cheque out of the envelope to see if it was payable over the counter and all right; there was nothing in the envelope but the cheque, it was payable to bearer—I presented it over the counter at the bank—I think the cashier had some consultation with somebody, and after that he returned me the cheque with the words written at the bottom "Requires another signature"—he declined to cash it—I brought the envelope and cheque away and went to the Vine Street Police-station, where I saw an officer, made a communication to him, and left Vine Street with two officers in plain clothes following me at some distance—I went to the Naval and Military Club, waited outside for some time, but could not find the prisoner—a boy then came up to me and gave me a message, in conse<lb/>quence of which I went to Swan and Edgar's, where I waited some little time and then the prisoner came up; he said "Have you got it?"—I said "No, it requires another signature"—I delayed a little taking it out of my pocket to allow the detectives to come up, and then I took it out and gave it to him with the envelope, with the cheque uppermost—he seemed very much surprised, and said "Where?"—I pointed out to him where it was written that it required another signature, he said "Is that all they said?"—I said "Yes"—the detectives then came up and took him away to the station—I had a full opportunity of seeing Him at King Street, and have not the least doubt that the prisoner is the man who gave me the cheque in the envelope—at the station I saw a constable pick up a piece of paper from the floor by him while he was being searched.</p>

On the 11th September, 1883, I was at Platt Street Station about 9 o'clock when the prosecutor came and made a complaint, and gave a description of certain men—he was smothered in mud, one of his trousers pockets was torn out—I afterwards saw George Hines, who gave me certain information—from that date in September, 1883, till the 17th December, 1884, I did not see the prisoner—I then saw him in the same public-house, the Grown, and said I should take him into charge on suspicion of the robbery on this date—he said "you have made a mistake"—on the way to the station I said "I traced you to the Dials after the robbery"—he said "I did not go to the Dials then, I have been living at Holloway"—I brought the prosecutor to the station, and he picked the prisoner out from seven others.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I first mentioned the horses, and it was on the proposal about six horses that Regan told the clerk to call Bastow in, and I saw Bastow for the first time; that was 8th October—the horses were my own property—I had bought some of them in August as a speculation to sell—I used my own judgment in bringiig them to England—Regan asked Bastow if he would go and look at the horses—the first consignment of cattle was to Ffolliott, Nephew, and Co., for which we got a cheque, the other consignment of eight and eleven were to Ffolliott, Nephew, and Co.—I did not see Bastow in connection with this—I asked him first about 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the horses, and came down from that to 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some of them were small cobs, none of them were 15 hands high; one of them was dose to 15, two of them were a little over 12—they were a rough breed, and I told him they had suffered from the voyage—the proprietor of the yard said they were not worth more than 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we came in, and each put down in writing what he thought—I had put 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he put 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I would not give way, and he took the horses at my price, 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said before he started Regan had given him a bill of exchange in blank, and he would fill it up for the amount—we dined together at Bristol—I took the horses to the railway, they were booked for Paddington I think; he booked them—Bastow gave me no money for my trouble and expenses; he asked me what I was going to stand him—I said I was rather short—he said "Don't shorten yourself for me"—I said "I can give it to you when Mr. Regan gives me the cheque; I could give you a cheque, but I am overdrawn at the bank, and perhaps it won't be cashed"—I gave him a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was dishonoured—the next time I saw Bastow he was in custody, and has been locked up ever since—when committed for trial Marshall asked the Magistrate for an order to take possession of</p>

               <p>these cattle and horses—Bastow said he had nothing to do with them, he might do what he pleased with them, and Regan's Counsel said that if I took an account of what the cattle and horses were sold for, and put it against the 276<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, he would not object—that was some time before the bill had matured—it was understood at the police-court that the bill would be dealt with at that time—I have since sold two of the cows for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, they were two little ones, and three horses; one sold for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., another for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the greenyard had injured that—there would hare been more chance of making profit by waiting; one would have been worth 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Row next year—Bastow said nothing to me about sending the cattle to Canada.</p>

I am employed by Arnold as a travelling cattle Agent—I live at Jersey—on 24th October I came over with six of Mr. Arnold's cows with rugs and halters—I arrived at Waterloo about ten minutes past two on Friday 24th October—Mr. Arnold had given me verbal instructions what to do, and a letter addressed to Regan—I saw Regan at Waterloo—when I arrived he was standing in the booking-office—after I had signed for the cattle Regan said "Have you come with these cattle? Mr. Arnold had no occasion to send a man with them"—I said it was Mr. Arnold's rule to send a man to receive the cash and to take charge of the cattle across the water—the cattle were brought to the Waterloo office by the porters, and I said "Here they are, Sir"—Regan said "We cannot remove them till seven o'clock at night through the streets of London: you had better send them round to the Waterloo stables, and in the meantime you had better jump up with me and come to the office for a settlement"—there was a Hansom's cab there—I sug<lb/>gested that I should give the animals some hay and water as they had had nothing in the train—I went to his office after I had attended to the cows—I got to 1, Westminster Chambers, about three; the name up was Ffolliott, Nephew, and Company; Alberta Cattle Ranche Company—I waited there till about ten minutes past four in the waiting room; he appeared to have other gentlemen doing business with him—I wanted to get back to Jersey that night—I was called in; he said "You will be too late for the bank to-night if I give you a cheque, you had better come in the morning and I will settle with you, and you will get back to Jersey on Sunday morning"—I asked him what time the office would be open—he said 11, but that he might not be there before 11.30—I gave him the order for the delivery of the cows, by means of which he could obtain them, on the condition I was paid the next morning—the next morning, Saturday, the 25th, I was there at 11; I found a boy at the door—I think Mr. Regan came just before 12—I had to wait till about 1 before I was called in—I demanded cash for the cattle—the prisoner told me he could not do it, their conditions were 14 days, by bill; he said "If my partners in the firm were here I might be able to pay you," but that they were out buying Herefords, that they were going to make a great shipment to America—I asked him what line they were going by—he said he had not exactly arranged yet—I asked him if my six little Jerseys were going with them—he said "Yes"—I said "When are you going to ship them?"—he told me the latter end of next week, but that he could not tell me the line—I asked him the line; he said he had not yet de<lb/>cided—I demanded to know where the cattle were, but he said "I will give you this bill; I cannot pay you before 14 days"—I said "I cannot take this, Sir; my instructions are to receive cash from my employer"—he said "You must have this promissory note"—I thought it was a bad job then—I demanded the cattle or cash—he told me I was a very stupid fellow, or pretended to be one, if I did not understand a bill of that kind—I said "Who are your bankers?"—he told me the Imperial Banking Company—I said "It is of no use, I must have my cattle back," and I wanted to know where he had put them to—he began to go off, and told</p>

Bird"—I never heard of any other partner who was to sign, those were the only two signatures—on 7th October, 1884, the balance was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I was clerk in October, 1883, to Bastow, who was then trading at 3, Lawrence Lane as Cooper, Sons, and Co., accountants and partnership negotiators—during the latter part of the time Bastow was there he was visited by Regan, who had an office at 11, Clement's Lane, I understood, and who always said, I under<lb/>stood, that he came from America to float the North Park Cattle Ranche Company—I do not think that was registered—in March or April last year Bastow and Regan went together to Royal Exchange Buildings, and I went with them as clerk—the name of "Ffolliott and Nephew' was adopted there, and "The North Park Company" and "Wyoming Company" were put up—I have heard a Mr. Ffolliott who lived at Chicago spoken of there, and I have seen a photograph of him; I never</p>

               <p>saw him there—I always understood Bastow was a partner—about June last year we moved to the Westminster Chambers, where "The Alberta Company" was first put up—I never heard of a manager at Royal Exchange Buildings who absconded—I wrote this letter to Messrs. Bligh at Bastow's direction on 1st November; he was not on the Continent then—I also wrote this of 21st November saying that the period of credit had not yet expired—I cannot swear that the endorsement on Mrs. Wright's cheque is in Regan's writing.</p>

Bastow told me to write something untrue to Mr. Bligh, and five days afterwards pointed out that the term of credit had not expired—Regan was not then in the same office as Bastow—a girl many letters were written and received from Colonel Dennis in respect to the leases—I do not know of two 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheques sent to him; I believe they were to be delivered up on payment of another 50/.—the plan was for a syndicate to buy from Regan and Bastow, but I don't know for what amount; it was only being floated at that time that the company might be formed to buy from the syndicate—many gentlemen entered into that syndicate and paid several hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>John Royle—he lived with his wife in the barracks next door to us—his wife's name was Elizabeth, and her age was—on Wednesday, the 31st December last, I heard Royle and his wife quarrelling about 9.30 at night—I heard him swearing and heard him say "There, there," and he said "Go to b——"—he said that three times, and after that I heard something fall—I mean that something went on the floor as if somebody had fallen down, and I heard the prisoner's wife say "Oh, Johnny"—the next thing I heard was that they were still quarrelling, but not so loud—I heard the prisoner say "I will let you know that I am your master, and the master of this house"—our rooms are separated from the prisoner's by a brick wall only, and I should say that it is a single brick—I knew the deceased woman quite well—on Saturday, January 3rd, I went in to see her about 9 o'clock in the evening, and she com<lb/>plained of pains in her head and stomach—I did not notice her eyes that night, but on the Sunday morning I saw that she had a black eye—she died on Monday, January 5th, about half-past 11—before she died, in consequence of what she told me, I spoke to the prisoner and said "If she gets over this it will be a caution to you not to hit her again"—he made no reply whatever to that—I have known the woman since March last year; she was a sober woman and a very hard-working woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Physi<lb/>cians, and medical officer of the 31st Regimental district—on the 2nd of January I went to the deceased Elizabeth Royle; she complained of pain in her abdomen—I asked her if she could account for it—I noticed the next day that she had a black eye, her left eye, and I put certain ques<lb/>tions to the prisoner upon that—I asked him how his wife came by. That black-eye; he said that he did not know—next day, the 4th, she appeared to be considerably worse; she complained of pain in her abdomen stilly especially on the left side; she complained of her left side all through—I continued to attend her, and she died on the 5th—I made a post-mortem examination on the 6th, and found the peritoneum exceedingly inflamed; that is the serous membrane of the abdomen—there was a livid mark about 3 inches long by 2 1/2 inches, on the outside of the abdomen, cor<lb/>responding with a mark on the stomach—the lungs were somewhat con<lb/>gested and adherent to the chest—that was not significant of the cause of death—the cause of death was peritonitis, that is inflammation of the peritoneum—the heart was healthy.</p>

She said she would, but I don't know whether she did or not. I left her about 10 o'clock in the morning and mounted guard, and did not see her till 1 o'clock, when she said she was no better. She was going out to work that afternoon. I told her not to go as she did not feel well. She went to work, and came home about 6 o'clock in the evening. I saw her again about 7 o'clock, and she went down to the dispensary in the town, where she had medical treatment. I saw her again about 9 o'clock, when she said she was no better. I did not see her again before 8.30 a.m. on the 28th ultimo. She brought me my breakfast. She was no better then. I did not see her again until 10.50 a.m., when I dismounted guard. About 1.50 she went to bed, and remained there that day. I gave her the medicine as directed. About 8 p.m. she asked for some brandy, which I gave her. She went to rest and I did not see her until about 8.30 a.m on the 29th ultimo. She then asked for a cup of cocoa, which I gave her. I was with her during the morning, and she asked for some brandy, which I gave her. I told Mrs. Rogers, and Mrs. Herbert, and Mrs. Thomas, that my wife was ill in bed, and they asked what was the matter, and I said I could not tell them unless it was a cold. She was in bed all day on Monday, the 29th, and on the next day (Tuesday) she got up about 1 o'clock. She went to bed about 9.30 p.m., got up on Wednesday (31st ultimo), and she was a little better. She went down to the washhouse to do a day's washing. I asked if she could not put it out for some other person to do, but she would do it herself. In the evening she complained to the people in the washhouse that she could hardly stand, and I used some rather hasty words to her at about 9.30 p.m. Afterwards, as she was getting up out of her chair, she caught her foot in the wringing machine and that caused her to fall. When I went to pick her up she said "Oh, Johnny!" We went to bed, and in the morning she complained of her cold being had again; she remained in bed all day on the 1st January, and about 10 a.m. I asked her if she would see the medical officer; she said "No," but asked me for a little more brandy, and I got it for her and gave it to her hot. On the Friday, 2nd January, the medical officer came to see her. I was up all night with her on the 1st January. About 10 a.m. on the 2nd I had to leave to mount guard. I left a little girl with her until Mrs. Gee could go to her. I saw no more of her till about 5 minutes past 10 on the 3rd January. I did not give my wife the black eye, and what the witnesses have said is incorrect. I noticed the black-eye on the morning of the 3rd, when I came off guard. I cannot account for how she got the black eye. I deny using any violence to my wife.—J. Royle.'"</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to a dressing case maker and live at 29, Tynemouth Road, Tottenham—my wife is Adelaide Louisa Gay—we have two children—in August, 1882, I went to Australia for my health, and returned on June 25, 1884—when I saw my wife she was very stout, and I learned that she was in the family way—she showed me some letters, and I learned that Jones was the father of the child—I then wrote this letter to Jones dated 22nd August: "Dear Sir,—Having read the letters received by Mrs. Gay from you, I am much surprised at your refusing to have an interview with me as asked, and further at your making a proposal to see my wife to-morrow afternoon when you suppose that I shall be at business. I shall make it my business to call and see you on Monday morning about ten o'clock or soon after, as this matter has gone far enough, and you seem to think it very lightly, and expect Mrs. Gay to square the whole thing up without you having the trouble not to say annoyance of seeing me. Awaiting your early reply, &amp;c.—<hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR R. GAY. P.S</hi>.—Mrs. Gay was answering your letter when I arrived home this evening, and I destroyed it, and have forbidden her to either receive or write letters to you again, as from the tone of yours there it seems as though there was a great deal of affection still going on.—A. R. Q"—I saw Jones on the Sunday morning, but I was going out to dinner, and merely had a short conversation with him—we made an appointment for Monday or Tuesday, when I met him outside the Holborn Restaurant and told him I would not have the child in the house after it was born, and he must make some provision for it and take it away—he said that he would try and find somebody to adopt it—his brother Frederick came to see me once or twice, and we went to the Holborn Restaurant and had a conversation, and on 12th October I wrote this letter to Jones. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 12/10/84, <hi rend="italic">and commencing "Dear Sir" it stated that the witness had informed Frederick Jones that he knew of a woman who would take the child for</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and keep it and bring it up as her own, which would be cheaper than paying</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week for its support till it was</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">or</hi> 14 <hi rend="italic">year of age. Signed</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR R. GAY</hi>.) After that I saw Jones in front of the Holborn Restaurant about the end of October—he said that he could not pay the amount, it was too much money; he was hard up, but he thought he could get somebody to take it for less money—I saw him several times afterwards, and then wrote him this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated October</hi> 29, 1884, 113, <hi rend="italic">High Holborn, stating that he had placed the matter in the hands of his solicitor, and was in possession of all the letters written by Jones to Mrs. Gay, which he should use against Jones on a charge of attempting to procure abortion.</hi>) I then wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated October</hi> 29, <hi rend="italic">commencing "Dear Sir" stating that he had been obliged to call in a nurse and pay her four guineas, for which he requested a</hi> P.O. <hi rend="italic">order, and stated that to wife's illness was greatly in consequence of the stuff which he, Jones, had give her.</hi>) I saw him again on 28th November, and afterwards received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188412290164"/>
               <p>this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 28.11.84, <hi rend="italic">appointing a meeting outside Holburn Restaurant at</hi> 9.39 <hi rend="italic">that night.</hi>) I met him there and he said that he had found somebody to adopt the child for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and should have to borrow the money from his father-in-law—I asked him for the nurse's fee he said he could not pay me till after Christmas, he was so hard up—on 7th December I wrote this letter to him. (<hi rend="italic">Insisting upon the nurse for being sent by return of post, and the doctor's fee as soon as the confinement took place, or the matter would be laid before Jones's father by</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">o'clock on Monday afternoon.</hi>) I received this answer, "Yours just to hand, and if you write to the governor I shall certainly let the matter take its chance, and you may take what proceedings you like, which I find upon advice your chances upon recovering anything are very small. W. Jones." The child was born on the 9th, and I wrote this letter: "Dear Sir,—The child is born and alive. I must see you to-morrow morning, the first thing, to arrange for its immediate removal. <hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR R. GAY</hi>. P.S.—If You cannot come, send your brother or some one." Jones did not come; but on 10th December the prisoner Walker came—that was the first time that I had seen him—he said that Jones would not come, and had sent him, and he or Jones would meet me at Liverpool Street Station at 8 or 8.15 the next evening to receive the child—on the next evening Mrs. Barnes the nurse took the child to Liverpool Street Station, and I met them there—about 8.10 Jones and Kate Day arrived, the nurse was in the waiting—room with the child—Jones asked me if the child was registered—I said "No, you had better get it registered in the name of the woman who is to adopt it"—I asked him to give me the address of the woman that I was to send the box of clothes to; he said he could not give it to me then, but he would send it next morning—he never sent it—the child was handed to Kate Day by the nurse, with a bottle of food and a parcel containing a change of clothes—on the 13th Jones's brother came to see me, and showed me an account in a newspaper of the other prisoner and Kate Day being arrested, in consequence of which I went and saw Jones at Denmark Hill that afternoon, Saturday—I asked him if he had any idea that the child was going to be done away with; he said no, he would sooner have paid hundreds of pounds than the matter should have been exposed, and he thought of running down to Brighton for a day or two—I told him he had better not—he said that Walker was to have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Long 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Barnard 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not certain about the amounts, but there were two fives, and Walker was to have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Jones told me that the cab was to drive to the Station Hotel, Camberwell New Road, and that he should have been a fool to have done such a thing in the light if he wanted to get rid of the child, that he introduced Kate Day to Walker outside the Station Hotel, and they went to the place of meeting with the child; but previous to that Jones told me that Barnard's wife was confined to her bed, and could not take the child, and Barnard would do so—I said that somebody ought to go and see the prisoner Walker; Jones said he had been advised not to go near them—on the following Monday Jones and his brother came to my business address, and I told them that I should go and see Walker on Tuesday morning: Jones said, "Very well," and he said that he could not very well go, as it would seem as if he came from Walker's friends.</p>

               <p>no intention of committing the offence of conspiracy to murder—the Station Hotel is close to the Camberwell Road station of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway—Jones told me that he and Walker had been at school together, and he vouched for Walker that he had no more idea of murder than himself—I did not go to see Walker.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Addressing him as "My dear Will" informing him that her husband had found out all about it, and asking him to run over on Sunday morning, and to be sure and burn the letter.</hi>) I afterwards wrote him this letter.

               <p>myself were working at—Long spoke to me on several occasions, and said that he hoped the job would soon come off—he said "I may as well tell you that Walker is the first one who mentioned it to me, and I am puzzled to know what he has to do with it"—on the 10th December about 6.30, when I left work I saw Long outside the gate—he said "Are you ready to do that job to-night?"—I said "No, I am not, I have an ap<lb/>pointment to keep"—he said "Never mind, it is to come off to-morrow night at 9.30 in the Burton Road, exactly as the clock is on the strike of the half-hour, we shall stand under one lamp post on one side of the way, and the woman who brings the child under the other, and exactly at that time we shall cross over and meet each other, she will then hand you the child and a bag or parcel containing ten sovereigns; I have made a capital arrangement for disposing of it, and that is to take it to Lewisham "Waterworks"—I said "I know nothing about Lewisham"—he said "I do, I know every inch of the ground, you turn down a narrow passage out of the main street, where there are not many people about as a rule, so that you can easily throw it over; no one will hear a splash, there is such a noise with the fall of the water that it will drown any sound of the splash being heard; we shall have to take a cab from the Peckham Road way, but we must keep it quiet before we get there"—that is, keep the child quiet—"I have also thought of a good plan for an excuse for not bringing a woman into the matter; I have told them that the woman I engaged is likely to be confined, so had to let her husband into the secret, so you can tell them when they bring the child that your <hi rend="italic">missus is a bed</hi> just confined, and so you have come; I have seen a third party, so I know it will be all right; I shall be outside your place to-morrow night waiting for you when you leave work, as I don't want to lose sight of you"—I told him I should have to consider over it again, and we parted—I saw Mr. Ford next morning and told him, and the policemen called on me at 10 o'clock, he having sent for them—I told them and acted under their orders—I left work at 6.30 and found Long making for me—I went down the road with him, he said the arrange<lb/>ment about Lewisham was the best he could make, that he had some newspaper in his pocket, but he thought it was hardly large enough to wrap a child in—he said "As soon as we get the money we can buy some canvas at a shop and make a neat bundle, and there we can change one of the sovereigns; I will show you the spot in the Burton Road where we are to meet the woman with the child, shall we walk to the place?" pointing to the exact spot where she would meet us—I said I told my wife I was going to work late to-night, we walked about, and at a few minutes to 9.30 we went to the place he had pointed out—after waiting a minute, Walker called him, saying "Is that you, Long?"—I said "Good God, that is Walker, what is he doing here?"—he said "Nevermind, you keep quiet"—they walked up the road, and after talking a minute or so Long returned, called me, and said, "You go up to about there, where you saw us stop, and you will see a woman bring the child down the road; you will have nothing to say, as I have told him that your wife is confined, and you are the husband"—Long went round the corner, I went to the spot, and after a minute or two Miss Day came down the Knatchbull Road and brought the child to me, and the parcel and this canvas bag containing ten sovereigns—she only said she had dropped the feeding bottle—she then left, and Inspector Moore jumped over the fence and</p>

The first time I saw Walker was on a job at Little College Street—Long paid him deference as if he was some one of importance, and he treated Long as a workman—I only worked one night with Long; he employed me again at Peckham, and told me the house belonged to Walker's father—I just told the outline of the story to Mr. Ford, and then I told it in the presence of Finch and Wethered—I was then taken to the solicitor's office at the Treasury and told it there, and then to the Magistrate—when Long said "I may as well tell you that Walker is the first person I have mentioned it to," that was the only occasion when he mentioned Walker's name—I told the Magistrate that Long said "I have found a very good spot for it, and that is Lewisham Waterworks"—when he said "The woman I have en<lb/>gaged is likely to be confined," he added "and expects to go to bed every day"—Walker was on the other side of the way, and called out loudly "Is that you, Long?"—I recognised his voice and spoke, and was told to be quiet—I have never said that if I had known that Walker had been there with the baby that night I would have gone and told him that the police were on the watch, or that I would have warned him—I had not heard his name for some weeks before that.</p>

I said 'As you like.' He said 'I left it with my friend Walker, entirely in his hands: I am innocent of the charge of doing away with the child.' He said he had found a woman to adopt the child.

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live at 74, St. Mark's Road, Kennington—on Monday evening, 22nd December, about half-past 8, I was at Camberwell Green, and saw the prisoner driving a butcher's cart from Peckham towards Camberwell Road, about 10 or 12 miles an hour—he was on his off side of the road; his wrong side—he crossed the corner instead of going round it, crossing the metals of the tramcar on to his near side and in front of a butcher's shop, there he Knocked the deceased down and the wheel passed over her—he passed two tramcars before knocking her down—he drove on, turned into Waterloo Street, and I lost sight of him—I did not know him before.</p>

I was at Camberwell Green on the evening of 22nd December—I saw the cart which the prisoner was driving, I was alighting from a tramcar at the time, on the side of the Green—I could not form an estimate of the pace at which he was going, but it was very fast, a furious pace I should call it—he was 40 yards from the corner, as near the middle of the road as possible—I saw the woman knocked down and apparently run over by the cart; she was crossing the road on the tram line—the prisoner stood up in the cart, whether he was actually whipping the horse or not I could not swear, but his action was suggestive of it, it conveyed that impression to my mind—he drove off at a very furious pace; I ran after him, and shouted after him, as did a number of other people—I could not keep up with him—he turned out of the main road—I don't know where his employer lived.</p>

About 8 on the evening of 22nd December I was with Constable Smith at Camberwell Green—I heard a woman scream, turned round, and saw her lying in the middle of the road and the cart driving away about 20 yards from her—I ran after it and called out for him to stop, and so did others—he turned into Waterloo Street and was stopped in about 230 yards; he was going very fast—he appeared to slacken his pace just before he was stopped—his master's shop is in the main road, about 50 yards ahead—by turning into Waterloo Street he went out of his way—there were 10 carcases of sheep and a dead calf in the cart—he had the reins in one hand and the whip in the other—I could not swear that he used the whip.</p>

I told them I was glad they had. I don't know who the two men were who fetched them away out of my room; I don't think I should know them again. I was not up when they came; it was about nine in the morning."—Tubbs stood by and heard all this, but did not say a word—I took him to the station and charged him—he said "You have made a mistake."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There is "com." in Taylor's account—that meant com<lb/>mission—you will see the same word written against ft portion of the goods, and "contract" against others—4 think these are in Ralph's, writing, and he would tell me to put "contract" here—in all the items of Tatlor's bought account the contracts are made by Mr. Ralph, and he reports to me, and in that way the items go to the contract part of the account, he has marked the items which are commission—with regard to this cheque of 10th January being split into two, my, impression is that I said, "What are these two cheques for?" and Mr. Ralph said, "Well, that makes up the account, don't it?"—I do not know how Ralph was, feeding his private account at the bank, it is not the subject of audit by the auditor.</p>

I am the last witness's daughter—on the night of the 31st, from what my father said to me, I followed the prisoner to the corner of South wark Park Road, where he crossed the road, went past our house again, and turned into the urinal at the corner of Fort Road—when he came out he went to Willow Walk—I then saw a constable and gave him into custody—I did not lose sight of him; he did not go into a public-house all that time—when given into custody he said "What do you want me for"—the constable said "You come in here and wait and see"—the constable took him to the station and sent for my father, who came.</p>

I live at 216, Whitecross Street, Barbican—on Sunday morning I was riding in a Hansom's cab in High Street, Borough, the wind blew my hat off, I stopped the cab, my sister got out to get the hat—the prisoner came and said "What's up?" I said "My hat"—he made a snatch at my locket and chain—I jumped out of the cab and held him tight—my husband, my sister, and her husband were in the cab—my husband jumped out and assisted me—the prisoner gave back the locket and said, "Have mercy on me for Heaven's sake, I have given you back your property, let me go"—my friend said "No, you have got my locket"—he called out "Police"—the prisoner threw the locket into the bottom of the cab, he said "I have given you your property, but have mercy on me for Heaven's sake."</p>
