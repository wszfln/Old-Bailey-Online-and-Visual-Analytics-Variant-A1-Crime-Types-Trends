On obtaining the machine, after signing the order-book, I handed it to the man representing him<lb/>self to be Dr. Mackenzie's man, and his friend, and they departed west<lb/>ward in a hansom. I was out of employment at the time; I was glad to earn the half-crown I received. Had I had any intent to defraud I should not have given my own name, and written it in the book."</p>

M. Lewis, Picture Frame Dealer, etc., 222, New King's Road, Fulham"—the next day I recognised his voice when I was rung up on the telephone—he said he was Lewis, who called the night before, and he wanted the machine sent on that day, also a case and the bill, to the address on the card—I wrote this order to the head office for a No. 4 machine—the number, 51129, etc., was put on afterwards—I put the words at the bottom, "To be delivered to-day."</p>

I have got your salary in my pocket, and you can go; if you will square up your cash book, I will pay you a month's salary, and you can go"—he said, "I will go to-morrow; I want no salary"—I said, "Well, get your cash book squared; I can do nothing further before you do that"—my office consists of two rooms; the outer the clerks' room, the inner my private room; there is a door between them—the prisoner brought me the cash book, and I gave it to Mr. Battle, one of my clerks, to check the addition—he was in the other room—while he was doing so I was in my own room writing,—I heard my door close, and, looking up, I found the prisoner presenting a pistol at my head, with the remark, "I have got something to say to you"—I had just time to call "Battle," when he fired a shot at me; he was about three yards from me—as far as I can tell, it hit me in the head, but he fired, I believe, four times, and they came very quickly—I have the marks of three shots—there is one in my arm—I must have jumped up at the sound of the first shot, and closed with him—one shot went through the lapel of my coat, and came out at the bottom apparently, for there are cuts in my coat—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the shot he had in his hand—the trigger caught in the fleshy part of my hand, so could not be fired again—assistance came—the prisoner was handed over to the police, and I was taken to St. Bar<lb/>tholomew's Hospital—the wounds in my head have healed—a bullet is still in my arm—I have recovered now, except that I am a little bit shaky.</p>

About 4.30 p.m. on July 8th I was on duty in Cannon Street—I was called to 17, Watling Street, and found the prisoner detained—I was told in the prisoner's presence that he had shot Mr. Gillmore—I said I should take him into custody—he said, "I will go quietly; I bought it for a purpose: I was going to shoot myself, but they were too quick for me"—by "it" I think he meant the revolver—Mr. Dean, one of Mr. Gillmore's clerks, gave me this revolver—I handed it to Sergeant Hollick—I took the prisoner to the station, where he was formally charged—he made no reply to the charge.</p>

On July 8th I was acting sergeant at the Police-station—the last witness handed me this revolver in Mr. Gillmore's office—I examined it—it is a six-chambered self-cocking revolver—four chambers were discharged—the prisoner said, "I have bought it for a purpose; I have done with it now"—it was fully loaded, four shells and two full cartridges—I picked up two bullets in Mr. Gillmore's office; they correspond with the bullets in the undischarged cartridges—another bullet was handed to me, which fell out of Mr. Gillmore's coat—on searching the prisoner I found eight other full cart<lb/>ridges of a similar description to those in the revolver.</p>

I am House Surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—about 5 p.m. on July 8th Mr. Gillmore was brought there—he had a lacerated wound on the left side of his scalp, penetrating to the bone; a punctured wound on the left arm, with a large blood-clot beneath—there was no exit to it, showing that the bullet was still in the arm—the following day I examined the arm by the X-rays, and located the bullet—I have not been able to extract it—I cut into the arm, and searched for it for one hour and a quarter, but could not get it out—it may or may not inconvenience him—at present there in no indication that it will do any injury—if the bullet had struck him a little lower in the head it would probably have gone into his brain; I cannot say that it would have killed him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a steel-bar manufacturer, of 5, Talbot Street, Nottingham—I have only been there two or three months—my wife's name is Georgina Clara Cox—we were married 13 years ago, and have three children—two little girls are in London, with my father and mother, and the third at a boarding school—the eldest is 12 years old—I lived at three or four other houses in Nottingham before I went to Talbot Street—I was born at Nottingham—I was living there up to July, 1900—before that I met the prisoner—I have known him about 18 months—I believe he has lived at Nottingham for some time—he was a visitor at my house; he was a friend of mine—last July my wife went to the sea side by her<lb/>self; she did not take the children with her—after that time we did not cohabit—on the Saturday before August bank holiday I saw the pri<lb/>soner at Derby Station, with Mrs. Cox, in a railway carriage; I had a row with him, because she was with him—they were both very excited, and the prisoner seemed as if he had had too much to drink; he is of a very nervous sort of temperament—I tried to persuade them to come back—they did not seem as if they would, and said something about throwing them<lb/>selves on the line—I thought the sooner I got them away from the station the better, and as I could not get one away without the other, I brought them both back to Nottingham in a landau—when we arrived home I tried to get the prisoner to go away, and to get Mrs. Cox to stay—she was very excited, and was going to throw herself out of the window, and take something out of a bottle—she made me very nervous—they both went away together—I said to her, "You had better come back again when you get cooler and more sensible"—I next saw the prisoner in London about April last—my wife came to Nottingham between August and April—I think it was about the end of March she stayed one night—when I saw the prisoner in London in April I did not speak to him—I knew he and Mrs. Cox were living together at 87, Elsham Road, up to the end of July—I understood he had left her three or four months before I came up to London the last time, and gone to the other side of London—I came up to London in June—I corresponded with my wife</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190107220024"/>
               <p>before that, and I wrote once to the prisoner—I was very much annoyed, because I sent a telegram to my wife asking her to meet me in London, and an answer came back, signed "Georgina Moody," and I thought it was a sneer—I think it was on February 12th—I understood that in April the prisoner was not living with Mrs. Cox—I do not think I saw her after Easter till I came up to London on June 26th—I did not see the prisoner between April and June 26th—a day or two before June 26th I had a letter from my wife—I answered it, and addressed the envelope to her as "Mrs. Mossat," at 87, Elsham Road, because there was a paying guest there who knew nothing about this—on June 26th I received a telegram from my wife, and replied by telegram to her—I travelled that day from Nottingham to London, and by appointment I met her at St. Pancras Station about 1 p.m.—I went with her to the City to transact some business, and later in the afternoon went with her to Verry's Cafe in Regent Street—there we met Mr. and Mrs. Mossat—she had arranged to meet them there—I knew Mrs. Mossat before, but not Mr. Mossat—I heard the day before that they were living at 87, Elsham Road, as paying guests—we all remained at Verry's for about an hour—we had some tea, and some whisky and soda—I did not see the prisoner there—from Verry's Mrs. Cox and I went home to Elsham Road by 'bus—we dined there about 7 o'clock, and spent the evening together on the ground floor—we went to bed about 11.40, and after I had been in bed a little while I heard somebody come in at the front door—it sounded as if there was more than one person—I gathered from the sounds that they went upstairs to Mr. Mossat's room on the first floor—Mrs. Cox got up after that—our bedroom door was closed and locked—there was a little light in the room from the gas—Mrs Cox unlocked the door and went out—I think she shut the door after her—I heard her go upstairs—she was away about 10 minutes—while she was gone I put on my trousers, and went to see why she was up there—I went half way up the stairs, then I heard a door open, and I went down quickly—I heard voices up<lb/>stairs, but I had not time to recognise them—I went back into my bed<lb/>room—I smoked a cigarette—I did not get into bed then—shortly after<lb/>wards Mrs. Cox came down into the bedroom—I think she closed and locked the door again—she went to bed, and after I had finished my cigarette I did the same—after we had been in bed a little time a big bang came at the door—my wife had left the room twice before this last time—that was after I had gone to bed—I went before she did—when the bang came at the door I said to Mrs. Cox, "Who is it?"—she said, "I should think it is Mr. Mossat"—she went to the door and opened it—I remained in bed—I did not hear any words from any<lb/>body—Mrs. Cox went straight out—I was listening to know why she had gone out; then I thought I heard somebody in the next room, and a kind of click like a cigarette case—the prisoner came to the door, put his hand up, and said, "You have no business here"—I said, "Oh, have not I? I thought you had been gone for weeks"—I was still in bed—he had got his head and shoulders in the room—the door was about half open—I was watching my opportunity of getting out and closing with him—I did not like to move because I was afraid of something—I had it in my head that he might shoot me—I heard Mrs. Cox coming downstairs, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190107220025"/>

               <p>Court—I produce the file in the bankruptcy of H.

Chancellor &amp; Co.—the summary states the liabilities as ₤347, and the assets as ₤6—by bringing in a porton of a legacy a first and final dividend was paid of 3s. 0 1/2 d.—there has been no application for dis<lb/>charge, and no discharge—I also produce the file in the bankruptcy of George McCraith &amp; Co., of 1, Sussex Place, Leadenhall Street, wholesale grocers, on a creditors' petition of May 1st, 1896—the receiving order was June 24th, and the adjudication June 29th, 1896—the liabilities were ₤2,020, and the assets ₤135—there was no dividend, and no dis<lb/>charge—I also produce the file in the bankruptcy of Herbert Shouland, on a creditors' petition of February 2nd, 1901—the receiving order is dated March 28th. and the adjudication April 26th, and is against Herbert Shorland Slatter, trading as the Grocery and Provision Shops Association—the summary shows liabilities ₤14,110, and assets ₤400—in the statement of affairs there is a list of unsecured creditors, in which I find the name of Balhachette, ₤200; and for deposits, Jenkins, ₤50; Mrs. A. M. King, ₤50; and W. Latham, ₤70—the unsecured creditors are brought out at ₤2,876 18s.—among 35 creditors, partly secured, are for deposits, Miss Turner, ₤2,250; Mrs. H. A. Grimley, ₤900; Mrs. Maggie Mitchell, ₤300; and H. Venn, ₤l00; the total is ₤11,233 8s. 5d.—amongst the particulars of securities are several charges on each of various shops at Lewisham Road, Woodgrange Road, Harrow, and other places—434, Harrow Road and 136, Woodgrange Road are each charged eight times over, and 6, Salisbury Pavement six times over, to different people, and each of the shops, as well as the offices at 147, Oxford Street, and at Rosebery House, 8, Bream's Buildings, are set out as having rent due in respect of them, the amount of rent owing being ₤405—among the preferential creditors I find the names of eight local authorities, who claim for rates in respect of the eight shops, and of seven persons who claim wages—the total costs of seven of the eight shops are set out at ₤960, and they are estimated to realise ₤660, including the leases, good<lb/>will and fixtures.</p>

I am single, and live at Inverawe, Branksome Avenue, Bournemouth, with Miss Florence Elizabeth Campbell, who is an invalid—we are engaged in philanthropic work at Bournemouth—in August, 1899, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Graphic:</hi> "All those seeking sound and profitable investments should write to, or call upon, the Secretary of the Grocery and Provision Shops Association, 147, Oxford Street, London, W.

Withdrawable at 60 days' notice"—I wrote, and received this reply, that a charge, prepared by their solicitors, would be given on the shops, giving further particulars, and enclosing a similar prospectus to this—(<hi rend="italic">This contained a picture of one of the shops, and stated that the head office was at 147, Oxford Street, and the warehouse at</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Old Shades Wharf, Upper Thames Street; that the secretary was H. Shorland; that the company was not registered under the Companies Act; that the depositors became simply creditors, and incurred no liability, according to Counsel's opinion set out; that as the capital was subscribed, the interest would be reduced from 26 to 10 percent., but that would not affect the present depositors; that among the staff were gentlemen who had been in the trade 10 or 12 years, having vast experience, knowing the best brands;. that two inspectors were employed to find suitable sites; that for the fitting and stocking of each shop ₤150 to ₤200 had been laid out; that in some cases ₤400 had been paid for goodwill, which brought in weekly returns of ₤100 and more,</hi>)—I read the prospectus and a typewritten document of Press opinions—believing they were real, I sent a cheque for ₤300 to the association on September 13th or 14th, and received this reply—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that, as the association had only been in existence since April, there was no balance-sheet, but the capital was unlimited; that their buyer, Mr. Mack, had 20 to 30 years' experience, and that the depositors would always receive 26 percent, interest.</hi>)—I got this receipt, dated September 26th, for my cheque, which should have been dated September 25th—I also received this deposit note, which undertakes to pay the interest and to repay the deposit to my "<hi rend="italic">accessor,</hi> executor, or assignee"—I did not understand the word "accessor"—the letter stated that the solicitors, Bennett and Leaver, had been instructed to send security duly stamped—on October 1st I received in this letter a cheque for ₤1 10s. interest for the week, and the next day the letter enclosing the charge on the shop, 43, Turnpike Lane, a notice that the interest had been reduced to 15 percent., but that that would not affect me—the charge was signed, "H. Shorland," and witnessed by "J. B. Wilson"—I received my interest regularly up to the end of the year—I came to London, and saw Shorland at 147, Oxford Street—he spoke of the association as a business well established and fairly prosperous—in January 7, 1900, I sent another ₤125 to the same address, and again ₤75, and received the acknowledgments produced, and a statement that the cashier, Mr. J. B. Wilson, expected the accountants would have the balance-sheet ready at the end of the month—I received this charge on the Turnpike Lane shop for my ₤125, and in the letter of February 23rd this balance-sheet, which showed that ₤2,000 had been spent on shops and goodwill, and the letter stated that the results showed that the association were justified in still further enlarging the scope of the business, and they wished to give the original depositors an opportunity of sharing the success—the stock, fixtures, and fittings were valued at ₤1,831 5s. 9d., the leases at ₤2,100; the liability to depositors and interest were stated to be ₤4,985 1s., outstanding charges ₤473 17s. 1d., bills payable ₤263 5s. 2d., and the "surplus, being proprietors' capital," ₤62, 107 12s. 1d.—it is signed "J.

               <p>giving a charge on his life assurance for security in case of his death—I afterwards received this letter, stating that the risk of investing in the association was practically reduced to <hi rend="italic">nil</hi>—I never heard the amount of the insurance, nor of the policy expiring six months afterwards—I next received a <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> in a halfpenny wrapper, with this paragraph marked, "The Grocery and Provision Shops Association balance-sheet and summary of assets and liabilities on January 20th last show that assets exceed liabilities by ₤2,107, after paying depositors. interest at the rate of 15 to 17 1/2 percent, per annum"—about June 18th I sent a further cheque for ₤100, and received the receipt and deposit note, and this letter, stating that if I put in another ₤500 for a year certain, the association would allow me 28 percent, per annum interest on all my deposits—that induced me on July 3rd to send another ₤500—in reply I received the document produced, including a deposit note for ₤1,200, the amount I had deposited up to that time—that cancelled the previous notes—I had told Shorland that the object of my invest<lb/>ments was to increase my income, in order to assist Miss Campbell and myself in our work at Bournemouth of helping others, and on July 4th I received his cheque for five guineas in a letter, which stated, "I trust you will find other people willing to help you in so good a cause"—the cheque was honoured—on July 24th I forwarded another sum of ₤250, and received the usual papers, with a receipt to myself and Miss Camp<lb/>bell—in September, 1900, I came to London—I found 147, Oxford Street upset—a general moving was taking place—on my second visit, in the afternoon, I saw Shorland—he told me that the business and the workers were increasing, and as they required larger premises they were going; to Bream's Buildings, Chancery Lane, and he gave me a paper with the new address—later, at Bream's Buildings, he told me that they thought of taking a banker's licence, because the bankers took three days to collect, and cheques were dishonoured, because they would not send across the road to get the money—he showed me a book of cheques like these produced, headed—(<hi rend="italic">"Head Office: Rosebery House, 8, Bream's Buildings, Chancery Lane, E.C."</hi>)—in November I sent ₤400, and received these acknowledg<lb/>ments produced and a price list—at the end of December I received a cheque for ₤12 2s. 4d.—it was dishonoured, but I subsequently received a P.O.O. for the amount—that was the last payment of interest—I received another cheque, but not for interest—I had several cheques on the new form—I asked shorland through the telephone why the interest had not been sent, and remonstrated, in the interest of the association as well as my own, about cheques being returned—he gave an explanation, which I cannot remember—on January 11th I again came to London—I saw Shorland at Bream's Buildings—as he came in his first expression was, "I have very bad news for you; we shall not be able to pay you any interest till the beginning of February"—he said the business had been overstocked for Christmas, and they had not paid cash in the usual way for stock, and were using the money coming in to pay off the debt—I suggested that he should send me provisions instead, and he made a list of what I wanted, and promised on that Friday to send them on the Monday—they did not some—I called again at Bream's Buildings on January 25th—McCraith, whom Shorland always spoke of as Mack, came in—I</p>

               <p>complained of the extreme inconvenience of the money not coming in weekly, as I expected it, and had made provision for it—he said he would say nothing, as he was only a hireling, or some such expression, hut that he would take down my statement and show it to Shorland, who was un<lb/>well and unable to be at the office—I asked him how the business was progressing; he said that it was fair—I received this letter, signed "G. McCraith," stating that Shorland must not be worried about business, his temperature being exceedingly high, also two days later another letter, stating that Shorland was still indisposed, apologising for the provisions not being sent, and stating that they would be forwarded, but owing to withdrawals they were extremely short of cash—this is signed "Yours truly, for H. Shorland, G. McC." about that time I consulted Mr. Symons, a solicitor at Bournemouth—I received this letter from Shorland. enclosing security for the ₤800 I had paid in November, apologising for the delay, and stating that he was going to form a limited liability company, and that he would forward deeds to-morrow—after that I came to Bream's Buildings, and showed him that the deed was unstamped—he said he would get it done, and deliver it to me before I left in the evening, and that it was "Mack's" fault—later I got it—it was stamped with a ₤1 stamp—I asked Shorland howmany depositors there were—he said, "Forty<lb/>four"—I asked Mack about the association's liabilities, and he said they were ₤510 or ₤100 for stock or rent; that I was the largest creditor, and should be considered accordingly—I asked him how the deposits had been used—he said some of it in paying off other depositors, who were taking out their money, and the rest in the business, but he could not say how—Shorland said that owing to the writ that had been served at the instigation of my solicitor, he had not been able to go on with the new company, but he would call a meeting of depositors to consider the matter, as to whether he should be declared a bankrupt or form a com<lb/>pany; that if he was declared a bankrupt we should get nothing, but if he formed a company we should get debenture stock, and that I should stop the writ, as it had not been served upon him—I suggested that we should go to the solicitor's office together, and that he should state what he had stated to me as to the condition of the business—he said, "No; if I go they will serve the writ at once upon me"—I made an appointment later on to meet him at the office of Mr. Painter, a solicitor whom I had substituted for Mr. Symons, who had called at Bream's Buildings, but Shorland said he had not given his name, and that Mr. Pugh would know all about the formation of the company and the, work of the association better than himself—Pugh, he said, was manager to Messrs. Crocker—I wrote this letter of March 14th, 1901, to Shorland, and received his reply of March 16th, 1901—(<hi rend="italic">One letter was signed "Ruth Turner" to "Dear Mr. Shorland," and expressed sympathy with him in his business diffi<lb/>culties, and stated she had not heard since the interview with the solicitors how matters stood, and, among other religious consolation, recommended him to trust in Jehovah; the reply was signed, "Herbert Shorland," and was addressed "My dear Miss Turner," and stated that her kind and sympathetic letter was a real comfort to him; it continued:</hi> "You have not heard from me, as there is nothing fresh to let you know; the moment I can give you any information I will write</p>

Let us hope that God may help and guide us all, and, with His help, and my best endeavours, everything will end all right.")—the amount parted with by Miss Campbell and myself by way of deposits was ₤2,250—I have only been paid the interest I have stated.</p>

Wright and Odell, and it was paid up till June, 1900—in June Saruco, or Wilson as I knew him, said that he had been advised to leave the premises, as he believed the police had infor<lb/>mation which he thought had come through me or through my association, and we arranged that he should vacate the premises there and then, pro<lb/>vided he paid ₤80 for the surrender of the agreement—at the end of September I went for my holiday, and when I came back on October 5th or 6th they had gone—I knew they were going to 8, Bream's Buildings—I instructed my solicitors to take proceedings for the rent—I never got it, nor the ₤80</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">"RICHARD ROBERT POWELL FOOTE</hi>. I live at 106, Salcot Road, Wandsworth. I am a clerk. In June, 1899, through an advertisement, I went to 147, Oxford Street, where I saw Shorland and Wilson. I was engaged as clerk. I was set to typewriting prospectuses, letters, and extracts from news<lb/>papers. After I had been at the place a few days I saw McCraith there. He came to the office regularly. I understood he was the provision buyer. His re'ations with the other defendants seemed to be those of master and servant. McCraith had to do what he was told; his position was that of a servant. I made a statement in April which is shown to me; in it said he appeared to be a partner; I said so because he was more friendly with Shorland and Wilson than other employees. The three used to go out together. No one else went out with Wilson and Shorland except Mr. Lewsey. I remained with them till January, 1901; ₤2 15s. wages was due to me when I left. I applied to both Shorland and Wilson for it. I received the letter (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), No. 153, from Wilson. When I applied to Shorland he told me to apply to Wilson. I never got the ₤2 15s. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined for McCraith:</hi> Sergeant Bower and Detective West were present when I made my statement. It was not suggested to me that he was a partner; I said he was a partner, as far as being friendly went. There was no one else to go with Wilson and Shorland but Lewsey. I never went out with them. I never asked McCraith for my wages, as I did not think he could give them me. I think I saw McCraith there the first week I was there, but am not certain. I had the office to myself</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Society of Auditors and Accountants—I practise at 5, Bishopsgate Street—through Fitz<lb/>gerald Arthur I got to know Wilson and Shorland—in October, 1899, I received their instructions to prepare a balance-sheet of the Association—I began the work in January, 1900—I examined the books—they were very badly kept, and not written up—Wilson said that he wanted a statement showing the amounts due to the depositors and other creditors, and the cash at the bank and the book debts, including stock, fixtures, till list, goodwill, and so forth—I made out some schedules which, when filled up, would give the information—I received them filled up—on February 16th I wrote this letter to Wilson, enclosing draft of figures, and asking for information as to bills ₤187 9s. and book debts ₤93 15s.—on. February 21st I wrote again—I sent a draft statement, showing assets, cash at bank, ₤141 13s. 9d.; book debts, ₤304 6s. 1d.; stock, ₤1,198 14s. 3d. (I got the figures from Wilson for the schedule); fix<lb/>tures and fittings, ₤1,831 5s. 9d.; London office furniture, etc., ₤253 15s. 6d.; leases, ₤2,100; and goodwill, ₤1,000, I also obtained from Wilson—the liabilities were, "To sundry creditors, depositors and interest accrued, ₤1,985 1s.," from the books as the total amount deposited to January 20th, 1900; then creditors on open account and for outstanding charges, ₤473 17s. 1d., I got partly from the books and partly from state<lb/>ments sent in by creditors—bills payable, ₤263 5s. 2d. was in the books—that left the surplus of assets over liabilities, ₤2, 107 12s. 1d., and I wrote at the bottom: "I have prepared the above statement from the books and particulars furnished to me; I have agreed the correctness of the cash at bankers and in hand; the value of the remaining assets have been furnished to me by the Association's employees"—as sent in, that statement was not signed—between February 21st and 28tb I had a conversation with Shor<lb/>land,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190107220048"/>
               <p>in consequence of which I wrote him this letter, requesting that no statement bearing my signature should be issued until it was signed by me—on March 5th, from something that came to my knowledge, I wrote Shorland this letter, objecting to the issue of the statement purporting to be signed, and requesting its withdrawal and the return of any moneys received under it—I received this reply of March 7th, expressing surprise, and requesting that I should not interfere, as he saw no reason why the balance-sheet should not be signed—I received 130 certificates, first of the book debts, signed by Wilson, next of the stock in hand at the ware<lb/>house and at the wharf, signed by Wilson and Mack, and of the stock in London, being eight items of stocks at various shops, of the value of the fixtures and utensils at the shops, amounting to ₤1,831 5s. 9d., signed by Wilson and Mack, of the furniture at the London office, of the value of the leases, and of the value of the goodwill of seven shops ₤2,000, all signed by Wilson—₤5,722 represents all known liabilities on January 20th, 1900—to Shorland's letter of March 7th I replied that I had con<lb/>sulted my solicitor, and declined to continue to act professionally for him—a little later I saw the paragraph in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph,</hi> in which it was stated that the profit to the Association was ₤2,107, and I brought an action for an injunction against Wilson and Shorland jointly, and my costs were paid—no part of my memorandum is on the printed balance sheet—I made a list of the depositors' names; they number 138.</p>

I first heard of this crime about 5 a.m. on June 18th—I was entrusted with the inquiries in regard to it—I visited various barracks where regiments of Guards were stationed, and took statements from all who were out after twelve on June 17th—among others, I took one from the prisoner on June 21st, at the back of the orderly-room at Chelsea Barracks—I wrote it down as he made it—I read it over to him, and he signed it—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the prisoner left barracks about 7 p.m. on June 17tht and went to 26, Denbigh Place, and rapped the railings; that his sweetheart, Connie Perry, lived there; that he went into the public-house opposite, and remained there talking and drinking till 12.30 a.m., and then walked away with a customer, but he did not know where to; that when he was returning to barracks, about 3.30 a.m., he met Evans; that he never went near Hyde Park on the Monday night; that he had only been there once, and that was on parade, and that he had only been in London about a fortnight.</hi>)—on the 26th, by my instructions, Sergeant Pollard took a further statement—on the 21st Evans gave me a description of a woman who had been in Hyde Park that night, and Constable Stranger gave me his description—I searched for her, but did not succeed in tracing her till July 9th, when I found the witness Ford at Pirbright—from information I got from her, I caused the prisoner and Evans to be arrested, after consultation with the solicitors—when the prisoner was arrested he did not say anything—I told him the charge, and referred to my former visit—I said, "You remember me, Inspector Fuller; I took a statement from you on the 21st of last month. I have the girl whose description was given me by Evans on that occasion. I have taken a statement from the girl, and I find that your statement to me is untrue, and I shall arrest you and Evans for being concerned in assaulting Constable Brewer in Hyde Park on the 17th of last month"—he said nothing—he and Evans were then placed among seven others of the same regiment at Rochester Row Police-station—that is where the belt was lent to Evans, so as to make him appear like the others—Evans was at once identified by Ford, and she also identified the prisoner after considerable hesitation—before that she picked out another man, and I told her to have another look—the prisoner said nothing when he was picked out—when the woman identified him</p>

               <p>she said, "That is the man that came up to us"—he made no reply—I directed Sergeant Pollard to take him to Hyde Park Police-station—I took Evans—on the way he made a statement which I afterwards wrote out—at the station the charge was read over to the prisoner and Evans—the prisoner, in reply, said, "I am not guilty"—on July 15th Evans gave his evidence before the Magis<lb/>trate, upon which day the prisoner was committed for trial—this letter I got from him; it is written by him; it is written from Holloway Prison, dated July 17th—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) <hi rend="smallCaps">"MR. FULLER</hi>,—I have considered it best for me to explain the truth of this affair which is so much put upon me by Martin Evans. I told him I would say nothing about what he had done that night on June 17th, but as he has put it all on me, I will let his part be known, as I want you to go and get his belt, and you will find some blood on the inside of it, for when he came back to assist me he struck the policeman on the right side of the head, and then, being in a hurry, he put his belt on upside down. The policeman had his back turned to him when he hit him, and was scolding and punching me with his baton. The next morning he came into my room, and told me there was blood on his belt. I went and saw it, and thought to take it off. I did get some of it off with a knife, and same I did not, which you will see for yourself, and a boy named Taff, in the same room as Evans was in, saw me scraping the belt"—<hi rend="smallCaps">T. KENNEDY."</hi>—upon that, I got the belt on July 20th, and examined it—I could find no traces of scraping; I can now; there were two black spots when I saw it first—after that I handed it back to the barracks—it was obtained again, for the doctor to see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On the 20th it looked as though blood had been on the belt—I did not notice anything about the buckle of the belt; I ex<lb/>amined it carefully—I did not then see any dark-coloured dirt; I have since—the best description I had of the girl was from Evans on the 21st.</p>

Waddell &amp; Sons appear to have overlooked the three days' grace, but as our customer's instructions are to pay on presentation, I shall not return the bill"—I had received this document of instructions by the first post, and on the strength of that, paid it—it is unusual to pay a bill three days before it is due—I wrote to our customer on the Monday that; under his instructions, I paid the bill—on July 6th I was sent for to go to Hunter Street Police-station, where I identified the prisoner from about 10 men in a row as the man I had spoken to about the three days' grace—I have not the slightes doubt—I had not seen him before June 29th.</p>

On July 5th I went with Sergeant Goff to 62, Burton Crescent, King's Cross—I found the prisoner in a back bedroom on the ground floor about 11 p.m.—I said to him, "I have reason to believe you uttered and forged a bill on a London bank, and we intend to take you to Hunter Street Police-station for identifica<lb/>tion—he replied, "All right"—when dressing he said, "I suppose you have your warrant?"—I said, "No; a warrant is unnecessary'—he said, "I suppose it will be the usual sort of identification; I hope you will give me a fair change"—I said, "Certainly, and you can dress, as you think proper"—we took him to the Police-station, and sent for Mr. Hart Dyke, who picked him out from six others at once as the person who had presented the forged bill of acceptance—I searched him, and found in his pocket-book ₤6 in gold, and receipted bills for ₤10 13s., all since June 29th—I said, "You will now be charged with forging and uttering on the 29th <hi rend="italic">ult.</hi> the bill produced"—I showed him the bill, and read it to him—he said, "The gentleman who pointed me out has made a mistake"—we took him to Paddington Station, where he was charged—he made no reply—the bills found on him relate to two new suits of clothes and two new hats, a new portmanteau, and a box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made my note at the Police-station—I first saw a clerk to the Banking Association about this—I subsequently saw Mr. Dyke, who gave a description of the man—he said that the prisoner had on a black coat, a <hi rend="italic">bowler</hi> hat, and had the appearance of a clerk, and that he was shabby genteel—I went with Goff to Burton Crescent, and brought back clothing belonging to the prisoner, having searched his room—he was dressed as</p>

               <p>he is now—he changed his clothes for identification, he put on clothes brought from his room—that was owing to what he had said about a fair chance—I did not suggest the change—Mr. Dyke went to one end, then turned, and in walking back picked him out—there were at least two others with black coats—the cashier of the Bank of England was sent for, but did not identify him—I called someone else to identify him on July 11th—he failed—the men then had their hats off—when Mr. Dyke went to the station they had their hats on—I ordered them to put them on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner was not dressed when I took him—I told him he could wear what he liked—he put on the grey clothes he is wear<lb/>ing now—I took away his old clothes, that he should have a fair chance—they were hanging on the back door—he changed at the Police-station—the other person who came to identify him had nothing to do with this charge.</p>

                  </hi>. On July 5th I was with Dennie when the prisoner was arrested—I afterwards went back to 62, Burton Crescent, and searched the prisoner's room with him—I found a new portmanteau empty, a Gladstone bag locked; the key was found on the prisoner—I opened it and found in the pocket a parcel; four or five pieces of paper, containing ₤35 in gold—I also found some pawn tickets, and these rough memoranda of the prisoners in a drawer—he had one room.</p>

Phillipson, Esq.," is slightly disguised, and "77, Lancaster Gate" is his ordinary writing—the endorsement is his writing—this inventory is a specimen of his writing.</p>

I am an expert in handwriting, of Bath House, Holborn Viaduct—I have had 17 years' experience—I have examined the specimens of the prisoner's writing, and compared them with the signature, "John Waddell &amp; Sons," on this bill of exchange, which is slightly disguised, and the words, "To H. Phillipson, Esq., 77, Lancaster Gate," which is not disguised—they are the same writing—I believe the signature of the drawer is written by someone else—I have also examined the endorsement on the notes, which is the same writing, but written more carelessly, which rather suggests an attempt to disguise—(<hi rend="italic">The witness pointed out the similarities</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Penrhyn Street, St. Pancras—I am a solicitor, but do not practise—I entered the Post Office service in February last year—on Saturday, June 29th, I was employed at the Parcels Office, Mount Pleasant, near the King's Cross Road, the old Clerkenwell Prison—my duties lasted from 7.30 to the end of the first delivery, which I finished from 10 to 10.45 a.m.—I am married—I have known the prisoner over 11 years—I saw him as I was coming out of the post-office in Calthorpe Street—he asked me, and we went into the Prince Albert public-house in the Gray's Inn Road for a drink—we stayed about a quarter of an hour—the landlord's son served the drink—the prisoner paid—he had money—then we walked to the Vicar of Wakefield, in Gray's Inn Road, and had another drink—we stayed 10 minutes—I left him at the corner of Gray's Inn Road and George Street, and reached home at 11.30 by the clock at the corner of Orange Street—I went on duty again at 3 p.m.—the prisoner wore a moustache.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 12 years old, and lived at 3, Chandos Road, East Stratford, with my father, mother, and brothers and sisters—my father is a blacksmith—on Tuesday, July 2nd, my mother went out about 9 a.m.—father had left for work by that time—he came back about 1 o'clock, his usual dinner time—there was no dinner for him—he left some money for us to get some with, and went back to his work—about 1.45 mother came in, the worse for drink—she was in the habit of drinking; she remained in doors about 15 minutes, and then went out again—she came in again about 3 p.m. with another woman; she was worse then than she had been at 1.45—she and her friend went out again, and she was out when father came home about 5.30—he had had a drop to drink, but not much—he was not actually drunk—he brought some kippers in, which he gave to me, and I cooked them—my father and my brothers and sisters and myself sat down to tea—mother came in—she had had some drink; she fell about—my brother Phillip went out, and then mother began to sing, and called father names—she had some rosebuds in her hand—she threw them across the table, and they went into father's plate—my father told me to</p>

Harriett cooked me some tea. Whilst I was having it my wife came indoors. She started singing and swearing. I said, 'That's a nice state to come home to your children, isn't it? and every day last week the same; you are getting worse.' She came at me; she came towards me, as I sat on that chair, to fight; I pushed her away from me. She fell down between the bedstead and the table; she was very drunk. There</p>

               <p>was not above 2ft. of room between the two bedsteads and table. The centre of the table stood down, and was bigger than the body of the table. She got up again and started swearing again, and came after me again. I stood up to get away, to go out. She would not let me, but kept hold of me, and I hit her in the eye. She had no mark above the eye, as Dr. Nicholls said. It was on the bottom of the cheek. She got up again and came after me again. I turned my back towards her, and leaned on the bed, with my hands to my ears, so that she should not scratch me; she started fighting me at the back of my neck. When I got up I saw there was blood coming from her. I said, 'Look at the state you are in,' and she said, 'A b——good job too.' Then, when Harriett came in, she got hold of her mother and started crying and saying, 'Why, don't you let <hi rend="italic">Daddy</hi> go out? He don't want to make a <hi rend="italic">row;</hi> it is you making the <hi rend="italic">row.'</hi> She said, 'b———your <hi rend="italic">Daddy';</hi> she sat on the bed. I got out of the room, and went downstairs to the w.c. I didn't take notice of the blood at all. I didn't think it was going to cause death. A lady downstairs knocked at the door of the w.c, and said, 'Your wife has fallen downstairs, Mr. Smyth, and has hurt herself.' I hardly know whether I said, 'Serve her right,' or 'A good job.' I dressed myself, and went up<lb/>stairs as quick as I could, and saw her lying at the bottom of the stairs. I sent Harriett for a doctor. Whilst she was gone I put her head upwards on the stairs, and her feet down where her head had been. I had her on my arm when the doctor came in. I did not speak to the doctor. He said, 'She is dying.' I said, 'I know it.' Almost as soon as the words were spoken she died. My boy Ted didn't know anything about the day of the month; he must have been told; and as regards the time, there was no clock in the room, and he cannot tell it if there had been. My wife was a very violent woman when in beer."</p>

I am surgeon and physician, of 90, Kerrick Road, Brixton—about 2 a.m. on June 27th I was called by the police to Dal<lb/>berg Road, where I saw the dead body of a woman lying in the gutter beside the kerb; Dr. Niall was there before me—she had a severe wound on the right side of her throat; by the time I arrived she was dead—her clothes were blood-stained—under my direction, the body was moved to the mortuary, where I made a complete examination of it—the wound on her throat started on the left side just over the middle line, in a skin-cut, and then passed to the right and ended deeply—it was 4in. or 5in. in length, and cut the deep and superficial vessels of the neck—it would require considerable force to inflict, and, in my opinion, was inflicted by some sharp instrument, such as a razor—below it, and running parallel with it there was a skin cut about 3in. long—in my opinion it was inflicted distinctly from the other, upon some other occasion—on the left fore arm I found another subcutaneous wound about 2in. long—there was a cut on each of the first and second fingers of the left hand—I think they reached to the bone—all these other wounds were such as would be inflicted by a sharp instrument like a razor—I did not make a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination; that was unnecessary, as I was able to arrive at the cause of death—it was caused by hemorrhage from the cut in the throat.</p>
