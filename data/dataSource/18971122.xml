                  </hi>. I live at 85, Pimlico Road—I am Assistant Divisional Surgeon to the police—I was called to the police-station on Friday, October 22nd—I examined Vessey—I found a notch in the left ear three-eighths of an inch deep—it was a cut right through the bone of the ear—I put a stitch in it—there were three small super<lb/>ficial wounds on the same ear, also a small superficial wound on the left cheek and an incised wound on the chin an inch thick, a small wound on the left side of the neck, and three small punctured wounds on the lips—the wound on the neck might have been dangerous but that it was superficial—these scissors might have caused all the wounds—I did not consider his position dangerous—I have seen him to-day—lie is suffering from paralysis on the left side of the face, which might have been caused by a cold and not directly by the wounds—it might have been indirectly—I ordered him off duty for seven days—I noticed the paralysis on his face about two days after the injuries—I could not see any sign of paralysis when I first examined him—he was attended to as an out-patient—the wounds</p>

               <p>were not very severe, but they would be dangerous if complications arose, which might always supervene—if he had been struck in the eye the wounds would have blinded him, the big notch in, the ear for instance.</p>

               <p>that time we had been in the habit of going out for walhs—I remember meeting him on Saturday night on September 11th last in Drummond Street about nine o'clock—we went for a walk together that night—we remained in each other's company till a few minutes before eleven—at that time we were in Cardington Street—there were no other companions with us—we were going towards the Hampstead Road—I did not see anybody whilst we were going that way—On getting closer to the Hampstead Road we passed the prisoner—he was going in the same direction as we were—we overtook him and passed him round the bead, nearer the Hampstead Road, about 20 yards from it—we were both walking on the pavement and the prisoner also—on passing him I heard him say, "What are you doing round here?"—we then stopped—we were ahead of him—we turned round—he was about one yard off—we both said, "What is that to do with you?"—the prisoner answered, "Get on about your business and don't get following me"—we had not been following him—that was the first time I had seen bun, and as far as I know the first time Smith saw him,. I noticed nothing in his walk as we passed him—when we turned round he seemed to be rolling—when I saw that, I said to Smith, "Come on, Smith, the man is in drink"—we then walked away in the direction of the Hampstead Road—we were then walking; in front of the prisoner, because he stopped—having gone about 10 yards Smith stopped, and I opoke to him, but not so that the prisoner could hear—Smith did nothing but stop and look round—I was about three yards from him—I said, "Come on, Smith, it is no good stopping here"—he said, "All right"—the prisoner then walked up to him and spoke to him—I could not hear what he said; he was bending down—I could not say if Smith spoke to him—the prisoner then made a lunge forward at Smith's stomach with his right arm—they were standing face to face, about a foot apart—I could not see if the prisoner had anything in his hand—the prisoner then walked away in the direction of the Hamp<lb/>fitead Road—Smith walked up to me and spoke to me; he walked with me for about six yards—when he came up he had one hand on his stomach—he kept his hand there while walking with me—I did not see anything happen then; he was standing up—I left him standing—I walked into the Hampstead Road after the prisoner—after I had walked away, I turned round and saw Smith fall—he fell where I left him—he did not walk on—I walked into the Hampstead Road—the prisoner was in the middle of the road going to the other side—I followed him—he did not get to the other side—while I was following he walked on into the Hampstead Road towards the Euston Road—I con<lb/>tinued to follow him—I came up within two yards of him—I said to him "when I see a policeman I will lock you up"—he did not answer—he still walked on—there is a pawnbroker, Davis by name, in the Hamp stead Road—there was a policeman there when I got there—it was Constable Wilmer, 457 S—I spoke to him, and he and I followed the prisoner, who jumped on to a 'bus going in the direction of Camden Town—in the same direction as we were westward—the prisoner jumped on to the footboard of the 'bus—the 'bus did not stop—he jumped on whilst it was going—I saw him do that—that was the first Thus that I saw—the policeman went up to him and spoke to him—I cannot say</p>

Farrant said "What do we want to follow you about for 1" Farrant then said to Smith,"let us walk on in front if he thinks we are following him," they then walked away together in the directionrof the Hampstead Road—the prisoner stood still—after the two had walked away, I saw Smith stop and look round—he was about 10 yards away—he looked at Kimber—Kimber was standing where they left him—Smith got quite close to prisoner—I saw Kimber appear to speak to him—I could cot hear the words—Smith did not appear to speak to Kimber—I saw Kimber make a movement towards Smith—he hit him on the body, it was not in the face—I did not notice Anything in Kimber's hand at the time—I was behind Smith—Smith's hands were in his trousers pockets, both of them—Farrant was about</p>

I took hold of him when he was on the footboard of the omnibus—I said, "Come down; you will have to come back with me"—he got off—I took him into custody—Farrant said, "That man has stabbed a boy; I will show you where the boy is"—I took the prisoner towards the gates of the hospital where I saw the deceased on a coster's barrow—while going towards the hospital the prisoner said, "You don't know what they have done to me with a lot of roughs"—when I got to the hospital I handed the prisoner over to another constable and ascertained whether Farrant's statement was true or not—I then retook the prisoner, and took him to Albany Street police-station—I noticed blood on the first two fingers of his left hand and on the thumb of his right hand—in my opinion it looked fresh blood on both hands—in my opinion he was perfectly sober and sane.</p>

I foolishly, like other people, stopped to look. There was a cry of 'Knife them.' It appeared to me to be rival sides. I went on into Hampstead Road. They, I mean seven, eight, or ten of them, ran after me and said, 'That's him.' I think the witness Farrant was one of them.

                  </hi>. I am 75 years old, and I have lived at Bishop's Stainton, in Devonshire, all my life—I knew Samuel Kimber, the prisoner's grandfather—he lived in the same village with me—his wife supported him during the latter years of his life, as he was quite insane—he was quite a lunatic; he was incapable of doing anything for himself—at one time he had been a gentleman's servant; after that he was round the neighbourhood, and did not go far—he died, and was buried in the churchyard—his son, Henry, went into the service of a gentleman, to whom my father was servant for 40 years; they were in service together—Henry Kimber had to come home and go into the Devonshire Lunatic Asylum—he died there, and was afterwards brought back to be buried in the village—after the death of his father and mother, Henry Samuel Kimber, the prisoner, lived with his grandmother till he came to London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The grandfather, Samuel, was never in confinement—there were no asylums so many years ago as that—they did not take any notice of his going about, because he was perfectly harmless—he had six children; Henry Kimber was one—the prisoner has a brother.</p>

I live at Bishop's Stainton—I have known the prisoner since he was a boy—after the death of his father in the lunatic asylum he lived with his grandmother—I knew him well—he was always a quiet, well-conducted, rather reserved young man—he left the place with a very good character when he came up to join the police<lb/>force whea he was 19 or 20—after he was in the force I saw him once or twice—after he had to retire on account of the state of his health he came to Devonshire—the first time I saw him I knew him at once—about three years after that, in September last year, he came to see me again, and he was then so changed for the worse in his appearance and manner that I did not know him when he came to the door—I knew his voice—he had aged very much, and he seemed to be lost in his mind when he came in—when a young man he used to lodge with me—he has changed very much indeed in appearance during the last few years.</p>

I have known Kimber for 10 years—I knew his wife—all the time I knew him he was a quiet, inoffensive man—his wife unfortunately drank very much—I have noticed a great change in his appearance of late, in his face and eyes, and in wandering about, in conversation—about four months ago I went to see a man named Claridge, who is charged with murder, and is in the lunatic ward of the infirmary, and he reminded me, in the eyes and conversation and everything, of Kimber—I had the conversation with the prisoner about a month before this murder.</p>

I have known the prisoner for the last five years—he always appeared a very quiet, inoffensive man—within the last 12 months I have noticed a change in his appearance and manner—the strangeness of his conversation has attracted my attention—he drank, but I never saw him take a very great deal—he could walk very well, but I noticed by what he said—I was speaking to a friend of mine about the disease of the potato crop 40 years ago, and the prisoner said, "I have seen some very large potatoes"—I said, "How large have you seen them?"—he said, "I have seen such potatoes that a quartern loaf was nothing to the size of them"—I said, "I think you are talking very foolish"—he said, "I am not talking of English grown potatoes"—I said, "I don't know where they came from, but I have never seen potatoes so large as a quartern loaf"—he said, "Well, I don't know; perhaps I have a little exaggerated"—I thought perhaps he was a little out of his mind, and that he had been drinking a little when he said that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Medical Officer at Holloway Prison, into which the prisoner was received on September 13th, 1897—in consequence of instructions, I made him a subject for special observation—the case was postponed from last Session to this, and he has been under my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189711220029"/>
               <p>observation for something over two months—he has been quiet and rational in his conduct, though he has appeared rather nervous and depressed mentally—rather more nervous, but not more depressed than a person ordinarily is who stands committed for trial on a charge of murder, except at the period when he received intelligence of his wife's death—he appeared to feel the death of his wife very keenly, and to realize the loss he had sustained—during the whole time he has been under my observation I could not find evidence of legal insanity, and I think he has been in a condition to appreciate the nature and character of an act he was doing, and to realize that it was wrong—I have read the evidence in this case, and have been present in Court during the greater part of this trial, and I have seen and heard nothing to lead me to think that he was actually legally insane on September 11th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The legal definition of insanity is that a person does not-realize the nature or quality of an act he has committed, and does not know it is wrong—there are very many people in confinement now who know an act is wrong and still do it—the test I apply is the definition of legal insanity—the prisoner is prematurely old—in the case of a man whose father and grandfather died between 40 and 50, one of imbecility and the other of general paralysis, there is more probability that he inherits some mental weakness—bodily health has a considerable bearing on mental health; a man in good bodily health is less likely to be affected mentally—the prisoner told me that while in the force he ruptured a blood-vessel and spat blood a good deal afterwards—I should not describe him as a man of strong mental power—if he bad any tendency to insanity in his constitution, the fact of his health breaking down would probably aggravate whatever the tendency was—he said that during the last 12 months his wife's health had been a source of great worry and anxiety to him—the earlier symptoms of melan<lb/>cholia would be nervousness and depression—a man might suffer from a delusion of which there would be no trace shortly afterwards—a very common variety of delusion where a person's mind is giving way, is that he is the subject of persecution, and is being followed and spoken to in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He has had no fit or anything of that kind while under my care; he has complained of certain feelings which I have watched, because they were somewhat of an epileptic character, he had no attack of epilepsy—speaking of his wife before and after her death, he gave a fairly collected account, but he spoke more slowly and foolishly than I should have expected from a man who had held such a position in the police-force—I heard he had been drinking for 18 months—drinking for 18 months to frequent excess would probably dull the intellect in a person prone to mental weakness.</p>

I live at 6, Crescent's Place, King's Cross—on Sunday, October 31st, I was a school-boy—I was with these boys, who are friends of mine—they have left school—about 2.30 we went to a boy Luther's house, and I bought a pistol of Luther for 3s.—Bond and Leader were with me—Luther gave me some bullets, or cartridges, and a ramrod—we went down the Essex Road, because there was a war on, and we went to fight the boys in Grosvenor Street—we failed to find them, and came back to the Pentonville Road—we arranged to meet again and I went home to dinner in Pentonville—about six p.m. I met Bond, Leader, and Charley Parsons—we went down the Essex Road again, and failed to find the boys—Bond said, "I mean to shoot some<lb/>body before I go home to-night"—he had said "Let me look at the pistol," and I let him look at it, but he would not give it back to me—I gave him some cartridges—then we came back to a coal-shed and saw four boys—we stood at the shed, and some boy asked for a light, and a boy gave one, and the pistol went off—there was no fight—I told the Magistrate that "Bond said. 'I mean to shoot someone before I go home to-night'"—I saw Bond fire at the boy—we ran away, and Parsons</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He went to the station quietly—the crowd were trying to get hold of the prisoner's arm—I was forcing them back—they called out several things—I heard, "I shall let you have it"—they were trying to get between the prisoner and me—there was no attempt by the prisoner to get away—the locality is a rough part and there is a class who will attempt to rescue a prisoner whether they know him or not.</p>

I live at Hale Lodge, Edgware—on November 6th, about 7.45 p.m., I was in the Green Man public-house at Hale, Edgware, when the prisoner entered the bar—I have seen him before—he was refused to be served, and went out—I had heard a dispute between him and the landlord about holding a gentleman's horse, and the prisoner used abusive language—the landlord ordered him away, and he refused to go—the prisoner said, "All right, my f—, I'll be level with you if I get five years for this"—a few minutes afterwards he added, "I will do you an injury before the morning"—I said, "I think you will get into trouble if you stop about here, I think you had better get off"—he went towards Edgware, and I followed as far as Hale Lodge, where I live, and went in at the gate—that is about 200 yards from the public—I heard him threatening, and followed about 20 yards further, and I saw him within three or four yards of a rick on the same side of the way as our house, and in a field adjoining about 100 yards from Hale Lodge—I then went back and went indoors—in a few minutes I heard somebody call fire—I went out and into the field, and saw a very large hay-rick alight, some police officers and a few more people—some men were pulling the barbed fencing down—I was talking to the officers when the prisoner came from behind the rick and said to the people and officers generally, "Here is Hennessey, what time did you see me here?I was not here at eight o'clock"—that was a few minutes past eight—six or seven minutes had elapsed since I last saw him—about eight I had heard the cry of fire—I had mentioned his name to the officers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in business at 35, Lavender Hill—in January, 1896, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi> referring to the Bourse Finance Company, Bourse Buildings—I wrote, and got a reply, and then gave some instructions, and sent a cheque for £5 for a share in a syndicate which the Bourse Finance Company were forming at that time, as I understood—a little while afterwards I got, as the profit on that share, a cheque for £9, drawn by Morgan and Sachwell—that cheque was duly met—in March, 1896, I received a com<lb/>munication from the Bourse Finance Company, and I gave them instructions to purchase Midland Ordinary Stock—and sent £10—I received this letter, dated March, 1896, signed, "The Bourse Finance Company.—E.M."—acknowledging the receipt of £10, and including a contract note for the purchase of Midland Ordinary Stock, the £10 I sent was for cover—I received another letter, dated March 7th (<hi rend="italic">Acknowledging receipt of cheque for</hi> £5, <hi rend="italic">and stating that they had bought Mialands, and enclosed contract note</hi>)—that was in consequence of instructions from me to buy some further Midlands—I received this letter after the Mid<lb/>March account, showing my position, and a balance due to me of £8 1s. 5d., and asking me for £2 16s. 3d. as contango, at the rate of three-eigths percent.—I sent a cheque for £2 16s. 3d.—I received this letter, dated March 18th (<hi rend="italic">Saying that Midlands had gone down, that they had covered his</hi> £500 <hi rend="italic">one percent., thinking it quite right to follow the stock, and asking for cheque for</hi> £5)—I sent that cheque, and received an acknowledgment, signed "The Bourse Finance Company"—on March 30th I got this letter asking for £7 10s. as further cover on the purchase of the £500 and £250 Midlands—I sent that cheque, and received this acknowledgment (<hi rend="italic">The letter added, that as he said he was short of ready cash, if he sent acceptance for</hi> £20 <hi rend="italic">or</hi> £30 <hi rend="italic">they would work the stock for him on obtaining his leave to</hi> do <hi rend="italic">so, and should only charge him four percent, and a small commission.</hi>)—I gave them this acceptance for £25, payable three months after date at the London and County Bank, Clapham Junction—it was drawn to the order of Sachwell &amp; Co., and endorsed Sachwell &amp; Co.—it was presented at my bankers and met by me—in sending that, I gave instructions for the purchase of 500 more Midlands—this is the letter acknowledging mine (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they had carried over the stock, and enclosed a statement; and that they had bought</hi> 500 <hi rend="italic">more Midlands as per contract enclosed, and would buy mort as opportunity offered</hi>)—at the end of the month I got this account, and then I got the</p>

Bourse Finance Company E. Morgan, manager—that bill was paid at its due date by me—in August, 1896, I got this letter, enclosing the account 10 date—(<hi rend="italic">the letter stated that in order to save the contango, and kept the stock open, they had decided it would be better to take up the Midlands, and enclosed two bills for</hi> £25 <hi rend="italic">each at four months, which they asked him to accept and return)—I</hi> accepted this bill for £25 at four months, drawn and endorsed by E. Morgan &amp; Co.—I think it was taken up from the discounters by some cheques that Morgan obtained from a firm of Aylmer, money that was owing, and I think Morgan took it up—about September, 1896, Morgan came to me and told me he had left Sachwell, and he wanted some money—I asked him about the Midlands, and whether he had received the dividend—he said, "No," and he wanted me to accept another bill in order that he might make up the' amount of deposit in taking up this stock, as the original deposit was supposed to be 10 percent.—he brought this bill with him for £23 14s. 6d., dated September 25th, 1896, at three months, drawn by E. Morgan, and endorsed by E. Morgan and 8. A. Cobbett—I accepted, and afterwards paid it—on the same day, September 25th, I got this letter (<hi rend="italic">Headed</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">Care of Mr. Moor. Memorandum from</hi> 2, <hi rend="italic">Pancras Lane, Queen Street," signed E.

R. Moor was also up in the lobby, I think—the office was one room on the top floor—in December, 1896, this bill for £26 14s. 6d. was sent me through the post by Morgan; I think it was filled up, but I cannot say—I accepted it—(<hi rend="italic">This was a three months' bill, drawn by E. Morgan, and endorsed E. Morgan and S. A.

               <p>definitely what Moor wanted it for—it was for £50 drawn by Morgan, and at three months—Morgan sent it back to me after a little while, and it was cancelled—I accepted also this bill for £34 17s., drawn and endorsed by Moor &amp; Co.—I said I would not accept another bill till I had the £50 bill back, and he sent it back, and I accepted another, which is this £34 17s. bill, I think—I did not notice the drawer—at the end of March or beginning of April in the next year, Morgan came to my house and asked to see me privately—I took him into my room, and he brought out a prospectus, and showed me this, I understood that he was forming the United Founds s' Company—he said he was getting together, I think, £500, and he had had this cheque of Evans handed to him, which he was not to use till he got the othrrs—he said Evans was a J.P., and gave me to understand that he was a man of means—I thought J.P.'s were men of position—he produced this cheque drawn by H. R. Evans on the Notting Hill Branch of the South Western Bank in favour of the United Founders' Company for £100, and dated April 27th, 1897—Morgan said he could not get the money for it till he had got the other huudreds—he asked me to keep it as security for a £50 Bill he wanted me to accept—he produced this blank bill, which he ultimately filled up for £45 (<hi rend="italic">This was drawn and accepted by Morgan &amp; Co. and accepted by Brook at three months</hi>—I accepted the bill after a long talk—he left the cheque with me, with this letter, after I demurred (<hi rend="italic">The letter, dated April</hi> 29th, <hi rend="italic">stated that in Consideration of Brook signing the acceptance for</hi> £45, <hi rend="italic">Morgan deposited with him, on behalf of the United Founders, a clieque for</hi> £100)—I had seen the prospectus before I accepted the bill; I glanced at it—it was headed, "The United Founders Association, Limited, capital £10,000; among the directors were H. R. Evans, Esq., J.P., and Morgan, Esq.; offices, 2, Pnncras Lane; Secretary, F. Moor, Esq."—I did not notice there was no banker's name on it, or that the application for shares was to the Directors of the United Founders' Association, Limited—I gave my bill for £45—it has been presented by the firm of Messrs. Bode &amp; Co., as discounters—I have not met it, and I am being sued on it by Messrs. Bode; the action is pending—when I gave that bill, I believed the cheque was a good one and that the United Founders' Association was all <hi rend="italic">bona-fide;</hi> I took Morgan's word—after that date I wrote several letters to Morgan. (<hi rend="italic">These were read</hi>: 4 <hi rend="italic">letter of May</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1897, <hi rend="italic">stated that he was exceedingly disappointed at not receiving any cash according to promise; that he was in a most unsatisfactory condition, and wanted the Midland Stock cleared up, and complaining of the Defendants' treatment of him. Morgan's reply to this was dated May 7th; "Dear Sir, only just received your letter of the 5th, why this upsets will write you later." On May 8th Brook wrote that his liabilities he found were greater than he anticipated and that he wanted the last</hi> £50 <hi rend="italic">for business purposes, and he had long ago given his orders to sell the Midlands; other letters followed begging the Defendants' to have respect for his feelings and anxiety, as his creditors were pressing him.</hi>) A bill for £25 referred to in those letters was one he had obtained from me a little while previously—I filled in a blank form, and later on he wrote and told me it was only £15 he had filled it in for—I then sent him another £10, and afterwards I found out it was not a £15 but</p>

Morgan, managing director."—I watched the stock—it went down—I instructed them to sell, and received this letter, (No. 7) in reply, enclosing contracts 8 and 9—I received a telegram asking me for a further cheque for £30, which I sent and received this receipt and this</p>

I believe Morgan is one of our shareholders—I cannot tell you whether all these cheques have been honoured—I do not know every shareholder, but I believe Morgan was one—I believe he held five shares—the payments in 1896 were £4,918 and the balance at the end of the year was £10 12s. 7d.—this is Morgan's pass-book—The payments to the end of the year are £2,290 14s.—the account is still open practically—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is our Secretary's signature—the bank had a lien on this account for any balance—it was arranged that Morgan should not draw below £5, he had to keep £5 in the account—at the beginning of July we found a balance of £8 6s. 10d.—Up to July 5th the balance <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> the payments, amounted to £39 17s. 2d., and out £29 12s.—£6 was paid in on the 6th, which, with the £7 would be £13, but there was a further £2 10s.—the arrangement was to keep the lien of £5 on one bill, but the second bill made the lien £7 10s.—there was not enough to meet the cheque by 4s. 10d.—the bank might have honoured that—the £20 bill has been met—I believe there was a credit of £32, but not on Morgan's account, we held that for Moor—it was a verbal agreement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The cashiers have to inform themselves of any lien—I should not have cashed it if it had been presented that morning—On July 1st £18 10s. 10d. cash was paid in—this is the agreement by Morgan not to draw the balance below £5—it is stamped—we had charges on a debt due to Mr. Mathews, £70 odd; we had that sent to us last week, and the balance was set on one side—there is a charge for overdrafts. Mr. Brooke's bill was returned, and that created an overdraft, and we charged commission on it—Morgan still holds his five shares, but they are not fully paid up.</p>

R. Moor" was put up on the office door, and below "Mercantile Trading and Invesment Company" on the door-post, and a little later the "United Founders, Limited" went up—the Christmas rent was paid, and the Lady Day—the premises were vacated just before the June quarter without any notice—I never got the Midsummer quarter—I recognize Morgan—I asked him when he was leaving whether he had any explanation to give, he said, "No."</p>

Some were ready to put into foolscap envelopes; also a packet of newspaper cuttings refer<lb/>ing to the Founders' Company and the Finance Company, a cheque on the Union Bank, three letters for Mr. Hewick, and some typewritten circulars on "How to employ idle money," similar to these—also these respecting the London and North-Western Deferred and Midland De<lb/>ferred, showing how to make money by them—I also found a cash book, a ledger and two journals; the last entry is 1890—there are no entries in the other book—there was a share certificate book showing that numbers 1 to 10 had been used—they relate to 300 shares each one of which was to Morgan—the counterfoils are not properly filled in—I also found some envelopes addressed and some stamped—I found in the office a bond for 100 dollars and a great many letters which had passed through the post, and a great many of them were to Moor—I think I have read nearly all of them—I found documents against both prisoners in the County Court, and in the High Court proceedings against Morgan, also four letter-books, and a letter signed H.

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the District Messengers' Company—if you want to send a letter to the Temple, I have a boy waiting; you give it to me, and I give the boy a ticket and enter the day of the month, the boy brings the ticket back receipted and an entry is made in the office on a sheet—I have got press copies—I find on August 24th an entry of a letter addressed by Mr. Morgan to Mr. Cobbett, of 10, Bloomfield Street—Spoke's number is 639—I have no doubt that that letter went on August 24th—our dates are sometimes corrected if they are wrong—this date has undoubtedly been a 3—it is written under a 4—it has been altered from 23 to 24 by the sergeant of the Company—he would know about it by being told when it was brought back—I should compare it with the sheet—the sergeant would make out the sheet—I should say that the sheet is the most correct, but the entry would be made when it was handed in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can see that the entry refers to that number by the time—this certainly looks as if it had been 13—I don't think it has been altered from 13; it has been altered from 23 to 24—if a ticket had been handed in on the 13th, representing that a letter had been taken in on the 18th, the 13th would appear in the margin—that is, at the office—it left at 9.45, and returned at 10.10.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I came back from my holiday on the Saturday previous to the 24th—Mr. Morgan spoke to me, that was the first time I saw him—he handed me the message—I. saw the ticket made out—he did not say, "I have made-a mistake"—I had a letter from him on the Friday, a fortnight ago, which is destroyed—it asked if I could say whether I had a letter for Mr. Cobbett—that was not from the solicitor, but I sent the answer to the solicitor.</p>
               <p>

I was to hand them over to whichever of them came—Krahn did not come to the office after "Spencer, Dickenson &amp; Co." was put up, but Reekie did—I sometimes gave the letters to a young lady, I do not know her name, and sometimes Reekie came himself—I kept a book in which I placed registered letters, and entered them—registered letters came for Spencer, Dickenson &amp; Co., which I signed the postman's receipt for—I do not know Reekie's writing—here is "Burrows, Glasgow" on one, and it looks like" H.B.R." after that—I gave a number of letters to the police addressed to "Spencer, Dickenson &amp; Co." on September 22nd—the first postmark is September 14th, when they began to accumulate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cfoss-examined.</hi> Whenever letters were handed to Reekie, they were unopened whether registered or not—I. knew him before he took the office as working on the river, and I knew he had a public-house—I do not know that his wife managed the public-honse while he worked on the river—he was looked upon as a respectable man.</p>

My last investment was on August 3rd, when I had got £15 10s. to my credit in the Systematic Investment—I received £3 6s. 5d. profit in respect of that sum—on August 6th I received this letter—" Dear Sir,—To-day being settlement day, we have much pleasure in handing you herewith cheque value 11s. 3d.," &amp;c.—I did not purchase any shares in response to that letter—I then got letter No. 283, dated August 13th—"Americans are good to buy to any extent, which is admitted even by the most cautious purchasers, and we therefore advise your interest in the boom now commencing"—I still did not invest—on August 24th I received this letter—"The operation you were interested in last week turned out unsuccessful, and closed with a loss of cover"—up to that time I had received Leonard &amp; Co.'s circulars regularly—this circular of September 3rd I obtained through a friend, and I observed that so far from my operation turning out a loss, on August 24th they were advertising to other people that profits were still going on—I did not get the profits mentioned in that—besides investing in Leonard &amp; Co. I invested £5 in Percy Seymour &amp; Co.'s Operations, which I lost—my nett loss was £16 odd—I believed that they were genuine businesses, to emphasize that I had written to Leonard &amp; Co. asking for an assurance of good faith.</p>

Harrison, in 154, Tooley Street, which is the address of Reekie's public-house—the usual signature is left blank—the person describing himself as secretary of the Co-operative Traders' Association is Krahn—I also found a pawnbroker's duplicate, or contract note, in respect of a single stone diamond ring in the name of Henry Reekie, August 20th, 1897, for £15—I also found this letter book containing letters, signed, "Frederick Burrows &amp; Co.," and" George Harrison"—many of them contained acknowledgments of the receipts of sums of £5—I also found an indiarubber stamp of Spencer, Dickenson &amp; Co., and a number of circulars of Burrows, and Spencer, Dickenson &amp; Co.—I arrested Alford on September 23rd on a warrant—I searched his office, 171, Queen Victoria Street, and found a few copies of the <hi rend="italic">Financial Telegraph</hi>—I searched Effingham house—there were no books or documents there—Reekie was subpaeaned as a itness—I previously had a conversation with him I did not then know the, facts<lb/>deposed to by the witnesses at the Mansion House—I arrested Reekie on September 28th, at 154, Tooley Street—I read the warrant to him charging him with conspiracy and fraud—I also showed him a cheque endorsed" Spencer, Dickenson" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said, "Yes, I wrote that at the dictation of Krahn, I have received letters in the name of Spencer Dickenson, and taken them to Krahn; he has opened them—I have also received circulars from the printers, and taken them on to him, and in fact I have been more of an errand boy for him, and if I am called upon I will speak the truth about this matter: he advanced me the money to open the account, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, at the Economic Bank—I conveyed him to the station, and going over the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable in the employ of the South<lb/>Eastern Railway Company at Charing Cross Station—about three p.m. on Saturday, October 23rd, I was on duty in the fore-court—I saw the prisoner there with a hansom cab, standing against the luggage platform; he had no passenger inside—I asked him whether he was engaged; he said, "Yes, I have a fare waiting at the cloak room"—I said, "You seem to be here a very long time; I think you had better pull up over the way," meaning the rank—he did so, but pulled up in such a manner as to block the traffic going out at the gate—I asked him to pull up a little further so that the traffic could get out properly—my attention was diverted for a little while, as we were very busy—then I noticed an altercation going on, and I approached the spot where it was going on—I saw the deceased holding up his open hand to the prisoner, who was on his cab—the deceased was standing on the ground, and three or four yards from the prisoner—I could not hear what was said—at that moment a London and North-Western Railway omnibus came between the prisoner's cab and the privileged rank and obscured my view—after it had passed I saw the deceased lying on his back just out of the gates in the Strand, bleeding from a wound in his head—I assisted a metropolitan constable to get him into a cab and send him to the hospital—I did not see any blow struck.</p>

               <p>Lambeth—about three on October 23rd I was driving a four<lb/>wheeled cab from the inside of Charing Cross Station—I had a lady inside—when I was passing out of the station the prisoner said, "What a b——fine lot; who is the b——builder of that?" I pulled up for a moment with surprise, and he said, "I would not—"—I said, "Why do you insult me, going out of this yard, when I have a lady inside my cab; if you do not apologize I will call someone who will make you wash your mouth out; I don't know you, I have never spoken to you"—I moved on a few yards, and on crossing by the gate there was a metropolitan constable, and I made a communication to him—I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

R. O. Johnson, due October 9th, 1897, was drawn on me and I accepted it—when I admitted last time that it was on Kressel'a Alimentary Extract Company I did not know, and it took me by surprise—if I swore I was a graduate of Heidelberg University, I am only an undergraduate; I readily admitted it in cross-examination—I have been called Dr. Kressel—I was two years at Heidelberg after my conviction.</p>

Young &amp; Co., who act for me, are Warsany's solicitors—they appeared for me at the police-court—ut the police-court Kressel offered to withdraw the proceedings if a satisfactory apology was given, and I would not apologize.</p>

Young—I kept it because he did not ask for it; I was not going to run after him with it—I did not want to use it against him—I have good grounds to believe that at that time no complaint was made to the post-office of the non-receipt of the letter—no Kressel complained about the letter, but he said nothing about the date of it.</p>

About 7.20 p.m., on October 23rd, I was in Myddleton Passage, Clerkenwell—I saw Collins surrounded by a large crowd at the bottom of the passage—Young had his right hand raised as if he was striking Collins, who had Small in custody—they were about 20 yards off—I ran to Collins' assistance—Young ran towards me—he had something glittering in his right hand—I closed with him—he made a plunge with his right hand, and whatever it was went between my arm and body—I drew my truncheon and struck him across the left side—Worrell came to my assistance, and we took Young to the station, he was very violent all the way—at the station he said "I wish I had <hi rend="italic">jibbed</hi> you and some more of the f————,—on putting two prisoners in a cell on the Sunday at 7.40 p.m., Young shouted to Small who was in his cell within hearing, "Darkey, I stabbed at the b—————six times, but I only stabbed him twice"—on the Monday morning when Young was re-charged with attempting to murder Collins, he said, "I am innocent, it was not me that stabbed him at all."</p>
