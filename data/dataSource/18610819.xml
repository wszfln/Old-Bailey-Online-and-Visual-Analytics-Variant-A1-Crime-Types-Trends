I am a Trinity pilot, of 20, Stanesbury-road, in the parish of All Saints, Poplar—my house was broken into on 1st August between 2 and 3 in the morning—I was in bed—my wife awoke me, and told me there was a noise—I got up, and listened some time—I heard nothing, and I then opened the window, and saw what I took to be a man lying down on the top of the larder in the back yard—I asked who was there—there was no reply—I said, "If you do not speak I will shoot you"—I got no answer—the figure still remained there—I was about to dress to go down, and Mrs. Leigh called my attention to a man running away—I saw him—he came from the back part of the premises, towards the house to where his coat was lying—it was his coat that I had taken to be a man—he looked up and said that he had nothing of mine—he picked up his coat, and then ran through the yard again—I called, "Police"—he scrambled over the gate, and the policeman caught him just as he was outside the gate—I went down stairs afterwards, and found my house had been entered by the dining-room window—part of a pane of glass had been broken out—it would admit a man's hand right on to the fastening—the fastening had been undone, and the window opened—I missed only a cloth cap which had been left on the table in the dining-room—I have since seen the cap—the policeman showed it me—it was mine—I saw the prisoner directly afterwards in the policeman's hands—I saw him go into the policeman's hands.</p>

               <p>there would not have to go into the kitchen; it is on the other side of the way—there is no other door except through the kitchen or from my bed-room—the only outlet from the bar is through the kitchen, because we have not a public bar—the prisoner went about his work as usual—the cook and the housemaid were in the kitchen besides me—Mr. Bunyer's aunt, at Worthing, made inquiries about the prisoner—I did not go into his bed-room after he left; I never go in—his things had disappeared before he left; I know that from the servants—we had no sitting-room company that day—there was no other waiter or chambermaid going in and out—he did not, to my knowledge, leave Worthing before his time; we had a very good character with him from there—the porter was not in and out, no one went to the drawer but myself—I may have opened it to take a tea-spoon out, but I should not then have missed the plate, because it was at the back of the drawer and five butter-boats and other articles in front of it—I saw the butter-boats, and concluded that the other things were there.</p>

I keep the Old Bell, Holborn-hill—on the night of 26th April, or early on the 27th, I counted the plate and carried it up into my bedroom, which was locked all night; that part of the house is entirely away from customers or servants—the prisoner came to me as under-waiter; he told me he came from the Steyne Hotel, Worthing, and referred me there—he left my house on the morning of the 27th without telling me that he was going, but he was to have left on the following Tuesday—I did not see him again till 1st or 2d July—you go down a gate-way, and the coffee-room is on the right and the bar and parlour are on the left.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 23, St. James's-terrace, Whitechapel. On Saturday night, 13th July, about 10 o'clock, I was coming home from the City towards St. James's-terrace—I had had a little to drink, but was not tipsy—I had been with a friend during the day—when I came to White-chapel Church a heavy storm of rain came on, and I went into a public-house and called for some refreshment—I pulled out a bag which contained some silver, and took out 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for the beer, and put the bag into my pocket again—there were several people in the house—I saw the prisoner there—he spoke to me and asked me to drink—I did drink with him—he seemed a respectable young man—there was another young man in his company—I left 'the house and they followed me across the street, and the prisoner said, "We will see you safe home, father"—I went up Union-street, and at the corner of Mountford-street I bad occasion to do what. nature required, and while I was doing so the prisoner hooked his arm sharply round my neck very tightly, and I was nearly throttled by him—he nearly strangled me, and with his other hand he pulled the bag out of my pocket—his companion hit me a tremendous blow on the head which knocked me down, and there I lay insensible for a short period—they both ran away—as soon as I could I picked myself up again, but I could not catch them—Mountford-street is no thoroughfare, and they turned back again towards Whitechapel—they were gone when I went back—I had never seen either of them before—I saw the prisoner again that same night in the station-house,</p>

On 9th July, frominformation I received, I went with my son and Inspector Fife, and Sergeant Elliott, to Featherstone-street—I saw the prisoner coming towards me, pushing a costermonger's barrow—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Well, Dick</hi>, I have received instructions from the solicitor of the Mint to look after you, you are suspected strongly of dealing largely in counterfeit coin; what have you about you?"—he said, "Nothing, Mr. Brannan"—he was then seized by Sergeant Brannan, and I took this coil of rope off the handle of his barrow, undid it, and found in it nine counterfeit shillings, and two florins, separately wrapped up in paper—I said, "What do you call this?" he said, "Oh, my God, I am done!"—I said, "It appears the imprisonment you have had has not had the desired effect; you might have got a living at your work"—he said, "There is no living to be got at it, Mr. Brannan; I cannot help it"—I said, "You must come back with us to your lodgings, we are going to search them"—he occompanied us to a house in Feather-stone-court, and on entering the room he said, "Mr. Brannan, I will save you the trouble," and went to a cupboard and took out a packet containing three counterfeit florins, which he put into the hands of Sergeant Elliott—we took him to the station, and on the charge being read to him he said, "I am guilty.".</p>

I was formerly a police-inspector, and am now in the service of the Mint—I received information which induced me to go with sergeant Leather to Hazlewood-place, in July last—we found the front door open and the parlour door ajar—I opened it, went in, and saw a man and the prisoner sitting at a table—there was a dog in the room—the prisoner put her left hand in one of the pockets of this apron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which she had on—she had some difficulty in getting her hand out—she took out something which appeared to be a rag—sergeant Leather attempted to seize her, but the dog snapped at him, and he pulled his hand back—the prisoner then moved a board which was temporarily placed on the floor, put her hand down a hole and dropped a rag down—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the rag—the man pushed a table between sergeant Leather and the woman to prevent him taking her, but he took her—I went down into the cellar and on the top of some dust I found this rag containing these three counterfeit florins separately wrapped in paper, precisely under the hole—I re-entered the room, held the rag in my hand, and the prisoner said, "I</p>

               <p>the front door was often fast—if it was not, you opened the gate first, then went the three yards of lobby, and then his door was on the right-hand side, on the ground floor—the window that he tapped at overlooked the road—there is a footpath there on that side of the road—the back way into the house was at the gable end—I had to go through the yard-door to get to the back—door, and then through the kitchen into the lobby I have spoken of—there was a door between the lobby and the kitchen, which cut off his room from the kitchen—on Wednesday, the 29th, the day before the codicil was executed, I had a conversation with John Orme Roe, and I copied a draft that he brought to me—having copied it, I went to the old man on the 30th—I do not think he was looking much better on that day—I do not know that he was much better—he questioned me as to his health—I was examined on the former occasion to establish the validity of the will—I cannot say whether I stated on that occasion that the testator looked much better on that day—it is a long while ago—I have never looked at the evidence—I might have said so; I won't dispute it—I told him the business I had come on—I first read the codicil to him; he then took it up and read it himself, and said, "That will do"—I cannot say whether he read it without his spectacles—I remember well enough his taking it up and saying, "That will do," but I cannot remember whether he had his spectacles or not—he asked Turner to get the ink for him, and he tried the pen several times—he then said that he must attend to his books, for he had neglected them sadly of late—they were books of his own business.</p>

I live at Sutton, near Macclesfield—I keep a shop there—I knew the deceased, Edward Roe, for seventeen years—I am one of the attesting witnesses to this will and codicil—both these signatures are my writing—I remember the day when the codicil was executed, the 30th December—Mr. Roe was pretty well in his health that day—I remember his signing the codicil—at that time his hands were <hi rend="italic">cramped</hi> in this way (<hi rend="italic">contracted</hi>)—he had some difficulty in signing his name—he signed a piece of paper before he began, and tried his pen on it—I know his handwriting very well—I have seen it many and many a time—T believe this letter and cheque are not his writing, nor the envelope—he could not write in that way; not so well—he used generally to sign his name, Edward Roe—that was his regular way.</p>

                  </hi>. I live near Macclesfield—I acted as servant to Mr. Edward Roe for about three years before his death—I had known him about thirty years—he died on 1st January, 1859—I was in attendance on him for the three weeks or fortnight preceding his death—during that period he was confined to one room—I used to attend on him both day and night for that fortnight; all day and night—there was a casement at the room in which he was, which was fastened—it was fast when I went there, and had been for years—a person named Elizabeth Mycock was also in attendance on him—she is seventy-five years of age—she has fractured her thigh, and is not able to be here—I remember the day when the codicil was executed—I have seen the letter which has been produced (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—Mr. Roe was not able to write such a letter as that on that day—I was in attendance on him the whole of that day—I never left the house on that day, without it was for a few minutes to relieve nature—I did not hear of any such letter being written that day—no person could have gone into his room and out again with such a letter, without my seeing them—he used to show me all letters that he wrote—he always wrote a copy before he wrote the letter—he used to write upon small note paper, not with lines upon it; he used to rule them himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Johnson and Coote, of Gray's Inn-square, and also of Doctors' Commons—I know the prisoner; he was a client of ours in respect of certain proceedings in the Court of Probate, of <hi rend="italic">Sale v. Roe</hi>, and also in the Court of Chancery, of <hi rend="italic">Roe v. Roe</hi>—on 19th June I wrote this letter, to Messrs. Brocklehurst and Bagshaw, by the instruction of the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "June 19th, 1860—Gentlemen,—Re Edward Roe, deceased—We think it right to inform you that we have to-day had a long interview with our client, the Rev. James Roe, with reference to a letter which has been discovered, within the last few days, written by the deceased Edward Roe, dated 30th December, 1858, in which he complains of the coercion exercised towards him, and forwarding him a cheque. We intend immediately to consult counsel as to the course which should be pursued by Mr. James Roe, which we imagine will be "that we should at once apply to the Court for a new trial we inform you of this that the executors may not proceed to distribute the estate until the questions raised by this letter have been disposed of—We are, gentlemen, your very obedient servants, Johnson and Coote.")—I afterwards wrote another letter of September 5th—it is my writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: September 5th, 1 860—Gentlemen,—Re Edward Roe, deceased—We think it right to inform you that, since writing our letter to you of the 19th June last, we have satisfied ourselves of the authenticity of the letter of the 30th December, 1858, which we shall be able to prove unquestionably to be in Mr. Edward Roe's handwriting, and we shall now proceed to take such steps as counsel may advise. Though our letter to you of the 19th June last, was, we imagine, quite sufficient to put the executor on his guard, and to caution him against distributing the estate, pending the questions raised by Mr. Edward Roe's letter, still we think it right to give you this further notice, as, notwithstanding our letter, the executor is, we are informed, proceeding in the distribution of the estate.—We are, gentlemen, yours faithfully, Johnson and Coote.")—I received the letter and envelope produced from the prisoner on 13th August, 1860—I retained them in my possession until they were deposited in the Court of Chancery, under an order of Vice—Chancellor Wood, with the exception of four or five days, when I handed them to my partner, who took them into the country—I received them back again from him—on Saturday, 26th January last, I was at my office in Doctors Commons, in an inner room with the prisoner—I opened the door and requested Mr. Surrey to come in—after he came in, the prisoner, looking at him, said, "Who are you?"—I answered for Mr. Surrey by saying, "I think he is the son of Mr. Surrey, of Fleet-lane;" and I said to Mr. Surrey, "Is that (pointing to the prisoner) the gentleman for whom your father made the dies?"—he said, "Yes, he is"—the prisoner seemed confounded with the accusation that seemed to be implied (I had had some conversation with him before Mr. Surrey entered the room)—he seemed confounded by the accusation; he put his hand to his head and stood aghast, and quite thunderstruck at the charge—he left our office a few minutes afterwards—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186108190030"/>
               <p>these document were deposited in the Court of Chancery under an order of very nearly that date—on the morning of that day a summons was attended, which I attended myself before the chief clerk of the Vice-Chancellor—that was to deposit the documents in the hands of the Court of Chancery—that summons was taken out by the defendant's agents, Messrs. Elsdale and Byrne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the order made to deposit the documents before Mr. Surrey came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, before I saw Mr. Surrey—I did not commu<lb/>nicate to the prisoner that the summons was taken out, or that there was an application to deposit the documents—the summons was returnable on my return to London, which was that same day—I did not communicate to the prisoner, when I saw him in my office, that there was such an application and order; I had no opportunity of doing so—I told him before Mr. Surrey came in that the order had been made to deposit the documents—I do not know exactly the day when the summons was made; it was served before my return from Macclesfield—my partner, Mr. Coote, has not attended a great deal more to this matter than myself; he attended to the trial at Chester more than myself, but I have attended all the Chancery proceedings—it was on the 29th or 30th of August that I handed these documents over to Mr. Coote for four or five days—that was in order that he might make inquiries at Macclesfield and elsewhere, about the genuineness of the documents—Mr. Coote is in London; he is not in court; I think he is at Doctors' Commons—he is accessible at any moment—I gave him the documents, with instructions to ascertain their genuineness—he has told me that he did make inquiries, and upon his report of those inquiries I acted in the suit—it was after that report from him that I wrote the letter to Messrs. Brocklehurst, which has been read, stating that I had satisfied myself of the authenticity of the documents—after that I proceeded in the suit, filed the bill, and went to considerable expense—those expenses have not been paid—I did not undertake to carry on the suit at my own risk; merely advanced money on account—we are not out of pocket to a very large amount; only the amount expended in this suit; not in the suit of <hi rend="italic">Sale v. Roe</hi>; those have been paid—I should not have undertaken the suit if I had thought there was any doubt about it—Mr. Coote conducted the trial which took place at Chester, and saw the witnesses—Mr. and Mrs. Loney were both witnesses on that trial—I know that Mr. Coote went to Macclesfield and saw Mr. and Mrs. Loney—I know also that he saw Mrs. Thompson; she was formerly a Miss Gee; a relation of the family—he also saw the postmistress at Macclesfield, and put the envelope and stamps before her; at least, so he told me—I also know that he went to Bath, and saw the Bath postmaster, and put the envelope and stamps before him—I think he also saw Mr. Hollway, the gentleman mentioned in the bill, from whom the parcel was said to have come—after receiving the result of this infor<lb/>mation from Mr. Coote, I wrote to Messrs. Brocklehurst—I also wrote to Mr. Roe, on 5th September—being satisfied by Mr. Coote's inquiries I then took proceedings—the 24th January was the first day that any commn—nication was made to me by the other side about—Mr. Surrey; the letter and cheque was not submitted to me before 13th August—I suppose it was to Mr. Coote—I only know that, from what Mr. Cooteh as said—Mr. Coote did not submit the original letter to me—he gave me some informa<lb/>tion upon which the letter of 19th June was written—the prisoner came to town on the 19th, and on that day he wrote out a copy of the letter from his own head, not having the letter with him—at the time I wrote the</p>

               <p>letter of 19th June I had not seen the original letter or cheque—I had seen a copy which the prisoner gave me—I have seen the prisoner in the presence of Mr. Coote—we were together on 19th June—the original letter was placed before Mr. Coote some time before that—I am not sure of the day—I think it was on the 4th of June—I only speak from what Mr. Coote told me—it was certainly some time before the 19th—I do not think there is any call-book at Doctors' Commons—Mr. Coote has a journal of his own in which be makes entries, and I enter in my own journal what I do—we do not eater jointly—there is no unfriendliness between myself and Mr. Coote—I have seen the prisoner with Mr. Coote—I first saw him with him on 19th June, the day I wrote this letter I met the prisoner at Doctors' Commons, at the request of Mr. Coote—Mr. Coote told me on that occasion that he had seen the original document; that Mr. Roe had been to town and shown him the original letter and envelope—I do not remember his saying that he had looked at the date of the stamp on the envelope—I do not recollect his telling me whether he did or not—I do not think Mr. Coote has been subpoenaed on the part of the prosecution—he was not examined at the police-court—I communicated to the other side that Mr. Coote had made inquiries about the genuineness of these documents—while the documents were in my hands persons called on behalf of Mr. Hartwell Roe to see them several times—Mr. Hartwell Roe himself called on 3d November—I do not think any one called before that—I received an answer to my letter of 19th June from Messrs. Brocklehurst—when I wrote the letter of 5th September, no one called to see the documents and inquire about them—the 3d of November was the first time that any one came to see them—on that day Mr. Hartwell Roe, and Mr. Collis, an attorney, acting for him, called—they called twice on the 3d, and remained for a long time on both occasions—I showed them the letter, cheque, and envelope, and they examined them very carefully; they used a lens, or microscope—I am not sure whether that was on the first occasion, but they did after<lb/>wards, certainly—they used very powerful lenses, I am not sure about the microscope—on 5th Mr. Collis called alone, and on 6th Mr. Collis and Mr. Hartwell Roe both called again—on 8th I endeavoured to obtain from Messrs. Brocklehurst some cheques and papers so that I might compare them—I did not receive them—they attended with them—I did not have the custody of them—they brought them so that they might be compared—they brought cheques of the testators; not letters—I also procured some letters through the prisoner—Mr. Loney supplied Mr. Coote with them, and Mr. Coote gave them over to me—I think that was before he went to Macclesfield—I asked him to let me see some of the documents that I might compare them—Mr. Loney did not bring any to me—he brought them to Mr. Coote—they were writings containing accounts; not strictly letters, any of them—I think I have them here—it was such writing of the testator as he was able to furnish us with.</p>

Brocklehurst—the result of that comparison in my own mind was that I was satisfied there appeared to be a great similarity in the writing, so strong that I had no doubt they were the same—the suit was commenced before that, and we went on with it—it was not commenced before the documents ere received by Mr. Coote from Mr. Loney—I com<lb/>pared</p>

               <p>those documents with the cheque and envelope, and was satisfied with the comparison, and subsequently to that instituted the suit—I then com<lb/>pared them with the cheque received from Messrs. Brocklehurst, and was satisfied then—on 15th I produced the letter, cheque, and envelope to two experts, Mr. Netherclift and Mr. Adlard—Mr. Hartwell Roe was with them, and Mr. Collis also—they brought the experts with them—they are men of great celebrity—they all four examined them for more than an hour—on 17th Mr. Cooke, another expert, compared the documents with the cheques I had obtained from Mr. Brocklehurst—Mr. Cooke was called in by us for our own protection—I think we did it as a proper precaution—we thought it a right step to take—Mr. Cooke is a gentleman of eminence as an expert—on 19th I also called in Mr. Lane—he bad made an appointment to come on 17th, but did not come till the 19th—he examined them carefully on 19th, with magnifying glasses, and so on—I do not think he measured them with a compass—I think Mr. Hartwell Roe did so—I can hardly say; so much has been done—on 17th Mr. Adlard, Mr. Hartwell Roe, and Mr. Collis again called to see them, and again examined them for a considerable time—on 28th Mr. Brocklehurst called with Mr. Hartwell Roe and Mr. Collis, and they again examined them very carefully—on 3d December Mr. Adlard, Mr. Collis, and Mr. Hartwell Roe again called and saw them, and they then examined them for a considerable time—on 15th a man named Burgess and Mr. Stainbridge called; they did not see them on that day, but they did on the 18th—they were sent by Messrs. Brocklehurst—I do not know what Burgess is—I believe he has been a policeman—Stainbridge is a clerk in the General Post Office—he came to look at the post office stamps—they inspected them carefully—the experts, introduced by Mr. Hartwell Roe, never expressed any opinion at all in my presence—having been present at all these examinations I was still satisfied and still continued the suit—on 7th January I received a letter from Messrs. Brocklehurst, asking me to give a photograph copy, and I said they could have it if they liked—I was first told anything about Mr. Surrey on 24th January; that was by Mr. Parrott—I believe he is the attorney for John Orme Roe—up to that time I had not any reason whatever to doubt the genuineness of these documents—there were many insinuations made during my stay at Macclesfield, but no positive statement was made to me before the 24th—I discontinued the suit in consequence of what Mr. Surrey stated.</p>

I am a relief engraver, of 15, Fleet-lane, City—I am acquainted with a gentleman named Perraton, and have several times executed orders for him—he came to me in the course of the year 1860 with this paper, marked A 1—I had some conversation with him, and he also gave me this other paper, marked B 2—in consequence of receiving those papers and the directions he gave me, I made two stamps—that was somewhere about 25th June; I cannot exactly say the day—Mr. Perraton also left with me these two other papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were attached to the others at the time I had them—they were in two parcels, two papers in each—they were both received at one time—I executed them—one was a stamp with four straight lines in it—since this matter has been investigated, I have made two fac-similes for the purpose of explaining my evidence—Mr. Humphreys has them—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them, with this exception, I made a circular stamp for letters separately—I did not know what letters were wanted—this fac-simile has been set up since the occurrence has transpired—the type was not arranged when I supplied it, because I did not know how the prisoner wanted to arrange it—I made all the types that are in these two stamps—I made them circular stamps with movable letters, so that they might be put into any words which the letters would stamp—I made the letters that are on these pieces of paper—I made a circular stamp with ten letters in the first instance, and a space with power to admit of one letter; ditto for four letters, and ditto for two—I afterwards received back the stamp to admit of ten letters, and altered it so as to receive twelve—I took the stamps with the letters to Mr. Perraton, I think on 29th July, having made a few more movable types—the letters which I made would form, if so disposed, the word Macclesfield and the word Bath—the initial letters D and J, and the figures 1 5 9 2—on 8th August, I saw the prisoner at my shop, 15, Fleet-lane, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning—he said he was sent by Mr. Perraton, recommended to me as the maker of the stamps, and he wanted certain alterations, and asked me if I would devote a few hours with him—I agreed to do so—he brought with him the two stamps that I had done in the first place for Mr. Perraton with the fittings, and he said, "Consider yourself as working for me now, and not for Mr. Perraton"—he wanted certain technical alterations which did not seem to correspond exactly with the marks that he wanted them to correspond with, and I altered them under his own eye—I had to alter each letter separately to correspond with letters that he had with him marked in a book—it was a memorandum book with a black cover—he looked at each letter and the impressions, and got me to alter them separately—he took the impressions in my shop—I did not see the marks in the book; but he took, impressions, and then looked at them with his back to me at the time, and then gave me directions to take a little bit off here, or a little bit off there, wherever he thought it might be necessary—he was with me on the first day about four or five hours I should think—my two sons, William and Henry, were there during part of that day—I had to make the stamp larger, and in doing so the centre came out, and I had to make a new stamp entirely—I asked him for his card in the evening—he did not give it me, but he gave me a half-sovereign, and said he supposed that would do as well—he, came again the next day, and we were progressing with this circular stamp, the old one and the fresh one I had made—he was with me about the</p>

I am a clerk at the post-office at Macclesfield—it was part of my duty in 1858 and 1859 to change the date of the post-office endorsing stamps—in the course of business at the post-office, I change the endorsing stamp at different periods of the day—it is part of my duty before I stamp any letters, to take an impression of the stamp, when changed, on a piece of paper kept for that purpose—the stamps are changed now at 12 o'clock at noon, and about 5 in the afternoon—the letter D is put in at 12—the letter A is put in up to 12, B at 12, and C at 5—in the month of January, 1859, the letter B was lost, we used the letter D instead—I have got the sheet here on which the impressions were made by me when I changed the stamps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I first used the letter D on 3d of January—on 1st January I used the letters A, B, and C—this envelope could not have passed through our post-office on 1st January, 1859—I continued to use the letter D up to the 9th of May; all the letters passing through the Macclesfield post-office, which were posted between 12 and 5, from 3d of January to 9th of May in that year, would bear the letter D on them.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said something about the letters not being upright, how are the post-office stamps made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The word "Bath" is cut in the solid, that is, the letters are not movable, but fixed—I should think the word "Bath" on the envelope was made by movable type; the B is not upright, and does not correspond with the other letters, they are Dot uniform in line—a letter posted at Macclesfield at night would come down by the Midland Railway by way of Birmingham in a sealed bag—that is called the North country mail—I have here a registered letter delivery receipt-book, which contains a stamped impression taken from the same stamp as that used in the book that was sent to the chief office—I had not looked at this at the time the opinion was expressed to the gentleman who called to inquire whether the stamp was a genuine one; he only called with one envelope with a good impression of the Bath stamp on the back, and very good impression of the Macclesfield stamp on the front, but it was not this—I cannot say how long ago my attention was called to the date of that transaction, it was towards the end of last year—I believe that gentleman called before I saw Mr. Roe upon, the subject, but I cannot speak with any positivenese.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not produce this book when I was asking you about the stamp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was not the book you inquired for—this book is used for registered letters; it is a distinct book altogether—on 2d January, 1859, A was the index letter from Macclesfield—looking at this and the envelope together, there is a difference in the stamp; it is the same index letter, but it is not the impression of the same stamp—it was not so late as the latter part of August that I saw the gentleman who produced the envelope—it was earlier in the year than August.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have already told me that, to the best of your belief, it was the end of August or the beginning of September. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I alluded to Mr. Roe calling—I believe the gentleman with the envelope called before Mr. Roe, but I cannot say the precise date—I intended to have said it was about the end of August, or the beginning of September that Mr. Roe called—there are clerks in the sorting office at Bath below me—they would not have anything to do with the stamps—it is the stamper's duty to alter the stamps; the clerks do not do that, if they want to use it they can, but there is a distinct man for that duty, called the stamper—there are two or there stampers—the stamps are locked up in charge of the stamper then on duty—none of the stampers are here—I was subpoenaed yesterday morning—I had been given to understand I should not be required—I had seen Mr. Hartwell Roe on the previous Saturday—I only saw him once—I told Mr. Roe what I knew about it—I told him I was quite sure this was not the envelope, at least, I had not seen the envelope before this morning—he came to inquire if the prisoner had ever made inquiries about the stamp—I told him very nearly all that I have told you, not quite—I did not tell him about this envelope of course, because I had never seen it: I could not have done so—I showed him the impressions in this book—I had had an order to do so, from the Post-master general—he did not bring the order with him; but I had a written order to give information, although they had never</p>

               <p>called before—Inspector Whicher was to have called, but I never saw him till this morning—I suppose it was the end of last year that I got the order from the Post-master general to supply certain information—I was to show the book to Mr. Hartwell Roe, or any person coming on his behalf—no one came to see the book till last Saturday, and I was not shown this envelope till this morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now seeing that gentleman there, will you swear that this was not as late as the end of August? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief it was the end of August—I did not swear just now that it was a month earlier—yes, it was before August—I cannot say when, but about a month previous to that—it was not so late as the end of August when the gentleman called and showed me the envelope—but I cannot say positively when it was.</p>

I am a stationer, and live at 22, King—street, Snow-hill—some time in the year 1860, a person called upon me in reference to the execution of some stamps—I referred him ultimately to Mr. Surrey—I identify these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as the documents I received—I think I only received two by hand—I think I received the rest by post—this, marked A1, I think I received by hand—those that I received by post, I think I gave to Mr. Surrey—the stamps so executed were to be sent to Mr. C. J Wyld, Cheltenham—they were to go by rail—I sent the things that I did send by rail so directed—I afterwards received the stamps back again, and I received the whole of those letters by post—I cannot give the date that I sent down a parcel to Cheltenham—it was towards the end of July I think, I should say it was in July—the stamps were afterwards returned by the same person who had ordered them, and I referred the person to Mr. Surrey—I cannot say that the prisoner is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the parcel office, at the Cheltenham railway station—some time last year a gentleman called at the office—the prisoner is the person—it was the early part of July, it might have been on the 3d, but the exact day I do not know—he said, "Have you any parcel from London for Mr. Wyld?"—I said "No"—the prisoner then said, "When you have, send to the Gloucester station, to be called for"—I said I would do so—Gloucester station is eight miles from Cheltenham—a parcel did arrive from London on 5th July, by the 8.10 train—it was addressed to Mr. J. C. Wyld, Cheltenham—it might have been C. J.—I know there was a J. and a C, but which stood first I cannot recollect—I forwarded that parcel as I had been directed, and re-directed it myself to Gloucester—I afterwards received a letter, I have not got it here, we kept it in the office fearing a second parcel should come, and in the course of a month or two it was destroyed—the effect of that letter was, that on the 11th, by the 8.10 train another parcel would come, and asking me to send it to the Gloucester station—that letter was in the name of Wyld—a parcel did come on the 11th by the 8.10 train from London, addressed the same as the previous one—I forwarded that in the same way to Gloucester—we booked it oh the 12th—in the early part of the following November, the prisoner called at our office at Cheltenham—he said, "Have you any parcels for the Rev.

                  </hi>. I am an engraver and lithographer, at 10, Milsom-street, Bath—I have known the prisoner for some time, and have done business for him occasionally—he was with us on many occasions in 1859—on one occasion, I cannot say whether it was in 1859 or 1860, he asked me if I had any envelopes bearing the North country stamp upon them—I said I had not any by me—he did not tell me what he wanted them for, and I did not ask—I told him that I might have the means of getting some, for I knew solicitors in the town, and perhaps they might have kept their envelopes—he said that he should like to get them if I could procure them, and I offered to do so—in April, 1860, the prisoner went over my lithographic process—he applied to me for the purpose of going over—I was busy at the time, and I told him that our assistant would show it him—that was Francis Pyle—I am very well acquainted with the prisoner's hand<lb/>writing; I have lithographed various writings of his—I have seen these letters written in the name of Wyld; I can recognise the prisoner's hand-writing in most of them, in some of them very distinctly—they are not in the handwriting that he was in the habit of writing to me—part of the process of lithographing is to imitate writing—at the time we were working for the prisoner I was not aware that he possessed the faculty of writing different hands—last session I was subpoenaed here by the prisoner, and then for the first time some communication was made to me by the solicitor for the prosecution.</p>

               <p>time at our place—the only reason why they remained was because they had been overlooked, otherwise we should have sent them off sooner—I cannot say that they were dispatched in a packet of books; the mode I adopted was to send on his letters as soon as I received them, but as time went on, from his leaving, the letters came few and far between, and then they may have laid there two or three weeks—I did not, to my knowledge, on one occasion send him a suit of regimentals in one of the packets; I do not remember it—I did not pack the parcels myself—I suppose the back numbers would not come into use till the first issue was exhausted; I do not know what he would do with them.</p>

I am in business as a jeweller, at Cambridge—I became the acting executor under this will, the other executors having renounced—I had all the books and papers belonging to the testator, Edward Roe, amongst others, his banker's book—at the time of his death he had at his bankers, 1,699<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you present at the time the will was made, in 1858? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not—I was out at Macclesfield—I was not there during the last four or five days of December, nor for six months before—Mr. John Orme Roe was there at that time—I have seen the previous will of 1857—under that the prisoner was residuary legatee with me—almost the only alteration made by this will was the substitution of John Orme Roe for the prisoner—I believe it is in court—there were several other wills, or drafts of wills—they were not sent by me to Mr. Chapman—I gave Mr. Chapman one will, and that was destroyed—he is a grocer, and has occasion for waste paper, and I gave it him amongst other waste paper—I had offered the pri<lb/>soner 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a present—he told me he had claims against the estate, and this deed was to indemnify me against those claims—Lord Denman had with-drawn his caveat nearly twelve months before, but he was made a party to this deed, because I would not consent to take the prisoner's guarantee—I insisted upon having Lord Denman's name in the indemnity—I do not know whether the prisoner's father was the eldest brother of Edward Roe—I never knew any of the family, and therefore I cannot answer the question—I never knew any of them until this transaction—I never knew James Roe, or Johu Orme Roe—I knew my uncle Edward Roe—I really do not know that the prisoner's father was Edward Roe's elder brother—I know nothing of the prisoner being there as a boy with him—I know nothing of the family affairs—I did not know my uncle till about eight years before fee died—I never heard before you mentioned it, that the prisoner was brought up with him as a boy—I think I first heard of this letter on 4th June, from my attorneys at Macclesfield—it may be that I heard that the letter was put before Mr. Coote on 4th June—it came to me of course, through my attorneys at Macclesfield—they wrote to me to say they had received a communication from Messrs. Johnson and Coote—I knew nothing at all about John Orme Roe—I knew none of them: in fact I am engaged in trade, and that has made all the difference in the family—I never knew any of my relatives—those who are in professions are separated from those who are in trade—when I heard of this cheque I went to Mr. Johnson's to examine it—I went frequently—took Mr. Netherclift and Adlard, the experts, with me—I did not meet Mr. Cooke, another expert there—I did not know that he had been—I heard that Mr. Coote had had parties there, but I cannot speak of my own knowledge—I took Mr. Netherclift, and Mr. Adlard on one occasion with me to examine the documents, and on several occcasions I took Mr. Adlard himself—Mr. Collis also went with me, or more properly speaking, I went with him—I also went with Mr. Brocklehurst—I got cheques from Mr. Brocklehurst for Mr. Johnson to examine—I think Mr. Collis had them—I do not know whether they were left with Mr. Johnson—I went to Mr. Chandler with the detective, and introduced him as Mr. Wilson, an attorney—I did not introduce him to Mrs. Sale as Mr. Wilson—he called himself Wilson—I did not tell Mr. Chandler that all I wanted was an indemnity against the claim, nor anything to that effect—I said we wanted to find the prisoner—I did not say I wanted to settle it—certainly</p>

               <p>not, because I did not intend to: I made up my mind to have him—I said nothing of the kind to Mr. Chandler—I do not remember it—if Whicher has said so his memory is better than mine—something of the sort probably may have passed, because we were determined to find him—I told Mrs. Sale that she was indebted to me—we went to her for the purpose of finding out where the prisoner was—I did not tell her I wanted her to give evidence—I do not remember it—I told her she was in my power—she does owe me a large sum for costs—our taxed costs as against her are nearly 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is very likely we said that we were going to prosecute Mr. Roe, and wanted her to give evidence, although I do not remember it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of letter-carriers at the General post-office—the prisoner was employed in July as letter-carrier at the eastern district, Commercial-road—he also assisted in sorting the letters before his delivery—in consequence of instructions I went to that office on the morning of the 24th—the prisoner was then engaged in sorting letters—Bingham came to me, and I placed myself in a situation where I could see the prisoner, but he could not see me—I saw him feel some of the letters—he found one and felt it with his finger and thumb—he then placed it at the back of other letters which he had in his left hand, and went on sorting till he came to that letter again, and then placed it at the back of some other letters—he then collected the letters which he had been sorting, and took them to hit seat to arrange them in order for delivery—when he got to his seat I saw him feel the letter again—it was then among some other letters—he laid it apart from them while he was sorting, drew it towards him, looked round him, drew his handkerchief out, wiped his mouth, and dropped his hand<lb/>kerchief on the letter, which he took up under his hand<lb/>kerchief and pat it in the inside pocket of the flap of his coat—I asked him his name, and then said, "Step into the inspector's room; I want to speak to you"—Bingham came into the room directly afterwards and said, "You have been seen to pot a letter into your pocket; is that so?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I directed Bingham to search him, who took the handkerchief from his pocket and this letter fell from it—it is addressed Mr. W. Tripple, 17, New-street, Londen, Limehouse—I could see that there was coin in it—I said to the prisoner, "How do you account for that letter being in your pocket?"—he made no answer—I said, "How came it in your pocket; who put it there"—he said, "I did"—it was not in his delivery, and he had no right to take it with his letters to his seat—it bears the post-mark of London, S.E.—Erith is I think in that district—that would come in due course to the Commercial-road office, for delivery at Limehouse.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many persons were engaged sorting letters at that time beside the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps ten or twenty; they were in the same room as he was—this letter might rightly pass through the prisoner's hands in process of sorting, but it had no right to be at his seat—the sorters each take a bundle to sort promiscuously into different alphabets, and after they are sorted, they are taken to the letter-carriers' seats by themselves—several letters, including this, were taken by the prisoner to his seat, but they were not tied up in a bundle—it has always been my notion that he separated a particular letter from the others, and threw his handkerchief over that identical letter, because I had had infor<lb/>mation that he had done it before—that has always been my account of how this occurred—it is very possible that his handkerchief may have fallen over other letters, and he then picked it up and put it in his pocket—when I asked him who put the letter in his pocket, he said, "I did"—I did not hear him say subsequently that how the letter came into his pocket he could not say, unless he had picked it up with his handkerchief—he never said that he was innocent, or that it was a mistake; nothing of the kind—he said, "I put it there," and then ended the conversation—I gave him in.</p>

CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the sorting table, are the letters thrown out indiscrimi<lb/>nately from the bags? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a number of clerks are employed there sorting letters—they sort the letters to particular walks for the different carriers—a letter-carrier sorting, would have some letters for his own walk, and some for other walks—this letter was not in the prisoner's walk, so he should either have sorted it, or given it to the proper letter-carrier—the letter was just in advance of him—when he returned his handkerchief to his pocket, I could not see whether the letter was gone or not—I could not tell one letter from another—when he removed his handkerchief, I could not positively say whether a letter had been removed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the post-office—on the morning of 27th July, I accompanied Mr. Clare to the eastern district office, Commercial-road, and placed myself where I had a full command of the prisoner, who was sorting letters at the sorting table—I saw him feeling them with his finger and thumb—he put a letter at the back of other letters, I which he had in his hand; and when he came to it again, he sorted it to some letters which he took away to his seat—he then singled the letter from the others, pulled it a short distance nearer to him, in front of the others, put his hand in his pocket, took out his handkerchief, wiped his mouth and I nose, put it down on the table, picked it up and put it into his flap coat<lb/>pocket—Mr. Clare called him into the inspector's office, and I followed—Mr. Clare told him he had been seen to put a letter into his pocket—he said that he had not—by Mr. Clare's directions, I drew the handkerchief out of his pocket and shook it; this letter fell from it, and I picked it up—I could feel that it contained a coin—Mr. Clare then asked him how that letter came to get into his pocket—her made no answer—Mr. Clare asked him again, and he said, "I put it there"—I then went away to search his premises, and left him with Mr. Clare.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were those the words he made use of, "I put it there?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is no mistake about that; I am quite sure of that—the words were not "I did;" he said, "I put it there"—I was examined at the police-court—I did not say a word there about watching the prisoner', and seeing all this done, because I was not asked—I considered that portion of my evidence of importance, but Mr. Clare had given it—I took the prisoner from the post-office to the police-station, and the charge was entered of stealing the letter—I did not hear him say, "I did not steal it, I must have picked it up with my pocket-handkerchief" nor words to that effect—nothing of the kind—he did not deny stealing the letter in my hearing at any time, nor did he offer any excuse—he was not asked.</p>

I am senior clerk in the General Post-office—the prisoner was a sorter and letter-carrier at the Peckham office, and had been engaged there about twelve months—I received instructions to make up a test letter, and on 16th July made up a letter to Mrs. Smith, Grove-villas, Camden<lb/>grove, Peckham, and placed in it two half-sovereigns—there was no Mrs. Smith at that address—I do not know whether I addressed it—I fastened it—on the morning of the 17th I gave that letter to Mr. Clare that he might post it, and in the afternoon I received information and went to the post<lb/>office at Peckham—the prisoner was brought there by Bingham at half-past 2—I told him that a money-letter, addressed Mrs. Smith, Grove-villas, Camden-grove, Peckham, was missing, and asked him if he knew anything about it—he put his hand in a pouch which he had over his shoulder, and handed me the letter—I asked him how he accounted for the possession of it; he said, "I did not know I had it till I got out with my letters; I found it in the middle"—I said, "Did not you arrange your letters "for delivery before you left the office?"—he said, "I did"—I said, "This letter is not in your delivery; how did it get amongst your letters?"—he said, "I do not know, I did not put it there"—Bingham then took him in custody—he was searched at the office, and I saw the keys taken from his pocket—this letter was not in his delivery, and he should have given it to the proper letter-carrier, who delivers letters in Camden-road, or sorted it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the post-office. On 27th July, at a little before 3 o'clock in the day, I apprehended a letter-carrier named Wright—I watched him as he was delivering letters on his walk<lb/>stopped him in the Old Kent-road as he was going home, and took him to the South Eastern office—I afterwards went to his lodgings, 6, Charlotte-place, Bermondsey—his mother keeps a shop on the ground-floor, behind which there is a parlour—I got to the shop about half-past 3, and saw the prisoner in the back room in his official coat, blue, with a red collar—he suddenly left as I went into the shop, and I followed him up-stairs to his bed room on the first-floor front, and found him in the act of pulling off his coat—he put it on the bed—there was only one bed in the room—I had made no charge against the prisoner at that time—while I was searching the room, the prisoner got towards the door, by the stairs, and I saw that he was about leaving the room in his shirt sleeves—I told him not to go away—he said that he was just going down stairs, he would return in a moment—he went down but did not return—I remained in the bed room nearly half an hour, and then went down to the lower part of the house and made inquiries for the prisoner, but could not find him—I had not then searched his coat—I gave instructions to Smee, another constable, to search it, left the house, and went to the South Eastern office—the prisoner had not been back there—I then returned to the lodging with Smee, who examined the coat, and I saw this letter found in the pocket with some others which Smee has got.</p>

I am a policeman attached to the post-office—on 27th July, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, the second floor front room, and saw this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the bed—I found in the pocket of it these four letters, and this cover of a packet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) addressed to Miss Marners—it has the western post-stamp of 31st July—on 27th July I went to Richmond, found the prisoner at the police-station there, and brought him up to Bow-street—I asked him how it was that he absconded from his duty on Saturday last—he said, "There were so many things in the room, that I thought I should be implicated with Wright"—I asked him where he went to on Saturday night without his coat—he said that he took his official cape with him, went to Deptford, and bought a coat for a pound, and then went down to Richmond—he was shown the cover at the solicitor's office on 21st July, and said that he knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of Middlesex Hospital—the deceased was admitted there as an in-door patient on 4th June—I found the index finger of the left-hand very much enlarged, and a number of cuts on it—it smelt very horribly—the bones were dead—there were several sores which were discharging very unhealthy and fetid matter, and those commu<lb/>nicated with the bones that were dead below—he had a dyspeptic appearance—his tongue was bad, and his digestion was bad—we tried to bring his system into a better state if possible before amputating his finger, therefore the operation was not performed immediately—his general health did not improve after the removal—the symptoms which existed to some extent before, increased, which made me and the other surgeon consider that abscesses were being formed in different parts of the body, which I after-wards found to be the case—he died on 19th June, and I made a post<lb/>mortem examination—I found a large collection of matter and pus in the lungs and liver, with the structure of the lungs and liver by them in a state of mortification—there was also a collection of pus in the joint of the thumb of the left-hand—it was a very unhealthy sore, buried under the thumb and over the ball of it—the injury to the hand must have been inflicted some-time before I saw him, because the bones were dead—there must have been some violence—a simple cut would not be at all likely to be followed by such a severe injury—I believe he had this collection of matter in his lungs and liver consequent upon the injury to his hand—there were abscesses in the lungs and liver, that was the immediate cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand you to say that the collection of pus in the lungs was consequent upon the wound in the Land, or that it may have been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I mean to say that, not having received the wound in the hand, he would not have had that collection of pus—I say that the collection of pus did not arise from any bodily disorder, it was not the result of mortified action, having nothing to do with the hand—collections of pus do exist in the lungs quite irrespective of any injury, but you can trace their origin—if there is ulceration of the lungs the pus is formed first—these abscesses were cists filled with pus and not discharged—it is the same in cases of consump<lb/>tion, but not in the same form—consumption does not take place in the liver—there was a large abscess in the liver—in cases of dysentery, abscesses form in the liver wholly irrespective of any external injury—any external injury would produce collections of pus in the liver, lungs, and brain—we can trace their causes—I do not seriously mean to tell you that I can always trace the origin of a secretion of pus in the human system—the bone of the finger was dead—exfoliation is when a part of a bone dies; this bone was entirely dead—I believe the injury to have been inflicted a fortnight before he came in—a disease of the bone is not necessarily consequent upon an external injury—I mean to say that the bone would be not merely in an exfoliated state, but in a perfectly dead state, in one fortnight after the injury to the flesh—in a large number of cases such a wound would be inflicted without any disease following upon it—I do not consider that the man must have been labouring under disease for some time, and have been in a very bad habit of body prior to the injury; but these collections of matter in the lungs and liver took place subsequently—I do not consider that the bone was in a diseased state previous to the infliction of the wound—I cannot answer such a ques<lb/>tion—I cannot say what condition it was in previously, but the injury would account for it—I never heard of a case where a finger became dead of itself without any injury—I see no reason for the bone having been in a diseased state for more than a fortnight previous to my seeing the man—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186108190060"/>
               <p>I saw nothing in the symptoms to enable me to say that the bone had not been diseased for more than a fortnight, but the thing is perfectly unique—I never heard of a bone dying without a cause—a bone of the leg might die but bones of the finger do not—I do not know what is called "Pott's mot<lb/>tification"—I have frequently heard of the celebrated Dr. Potts, who lived in the last century—I know he described a kind of gangrene which begins in the toes, and gradually involves the bones, but it does not begin in the bones first—gangrene is not a secretion of pus—I know a disease where the falanges or bones of the toes fall off, but both the flesh and the bones die—I mean to pledge myself that the disease commences in the flesh first and not in the bone—I never saw it originate in the bone and become commu<lb/>nicated to the flesh—as a man of science I never heard of it and do not know it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and reside at 124, Marylebone-road—on Saturday afternoon, 6th July, about half-past 2 o'clock, I got into one of the General Omnibus Company's omnibuses at the Circus—there were other persons then in the omnibus, but I do not recollect the number—I was sitting second from the door—there was one person next the door, but I was more than half-way up, next to the brass rod—there was a distance between me and the person sitting next the door—when we arrived at Tottenham Court-road, the two prisoners got in—Jones got in first and sat between me and the woman, next to the door—there were three in the compartment and she was the centre one, and was on my right hand—when I got in I had in my right hand pocket my purse, handkerchief, and a small button-hook—inside the purse was a smaller red purse—inside that, were two sovereigns, and in the larger one ten shillings' worth of silver—I had last seen it about 12 o'clock—I had been nowhere to spend any money—Smart sat next the door on the opposite side—she had the child with her that she has to-day, and her purse and parasol in her hand—she did not sit exactly opposite me—I was near the centre, and she was on the opposite side next the door—she was nearer to Jones than to me—as we went to Holborn-hill, I saw her put the parasol on Jones' knee—it remained there some time—as we were going down Holborn-hill I felt Jones draw her hand out of my pocket—I put my hand in to see what I had lost and found my purse was gone—I then said to the conductor in her presence, "Stop, conductor, this woman has put her hand in my pocket and taken my purse"—she made some sort of denial; I cannot recollect the exact words—the omnibus stopped before we got to the bottom of the hill—I do not recollect whether the windows were open or shut—I did not see any one get out—the conductor then called a policeman, and he asked me if I gave the woman in charge—I did so, for robbing me of my purse—I then saw Smart two or three yards from the omnibus, going away—I said to the policeman, "That woman is her friend, I think you ought to take her too"—then the conductor turned and said she had not paid her fare—I did not see what policeman came up to take her, but she was taken—she was not more than three yards from the omnibus when she was taken—there were persons round her, both men and women—there was very quickly a crowd—Jones was taken in custody in the omnibus—she did not get out till I did.</p>

I am one of the General Omnibus Company's con<lb/>ductors—I was conducting this omnibus on July 6th, when the prosecutrix got in—the two prisoners got in at the corner of Tottenham Court-road—I think there were eight or nine other people then in the omnibus—when we got to Holborn-hill, I got down and put the skid on as usual to go down the hill, when I got up again the prosecutrix said, "I have had my pocket picked during the time I have been in your omnibus, I felt this lady's hand leave my pocket," pointing to Jones, who was sitting next to her on her right hand side—I called a police-officer and gave her into custody—I hung my skid up and took money from a gentleman that got down outside—during that time the door was opened and Smart got out—she had not paid me—there were people round her when the policeman was there—she was then about three or four yards off the omnibus—I did not hear Smart say any<lb/>thing about Jones—she said at the station-house, that she did not know her, and when given in custody she said she knew nothing of Jones.</p>

I reside at 2, George-street, Bloomsbury, and am a lodging-house keeper—the prisoner William, slept there for about seven or eight nights—the prisoner John has been there about five weeks, but he has been in that street about eight or nine weeks—the last night that William Thompson slept there, was the Monday night before he was taken in custody—the prisoner John has lodged in my house five or six weeks, on and off—the two slept in one room, went out together, and came home together—I received this duplicate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the prisoner John, on Tuesday morning, 9th July, and lent him sixpence on it, and he asked me if I would buy another which he had of a coat in pawn, for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the ticket of a gold watch and chain, in pawn, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not produce those duplicates to me; I have not seen them.</p>

I reside at 36, Roxburgh-terrace, Haverstock-hill, and am an engraver in the employ of Mr. Berry—on the afternoon of 25th July, I placed a bag of gold, about nine pounds' worth, in the desk in the back parlour of his house—I saw the desk on the morning afterwards; it was open—it was pointed out to me—I had locked it and taken the key—I went into the parlour and examined the desk—I found it had been broken open—I immediately missed the bag and the gold I had put there—there was a considerable amount of property in the desk untouched, medals and coins of different sorts, and money also, which was untouched.</p>

I am an engraver, and live at 96, Great Russell-street—the prisoner is my apprentice—on 27th July I was in Scotland, and received a letter—I came to town immediately, on 28th—I saw the desk had been broken open—the money in it was mine—the bag of gold spoken of was mine—I had left it to pay the wages while I was absent—from in<lb/>quiries I made, I spoke to the prisoner on Sunday, the 28th, the day on which I arrived—I went to the prisoner's lodging—he knew what I had come about—he had been communicated with before—I said, Do you sus<lb/>pect any one?" and he said, "No"—I then went away—on 14th August I again went there in consequence of something I had heard—I said, "Adolphe, you have been spending more money than you can have come honestly by"—he said he had received some money from his relations in Paris, from his mother—I found that he had been spending sovereigns—I did not say anything about sovereigns at that time—I asked him to show me the letter in which the money had come—he could not do so—he referred me to his brother; his brother could not find any letter—I did not get any such letter—I spoke to him again that same evening—I told him it was</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, E</hi> 68). On the morning of 26th July I was called to Mr. Berry's house—I found footmarks on the area railings where some one had got over; it had been raining in the night—I passed through the area door and came to the first door leading from the kitchen into the passage—it fastens on the inside with a bolt top and bottom—the second door is fastened inside with an iron bar that goes across it; that is between the kitchen and the passage—I found that, by putting a knife or something through the crevices of the door I could unfasten it and let down the iron bar—I examined the desk and found it had been broken open—I compared this instrument (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belonging to Mr. Berry, which I found on the floor, with the marks on the drawers, and they corresponded—the prisoner was given into my charge on the Wednesday evening—I told him he was charged with breaking into his master's house, and robbing him of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—he said he had done so, and was very sorry for it; that he had taken four out of the bag, and had thrown the rest of the money and the bag away.</p>

He said, "Adolphe, where are you going?" I said, "Home." He said he was wait<lb/>ing for me. He asked me to go a little way with him and I did so, to a public-house; when I left him he asked me whether I wanted any money. I said, "Yes," and he lent me some; that is how I came by the money which I had. Afterwards he said he would come next morning. He had come once or twice before to see me at my master's house, and he has sometimes asked me whether my master was out of town, and I said, "No." He asked at this time, and I said, "Yes," and from that time I have never seen him since. My master has been very kind to me, and it is not likely I should do such a thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, M'Cloud-cottages, Upper Clapton, and am a warehouseman—on Sunday, 4th August, I was going from the direction of Highbury barn, from my uncle's, to my home at Upper Clapton—about twenty-five minutes to 10 o'clock I was in Gipsey-lane, and found that I was being followed, I supposed at first by a man and woman—when I got just up to an embankment I turned suddenly round, finding the people behind me very close—one was just in front on the left-hand side, and the other stood where he was, behind me on the right—the prisoners are those two persons—I am certain of it—I asked Cotton which was the way to Stoke Newington—he hesitated for a moment, and then said, "I don't know;" and turning to the other prisoner he asked him if he knew—he hesitated for a moment, and then said, "No"—Cotton then said, "Oh! well you" had better go this way, "pointing in a direction rather to the right of that which I was going; a direction where I knew there was a hedge—I said to him, "I can't go that way, there is a hedge there"—just as I was saying that, I caught a momentary glance of Cotton stooping down on his right knee, and throwing the instrument round, which caught me just in the eye—it was something such an instrument as this (<hi rend="italic">a life preserver</hi>)—it was a starlight. night—I only had time to have a moment's view of it—I had an umbrella in my right hand; I immediately flourished that, and called out, "Help!"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186108190072"/>
               <p>and then "Murder!"—the blood gushed out all over me, and smothered the front of my clothes—almost as soon as I threw my umbrella up in the air they both ran from me, just at the moment I was calling out—one went in one direction, and one in another—I followed about eight or ten yards, but I was almost blinded with the blood, and so I stood still—I was taken to the Highbury Park tavern—some one came up and assisted me there the prisoners were afterwards brought in, one at a time, and I recognised them as they were brought in—I am quite certain they are the two men—after I had had the wound dressed, about twenty minutes to 11 I should suppose, I went to the place where they ran past, and pointed it out to the police<lb/>officer.</p>

I am a whip-maker in Barbican—I have a partner—Stan-field was an apprentice to me, and Harris was a servant—about a quarter to 8 o'clock, on the morning of 30th July, I secreted myself in a room on my premises and saw Stanfield force a door which leads to another room, which is used as a warehouse for unfinished stock—he forced it with a long bar I then saw him open several nests and take out some mounts similar to those produced, put some in his pocket, and some he secreted under the flooring of the outershop—about 12 o'clock on the same day I saw him there with Harris—they both went in about seven or eight times, and each time opened several drawers, took mounts out, and put them in their pockets—I had previously to that made a communication to the police—I know Taylor; he was in my service four or five months, about five or six months back, till about February or March last—we had missed whip-mounts from our stock before this 30th July, for a considerable time—Stanfield was in my service at the same time that Taylor was; Harris was not—we were missing the stock every day, and I at last watched—we had missed some of those horns—I know that these mounts are mine; they have come out of our stock—they cost us about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a set—I recognise these handles—we purchased fifty-four of these hooks, and they degenerated to thirteen—we call them buck hook whistles—they are used for sticks and hunting tops—we had not sold any either to Taylor, Stanfield, Harris, or anybody else.</p>

I was apprentice to Mr. John Smith, the prose<lb/>cutor—on 30th July, about a quarter to 8, I broke open a door leading to the warehouse, and took out some whip mounts, and again at half-past 11. When the officer took me, he took away from me forty or forty-two whip mounts, which I had stolen. I had taken some about three times before that I took some to the prisoner Taylor, and some to Harris. I think Taylor gave me sixpence a set for some of these mounts. I took about fifteen or sixteen buck-horn hooks. I did not know that there were fifty-four of those—I took them to Taylor, and he gave me fivepence and sixpence apiece for them.</p>

I live at 61, Albert-street, White Conduit-street, Islington—I am out of business, living on my means—on a Monday, some where about the 30th July, about half-past 10, I was walking along White-chapel-road, close against Mile-end gate—some man came up and begged of me, and I gave him a penny and half a pint of beer at a public-house—while I was in the house, standing at the bar, the three prisoners and three or four others came in—they stayed there about an hour perhaps, and I was there too—I had two glasses of porter, and I likewise stood a pot of beer for these men—I changed a sovereign while they were there—I went out of the public-house first and went towards the City—all the men followed me—Rogers came in front of me—I had very strong suspicions that they wanted to rob me, and took my purse out of my trousers' pocket and put it in my coat-tail pocket—I saw a policeman and spoke to him, and the prisoners walked forward about ten yards—after that I' left the policeman and went on towards the Minories—as I was going along I saw the prisoners; there were seven men altogether, some were before me, and some behind—I can't say who were before me—I cannot say whether the prisoners were before or behind me—when I got close against Moses and Son's, Rogers asked me to give him some more to drink—I told him I wanted to go home—he said he knew where there was a house open in the Minories, and we would go and have a glass there, and then go home—I went and stood a pot of beer there, paid for it, and thinking that they meant robbing me I went out of the house—as I went out, there were others preventing my getting away—I paid for two pots of beer there—I put my hands in my pocket with the intention that they should see me, but in reality I put them behind, and I then put my hands in front, to make them believe I had got my purse in my front pocket, but in reality I put it behind—the prisoners were at the bar at that time—after the beer was drunk, we all went out together—it was between 3 and 4 at that time—I remember being close to Aldgate-market—I heard a whistle which attracted my attention, and at that moment I</p>

               <p>received a terrific blow on the forehead from the prisoner Rogers—I do not know what with; I thought it was with his fist—it knocked me down—it did not deprive me of my senses—I jumped up as quick as possible and called out "Police"—I saw the other prisoners there—Rogers came up to me first, and said, "Have you been robbed of your purse?"—I said "You know I have"—I then put my hand behind me to see whether it was gone, and Rogers tried to wrest it from me, and scratched my hands—the other prisoners did not do anything to me at that time—Percival robbed me of my pocket-book and keys when I was first knocked down—all of them were there when I was knocked down, but I cannot say which one robbed me—I lost my pocket-book, containing two bills of exchange, several letters, five keys, a pocket-handkerchief, a knife, and almost everything I had in my pockets—they were in my trousers' pocket—I was robbed by Percival—I saw him, and felt him put his hands in my pocket—a constable came up after Rogers had spoken to me, and the prisoners divided—Percival and Gleeson went one way, and Rogers went another way—I gave them into custody—I was sober—a policeman came up when I shouted.</p>

BEST</hi> (<hi rend="italic">for Rogers</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you are a gentleman retired from business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was a wholesale potato salesman before I retired—I had a greengrocer's shop—I have been here in the dock, it was through my wife; she brought a charge of rape against me, on purpose to get what profit I had got—I had got about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my box—I was tried by a jury and acquitted—my wife was not the prosecutrix, she had one to do it for her—I left home on this day about 8 in the morning—I had been to Covent-garden, and Spitalfields, and stayed there to have my tea—I had not a glass to drink during the day—I am quite sure of that—I had dinner that day in Fleet-street—I never take beer with my dinner—I did not take anything after dinner—I had something to drink before the beggar invited me into the house—I began about 10 o'clock in Cleveland-street, White-chapel—I had a pint of ale there—I went to a friend's house after that and we had a pint there, not more—we had some business there which took me longer than I expected, and as I was coming from Cleveland-street to the City, I thought, as I had a good long way to walk, that I would have a short pipe home, and a glass of ale—I then went to the public-house where these men came in, where the man invited me in—I frequently treat people to porter—I generally have a glass myself—I had two half-pints there—it is my opinion that when I got to Moses and Son's, it was 12 o'clock—I went to the other public-house, in the Minories, about half-past 12—I did not have a glass there—I stood a pot and paid for it, and coming out, there were a lot of people ready to stop me—I was not knocked down then, it was further on—when I got up to Moses and Son's I heard a whistle, and the moment I heard it I received a blow, and down I went—I had never seen these men before that night—I suppose I could not see any better after I had the Wow than I could before—I was not drunk.</p>

               <p>Charles Oliver (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 31). About a quarter to 4 on the morning of 30th July, I was on duty in Aldgate High street, and heard a cry of "Police!" about twenty or thirty yards off—I went in the direction of the cry and saw the three prisoners—I noticed Rogers first, going down towards the Minories—the other two crossed the road and went down Aldgate—I spoke to the prosecutor and got some information—police constable 668, came up at that time—I sent him after Gleeson and Percival, and I went after Rogers—I called him back, and 668 brought back Gleeson and Percival—I searched Rogers and Gleeson, but found nothing; but on Percival I found two letters, five keys, a penknife, and pocket handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him if the keys and letters belonged to him—he said, "Now, policeman, you have brought me to my senses, I have been drunk all night, they do not belong to me"—the prosecutor was sober when I came up he seemed very much agitated, and the blood was running from his forehead—I afterwards found this pocket-book in the churchyard near, containing two bills of exchange, one for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other for 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some papers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw the prosecutor I believe directly after this affair took place, did he tell you that it was Gleeson who knocked him down! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he said Rogers, I am quite sure of that—when I came up to him I asked him what was the matter—he was very much agitated—I asked him about the men, and he said they had robbed him of a pocket-book containing 134<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me Rogers knocked him down and Gleeson and Percival rifled his pockets—I am quite sure of that—I have never said before that he said Gleeson—if Gleeson is put in the depositions it is not my mistake—I have always said Rogers.</p>

On 30th of July, about a quarter to 4, I was near the church in Aldgate, and saw the prisoners come from the direction of Houndsditch—the prosecutor was ten or twelve yards behind them, calling "Police!" before the prisoners got to me and the sergeant, they crossed the road from the church—Rogers turned down the Minories, and the other two walked on towards Whitechapel—I went after them, stopped them, and said they must come back with me—Percival said he should not come back—he had not got anything belonging to the man—they came back, and I saw their pockets felt by Oliver—these keys were taken from Percival—the prosecutor was sober, but agitated; when I got to the station-house I made a further search of Percival, and found a silk handkerchief, a penknife, two letters, a halfpenny, a ring, this piece of rag and the five keys which had been given to him back by the sergeant, who found them on feeling down his pockets—he was asked whose they were—he said they were not his, and they were given back and taken to the station.</p>

               <p>on 28th June last I had an order to take two horses to Twickenham—I took them there—when I got there two gentleman came to ride them—I should know them again—the prisoner is one of them—they left the yard at Twickenham about 2 o'clock, as near as I can remember—the other gentleman was younger than the prisoner—the prisoner had a whip, the other gentleman had not—the prisoner asked me particularly which was the quietest horse, as the other gentleman could not ride; so I told him which was the quietest, and the other gentleman rode it, and the prisoner gave him the whip—it was a very small whip, something like a lady's whip—the younger gentleman had the whip when they started—there were not two whips—the prisoner asked me to borrow one if I could—I could not; I went into the hotel and asked the ostler, but he could not get one—I told the prisoner that the horse he rode would require a whip—they then rode away—(<hi rend="italic">a whip was here produced</hi>)—the whip was a similar one to this—I could not swear that this was the one—it was what we call a very small whip—the gentlemen went away, and I waited to receive the horses—the horses came back about 8 o'clock, or between 7 and 8—the gentlemen were not with them; some strange man brought them—in consequence of what he said to me, I went to the Swan Inn, at Twickenham, and there saw the gentlemen—I merely asked them for some money to pay for the baiting of the horses—I did not say anything about the horses coming back without them—I said nothing to the prisoner about any accident, nor did he to me—I do not recollect anything of the kind—I came back to town with the horses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer employed on the South-western Railway at the Twickenham Station—on the evening of 28th June I went to the Duke D'Aumale's to see some friends of mine there—there is a lane which leads from the church at Twickenham past the Swan Tavern towards the Duke D'Aumale's—that lane runs parallel to the high road from Twickenham to Richmond along the water-side—afterwards, when you get in the direct way from Twickenham it turns up and joins the main-road again—I was in this lane that evening about 7 o'clock—I cannot say whether it was after or before—there is a gate there—I saw a woman of the name of Fitzgibbon in the road—she came up to me whilst I was standing at the gate—I saw young Mr. de Vidil come up to where I and Fitzgibbon were standing—he had his hat off, and his face was covered with blood—he ran up and crouched down between me and the old woman—while he was there two saddle-horses came up, one after the other, both without riders, and directly afterwards the prisoner came round the corner, close after the horses; he was running—he came up to the gate where I was standing—he was in this manner (<hi rend="italic">trembling</hi>), and saying, "What is the matter? what is the matter?" twice over—he made an attempt to jump over the rails—he missed the first time; in the second attempt he succeeded in getting over—he got over the rail next to the post that the gate was hinged on to—he got over the fence—there are tenter hooks at the top of the fence, and he got his hands fast in the tenter hooks—that was in the second attempt that he made to get over—there is a shrubbery on the other side of the fence; that leads down to the river—there is a foot road down to the river from the footway where I stood—I should say it is from twenty to thirty yards from the footway where I stood to the river; I do not know exactly, because I have only been once or twice in the place since this occurrence, I never was in the place before: it is something of that distance—as he was getting over I called to him, "What do you want there? there is nothing there for you"—at the time he came up he had a whip handle in his hand it was a whip handle with a loop at one end, and silver mounted, or some white metal, at the other end—I did not take particular notice what it was—it was somewhere about two feet, or two feet six long—the handle was of a yellowish colour—this is not it (<hi rend="italic">looking at the whip already produced</hi>), this is not the sort of thing the prisoner had in his hand—the silver mount was longer—I expect the yellowish colour was the colour of the material—I did not notice what kind of material it was—my attention was taken up with the young man more than anything else—I cannot say whether the prisoner carried the whip handle over the fence with him or not—when he got over the fence he got into the path, and then there is another iron fencing, and he jumped over that and got into the shrubbery, and there I lost sight of him—I went with the young man towards the Swan Inn at Twickenham—the prisoner came up to me again before I bad got three or four yards away from the gate where I was first standing—I should not think he was absent in the shrubbery above two minutes; I do not recollect exactly, but I should say it could not be more than that—the gate is between one hundred and two</p>

               <p>hundred yards from the Swan—he walked with me along the lane to the Swan—as we were going along I asked him how the injury had happened—he said the horse had shied and thrown him against the wall—I did not fetch the doctor—I cannot say who did—I did not see any whip afterwards picked up on the road—I do not remember whether the prisoner had anything in his hand when he rejoined me—I do not remember seeing any<lb/>thing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long altogether do you say he was away after he had got over the palings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From one to two minutes, I should think—he appeared to be very much excited—he went in the direction of the river—he could have reached the river in the time he was away, if he was running; not in walking—he could have done so without my seeing him—the shrubbery takes a winding turn to the river—he had to get over two palings from the lane—I saw him get over both, into the shrubbery, and then I lost sight of him—there is a path-road there leading down to the river—the distance between the two palings is about a couple of yards—they stand at about right angles to each other—part of the shrubbery reaches down to the river on one side, or nearly so—there is a footpath all the way down to the river—I do not know whether it also runs by the side of the river—the high road, where this happened, is very much frequented, not the foot-path—there is a footpath at the end of the lane leading down to the Twickenham Meadows—that is some distance off—at times a good many persons walk in that direction.</p>

I am the more anxious, that he met yesterday with an accident in riding; the horse having hit him on the forehead in rearing. I sat with him till 12 last night, and I told him I would call early next morning. I beg you may be so kind as to inform me whether you have heard from Alfred, and with my very best regards to Mrs. Parker and children, believe me, yours very sincerely, Baron de Vidil.")—Young Mr. de Vidil came to my house in Hertfordshire on Saturday morning, the 29th—I am not sure whether he was with me when I received this letter; I think not: certainly not—he did not remain at my house—I think he stayed about three hours.</p>

I met two gentlemen on horseback, I think the prisoner was one of them; they were riding towards me, and riding side by side, and the youngest was nearest to the pales; I saw the older gentleman strike the younger one a backhanded blow on the forehead; it appeared to me to be like a whip<lb/>handle that he struck him with; I could see that it had a knob on the end of it, a shiny knob; when the blow was struck, the young one's hat fell off, and he cried out, "Oh! oh! don't, pray;" I saw the older gentlemen then strike the horse across the head; the younger one rode off as fast as he could, the older one rode after him as fast as he could, and when he got <hi rend="italic">fore right</hi> of me he said, "Hoy, hoy! here's your hat;" he tried to get his horse back after the hat, but he would not go; the young one jumped off his horse and ran, and the older our got off his horse and ran after him; the older gentleman was running after the younger one and both horses were loose; I went and picked up the hat, and brought it back to the gentleman it belonged to; I delivered it to the landlord, and he gave me a shilling. I saw a man named William Liscombe the same evening, directly after it had happened, and I told him something; I also told my wife something when I got home that night.

Since February last my beat has been the lower part of Fleet-street and Bride-lane—during the month of May I saw all the defendants there—they were there with books in their hands, receiving bets, and passing books to the bystanders, containing a list of horses—there were a great many people round them the chiefs part of the time they were there; I mean round each of them: sometimes perhaps half-a-dozen, and sometimes a score—I have seen them there almost every day since February, not every day, from about 11 o'clock or a little after, up to 1, 2, and 3—it is very bad indeed for passengers to get through the lane—it is so crowded, that people cannot get through without they squeeze themselves through; the passage is blocked up—I have noticed vehicles passing—they cannot get through without stopping and shouting for them to get out of the way for a yard or two—the people have been standing in the roadway, collected round the defendants—when vehicles have been passing they have been obliged to squeeze up against the houses to let them through, and to walk behind the vehicles to let them pass forward—the lane is not wide enough at this end for more than one carriage to pass—the foot<lb/>way is not much over a yard or a yard and a half wide—I have had com<lb/>plaints from the inhabitants and people passing up and down—they are obliged to go round instead of going up the lane; they have complained of the nuisance of so many people crowding in the lane—the lane has an opening into New Bridge-street—I do not know that it would save anything to persons going from the north part of Fleet-street to the bridge to go along Bride-lane—if they come into the passage leading to St. Bride's Church, and down by the churchyard, they would save a little—I was on duty there at the latter part of 1851, all 1852, and the early part of 1853—there was more traffic passing through the lane then in the middle of the day than there</p>

               <p>is now, because they cannot get through now—the obstruction has been about the same ever since the spring; I have not noticed much difference—have seen the defendants with books in their hands, small books that they hand to one another with cards relating to the horses—I have seen them make entries in their books and I have seen all of them receive money.</p>

Bryant and Hodges service—he has called there two or three times on week-days, and once or twice on Sundays—he called twice on a single Sunday—I lived on the premises—he did not come in when he called on week-days, I saw him out<lb/>side the door, but he did on Sundays—Messrs.

SMITH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you brought solder to this man, and he saw the letter M on it, did not he tell you to bring no more? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I do not recollect his saying so—I know the witness Blyth—he was a servant of Locke's—I have never, that I am aware of, had any conversation with Blyth with regard to bringing things to the prisoner's—once I had an agreement with Blyth—that was not before the prisoner spoke to me at all—I had been with the prisoner some time—Blyth has asked me if ever I brought any goods to Locke, and I have denied it—it was not Blyth who first induced me to take things from the prosecutors—he did so once—that was about last February—it was at all times of the day, between 10 o'clock in the morning and half-past 6 in the evening that I took these things—I do not know whether he carries on any other occupation than this at his shop—I do not think he does—I do not know that he attends the theatres in the morning—I know he acts at them in the evening sometimes—I swear that it was to the prisoner, and not to Blyth, that I took these things, and with the prisoner that I had the conversation—Locke told me that Blyth was discharged from his place—I sold Blyth some patty pans—the things that I brought were quite new, not damaged—I do not swear that I sold those stamped ones, but I did those fluted ones—these (<hi rend="italic">pointing them out</hi>) are the things that I sold—there is no mark on them—I can swear to the sandwich boxes, here is a mark upon them—they were new when I took them, but they have been in his shop some time, and have got damaged—they are damaged now—here are some patty pans that I can swear to as having sold myself—they are damaged and dirty now, but they were not like that when I took them—I swear that they are the things that I took—I can swear that, because no one else makes these things; I have heard Mr. Barber say so—there is no particular mark on them—these vegetable cutters are in a dirty and unshakeable condition, and I believe they were when I took them—the things were not for the most part odd lots—I took various sizes, and the sizes have got mixed—I used to take them in dozens—I told Blyth that I was working at Wilson's—that was not true—I never told the prisoner that I was working at Wilson's—I swear that he never told me not to come near" the place again, when he saw the M on the solder.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 8, Duke-street, Smithfield, and am a tin-plate worker, and worked for Locke at his shop, 71, Little Britain, for five months—I know the last witness—I have often seen him at the shop—he used to come there two or three times a day sometimes, in some weeks—I first saw him there when I first went to work there, and I saw him continually during—</p>

               <p>all the time I was there, sometimes two or three times a day; sometimes there might be two or three days without his coming—I have seen him bring these patty pans with him, none of the other things, only the patty pans he used not to take them out where I was—he used to go into the front shop—I have seen him take patty pans out of his pocket, and after he has gone, I have seen large quantities there that were not there before he came—they used to go in together, leaving me in the back shop—I have also seen sandwich boxes brought by him—I have seen him take them out of his pocket, and give them to Locke—I have never seen Locke give him any money—I have heard Locke talk about money—I have seen Richards call and ask him for the money, and he would say, "Call at such a time, and I will pay you"—Richards would call, and they would go into the front shop together, and he would go away satisfied, without making any remark—I do not remember hearing anything said about prices at any time—I have seen part of a piece of solder that Richards brought, that is all—that was about five weeks, I think, before Locke was taken—I saw part of the letter M stamped deeply in it—part of it had been used—it was part of a square piece—I have never received any myself from Richards—I never had any transaction with him.</p>

Q.</hi> You persist in saying that you never received any patty pans from Richards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I never ordered any—if he says I did, he is telling that which is untrue—I never induced him to take anything at all—I was in Court just now when he was giving his evidence—I heard him say that I had induced him, and that he had sold me patty pans—that is untrue—I have been convicted at the Thames police—court for having a piece of lead in my possession—that is the only time—the lead belonged to a person of the name of Driver, in the Minories, where I worked for two years—when I was at Locke's I used to go to Mr. Driver's to work for him sometimes, to oblige him, and then I was found with the lead—he discharged me—I then went to Mr. Locke, who took me directly I came out of prison—he did not keep my wife and family while I was in prison—he did not discharge me at all—he was slack, and had nothing to do, and he said that I might get what work I could myself, and come and use his tools—I left him at the end of the week before he was taken into custody—I have heard the money jink, but I never saw it pass between them—I never saw Richards bring any of this sort (<hi rend="italic">pointing them out</hi>), only the round ones—I do not know whether there is any private mark on them at all—Richards took them from his pocket—I have heard him swear that he carried them in the front of his apron—I did not always see him when he came—what I saw he took from his pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). On 15th July last, I made a communi<lb/>cation to Messrs. Barber and Groom in consequence of information I had received—I apprehended Riohards on the 19th—I subsequently went to 113, Goswell-street, the house of Mr. Bates, a general dealer—I received this property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from him; two sets of vegetable cutters, 57 patty-pans, and 1 sandwich box—after that I went to the house of the prisoner Locke, 8, Duke-street, Smithfield—I walked up into the front-room, first—floor, and there I saw him—I told him I was an officer—presently afterwards Richards came in with Mr. Barber and a brother constable—I asked Richards, in Locke's presence, whether this was Locke—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Is this the man who has been receiving the things from you, that you have stolen from your employers?"—he said, "Yes—I then said to Locke, "Be careful what you say, for whatever you do say, I shall give in evidence against you"—I cautioned him two or three times—I produced the things I had received from Bates—I asked him whether he knew Mr. Bates of Goswell-street—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Did you sell him these things?"—I asked him whether he knew where Richards worked—he hesitated, and seemed very much confused—I said, "Do you know that he works at Barber and Groom's?"—he said, "Yes; but I do not know that he works there now"—he said he had told Richards that if he came there again, he should send for the police—I then searched the room, and in a tin box I found this sandwich box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the second of the two—I asked him where he got that from—he said, "From Riohards"—I then took him in custody—on the way to the station, I told him that Richards stated that he had bought solder from him—he said, "Yes, I have bought some from him"—I said, "What did you give him a pound for it?"—he said five pence or sixpence; I do not remember which—I told him it was worth more than that; and at the station he voluntarily stated that he gave Richards three-pence each for the sandwich boxes.</p>

I heard you were in trouble, and felt anxious about you"—a minute or two afterwards he said, "I have a place to be done, 62, Eaton-square; I have the key of it, and it is a seven cut Bramah"—he said that the servants would go to supper at about 9 o'clock, and the place must be done shortly afterwards—he was saying that they were to meet again at another place, the name of which I could not catch, with another man named Johnson—instead of finishing the appointment, he asked Leonard to go with him as for as Holborn-hill—they both went out together—I understood him that he got the key from one of the servants, but I cannot say for certain—I asked Simpson not to take him far, and asked Leonard to be quick back, on account of his dinner—my brother came back to his dinner, and left about half-past 3 or 4 o'clock—he did not return home at all after that—Simpson returned about half-past 11 that night—I was in bed—he knocked several times, and I got up and let him in—he said, "They have got Jack, and you had better go down to Rochester-row at 10 o'clock next morning"—I asked him was it much, and he said they found him in the house—I did not ask what house—he said nothing else—next day I went down to Rochester-row station, and found Leonard there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an umbrella maker and mender, and live in Mill-lane, Deptford—on Thursday, 30th May, about 6 o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming home from Lewisham where I had been doing some work, and as I was near the Ravensbourne river, going along a footpath leading to Deptford, I met the prisoner—the first words he accosted me with were, "You are the very fellow I want to see; you are a pretty fellow to go to a lady's house and do the work that I ought to do and have the money for it"—I asked him what house it was where the lady lived—he said "You d—d old b—you know well where she lives"—I said nothing to that—he then said that he would stab my—eyes out, and then I commenced to go on home, and he commenced stabbing me at the back of the head—I received the first stab there and the next at the side of the head—I held my hand up to defend myself—I turned to see what he had to stab me with, and it was the iron tube of an umbrella handle; and in turning my head he stabbed me right in the left eye with it—he then commenced stabbing me with it under the right eye and then under the ear, three or four times—I tried to extricate myself from him, I do not know how, and before I had gone many steps I fell to the ground senseless, and do not remember anything more until I found myself in the hospital some weeks afterwards—I was nearly ten weeks in the hospital—I have totally lost the sight of one eye and the other is very much damaged—unless I recover my</p>

               <p>sight I am a ruined man, for I cannot follow my employment—I have known the prisoner by sight for many years in passing by, but never had any conversation with him, and was never in his company—he is an umbrella maker and mender—there had been nothing the matter with my eyes previous to this occurrence—I did not use any violence to the prisoner before he struck me, only in my own defence in pushing my hand out to defend myself; if I did touch him it was not intentionally.</p>

I am in the Royal Artillery at Woolwich on the night of 8th July I went on duty in the guard-room about half-past 10 o'clock—I heard a noise, and saw the prisoner leaning over Sergeant Murphy and using threatening language—I cannot say exactly what he said, for I did not take particular notice—I asked Sergeant Murphy what was the matter—he said that the prisoner refused to give his name—I went to the prisoner and asked him what he meant by such conduct—he said he knew me perfectly well, and would do anything I ordered him to do; then turning rouud, facing Sergeant Murphy, he said, "I have had three months for throwing a quart pot at his head, and I will pay him off yet before I go to India"—he was under the influence of drink, but was steady, and quite aware of what he was doing—he was drunk in a military sense—I ordered him to lie down on the guard-bed and keep his proper place; he did so, and I left the guard-room—I returned in about half an hour and saw Sergeant Murphy carried out on a stretcher, apparently dead—the prisoner was brought out, handcuffed immediately after, and requested to see me—I saw him, and he said, "I wish to give myself up as a deserter from the 11th Foot—I told him he would have to answer the charge of assaulting Sergeant Murphy before that could be considered—he then said, "I wish I had killed him right out"—I ordered him to the guard-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-surgeon of the Royal Artillery—on 8th July, between 11 and 12 o'clock in the evening, I saw the deceased in the hospital insensible—he bad a wound more than an inch long, behind his ear—I had it dressed, and had him put to bed—he remained insensible about two hours; after that he became sensible, and I saw him at 8 o'clock next morning—he went on pretty well till the afternoon of 10th July, when he became considerably worse—he continued to get worse, and died on 12th July—I made a post mortem examination, and found all the vessels of the brain very much gorged with blood—I found blood effused on the right side of the brain and also at the base, and a fracture of the right temple bone—the wound might have been caused by this bar—the cause of death was con<lb/>gegtion of the brain, proceeding from the blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, of 23, Thomas-street. Woolwich—I remember the prisoner coming into my shop on 29th July, and inquiring for a ring he had left to be repaired—he said a person of the name of Mary Ann Peel was to call for it, and I was to give it to her—he asked me about a watch, as he wished to buy one and pay for it by instalments—I took one out of the window and that did not suit him—I then took another out of the drawer, and said, I would be ready for him as Boon as he was ready for me—he then said, "There is one in the window—I am expecting a remittance from my friends to-morrow"—I took the watch out of the window and was in the act of opening it when he gave a whistle, snatched the watch out of my hand, and rushed out of the shop—I am sure he was the man, because of leaving the ring to be repaired—I did not see the watch again—I next saw the prisoner on Wednesday, when he was in custody—I mentioned this to the police, and described the person.</p>

I have been nearly six years in the force—some time in June last, I received some information with refer-ence to Sunter, in consequence of which I watched him—I was in plain clothes—on Wednesday, 19th June, I saw him go into the Bridge-house public-house, in the Borough-road, about twenty-seven minutes past 4—Cutmore was barman there—he was behind the bar when Suuter went in—I had gone in previously, and was talking to Cutmore as a customer—I was drinking half a pint of beer—while I was drinking it Sunter came in—he called for a half a pint of beer—Cutmore served him; he put down a six-pence on the counter—Cutmore took up the sixpence, took some coppers out of one till, went to another till and took out two shillings; he came direct to where Sunter stood, and put down the two shillings and some coppers on the counter in front of him—it was put behind the beer engine, nearly out my sight—upon seeing the money put down there, I directly moved up closer to Sunter, and I saw the two shillings and some coppers—Sunter took them up and left the house—no conversation took place between the prisoners—no more than asking for the half-pint of beer—Cutmore pot the sixpence in the till—when Sunter took up the money, I was so close to him that my sleeve touched his arm—I am quite certain there were two shillings, and that only sixpence was given—I followed Sunter to a public-house in Newport-market, and to several other public-houses—on that occasion Sunter was walking in his waistcoat, and with his shirt sleeves tucked up, and I was the same myself; he had no coat—after going to several public-houses he came back to the Bridge house—I did not take him into custody that day—on the following Saturday, about 4 o'clock, I went again into the Bridgehouse-tavern—he went to another public-house that same evening, and shortly afterwards, about 9 o'clock, he was taken into custody—I was not present when he was taken; I beard of his being taken—on Saturday evening I went to No. 1, Duke-street, Westminster-road; that is a shop which Sunter holds; he could not live there, it consists of only two very small rooms, full of all sorts of locks, and keys, and other things—his name was up over the door—Sunter was in custody at the time I went there—I searched the premises—I found five or six packets of copper money, con<lb/>sisting of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and some silver money also, amounting altogether to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I found the copper money in all parts of the shop, some in an old pint-pot, some in an old boot, and some in an old watering-pot; I also found some other articles there—I took Cutmore into custody on the Saturday night (that was before I had searched at Sunter's)—I told him I was a police-constable, and I should take him into custody for robbing his employer, on Wednesday the 19th, of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

I bonght it—I reported this matter the same night to my superintendent, Mr. Payne, of the P division—I believe he is not here—I did not enter this in my book, because I always enter such things as this on a sheet of foolscap that I carry purposely—I merely enter rubbish in this book, all sorts of things (<hi rend="italic">handing it in</hi>); some of them are private entries and some on business—I enter any<lb/>thing that occurs on my beat, such as goods removed, or the numbers of cabs, and such things; those I enter in the book when I have got no foolscap with me—you may find this matter entered there, and now I come to recollect I believe you will—I made it on foolscap—I buy the foolscap; I do that out of my pound a week and less than that—no books or papers are provided for us; I have always found them for myself ever since I have been a police-constable—I see there is no entry here—there was nobody but Sunter and I in the compartment I was in at the time this occurred—no one but Cutmore was behind the bar—I did not call the attention of any, one in the house to this until the Saturday night.</p>

I am chief cashier of the London and South-Western Railway Company, at the Waterloo Station—the prisoner was in the habit of accounting to me for sums of money that he received, three times a week—I account to the company for the sums of money paid to me by him—I received those sums on account of the company—I cannot trace that he has accounted to me for the sum of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 8th March, or for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on 14th March, or for 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 29th December, on account of Buck and Co.—there is no entry of any sum of money received about that time on account of Messrs.

I can only say that that has come from the company, and that it is crossed to our bankers—that has not the bankers' stamp on it—whether that was included in the lump sum of 31st December or not I cannot tell—my books would not show that, if they were here—I am unable to tell you what the several amounts of the cheques were which made up that lump sum—I should imagine that Mr. Hagreen could tell that, and the bankers also—the prisoner could also tell, but this book does not show it—Mr. Hagreen is the cashier at the Nine Elms' goods station, I am the cashier of the company, receiving all the receipts—I do not know whether Mr. Hagreen received money from the prisoner—when the prisoner handed me in money in the way I have stated, he has handed in a list of the separate cheques—most likely he did so on 31st December, but I have not got it.</p>

               <p>it; but that, of course, would be by his instruction—the only two persons who were likely to receive money there would be the prisoner and Ponten—Ponten should not do it—I do not know that he did—I have heard so—there were no others to my knowledge in the habit of receiving money from the carmen—I never heard that Grimsdick received cash during that time—there is a room behind the pigeon-hole—there are only the prisoner and Ponten in that room; no one else—the two collectors would go there of an evening; after 6 o'clock, perhaps, to settle up with the prisoner what they had taken during the day—I should think they would be the only parties in the room—I do not know whether Mr. Hagreen knows more of the department than I do—I have seen a great deal of the working of it—the carmen would not come there at all times in the day—from 6 till 10 o'clock at night is the time to receive money—the collectors would no doubt go there to settle after the day's round—I know a person named Cooper, who was in the service of the company—I should think he must have ceased to be in their service three and a half years—there were no defalcations at that time that 1 know of—I never heard of anything of the sort—I do not know that the clerks are sometimes in the habit of borrowing from each other upon I.O.U.'s—I have heard it since the prisoner has been in custody; that they have borrowed from the prisoner—not for the purposes of the company, certainly not—they might receive money from him which would be entered in a book, and they might sign for the amount there—I am not aware that instead of that I.O.U.'s have been given to him—I thought you were alluding to money borrowed from the prisoner personally—I have heard of I.O.U.'s being given to him for that—I do not know that he has given money to the other clerks for the purposes of the company, and that he has received I.O.U.'s from them for that money—I swear that—I have not heard of any except money borrowed for their own purposes—I have heard that he has had these I.O.U.'s to some extent, and that some of them were handed over when he was called upon to settle his accounts, but I do not know it of my own knowledge—I never heard of Mr. Hagreen's brother making mistakes in his accounts—I heard, at the examination, that Mr. Hagreen had paid 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him—I know nothing of it, except what I heard at the police-court—I heard Mr. Hagreen's answer to the question put to him—I believe it was that he had paid 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his brother is not still in the employment of the company—I do not know that the money was paid to the company by Mr. Hagreen—I did not hear him say that—I understood that he had paid 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of his brother, for debts owing by him at Southampton, not to the company—that was how I understood it.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you know that that was handed to you after be and a person of the name of Grimsdick had been going over the accounts for some days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; some weeks—Grimsdick is in the company's service—I knew that they had been going over the accounts—this list was not the result of that examination—it was handed to me after they had been going over the accounts, but not as a result of that—at the end of 1857, there was a surplus of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which could not be accounted for or explained—I went over the accounts to endeavour to find out how it was, and could not—it does not follow from that, that the accounts must have been incorrect—it must have been through discrepancies in the carrying out—errors in the accounts would be different from discrepancies in the carrying out—errors of accounts are susceptible of being found out, but discrepancies in carrying out are not—Buppose, for instance, an item is ordered to be made paid; it might be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and be carried out one 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that would be a discrepancy in carrying out—by an error of account I mean simply a miscalculation; it might be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. entered as 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it could not be accounted for by sums being paid in and no entry being made of them—I should get no money unless there was an entry of it—no money is paid into the company without there is a record of it—it would not happen that money would be paid in without any entry being made of it—the company would get no credit for it unless there was a return—I handed over to the company about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. surplus, which could not be accounted for, and they received it and gave me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my honesty—I have occasionally made mistakes myself in accounts; not very often—I did not enter 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which ought to have been 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I entered it from a book where the figure was put down as 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was no mistake further than this, that I ought to have detected it—the prisoner was credited with the balance 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that mistake was discovered by Grimsdick in going over the books, and set right—I have here a list of mistakes in reference to the account—it is a not a list of my mistakes; it is a list of the mistakes in Stanford's account—it is a list which Grimsdick made out, and which I recognist as being correct—some of them were mistakes of my own making—I cannot tell how many—I have not made many mistakes; I should say not half-a-dozen—it was not forgetting to enter sums that I received; they were chiefly errors in addition—that is all that I am aware of—it is impossible for me to say over fifteen years; errors only occur to me as they arise—I have made mistakes, and where id there a man that has not—there have at times been complaints that there were not clerks enough in some of the depart<lb/>ments; not very often—Stanford complained in 1859 that he had too much to do, and that ho required an additional clerk, and he had another found him—he had been complaining of the want of Tone, it might be for three or four months before he got one—not constantly; occasionally—he has never complained since then that he has had too much to do, not to my knowledge—there is only himself, in a general way, to receive money from the carmen—his clerk would occasionally assist there; that is Ponten; no one else—I do not know as a fact that money has been received from the carmen by other persons besides the prisoner, only by his own arrangement—in one instance, I recollect it some time since, he had a party named Nee to attend for him one night when he was away, for his own convenience—Nee is a clerk under me—he received it on Stanford's authority, so Stanford told me himself—I have said that inaccuracies and mistakes in the accounts were so likely to occur that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year ought to be allowed for them—I said that about the period of his suspension—that was after he had got the additional clerk—on one occasion, in going through the accounts, I found that there was</p>

               <p>a balance of 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against the prisoner—that was a balance which he ought to have paid, and which he could not account for, which he was unable to tell me anything about—I received his I. 0. U. for that sum—I paid a sum of 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of some of my brother's mistakes—he was not prosecuted; there was no occasion—the same thing did not happen with reference to another clerk as to a sum of 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was another clerk deficient 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I, out of kindness, gave him time, believing it was a mistake on his part—that was in the present year—I am not aware that there have been frequent complaints from the several departments that there was not a sufficient number of clerks—there has been from the prisoner's department, and one other, the Down office—that is all that I am aware of—we have given them an additional number in the Down office, but not in the particular depart<lb/>ment from which the complaint was made—my brother's transaction was eight or ten years ago—it is since then, and since the other clerk's deficiency, that the additional clerks have been appointed—I do not know that the prisoner, since the irregularities in his accounts were discovered, has given a bill of sale in order to raise money on his house and furniture to pay the company—I have not heard him say so—he was suspended on 23d April, and was given into custody on 21st May—he had to go out to collect as occasion required, within the last two or three years—I allowed him for that the usual rate allowed to the collectors; Is. a day additional—he did not go out every day; sometimes two days a week, and sometimes four—he would be out the principal part of the day—he could not travel far; he would leave the station about 12 or 1, and be back again at six—I suppose he would be collecting accounts at different places during that time—after his return at 6 he would have to go in behind the pigeon-hole—it has not happened to my knowledge that in his absence money has been paid in and received by some-body else at the pigeon-hole—I have not heard it—he would remain at the office until about ten minutes to 10—he was there from half-past 9 in the morning till ten minutes to 10—before he went out to collect he would be making up his previous night's cash; that would be the different amounts he had received when out collecting, and the amounts paid in by the carmen—those amounts he would not hand over to me; he would send them direct to the cashier at Waterloo, Mr. ls Souef—I know nothing about his paying in to the bank—he was supposed to pay it at Waterloo—I used to band him over money to pay at Waterloo—I am not aware that I have handed him over money to pay into the bank—I should say, on an average, from 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week would pass through his hands; made up of the sums received from the carmen and from myself—he would have to make entries in three or four books—it was with my knowledge that Grimsdick was going over the accounts with him—he gave Grimsdick every assistance—it was not in consequence of their search of the books that these defalcations were discovered—this list was handed to me subsequently.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief cashier of the goods department of the London and South Western Railway Company—I have been fifteen years in their service, filling the office of chief cashier at Nine Elms—the prisoner was a clerk in the Nine Elms' office—it was his duty up to February last to receive the carmen's accounts—he also collected certain other debts that were outstanding, by my instructions—I do not mean by my instructions with regard to each specific sum he was to receive—the character of those debts would vary, but they would be accounts that were outstanding—in consequence of some matters which occurred in the office, I gave him verbal instructions that he was to discontinue from that time going out collecting; but there was an exception made in the case of Buck and Co. on account of their being rather difficult to deal with in working the account, and there<lb/>fore it was considered that it was better to remain in his hands—that was the only exception—it would be in opposition to those directions for him to obtain 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from quartermaster Smith of the Fusilier Guards; or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Frost on account of Waring—until I spoke to him on the subject of these accounts, I had not theleast idea that he had received either of them—if he had been authorized to receive them, it would have been his</p>

               <p>duty to enter them in the C.

C. book, and I gave instructions in reference to that item—this was in the prisoner's own office, and be requested me to go out with him into the corridor, and told me it was of no use sending, for he had received the amount of the Fusilier Guards—there was no amount named—there were people in the room at the time—it was after that that be gave an account of his defalcations, and in that these two sums were put down.</p>

               <p>this account on the Wednesday, but should be sorry to swear to it; it might be on the Thursday—I swear that there is no date in the book to show when I made it up—I call it the cash balance book—this that I made out up to 13th April, was copied from the books kept by the prisoner—I have got it here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the 13th is all in the prisoner's writing—all the other days are in Ponten's writing—it is the carmen's cash-book—it contains an account of the various sums, small and large, received from the carmen only, through the pigeon-hole—this 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 8th April is not in one sum, it is the result of his additions—they are either his figures, or Ponten's—I do not add them up to see if they are correct—I take the addition that is given me as being infallibly correct—I have added them up to see if there are mistakes, and I have found occasional mistakes—I have not found errors against himself, large or small—I have found that in respect to other parties, mistakes have been made both against, and in favour of the company, but nothing like 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nothingimportant, only a few pence—I am not dealing with errors of calculation, I am dealing with additions—I admit having found mistakes on both sides, but the errors were unimportant in amount—I never recollect an instance of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the balance of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in favour of the Company, which I spoke of yesterday, may have arisen from mistakes in calculation in reference to pounds, and not to pence—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the C. C. book—this repre<lb/>sents the money that has been collected out of doors—it is not all in the prisoner's writing—the prisoner copies the book in his office—he has one clerk, whose name is Ponten—this entry, "April 13th," and others, appear to be the prisoner's writing—this "Legg, Exeter, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." is Ponton's—I cannot see that it was entered first 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I should be sorry to say that the shillings have been altered—I do not feel certain—this first entry of mine, "Collector, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," I got from this book—they are my figures—I made a point of adding this book up—this 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. did not attract my attention—I cannot say whether there have been erasures or corrections in the collector's book—this 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. are my figures I am sure—this book, which I have copied, commences with a balance of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had not paid close up the week before, and had got that in hand—I mean that he paid 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. less than he ought—he did not give any account of it—it was money which he ought to have paid over on the 13th, but which he retained in his possession—next week, beginning with the 15th, we commence with a balance—he then commences with a portion of the 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had retained the week before—the balance in his hands is less—that balance has gone on from the end of last year, when he paid close up—whether he had any occasion to keep money in his hands, would depend upon circumstances, on adding up I find there is a difference, and carry the balance on to the next week; the balance is one for which he is responsible to the Company—it is not in cash, but in vouchers—he has vouchers in his possession at the end of the week, which he has to realize in amounts down the line—I eater in this book the cash that is entered in the collector's book and the carmen's—the carmen would not realize the amounts—here is entered "Vouchers, 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and "Vouchers, 556<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that represents cash, but probably he has not realized the whole of it.</p>

               <p>and he should have paid it over—that has been going on from January, 1861—I am not aware that the Directors are aware of this—on 23d April, I directed somebody to make out the Fusiliers' account: that bad been owing about three weeks—it was early in April when it took place—it was at the end of January, or the beginning of February, that I told the prisoner not to collect—I had authority for that from the superintendent—he called my attention to Stanford collecting accounts, as there was an additional collector appointed; and told me to tell Stanford to collect no longer—he assigned no other reason—I took the reason to be that there was an additional collec<lb/>tor appointed—I believe I then told Grimsdick to make out the account—I believe he was to collect them—it was in the prisoner's own office that I told the prisoner he was not to collect any more—I went direct from the superintendent's office—Mr. Godson is the superintendent—I do not know whether he is here now—Mr. Pitching is the additional clerk—one clerk could not do it all—he was not the only collector, but we wanted another—to the best of my belief, Fry was present in the office when I told the prisoner—I mean to say that Bucks' is the only account I told the prisoner he might collect—he would go specially for that, and for no other—I first spoke to the prisoner about these matters on 23d April—the conversation which resulted in his being suspended—it was at the beginning of February that I told him not to collect—nobody had drawn my attention to the balance being carried over every week—Grimsdick is the only person who has overlooked these books for the company—he went, over them with the prisoner before he was suspended—I desired him to do so—no one had desired me to tell him to do so—I have not heard of any inquiry being set on foot to find out the notes paid by the Fusilier Guards; but the question was asked of the bank-clerk at the police-court—I do not know that it has been stated that the notes were paid in to the credit of the company—there is a person named McCarthy in the service of the company—he is super<lb/>intendent of the delivering department—there is a small amount owing now from the Fusilier Guards-there was some dispute in reference to that account being overcharged—I do not know that the prisoner brought back the account front the Fusilier Guards about which the mistake was, and gave it to McCarthy to be set right—I cannot say whether McCarthy is here, or the bank-clerk—I only know from the prisoner's remittance book what sort of coin or money he pays to the bank, or to the cashier, three times a week—if the Fusilier Guards paid with certain notes, I should have no means of knowing that those identical notes had been paid in to the credit of the company—it cannot be discovered by a search into the books of the Company, because he kept no record of the note—he paid the monies to Mr. Le Souef, but paid in the lump—on one occasion I paid 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my brother through a mistake—I did not pay 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for another clerk who was deficient—I gave him time to arrange it, but he did not arrange it—it is still standing now—the Company know of it—they knew of it at the same time that they knew of this—I found it out just at the same time as Stan<lb/>ford's—the other clerk's name was Crouch—I gave him time to arrange it without the knowledge of the Company, but afterwards I reported it—I may have known it a week before I reported it—I said yesterday that it was without the knowledge of the Company—I meant only for a week—I cannot say what has become of Crouch—I believe he is in 'the service of the Company—on another occasion there was a sum of 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I allowed the prisoner to pay by an I. 0.

               <p>came and asked for a pennyworth of cheese, and tendered a counterfeit half<lb/>crown—I told him it was bad—he seemed to doubt it, and I took it back, tried it, and marked it with acid—I came back and told him it was bad, and he said that his master gave it him at Turnham-green, and that he had not any other money—I gave him back the half-crown, and sent my boy oat after him to watch him—my boy soon came back and I then went into the street, and saw both prisoners walking together—when they came to another cheesemonger's shop I saw the female prisoner hand the male prisoner something, and he went into that shop—I then gave information to a constable, and pointed out the prisoners to him—I saw Jones come out of the cheesemonger's and go into a baker's named Taylor—while he was in the cheesemonger's shop the female prisoner was standing close in front of the shop—she walked across the road when he went into the baker's, and when he came out of there he joined her and handed her something—I then went up and took the woman into custody, and Bunting the constable took the man—one constable was in plain clothes, and as we were going along to the station I told him to watch and see if she dropped anything, and she dropped two pieces of coin—they were picked up in my presence by a constable—one was a half-crown, and the other a shilling—the constable was walking behind her—his name is William Pound—he showed them to me—one was the half<lb/>crown which the man had tendered to me in my shop a short time before—as we were going along, the woman took her hand out of her right-hand pocket, and gave me a packet, saying, "I will give you the whole, and will speak the truth"—I handed it to the constable behind—Pound has the half<lb/>crown that the woman dropped and he picked up—I saw the paper examined that the woman gave me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and live with my parents at Fraser-street, Lambeth—on Sunday evening, 28th July, I was near the White Hart and saw the prisoner Smith—he called to me and said, "Mate, here"—I went to him and he said, "Fetch one of your mates;" I called Garton and told him the gentleman there wanted him—I saw Upham standing on the opposite side of the street; Smith was on this side, about a hundred yards from the White Hart, which is across in another street—I saw Smith give Garton a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a jug from underneath his coat—he said to Garton, pointing to the White Hart, "Go and fetch half a pint of six ale"—after he had gone I saw Smith go up a little street—Upham came past me and stood at the corner of a post, and when the little boy was coming out he walked along quick—I waited till Garton came out; Upbam could see the door of the White Hart from where he was standing—when Garton came out, Upham walked down to the Suspension Bridge—Mr. Douglas came out of the White Hart with Garton—about five minutes after he came out, I saw Smith and Upham together, and pointed them out to Douglas—I went with him into the Kings Head, and they were taken into custody there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the White Hart, College-street, Lambeth—on 28th July, Graddick came in with a small mug for a quartern of the best gin—he gave me a two-shilling piece, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and the gin in the small yellow mug—immediately after he left I found it was a counterfeit florin; I marked it, and subsequently gave it to the policeman—about ten minutes afterwards Garton came in with the same mug and called for half a pint of ale, for which he tendered a shilling; I drew the ale, but before I gave it him I examined the shilling and found it to be bad—I walked round the bar and questioned him where he got it—I was not able to leave, and I asked Mr. Douglas, a gentleman in front of the bar, to go with the boy and ascertain who had sent him—I afterwards handed that shilling also to the police constable; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two coins.</p>

I am an engine driver—I was at Mr. Heppel's house, the White Hart, on Sunday, 28th July—I saw him serve the two boys that came in with the jug—it appeared to me to be the same jug—I went out with the second boy—when I got out I saw the boy Smith, and he pointed out both the prisoners, Upham first, and then Smith—Upham was standing at the corner of College-street, and Smith at the corner of Belvedere-eresent—one was about sixty and the other eighty yards from the White Hart—</p>
