               <p>Q. How was it broke open?</p>
               <p>Allen. The Window Shutter was cut and broke, then they took down the Casement, and broke the other Part of the Glass besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that make Room sufficient for a Person to get in?</p>
               <p>Allen. Yes , Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time was this?</p>
               <p>Allen. Between the Hours of twelve and one in the Night.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time did you find that it was broke?</p>

               <p>Q. Was it done in the Day Time or Night?</p>
               <p>Allen. I can't tell whether it was in the Day or Night, but the Servant told me she found the Window broke open when she came down in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Allen. A Copper was taken out of the Wash-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How big was the Copper?</p>
               <p>Allen. It might weigh between thirty and forty Pounds ; and I lost out of the Kitchen , five and twenty Pewter Plates, and four Dishes , and a Pewter Hand-bason , and two Brass Candlesticks.</p>

               <p>Allen . A Gentleman here happened to be in a Shop the upper End of Rosemary-lane, when the Prisoner at the Bar came in to sell something , and the Man of the Shop asked the Prisoner what became of those Chains he showed him the other Day, he said he sold them to one Mrs Williams in Church-lane .</p>

               <p>Adlington. My Lord, on the 24th of March, I called at this Shop to buy a few Nails, where I saw the Prisoner at the Bar stand; my Curiosity led me to know what he, the Man of the Shop, would bid him for what he wanted to sell; I thought it would be little enough; and I heard the Master of the Shop say, George, what did you do with those things you brought to me; he told him he had sold them to one Mrs. Williams; says he, I would have you get them again, for I hear a House is broke open, and I believe they are stole; he said it was the House of one Mr Allen, a Rope-maker. I had not heard of the Advertisement till I came for these Nails ; I said, Mr. Sheppard, if you are an honest Man, you ought to stop this Fellow; he equivocated pretty much with me, and did not care to stop him; I said Mr Philips, I insist upon it you will stop this Man , that is the way to hear of the rest of the things; he would not do it; I turned about to the Prisoner at the Bar, and said, what is your Name? he said he would not tell me his Name: he said he was an honest Fellow , and he told me he would not tell me his Name . I said, then I assure you you shall tell me your Name before you and I part; accordingly there was a Man in the Shop, and I said Friend fetch me an Officer, when the Officer came , I carried the Prisoner into a Publick-house, within two or three Doors of this Iron-shop , I then wrote a Line to Mr. Allen, to let him know I had stopped a Person that I believe had robbed his Father's House, in the mean Time, this Person (the Prisoner) told me had the Chains, and had sold them to Mrs Williams for Three half-pence; I kept him in talk, having only myself and an Officer, till proper help came; when Mr. Allen came, I said we will go to the House where he says he has sold these things; when I came there, I told her I came for three Nails she had bought, I asked her if she knew one Munson , she said she did not, but she knew one

               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Penton . There was the Duke of Marlborough coming through the Mall, with his two Daughters; not knowing the Gentleman, I asked the Prisoner who that Gentleman wa s, he told me it was the Duke of Marlborough ; after I had asked him this Question, then he said to me, Did not you see four Fellows go before, I have spent my Money with them, now they want to shab me off, with that he said he should be glad of my Company , if I would go and drink with him; he very much insisted on it, with that I told him I had no Money to spend, and I was going home, that I had been out for most Part of Day; with that he asked me if I would go a-cross Hyde-Park with him, to a Friend of his in Grosvenor-square , or Grosvenor Street ; as we were going over the Park, he amused me with the pleasant moving of the Clouds in the Air, and began to sing a Song as he was going over the Park; when I came near to the Place where I was to go with him, he asked me if I would go to see the Place where the Men were buried that were shot, as soon as ever I came there, he knocked me down; after that , he took away my Hat and Wig, and Penknife out of my Pocket, I had no Money; and as I lay upon the Ground, he clapped his Knee upon my Stomach, and said, if I would not consent to let him buggar me , he would kill me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174704290005"/>Penton . I got a Serjeant to take him; being pursued, he dropped the Wig as he was running away; by struggling, I got away from him; the Soldiers heard the Cry of Murder; I was not a great Way from the Magazine in Hyde-park.</p>
               <p>Court . So the Soldiers came to your Assistance?</p>
               <p>Penton. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How many came to your Assistance?</p>
               <p>Penton. I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>Court . Was he taken immediately?</p>
               <p>Penton. He was taken that same Night after I was conducted out of the Park.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say with Respect to the Robbery?</p>
               <p>Penton. No more to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Penton . What are you?</p>
               <p>Penton. I am a Barber and Peruke maker; I live along with Mr Taylor; I went out, not being well, to take a walk.</p>
               <p>Corneliu Smith. I am a Serjeant. I was in the Magazine Yard on Friday last, and about a Quarter after Eight in the Evening, I heard a prodigious Cry of Murder several Times ; I charged three or four Men upon Guard, immediately to take their Arms , and we made up to the Place where the Cry of Murder was, and when I came there, I found this

             had given of him, brought him Prisoner to me; when he was brought to the Guard. I charged him with this Robbery, and he said he was not guilty of it, I told him I could not discharge him, he was certainly the Man .</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to think he was the Man?</p>
               <p>Smith . By the Description Penton had given of him, as having white Stockings and black Garden, very clean his Stockings were; then after I had searched him, I said you had better confess the Fact a considerable deal , than to keep it in your Breast; I have got an Account where Penton lives, and I'll send to him To-morrow Morning. I said to him if you will confess I'll discharge you from your Confinement; at last, says he, Serjeant , will you be true to me? I said I would; he said, then I would speak with you in the Court; then we went into a square Court within side of the Magazine, when we came there, he said you must give me your Hand, and swear to be true to me; so I gave him my Hand and Oath, I said, by G - d, if you will confess the Robbery, I'll discharge you from your Confinement; with that he said, I have got the Hat about me , with that he put his Hand behind him, and brought out this Hat; so I said, where is the Penknife? he said he had dropped the Penknife getting over the Tenterbook Gate ; so he wanted me to discharge him, to be as good as my Word; so I said I could not, so ordered him into the Guard-Room.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to make him these Promises?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did it in order to bring him to a Confession .</p>
               <p>Court. What to swear by your Maker, that if a Man will discover , you will discharge him; then to tell him you could not do it, but to bring him here for the Reward; if there was no Reward, it would be a different Case; you did a very ill thing, to make an Oath and then to break it: What Foundation have the Jury to believe you, but that you are upon your Oath? You are telling them that you have no Regard to an Oath .</p>
               <p>Smith. So I ordered him into the Guard-Room , and told him I could not release him; the next Morning I went to the Tenterbook Gate , to find the Penknife, according as he said he had dropped it; I could not find it there, then he said he had dropped it out of his Pocket in running, but could not tell where it was .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send for Penton the next Morning ?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes, but he was not forth coming, nor could not be found till the Prisoner was before the Court Martial .</p>
               <p>Q. What Direction did Penton give you to find him ?</p>
               <p>Smith. At Mr Rocher's , or in Cuper's Gardens .</p>

               <p>Tedman. The Woman of the House would have me go to Bed; I went and laid down upon the Bed, and this Woman came and laid down by me. I knew very well I had that Money in my Pocket , and I found her Hand in my Pocket, I am positive of it.</p>

               <p>Tedman. I looked at my Money just when I went into the House, and I had five Guinea, two Half Guineas, and a Thirty-six Shilling Piece and some Half-pence in another Pocket .</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the House before you went up Stairs?</p>

               <p>Tedman. Then I came down Stairs directly, and went out of the House.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing about it ?</p>

There was another young Woman that lived in the House, she asked me to go up Stairs with her to help her make the Bed, then she took up a Thirty-six Shilling Piece in particular , and some other Gold, and said, here's Money; I said how should Money come there ? Please yes, my Lord, she gave, me three Guineas and an Half to buy me some Cloaths, and I laid it out in Cloaths; and, my Lord , I have been robbed of all my Cloaths; the Prosecutor did say he would take the other young Woman up, he said she ought to be punished ; the Prosecutor went from that House to the next Bawdy-house in the same Street; the Bawd stripped me of what Cloaths I did buy, and never sent me a bit of Bread, since I have been in Goal .</p>
               <p>The Prisoner to Tedman . Have not I been with you a great many Times ? did I ever wrong you of a Farthing?</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Who are your Parents?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not ashamed to own who my Parents were; my Father was a wholesale Carcase Butcher, at the Corner of Cow-cross .</p>

With that I whipp'd down again ; Come, says I, John, look sharp, and you will find the other by and by; here's no Cellar , it can't run through, in the little black Box she left it; he was the Space of an Hour and an half hunting about; Come, says I, look sharp, John, you will find it; he was fumbling about his Side; Come , says I, John, if you can't find it, you shall be searched for it, for it can't be gone without Hands; accordingly I took him into the back Room , and made him pull off his Coat , and then I bid him unbotton his Breeches ; while he was unbottoning his Breeches , this Bag he flipped out of his Pocket, and slid down on the Ground; I asked him what that was? he said nothing that belongs to you, 'tis something of my own; my Wife and Mother stood at the Door, as it was not proper for them to be in the Room when the young Fellow was stripping ; so I says to my Mother, come in, here's something he does not care that I should see it; so my Mother came in , and she took hold of both his Hands, and we took up the Bag; I asked him what was in it, he said nothing but his own things; when the things were turned out, there was this crooked half Guinea, that we had missed, it was among the Half-pence; when I asked him how he could serve me so, he had nothing to say to the Purpose in his own Defence, but the Dog had thrown the Drawers down, and the like.</p>

            . I was brushing the Side block down, and there were two Women cheapening a Bit of Meat with my Mistress; while my Mistress's Back was turned, the Woman cried, Mistress, Mistress, a Man has got a Leg of Mutton ; I cried Stop Thief! and I caught him about four or five Doors from our House .</p>
               <p>Q. What did he drop?</p>
               <p>Collet. The Quarter of Lamb.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was the Person?</p>
               <p>Collet. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take up that Lamb that you see him drop?</p>
               <p>Collet. I did not take it up, but I saw it brought back .</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it, did you show it to your Master ?</p>
               <p>Collet. Yes, my Lord, and I took him to the Watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had him to the Watch-house, what did he say then?</p>
               <p>Collet. He said he never meddled with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from him when this Lamb was dropped down?</p>
               <p>Collet. I was just coming out of the Door, and I saw him drop it, and I pushed by directly; and I came back directly when this Lamb was brought in, I believe it was some Customer picked it up; it was the first Grass Lamb we had this Year.</p>
               <p>Court . Then you don't know who those Women were.</p>

               <p>Lewis. This Fellow returned from Transportation the first of February last; whether he staid his full Time , I cannot tell. Mr. Alderman Davis spoke of being here , I expected to have seen him here. The People that saw the Prisoner take it, thought it was a Leg of Mutton; they cried, the Man has taken a Leg of Mutton . This Fellow has an exceeding bad Character .</p>

When I went up the Court, they were rolling of them up; when I came to them, I took hold of each Hoop-petticoat , I told them I believed they had stole them; upon that one of them says to the other, take my Hoop-petticoat , and I will go and call my Mistress that will tell how I came by them.

On Saturday last they came again, upon which the Neighbours had some Suspicion of them, so they cried out stop Thief. These Houses anted repairing or rebuilding.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the Prisoner at the Bar would have been employed to work about them?</p>
               <p>Tomlinson. He was to take the Houses himself, and repair them at his own Charge; he was first to go and look over the House to take an Estimate, then to take a Lease. I have nothing farther, than that the Sink was broke out from the Wall; they tell me there were two in Company with him.</p>

I was speaking to a Person in the Neighbourhood of a Man that was taken for robbing the Mail, and they replied, a Man is taken for stealing Lead out of our back Houses; I replied, What Sort of Men were they? They said there were two of them, but one is gone away so on Monday I went down to see if this Lead measured with the Place, and I saw it exactly tallied.

            ; but when they took him, they cried out stop Thief. While he was in the empty House, where he took the Lead from, when they cried out stop Thief, I locked him into the House, the Key was without Side; there was a Chisel and a Cooper's Adze , which they think the Lead was taken out by. (These were produced in Court .)</p>
               <p>Q. What Time did you lock him in?</p>
               <p>Gosling. My Lord, they came about eight o'Clock in the Morning, and took this Lead, and they came a sec ond Time, that I locked him in.</p>
               <p>Tomlinson. When this Man came to me, he said that he was an House-keeper, and lived in Old-street Square, and I might enquire a Character of him at the Cook in Old street Square.</p>
               <p>[This was a Reply to one of the Prisoner's Witnesses, who said he had lodged with her for four or five Months. Two or three of his Witnesses gave him a good Character, but he had little to say for himself.]</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go into the Hackney Coach before the things were put in?</p>
               <p>Isaacson. Before I went into the Coach, he cried out Stop Thief! he said a Man was about to take my Bundle away; with that, I was frightened upon his crying stop Thief; and he said the Man had dropped the Bundle into the Coach again.</p>

            -work. I am Porter and Book-keeper belonging to the Cambridge Coach; and I was desired by this Gentlewoman, to call a London Hack; I fetched the things out of the Room, and put them into the Coach, and the Prisoner at the Bar was taking the things on the other Side; I saw him take hold of the things, I spoke to him, and he dropped them; I cried after him, Stop Thief! and I knocked him down in the middle of the Street; he moved them out of the Place , when I spoke, he dropped them into the Coach again ; they lay the Top of the Edge of the Coach ; I have lost a pretty many things, and I am obliged to look very narrowly; I called out to him . What Business have you with those things? I kept Sight of him, he run just across the Street; I run up to him and knocked him down.</p>

               <p>Council. Was it not light enough to see what a Man was doing?</p>
               <p>Southwark. It was light enough for that, or I should not have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any near him? Was there not People about, passing on all Sides? I suppose you had turned your Back to the Coach?</p>
               <p>Southwark. No, my Lord, I stepped out backward, one Foot was on the Step of the Coach, and the other on the Ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took them off the Seat?</p>
               <p>Southwark When I spoke to him, he dropped them and ran, I never lost Sight of the Man; when I had him down, the Coachman came and laid hold of him as well as myself after he was down.</p>

            . About seven o'Clock in the Evening, my Brother and I were going to Spital fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Addis. At the Corner of Great Eastcheap, about three Doors from Devonshire-square; as I was walking on the Left hand of my Brother, my Brother clapped his Right hand to his Pocket; we had not walked above four Yards further, but the Prisoner at the Bar came between us, and whipped his Hand into my Brother's Right hand Pocket; he immediately withdrew about three Yards back; he turned about five Yards, and we laid hold of him as soon as we saw him again; he mixed himself with the People, at first we lost Sight of him, but in about five Minutes we saw him again and laid hold of him; he came back again immediately as soon as he had delivered the Handkerchief to his Company.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Addis. An India Silk Handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was there in your Yard?</p>
               <p>Fisher. No Body but I; she went through the Entry, and a cross the Kitchen, and upon the Kitchen Step, she stood and dragged them off the Line.</p>

I was going down to the Yard, and I met the Prisoner coming up the Kitchen Stairs; the Stairs were dark, and I made way for her to come by; I thought she looked like a very suspicious Person; she told me a frivolous Story that she had been carrying Water, &amp;c. I knew my Neighbour had Linen drying in the Yard, and I was afraid she had taken something that did not belong to her; I asked her two or three Questions; her Excuse was that she had been doing something for a Gentleman up two Pair of Stairs; when she made this frovolous Excuse, I knocked at my Neighbour's Door, and desired her to come, I was afraid she had lost some of her Linen. When my Neighbour came out, she pulled the Prisoner in by the Shoulders, and took these Stockings from her; she owned she had taken them off the Line, and she owned it before Sir

            . Have you any thing to say?</p>
               <p>Mayhew . The Prisoner at the Bar came into my Shop, the 30th of March, when I came down, she had got a Piece of Check in her Hand, which was not that which was lost; we differed about the Price; she told me that a Gardener's Wife at Hackney had bought it for 10 d. and I asked two and twenty Pence for it; well, says she, I am going as far as Knightrider-street, and I will have a couple of Aprons, and I will buy a Gown of this thing; I saw this Piece of Check upon the Compter, while she was in the Shop; that which she was bargaining for, was of another Sort; she said, I'll call when I come back; I said good Woman do you know the Shop? she said yes; after she was gone, I was clearing the Compter; I said, Mr Mayhew , where's that Piece of Check? I don't know, says he; I said then that Woman has it; the next Day she locked up over the Bulk of the Door, and I said she had got the Check under her Arm; we could not swear to the Length; so Mr Mayhew , my Spouse, brought her back , and that Check I can prove to be my own; this happened to be a Piece I have had a pretty while, that no Body liked it; that I had it often before my Eyes.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself?</p>

             stopped at my Door, with a Basket of Tallow he had taken out of my House .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him?</p>
               <p>Greenhill . No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. It was dark then .</p>
               <p>Greenhill. Yes very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be up?</p>
               <p>Greenhill. I was called up, and I found him at my Shop Door with a Basket of Tallow .</p>
               <p>Q. How much might there be?</p>
               <p>Greenhill. I believe about 50 Pounds, value 10 s. when I came down, he was at the Door, and he came into the Shop, and fell down upon his Knees , and begged I would excuse him, for it was the very first Time that he had done any thing of that Kind; I kept him in the Shop, and before he went to the Watch-house, he confessed he had taken such a Basket full before.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your Tallow?</p>
               <p>Greenhill. The Basket of Tallow that he had taken last , is at the Constable's, the other is disposed of.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he confess ?</p>
               <p>Greenhill. I suppose about the same Quantity .</p>
               <p>Q. Have you missed Tallow before ?</p>
               <p>Greenhill No, my Lord, I have not missed it</p>
               <p>Q. Could you lose such a Parcel , and not miss it?</p>
               <p>Greenhill. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of the other Prisoner, Masterman ?</p>
               <p>Greenhill. Phillips told me that it was by the Instigation and Persuation of Masterman that he did this? and that he had never known my Shop had it not been for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Masterman?</p>
               <p>Greenhill. He was at work in my Cellar .</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no other Evidence against Masterman but what this Man said?</p>
               <p>Greenhill. I know nothing but what this Man said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else taken away?</p>
               <p>Greenhill. A Bag of Cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at the same Time?</p>
               <p>Greenhill. No, my Lord, that was some Time before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it, or did he confess it ?</p>
               <p>Greenhill. Phillips told me, that Masterman had carried Cotton away, and he told me where he had carried it. I believe it to be of the Value of thirty Shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any Cotton?</p>
               <p>Greenhill. I did think one Time I did miss it.</p>

               <p>Wilkinson. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. Give an Account how you came to suspect something ill had been done to her?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. By her Linen.</p>
               <p>Council. How long ago?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. Last Thursday, her Linen led me to enquire how it came.</p>
               <p>Council. You examined her?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you find the Girl greatly disordered.</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. Yes, Sir, she did not know how to walk.</p>
               <p>Council. You say there was something upon her Linen, what did you apprehend?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. I thought the Child had a Running.</p>
               <p>Council. Does that Disorder continue upon the Child still?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. Was you present when the Prisoner was taken up?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. Yes, Sir, and he said she often use to be asking for Half-pence , and he did not think there was any Hurt in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What Sort of a Child is it in it's Behaviour?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. A decent well behaved Child.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the Child?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. The Child was ten Years old last St Thomas's Day.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this Child was in a good State of Health? Was there no natural Disorder ?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174704290023"/>Council for the Prisoner. You must prove Force and Violence in this Case in a Person above ten Years of Age. I beg Leave to ask a few Questions in relation to this Child. I think this young Man lived at the Three Tuns in Bow-street , which leads to the Sanctuary , and your House joined next Door to the Passage. I think you said this Child had lived with you almost three Years. How long had this young Man lived at this House?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson I don't know.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you before suspect this Man's doing any thing to the Child? Has not this Child frequently gone with Messages? Has not this Child frequently gone on Errands for you to this a Man and to the Maid-servants?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson . She went to this House, where the Man lived, now and then, as a Neighbour might for any thing.</p>
               <p>Council. Now, Mistress, I would beg Leave to ask you (the first Time that you had any Intimation of this thing, was from the Linen of the Girl) did you ever, at any Time before that, find any thing ail her Linen?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. I did not suspect it to arise from a Strain.</p>
               <p>Council. Have you never seen Linen coloured in the same Way, happen from a Strain?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. No, never in my Life.</p>
               <p>Council. But have you seen Linen of that Colour before?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. I never did.</p>
               <p>Council . I would adventure to ask you, Mistress, upon this, when you was with the Girl ; I believe on Friday last; I think you went before the Justice. When you went before the Justice of Peace, was there a Complaint that the Girl actually was ravished, or only an Assault, with an Attempt to commit a Rape?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. A Rape, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the Surgeon examined the Child?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. Yes, Sir, and he said the Child was very bad, and the Fellow had used her very ill; he said he ought to be hanged.</p>
               <p>Council. So the Justice committed this young Man?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this Fact committed?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. About a Fortnight or three Weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make any Complaint to you before you found it out by her Linen?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. I object to this Child being admitted an Evidence; there was a Man indicted for robbing the Mail in the County of Surrey, and a Boy was produced of 12 Years of Age, and he was rejected entirely as an Evidence. As this is a Case of such a Nature, as will affect Life, a Person indicted therefore, is liable to so high a Punishment, that your Lordship will hardly, in a Case of this Nature, admit this Child to be an Evidence. There was a Case about eight or nine Years ago that happened in the County of Surrey; a Person was produced there of eleven Years of Age, to prove a Rape on her Body, and the Judge refused her.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. If Mr. Dawson can set aside such an Evidence, his Client, and all such, will be highly obliged to him; Without their Evidence being admitted. how is such a Crime to be proved? Can it be expected when a Man goes about such an Act, he calls Witnesses? With Regard to what Mr Dawson mentions, what may occasion that, may be that, when Persons are under Examination, with Regard to the Nature of an Oath, and have been totally ignorant; but not only in this Place, but Children every Day are admitted; this Child was ten Years old last St. Thomas's Day.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Mr. Potter has given no direct Answer to what I mentioned; that is, the Case of Miller, indicted for robbing the Mail, that a Boy was the only Witness in that Case, and not admitted. Mr. Potter says, if the Child is not admitted, how can such Facts be proved? In the Three Tun Tavern , if the Child had cried out, from the Alarm of a thing of that Kind, there might have been twenty other Persons to have been Witness of this Kind.</p>

               <p>Pitts. I went to speak with one of the Maids, but none of them were at Home; and he said if I would go into the Back Room, he would give me an Orange, I did not think he would hurt me; when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174704290024"/> went in, he shut the Door and used me ill; he set himself down in the Chair, and pulled something out of his Breeches , and pulled me to him.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you feel any thing particular?</p>
               <p>Pitts . It felt st - ff .</p>
               <p>Council. Did it hurt you?</p>
               <p>Pitts . I said it hurt me sadly; he would not let me alone; I said if he did not let me alone, I would cry Murder.</p>
               <p>Council. How came you not to cry out?</p>
               <p>Pitts . Because he threatened me, and I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Council. Upon your Oath, as you desire that God should love or hate you, did it hurt you?</p>
               <p>Pitts . Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel any thing particular about the Time that it was there?</p>
               <p>Pitts. There was wet just as he was about to take it out; there was something wet, I felt it, and some of it went into me, and some of it I saw afterwards upon the Ground; it was in me a little way, but a very little way.</p>
               <p>Council. Was, or was you not, hurt by it?</p>
               <p>Pitts. It hurt me all the Time.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. What Day of the Week was that?</p>
               <p>Pitts. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Council. Can't you tell what Day of Week, or Day of the Month it was?</p>
               <p>Pitts. I cannot tell, but I believe it was about the latter End of the Week.</p>
               <p>Council. How long ago was this?</p>
               <p>Pitts. About a Fortnight or three Weeks.</p>
               <p>Council. When you went into the Three Tuns , where was it that you saw this Man?</p>
               <p>Pitts. In one of the Fore Rooms.</p>
               <p>Council. Where was you at that Time?</p>
               <p>Pitts. I went into the House.</p>
               <p>Council. Was you in another Room when you first saw him? you say he called you to come to him.</p>
               <p>Pitts . He bid me come along with him, and he would give me an Orange; upon that I did go to him.</p>
               <p>Council . Did he give you the Orange?</p>
               <p>Pitts. Yes, he gave me the Orange, and bid me not tell that he gave me an Orange .</p>

               <p>Pitts. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. Did he not pull up your Coats?</p>
               <p>Pitts. Yes, Sir, and then I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Council. When he put something to you, did you not then cry out?</p>
               <p>Pitts. He said if I did he would do something else to me.</p>
               <p>Council. What was that he said he would do to you?</p>
               <p>Pitts. He did not say what.</p>
               <p>Council. So upon that you did not cry out?</p>
               <p>Pitts. No, Sir, I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Council. When he put it to you, did it hurt you a great deal, or only a little?</p>
               <p>Pitts. I told him it hurt me sadly; I told him I would get away from him, and he said I should not.</p>
               <p>Council. You say it hurt you a great deal; Was you sensible all this Time what he did to you? if you was not sensible, how could you tell that it hurt you?</p>
               <p>Pitts. I was sensible it hurt me, but was not sensible what it was .</p>
               <p>Council. When this thing was over, Child, where did you go to directly?</p>
               <p>Pitts. I went into the other Room till some Body knocked for me; I stayed some Time in the other Room.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you offer to cry out in the other Room?</p>
               <p>Pitts. I would have cried out, i f he had not threatened me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now who was the Person that knocked for you?</p>
               <p>Pitts. Our House joined to this, and I could hear them; the knocking was from my Mistress's House that joined; I walked away home.</p>
               <p>Council. Who was the first that saw you when you came home?</p>
               <p>Pitts. Mrs. Wilkinson.</p>
               <p>Council. So you made no Complaint?</p>
               <p>Pitts. I told no Body, for I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first Time you did tell it?</p>
               <p>Pitts. I never told.</p>
               <p>Council. She never said any thing till her Mistress taxed her with it .</p>

               <p>Council. What Condition did you find her in?</p>
               <p>Dove. She is in a bad Condition ; I find her Parts very much distended, much enlarged and soul .</p>
               <p>Council. Do you know any thing of the Prisoner's being disordered?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Council for the Prisoner. When did you examine this Child?</p>
               <p>Dove. Yesterday, about two o'Clock, but there is another Surgeon that did examine her before.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. I ask you whether you saw these Parts tore or lacerated?</p>
               <p>Dove. Not tore, but extended.</p>
               <p>Council for the Defendant. May not the Extension of these Parts arise from other Accidents ? the Extension may be done by many things.</p>
               <p>Dove. She is not only extended, but prodigiously clapped too.</p>
               <p>Council. May not the Extension of these Parts arise from other Accidents, than to come by the use of Men.</p>
               <p>Dove. Yes.</p>

               <p>Holland. Not as I know of; he bears a very good Character as far as ever I heard of him; he lived a Servant with me almost a Year.</p>

               <p>[It was represented by the Court to the Jury, that the Child was but a very few Months out of the Statute of that Clause, in that Text which construes every Fact committed upon the Body of a Child, under ten Years old, whether by Force or Delusion, and Deceit, she is drawn in to have such a Fact committed upon her, 'tis all one; this Infant being a little above that Age, takes her out of that Clause of the Statute, which makes her Consent not necessary; consequently he is indicted now in the same Manner as he would have been in a Fact committed on a Woman of mature Age. There were these things hinted which constitute a Rape; in the first Place, a carnal Knowledge of the Body of a Person; and the next Place it must be by Force, and altogether without the Consent of the Person. Now Delusion and Deceit that is not Force, there is in some Measure the Consent of the Will. It was represented by the Court, what a wicked thing it was to be the Author of such a Delusion and Deceit, but yet that does not constitute a Rape. There were these two things that caused this Person guilty of such a stagitious Crime to escape; viz. her exceeding in Age by a few Months the limited Time specified in the Act of Parliament , and not being able to prove a direct Force upon the Child.]</p>

               <p>Q. Did you catch her Hand in your Pocket ?</p>

               <p>Mason. When I was gone Home to fetch the Money , the Watchman asked her whether I was along with her, whether I drank with her, she said she never saw me till she took hold of the Watch. The Keeper of the Round-House said, Was he long with you; and she said , no.</p>

            ?</p>
               <p>Holloway. It was two or three Streets.</p>
               <p>Court. So you delivered it to Blankflower?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Yes, and he carried it into one George Wood's Yard, and there he poured it into an Apron and a Sheet; I was there and held up one of the Corners .</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Hudson?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Hudson was there too; then we took and carried it into Petticoat-square, and we sold it to one Alvarez, a Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell it for?</p>
               <p>Holloway . We sold it for 5 l. and the Money was shared between Hudson and myself, and Blankflower had 18 d. of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Blankflower to have so little a Share?</p>
               <p>Holloway. If he had carried the Cannister away to hide any where, we should have paid him for it; he had 18 d. and Part of 2 s. worth of Punch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with Blankflower ?</p>
               <p>Holloway . In Church-lane near Rag-fair , at a Distiller's , where we use to frequent to and fro.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body at Hurst's House ?</p>
               <p>Holloway . I saw a Man go up Stairs with a Candle , I can't say it was Mr Hurst; Mr Hurst said he lost two Cannisters ; he told me he had got one, but that I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. These were large Cannisters, how did you carry them?</p>
               <p>Holloway. I flung away the Top, and carried it as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any great Coat?</p>
               <p>Holloway. No, I carried it open, it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holloway by Hudson, the Prisoner. Was the Latch within Side, or without Side?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Without Side.</p>
               <p>

            . I latched the Door two Minutes before this Accident happened; the Door is latched without Side, that a Customer without Side may raise it with their Fingers.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw the Door latched?</p>
               <p>Beck. It was about ten o'Clock at Night; it was about two Minutes before the Things were lost, according to the Account the Prosecutor gives.</p>
               <p>Court to Blankflower. Now is the Time to make your Defence.</p>
               <p>Blankflower. Holloway asked me if I would earn 6 d. I was to hold this Cannister for him; then he said if I would carry it a little farther, he would give me a Shilling more; now, says he, if you will not carry the Cannister away, I will give you nothing ; so I carried it away after I had emptied the Tea into a Woman's Lap.</p>
               <p>Hudson, the Prisoner, had nothing to say in his Defence.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your House broke open at any Time?</p>
               <p>Caryl . Yes, my Lord, I apprehend it was the 27th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. In what Manner was it broke, Sir?</p>
               <p>Caryl . The Side of the Shutter, I apprehend, was pierced , the Shutter was broke, and seventeen Pieces of Shaloon were taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was broke?</p>
               <p>Caryl. It was about the Size of one of the Panes of the Window, big enough for a Piece of Shaloon to go through.</p>
               <p>Court. It was not enough for any Body to get in?</p>
               <p>Caryl. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did these Pieces of Shaloon lay? Were they very near the Window?</p>
               <p>Caryl. I looked upon it to be as secure a Place where they lay as any Place in my Shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the Window?</p>
               <p>Caryl. It might be about half a Yard, or a Yard it might be.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Pieces were taken?</p>
               <p>Caryl. Seventeen Pieces, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose, Sir, they were taken out of that Hole?</p>
               <p>Caryl. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else taken?</p>
               <p>Caryl. There were the Boards which they were upon, I put into the Indictment, and one Piece of double Alapeen.</p>
               <p>Court. This you say was done in the Night of the 26th; how do you know this was done by Night or Day?</p>
               <p>Caryl. My Brother and I came Home together at eleven o'Clock, and we did not discover it till between six and seven in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Court . Between six and seven in February, that is but just Day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who did this Fact?</p>
               <p>Caryl . Upon the Loss of these Goods, I sent to the Goldsmiths Company, in order for them to disperse it to all Pawnbrokers that might be likely to purchase them; I had a Person come to me on Saturday Morning, as this was done the Friday Morning, he said he could show me the Person that robbed me, and where he believed I might find some of my Goods. I went to Justice Burdus for a Warrant, and went out on Sunday Morning that I might take the Person in Bed. I went with a Gentleman in Court, and found the Prisoner, Exelby, in Bed; we knocked at his Door, and he came out in his Shirt. He that gave me the Information, likewise told me, that one

             was a-bed with him. When he came out to us, we told him we were come in Search of some Shaloons that we had Information he had stolen; we searched the Room, but could find no Shaloon, but we found the seventeen Boards they were wrapped upon.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Exelby's House?</p>
               <p>Caryl. A Person came and told me he could inform me not only of the Robbery, but likewise of some of the Goods; so we looked round about the Room, and we found some Camblet, and upon the Bed a black Bag, so we brought these away, and committed him to New-Prison, and this Lynch to Bridewell. The next Morning an opposite Neighbour to the House where we took him, that lodged up two Pair of Stairs, he told us there were some House-breaking Implements laid upon the Support of a Spout, on the Outside of the Window of Exelby's Room; there we found a large Chissel of Iron, a proper Instrument to force any thing with, and three or four Gimblets, and some more Implements; and in searching Exelby's Pocket, we found a little Slip of Alapeen , which tallied exactly with what I had at Home. These Slips lay all in the Window, and the Piece that we cut off to make Patterns of, we found in his Pocket .</p>
               <p>Q. What have to you to say to William Smith?</p>

               <p>Q. Sir, how can your swear to that Board?</p>
               <p>Caryl. It is a Board that has gone backwards and forwards a great many Times, I have sent it to our Presser's, and he has returned it several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174704290029"/> Times. This is remarkable from any other Board we put Shaloons on, the Board is smaller than any other, and it is under Size.</p>

               <p>Caryl. It was under Exelby's Bed.</p>

            . When I came down in the Morning between six and seven o'Clock, before I opened the Shop I saw it was robbed; I went up directly and told my Master, and he immediately jumped out of Bed and came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what Things were in the Shop? Do you know that Pattern of double Alapeen?</p>
               <p>Powel. Yes, that I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that Piece lie in the Window?</p>
               <p>Powel. That Piece lay in the Compter among forty Pieces, but the Pattern lay in the Window; we found a large Jack-Hook the next Morning with which they must fish for the Strings of the Shaloons, in order to draw them to the Window. These Implements we found on the Support of the Spout the Outside of his Window, one large Iron Crow, or Chissel , and a large Wire about a Foot and a half , with a Hook at the End of it.</p>
               <p>[These Things were produced in Court.]</p>
               <p>Caryl. When Lynch came to give Information, they said me they could take Will Smith if I would prosecute; I said I would prosecute any . I was sent for to Justice Hole's, where one Harford came and offered himself the King's Evidence ; so I was bound over by Justice Hole to prosecute Smith .</p>
               <p>Q. to Lynch. When were these Things put away ?</p>
               <p>Lynch. Just as they were coming up Stairs, I was in a Fright, and said, Jack, there is something against you ; when I got out of Bed, I went to the Middle Drawer where he had put these Things, for they were knocking first at another Door instead of our's.</p>
               <p>Court. So you took the Things out of the Drawer; What did you take them out for ?</p>
               <p>Lynch. I took them out for Exelby to hide them, and he did hide them. When the Gentlemen came to the Door, they said if he did not open the Door, they would break it open. I said pray let it be who it will, let them in Exelby and I was a bed together, they asked him what was his Name, and he said his Name was Exelby.</p>
               <p>Exelby. I never saw those Things she mentions , till I saw them before the Justice, nor I never saw her from Thursday Morning till Saturday Night, for I went down to Wapping to my Wife.</p>
               <p>Lynch. Several Times I cohabited with him, I did not dare to do otherwise; the Lodgings were not mine, he took them.</p>

            . Do you know any thing of this Affair?</p>
               <p>Harmwood. My Lord, I was robbed a little before Mr Caryl; upon his Information, I went along with him on Sunday Morning, I was one of the first that went into the Room, but we were mistaken, it was not right ; while we were parlying with a Woman, we enquired which was Exelby's Room, she said the next Room, was Exelby's. When he open'd the Door, the Woman was in Bed, and we found these Boards, I said this is enough to convict you; this Stick was found in the Room, which seemed to tally with a Hook they had left in the Shop, which appeared to be put on that Stick; so, my Lord, we gave him Leave to dress himself, and we took him before Justice Burdus . I should have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174704290030"/> observed, when the Boards were all pulled out, Mr Caryl's Brother challenged that Board in particular, and made Remarks that it was a Wainscot Board, and shorter than the rest; then we took him before the Justice. The next Morning I went to Mr Caryl's, and they told me they had fresh Information of those Implements found over the Support of the Spout of the House; they could not have been laid conveniently out of any other Window but theirs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Exelby's live?</p>

               <p>Court. It was on Sunday Morning this Woman was found a-bed with you, Mr Caryl swears to the Robbery being committed on Friday Night; Can you show that you was not there? Have you any Witnesses?</p>
               <p>Exelby. No, my Lord, but my Wife, that is not a Witness for me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this House broke open?</p>
               <p>Freeman. The Door was opened, and two Gallon Pots taken out of my Shop; my Door was shut with a Latch.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your two Pewter Gallon Pots?</p>
               <p>Freeman. Between nine and eleven. I deal in Wine, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not a great many People been in your House that Night?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I never keep the Door open after 'tis dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know when they were taken away?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I had just been using of them; I missed them about ten.</p>
               <p>Court. You had not shut up your Room?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I had not locked it, my Lord, my House was not locked up; it might be lost while the Door was open, under a Pretence of buying Wine; I only prove the losing of my Pots.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the Prisoners took these Pots?</p>
               <p>Freeman. No Reason, no further than the Evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. to John Brown. Do you know any thing of the Prisoners at the Bar, or either of them stealing any Pots from Mr Freeman?</p>
               <p>Brown. I know that on the 5th Day of February,

            . I belonged to the Craft that was in the Creek about this Vessel, this Pain, the Prisoner, and a Woman with him came into the Lighter, and I heard Pain ask Campbell what he had in his Lighter, and he told him Salt-petre; I was also at the Orchard-house at Supper, and Pain was at Supper with us, and he went out about eight o'Clock, and when he returned, he had some Dirt upon his Breast, and upon the Knees of his Breeches, which he brushed off his Cloaths. At that Time he seemed to be under some Fluster and Disorder. About eleven o'Clock the Company broke up, and Campbell before that came in and told them of the Loss of this Bag; upon this I searched my Craft, and there was nothing found there; afterwards, upon searching the Lighter that belonged to Pain, they found in it the Bag of Salt-petre, which is the Bag sworn to by Mr Bouch and Campbell. Pain desired us to take his Craft, and he walked away with the Woman that was with him; when we were going along with the Craft, there was a Boy came in a Skiff, and called to him by the Name of Doctor; we asked whether he wanted Dr Pain, we thought his Design might be to carry off this Bag.</p>
               <p>- Cockrum. After Pain left us at the Orchard-house , he returned in about an Hour and a half; upon his Return, he appeared in a Fluster, had some Dirt about him, and the Woman asked him where he had that; his Answer was, that he had been at his own Lighter, that he had been there to fetch two half Guineas which he had left in his own Lighter. Pain went away afterwards with the Woman; so afterwards we searched this Lighter belonging to Pain, we looked first and found nothing , but afterwards under the Hatch, under the Stern-Sheets, we found this Bag of Salt-petre, and it was dirty.</p>
