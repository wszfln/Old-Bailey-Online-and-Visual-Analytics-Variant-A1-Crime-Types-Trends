                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and live at 47, Holywell-street, Strand. On 10th Jan. the prisoner Grimaldi came to my house in the middle of the day—he rang my bell—I went down to him—he asked me at the door whether I could engrave a medal die—he spoke broken English, that it was rather difficult to understand—he showed me a medal, which from the glance I had of it I thought was a foreign coin—he followed me up stairs into my workshop—he produced a half sovereign—I took it up and examined it—I found it was bad—he stated that he wished me to engrave the reverse side of that, pointing to the half sovereign in his hand—I said I could do it—he wanted the milled edge done—I said "That is a bad half sovereign"—he produced another half sovereign, saying that the edge was better on that—that was a good one—I said I could do the edge—I asked him what he wished to have the half sovereign engraved for, and he said it was for an exhibition in Italy—it was to be done in twelve days—I said I should want 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the engraving—he said he would give me 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I agreed to do it for that sum—I did not know his name at that time—I asked him his name and address, and he said it was no consequence, he would call for it in twelve days—he did not give any card, or name, or address at that time—he left the half sovereign with me as a deposit—after he had gone, I made a communi<lb/>cation to Bow-street office—on 14th Jan. Grimaldi called again, to know how I was progressing—he did not see it—the die was in progress—he came again on 14th Feb., between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—I saw him—he said he had got lots of work for me—I had the die in my workshop—I showed it him—he took it in his hand—he did not like it in the first instance—he looked at it, examined it, and seemed very much hurt that it was not done better, but I stated it was not finished, at which he seemed pleased, and he wanted to know when it would be done—at the time he examined it he had a half sovereign in his hand, not the one he had left with me, but one he took from his pocket—at the time he was looking at the die he was looking at the half sovereign—I said it would be completed on the Monday following—he said he had lots of work for me—he held up his hand in this way (<hi rend="italic">with the fingers extended</hi>) meaning, as I understood, that he wanted five dies—the side I was doing on that occasion was the reverse side of the half sovereign, and he said he wanted me to do the head part—he took the half sovereign from his pocket, and pointed to the head part—I pointed to the head, and he said, "Yes, yes, yes!" nothing was said on that occasion about the cost of the head part—he called again on Monday, the 23rd—I had the die all ready for him—I sent my brother down stairs to open the door for him—he came into my room—I showed him the die—he seemed very much pleased with it—I had a white wax impression taken of it, which he examined, and seemed very much pleased—he looked at the rim of the die, and compared it with the half sovereign he had—he wanted to know what the expense was—I made out the amount—the amount for the die and the rim was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he made some difficulty about that—he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were left to be paid—he gave me an address and name, and took away the die—but before that he wanted to know what would be the expense of the head part—I told him that would come to a great deal more than the other part, being more difficult—he asked how much—I told him three guineas and a half—he made a great demur about that, and thought it a great deal of money—this is the die and collar that he took away on 23rd Feb.—I wrapped it in a paper, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, of Northumberland-alley, Fen-church-street. On Saturday night, 20th March, I was on my way home, about half past 12 o'clock, and saw the prisoner opposite the East India warehouses, about thirty yards from my house—she ran up against me, as though determined to make me stop and have some conversation with her—I did not stop, and when I arrived at my own door I gave her a shilling to get rid of her—when I took my latch-key out she endeavoured to embrace me, and then suddenly ran off—I found my money was gone, and immediately took hold of her and held her—I charged her with taking the money from my pocket, and she said she had not got it—I had taken the shilling I gave her from my waistcoat-pocket, and it was from the same pocket I lost the money—I told her I would take her to the station, and she then gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., saying that was all she had got—I took her to the station, and gave her in charge—I was sober.</p>

On 12th March I was in Bridge-street, Blackfriars, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I was walking along—two boys were wrestling together, and I could not pass, as one threw the other across the pavement—in turning round to go near the railings I was immediately surrounded and pinioned by five or six boys, and the prisoner put his hand in my pocket while I was so pinioned, and took oat my parse, which con<lb/>tained 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or rather more—I did not know him before—I am sure he is the boy—I did not lose sight of him—they held me for a moment to give him a chance of escape, but still I pursued him, and never lost sight of him—he was captured by two persons at the bottom of the next street—that was only a few minutes after my purse had been taken—I had not lost sight of him at all—I was not used with violence, except being kept against the railing.</p>

I am a surgeon by profession, and have for some years carried on an extensive business—I now carry on a business in Berners-street, connected with the silvering of glass—I have carried it on since the autumn of 1848—in 1849 I formed a partnership with Mr. Varnish and Mr. Cookney—that partnership ended in May, 1851—in the autumn of 1849 I engaged the prisoner Mellish—he was recommended to me by Mr. Powell, of the Whitefriars Glass-works—I knew nothing myself of the cutting or engraving of glass, I never had anything to do with it—I sent for Mellish, and he called on me—I told him that having a process for silvering glass, I wished to obtain the assistance of some individual who could superintend at the glass house the making of the different specimens of the glass that I wished to apply the silvering process to—he seemed very willing to under<lb/>take the conduct of the matter, and agreed to go down to the glass house for me, and to carry out any suggestion I could desire, it was necessary I should have a person on the spot with the workmen, as I could not go myself, and he agreed to do so at the rate of six guineas a week—the engage<lb/>ment we entered into was ultimately reduced to writing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. James Cookney having proved his attestation to this agreement, it was read, it was dated 26th Dec, 1849, and was between Messrs. Thomson and Varnish, and Thomas Robert Mellish, by which Mellish was engaged at a salary of six guineas per week, so long as he employed himself in the business eight hours per day</hi>)—I did not understand anything at all as to the rate of wages that were to be paid—I hired Mellish entirely to conduct that part of the business—he told me he had been accustomed to regulate the wages for a long period, and that he perfectly understood it, and that he would do so on ray behalf—he then entered into ray service—he required that he should have the sole control of the hiring the men, of their rate of wages, and that he should keep their accounts entirely, and that I should in nowise interfere either with the hiring or discharging them—I never knew what the rate of wages agreed upon was, I did not know many of the men by sight—he had an office in which he had a double desk, through which office every workman had to pass who came to work on the premises—he occupied that desk for the first few weeks, or I think for some months, himself; and he eventually had a clerk—that clerk was the prisoner Douglas—I did not engage Douglas, Mellish engaged him—he told me that he knew a very clever clerk in Birmingham, whom he had known all his life, and whom he could rely upon, and he would send for him—after he had done so, he told me who he was—I knew nothing about him before—I allowed him to hire a clerk—after Douglas was hired, he and Mellish occupied the double desk—I believe Douglas at first had between 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and I think Mellish afterwards rose them to 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Mellish fixed them and rose them—some time after Douglas came, an adjoining room was fitted up for Mellish, and called his own private room, where the accounts and vouchers were always kept by him—he had boxes for that, purpose—amongst the workmen engaged by</p>

               <p>Mellish there were a class called glass-cutters and mounters—they worked on the premises—there were also several out-door workmen engaged—they did their work out of doors, and were paid their wages by Mellish at the factory—he delivered their work out from the factory, and regulated the price paid for it—he received it back again himself, and inspected it—there was a wages book kept from the time of Douglas coming as clerk—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in Douglas's writing—it contains the names of the men that Mellish hired, the days on which they attended, and the number of hours they attended—at the end of the week the number of hours were added up by Douglas, and entered in another column, and the amount they had earned was put—this book laid always on the desk of Mellish, and was in his custody—it was his duty to ascertain the correctness of the amounts charged in this book, and he always quoted it to me as a proof of the cheap<lb/>ness with which he got the work done—he referred to it in that way—this hook had, once a week, to be taken to Mr. Dean, the cashier, and if Mr. Dean was satisfied, he would have to give the moneys for the amount—at the end of each week, every man's name being down here, and the number of hours he had worked, the sum due to each man was put down in the column, that was added up, and every Saturday they were paid—the men received some on the Wednesday, but on Saturday the whole was paid, and Mellish sent for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he wanted it—I have repeatedly heard from Mellish that that was the mode in which the business was done—I knew generally what the course of business was with reference to this book—I knew from Mellish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you arrange with Mellish what the course of business should be? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I understood that he superintended the wages book—the men were paid weekly under his direction, and whatever was wanted at the end of the week he instructed Douglas, and between them they got the money from Mr. Dean, and paid the men; that was entirely, as I understood, under Mr. Mellish's direction—I was daily at the office where this book was kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you seen this book on Mellish's desk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes! fifty times at least; time out of mind: I have seen it open—I have seen Mellish sit at this book with his pencil in his hand, going over it, over and over again—I did not give Mellish any particular instruc<lb/>tions with reference to it; it was his own book, and he managed it in his own way—I did not* know of any double vouchers being kept, until I detected these frauds—Mellish was entirely answerable for the accounts of the workmen—he had the sole control over it; nobody else had anything at all to do with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, at different times, speak to him about how the business was going on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After some months had elapsed, I found a very great expendi<lb/>ture was taking place—I repeatedly spoke to him on the subject, and he always told me that if I would wait until the Exhibition opened, it would be proved that he had expended the money properly, and it would be all right; that there was no doubt at all about his management if I would only give him time—that was what I was always told by him—I discovered these frauds in conse<lb/>quence of receiving a private letter—I made an investigation, and the result was that Douglas was given into custody—the boxes in Mellish's private room were searched, and a great many papers were found there—after exa<lb/>mining them Mellish was given into custody, and was ultimately committed and tried with Douglas, who at that time pleaded "Not Guilty."</p>

               <p>the time Mellish entered my service I was in partnership with Mr. Varnish and Mr. Cookney—I believe Mr. Varnish attended to the commercial part of the business, and to the accounts until Mellish came—Dean came into my service as accountant in the spring of 1850—up to that time Mr. Varnish had attended to the accounts—Mr. Varnish was examined at the last trial, I believe on the part of the prosecution; I was in Court and heard him exa<lb/>mined—I saw him here just now—I am not aware that I knew Mellish at all before he was recommended by Mr. Powell, but I am not sure whether Mr. Lund, of Cornhill, about the same time, did not introduce him; which had the precedence I do not recollect—I had been trying experiments in the silvering of glass twelve months before I knew him—I tried some experi<lb/>ments afterwards—I had no dispute with him before he went away—I took out a patent conjointly with him—when the patent was taken out, it was understood that Mellish was to give up the patent to me for a consideration, and that was never carried out; he on two occasions refused to do it—he refused to sign an agreement which Mr. Cookney prepared—I am not aware of more than one—that was about six weeks or a month before he left my service—when Mellish came into my service he had premises of his own in Great Portland-street—I am not prepared to state whether he carried on my work there—I believe he did not carry on any work there on my account—I have been to his workshop in Great Portland-street when I first knew him—the workshops were not kept at his own place in Great Portland-street for many months; on the contrary, as soon as I knew him he had works put up on our premises—they were put up immediately Mellish came there—Mr. Varnish used not to attend to this more than me—a number of Mellish's tools and men were removed from Great Portland-street, I believe immediately we got to Berners-street, as soon as the shop was erected; it was not more than a few weeks—he was to go to Mr. Powell's glass works to superintend the preparation of the glass for silvering—that continued all the time he was in my service—every evening, at 8 o'clock, he was supposed to go down there to superintend the workmen—that would take him an hour, or an hour and a half—I have been there myself occasionally—I do not know how long it would take him; as soon as the pattern is made, I suppose the work is done—I suppose there might be twenty or thirty workmen under him, and some<lb/>times, I believe, as many as forty—the arrangement with me was, that he was to relinquish his own business in Great Portland-street when he came to me—how far he carried that out I never understood—he had the general superintendence of the workmen on the premises, as well as the out-door workmen—after some time I established a shop in Regent-street for the sale of these articles—it was arranged that Mrs. Mellish should go there, with a relative of hers to assist, or a person whom she knew—it was one of the stipulations that Mellish should go and live there—it was principally at his suggestion that the shop was taken—it was carried on, I think, in Mrs. Mel<lb/>lish's name; Mr. Varnish principally arranged that—I had nothing to do with the taking of it, but I did not object to it—Mrs. Mellish was there twelve or eighteen months, up to the time of Mellish leaving in May—she was not paid anything in money for her services; it was understood that she was to have the house, and candles and coals, rent free—Mr. Varnish made the arrangement—the goods were invoiced to her—when they left, Mr. Var<lb/>nish settled with them—I have been in considerable practice—when I com<lb/>menced this business I resigned Westminster Hospital, where I was one of the principal surgeons, and I relinquished a great portion of my practice to attend to this—I still carried on my practice, but in a very limited manner—I</p>

               <p>know that while Mellish was in my service he went twice to Paris with Mr. Varnish—he also went to Birmingham and to York, at the banquet, to super<lb/>intend some things that I had sent there—that was, I think, somewhere in Oct. or Nov., 1850—I do not recollect attending him on one occasion when he had met with an accident to his leg; I do not recollect any accident—I do not recollect attending him for anything at all serious—I did not live it the premises in Berners-street—I live about four miles from town—I do not know whether Mr. Varnish has come among my witnesses to-day—he has received no communication from me—I have seen him here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glass cutter, and live at 9, Duke-street, Lin<lb/>coln's-inn-fields. I know Mr. Mellish—I worked for him when he was in business on his own account at Pimlico—that was a long time ago—he told me, when I worked for him in Portland-street, that I was to go to see him at Mr. Thomson's—I cannot say when that was, I never kept any account; it might be two years ago—I went, and agreed with him for the price of my work—I cannot state at what part of the year I first began—Douglas was not there when I first went, or when I arranged the price—the first time that anything was said to me about the two accounts was by Mr. Thompson, after Douglas was taken into custody—I see my signature to this bill of 22nd Feb., 1851 (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did that work, and this is the amount I received—I suppose I must have received it on that day—I always received my money on a Saturday—on that Saturday I received 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot say whether Douglas or Mellish paid it me—I cannot say whether they were both present—these are the prices that I agreed for with Mellish—this other account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my writing—this purports to be for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and bears date 22nd Feb., the same as the other—I receipted both this and the other—when I signed this second one it was only for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been added since—I do not know these initials (<hi rend="italic">these two accounts were marked "A"</hi>)—these three (<hi rend="italic">marked "B"</hi>) all bear my signature—I receivesd 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on that occasion—they bear date 15th Feb., 1851—one of these purports to be for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I signed it, and the reason of that was that Mr. Douglas, when I went there a fortnight after, said, "Suttie, I have lost one of your bills, it was for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think, I won't be sure; I will make it out, and you sign it," and I signed it—these others are my two hills that I made out—I do not believe Mr. Mellish was present when I signed the one for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the initials at the corner were not on it when I signed it—these two bills (<hi rend="italic">marked "C"</hi>), dated 12th Oct, 1850, both bear my signature; one purports to amount to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there has been a"9" altered—that was made out in the same way as the last; it was made out for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot say whether I gave two accounts then—I did not give two accounts, I believe, until Douglas came—I believe he had come at that time—I always gave two accounts after Douglas came—when I signed the receipt that now purports to be for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it was for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. only.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Mellish say anything to you about making out two receipts at any time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No more than saying, "We always require two bills"—he said that to me—he did not say what for—when I have written two, one has been sometimes destroyed, and the another one written—I used to take two sometimes, because I thought it was the system of the house—both the bills I took contained the items, one of them they destroyed, and wrote another, which did not contain the items.</p>

               <p>receipt ready written—that was my course, and then upon Douglas presenting the other bill in his own handwriting, I signed that and gave it him—when I went the second time, I took two bills made out alike, with the items—Douglas tore up one of them, and wrote another, and I never took but one after that—Meilish was rather particular as to the nature of the work that was done—on the last occasion my work was found fault with, and I never went any more—I had worked for Meilish when he lived in Pimlico—I did several little jobs for him fourteen or fifteen years ago, amounting only to a few shillings, and I had known him before that—I cannot tax my memory with Douglas's handwriting.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There are some receipts, I think, without the initials of Mr. Mellish, are there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe so—I have looked through them all, over and over again—there are several—many of them have the initials of Mr. Dean, the cashier—I have not seen any of them since the last trial—this one of 19th July, 1850, has Dean's initials, "B.D."—that means that those initials were to be placed on the bills of Lee before they were paid by him, as a sanction that he had paid them—I cannot say whether Dean's initials are on all the bills—I believe not on all, but I cannot ay positively—I have seen several of those that have "T. R. M." on them, and examined them with the books—I cannot say that I have examined the whole of them—I have examined very many—some may have escaped me—I believe the object of Dean's putting his initials on those receipts was to verify to the firm that they were paid by him—I believe Mr. Varnish gave him directions as to what his proper duties were—he engaged him—I never had any conversation with Dean as to what he should do—Mr. Varnish was the principal person in engaging him, and I believe settled his duties—I believe Mr. Varnish did not settle the whole matter with reference to what receipts were to be given, and what initials were to be put upon them—I believe the whole of the receipts for the work of the glass cutters in and out of the establishment were arranged entirely by Mellish—I never heard from Mr. Varnish that it was arranged between him and Mellish that there should be two vouchers—I have never heard that from Mr. Varnish—for eighteen months the business was carried on by vouchers before I ever heard of it in any way, before I knew that vouchers had been demanded by Mellish of the workmen at all—Mr. Varnish and Dean attended to the accounts—Dean never told me that vouchers were presented to him until very nearly the period at which Mellish left the business—about six weeks before Mellish left there was an inquiry as to the vouchers, and that was the first time I had the slightest idea such a thing had been carried on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I ask you distinctly whether Mr. Varnish had not the whole superintendence and management of the accounts and the vouchers over Mellish and over Dean? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my knowledge and belief, Mr. Varnish had nothing whatever to do with them—Mr. Mellish was the sole and entire person who engaged the people, fixed their wages, received their bills, and superintended their payments, and I believe Mr. Varnish knew nothing whatever of the concern so far as that went—his business was the out door commercial duty, to go into the City to see people who might require the manufactures, and to deal with merchants and others, to recommend the silvered goods, and to treat it as a mercantile affair—Mr. Varnish never told me that he knew there were two vouchers till about six weeks before Mellish leaving the concern—I have stated before that within six weeks of Mellish leaving the concern, the subject of vouchers came before the partners, and it was not till then I heard of any such thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not said, in your examination in chief, "I had not been informed of two bills up to the time of Douglas being given into custody?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185204050031"/>

I am clerk and cashier to Mr. Thompson, and was so at the time Mellish was in his service—it was my duty to examine the wages book with the documents, and then pay the amount of the wages over to Douglas to disburse to the men—he came to me on the Saturday for a sum, which was his estimate of what the wages would come to—I gave him that sum, and on the Monday the wages book was produced to me, and I saw whether it was right or not—I knew nothing myself of the value of the work, or of the nature of the engagement of the men—Douglas was the person who produced the wages book to me—he was also in the habit of bringing me vouchers with it, that was so from the commencement—I required those vouchers, and checked the wages book by them, that is the out door work—after examining the vouchers, I marked them—all these vouchers produced, except five, have my initials to them—I am not able to account for those five, not having them—I have referred to the wages book with the accounts that I marked—I referred to it weekly, and I have looked at it since—these sums are entered in the wages book as paid to the men—I find Mellish's initials upon some of these vouchers; that was to assert the correctness of the account.</p>

I had frequently seen the pri<lb/>soners come in and out of my shop, but have only known them in the way of trade—they had no business in my house at all—I fastened my door at 12 o'clock at night—the lock was defective, and would not lock, but there was a bolt under it, which was a good security for it—the house door had been fastened before—we do not go in and out that way—I saw that that was secure when I fastened the other—it was fastened by a lock, and bolt, and a key—when I came down I found the bolt in its place on the shop door, but the staple had been drawn—the bolt was shot—this coat and waistcoat are mine—they had been in a drawer in a chest of drawers in the parlour behind the shop—they had to break open another door to get in there—I had locked that door myself—I missed a half-side of bacon, a show-glass, a jar of pickles, and also a pair of sugar-tongs, but they were found in the cellar.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Acacia-road, St. John's-wood, and am a cow<lb/>keeper. On Monday night, 23rd Feb., about 20 minutes past 7 o'clock, I was in the Edgeware-road, about half a mile beyond the fourth mile stone—I passed a man with a white coat and a cap on—I believe the prisoner is the man, but I cannot swear to him; his face was towards the hedge—he walked after me about seventy or eighty yards—I think he was not more than a yard from me—I thought he was going to speak, and looked round—he put his right hand down before him, looked rather towards the hedge, walked on much faster, and passed me—I came on towards London—when I got within about forty or fifty yards of the third mile stone, I heard some one walking behind me quite close to me, and when he came close to me he fired—I think, by the sound of the feet, the person must have been within a yard of me at the time—the flash came round my face, and I was struck just behind the ear with the shots—I think there were at least twenty shots fired into my head—there were three or four taken out of my ear—I bled a good deal—I was stunned, and staggered into the road—I then ran about thirty yards towards London, and I saw some person coming towards me, and I looked up the road and saw a man in a white coat about seventy or eighty yards from me—I did not see any other person between him and me—I told the person I met that I was shot, and said there was the man up the road—I do not recollect that he made me any answer, but he kept on; I thought he might be going after the man, but I did not see anything more of him—I went as fast as I could to Kilburn, to Mr. Deacon's, a friend's house there, and he went with me to a doctor—as I was going I met a policeman—I told him the particu<lb/>lars, and I believe he went to see for the man—I was examined by the surgeon</p>

Mr. Townsend's"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him this pistol (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was loaded with powder and shot; and I found on him a paper containing shot, and a paper containing powder and percussion caps, a penny, a comb, a glove, and an old handkerchief—I brought him to London by the railway—I went to Mr. Veale's house, and saw the surgeon extract this shot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his ear—I should say it is the same kind of shot that the prisoner had on him—I think it is a No. 5 shot—I was at Bushey on the previous Friday to this, and I fancy I saw the prisoner then; I will not be positive.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Manchester-terrace, Kil<lb/>burn. On Monday evening, 23rd Feb., Mr. Veale was brought to my surgery at a few minutes before 8 o'clock—he was bleeding considerably from several wounds in the neck, which were evidently the result of shot—I extracted one shot; I did not extract any more, because he said he was a patient of Mr. Roberts, of the Finchley-road, and I advised him to get home and see him: they were deeply seated, and I did not think it right to interfere at that time—I have compared the shot I extracted with the others, and I believe them to be the same—I found a small portion of paper in Mr. Veale's coat collar, which is charred, and is evidently a portion of the loading of some fire arms—the wounds were such as would be produced by shot fired from a pistol—the wounds themselves were not serious—he was in a good state of health, as far as I could judge; it was the first time I had ever seen him—I extracted one shot from the back of the neck, and the others were in the immediate vicinity—I did not probe them at all.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On Saturday, 28th Feb., about 11 o'clock at night, I was at Clay-hill, Enfield, near Mr. Bevan's house, which is situated at the road side, with a meadow adjoining, and separated from the road by a close fence about five feet high—there was a haystack in the meadow, about four yards from the fence, and that haystack was on fire, and I saw the prisoner coming in a direction from it—he was about six yards from it, coming towards the fence—when I got up to him he was getting over the fence—I stopped him, and said, "You have been setting that hay<lb/>stack on fire"—he said, "No, I have not, nor did I know it was on fire"—I asked him what he was doing in the field, and he said, "I got over there to ease myself"—I said, "Come and show me where you have done so"—I got over the fence, and we went, but he could not show me where—he said it was near the fence—I found no appearance of it, and, took him into custody—I made him assist me to put the fire out—there was a rake by the side of the stack, which enabled me to pull the hay down, so as to stop it from going further, till I got some water—I alarmed Mr. Bevan's servants, and when they came I said to the prisoner, "Now, in the presence of the butler, show me where you have eased yourself?"—he could not do so, and I then took him to the station, and on searching him, found this knife, a tobacco box, and one lucifer match in it that had not been lighted—I also found this cover of a book, on which there are marks of a lucifer having been rubbed—I also produce some leaves of a tract, and this tobacco pipe I found in his pocket.</p>

The stack is his property, and on land he rents—I remember the policeman giving an alarm—I went out, and found the prisoner and the policeman standing near the stack—the policeman said, "The stack has been on fire, and I saw this young man coming away from the stack; and I said to him, 'You have been and set that stack on fire;' and he said he did not see fire, or did not know it was on fire, or something to that effect"—that he then said to him, "What do you do over there?" and he said he had got over to ease himself; and that he asked him to show him the place, and he could not do so—I went and looked, and there was no appearance whatever—the policeman then took him to the station—there had been water fetched before I arrived at the spot, and the fire was quite out—as soon as the policeman had taken the prisoner to the station, I and William Jones, the footman, went back to the stack, and Jones picked up some papers, and handed them to me—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were picked up in my presence, about three quarters of a yard from where the fire had been—there was also a lucifer match found in one of the pieces of paper; it is now broken in pieces, by being pulled about before the Magistrate—I know the prisoner; he lives near—I have compared these papers with some the officer found on the prisoner, and they match, and form part of the same paper.</p>

On the evening of 25th Feb the deceased was brought there—I examined her, and she appeared to be suffering from dislocation of the collar-bone and broken ribs, and was treated accordingly—she continued in the hospital till 2nd March, when she died—the immediate cause of death was bronchitis, inflam<lb/>mation of the bronchial tubes—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination; there was a fracture of the collar bone, and the third, fourth, and fifth ribs were broken in two places—I have no doubt that the accident was the cause of the inflam<lb/>mation of which she died.</p>
               <p>

Q.</hi> You say she died of bronchitis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that is a very common complaint, especially at this season of the year—a great many persons have died of bronchitis within the last month or so—I connect the inflammation with the accident, because it is a very likely sequence of frac<lb/>ture of the ribs and collar-bone—a very slight membrane separates the ribs and collar-bone from the bronchial tubes—bronchitis is frequently produced by some peculiar state of the atmosphere—the deceased bad been subject to bronchitis—she appeared in serious danger when I first saw her—she was very old, and very thin and emaciated, and asthmatical.</p>

I am a widow, and live at No. 20, Artillery-lane—I keep a grinder's shop, and sell nails—Scott lived in my house with his father and mother, in the front room, on the first floor, which adjoins my bedroom, which is the back room—on 25th Feb. I bad 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, two sovereigns and a half sovereign, in a drawer in my bedroom, wrapped in separate papers—I saw them safe on Wednesday 25th Feb., and on Thursday night between 9 and 10 o'clock I went to the drawer to get change, and then for the first time I missed the money, all but the two sovereigns which were left—I also found my things strewed about the drawer, as if some one had been there—I had locked the door of my bedroom, and kept the key in my pocket—when I went to get the change this drawer had been forced open—two pincushions which I bad where the money was, were gone—I know the pincushions again, these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—about 7 on the Thursday night the prisoner Knight came into my shop, for a halfpennyworth of nails—I served him—he returned again with them, and wanted them changed, and I did change them—after Knight was</p>

               <p>gone, Parsons came in for a halfpenny worth of nails—I served him, and he went away—the window of my bedroom was shut, and fastened with two screws—when I went into the room to look for the money, the window was left open, and the flowerpots were knocked about—about half an hour after Knight and Parsons had bought the nails, I went down in my kitchen, and I heard, or fancied I heard, some one in my yard behind my house—I went with the candle, and Scott was coming in out of the yard—I said, "What do you do there?"—he made no answer but walked right through into the street—these are the two pincushions I had in the drawer—I have had them a great many years—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the kind of nails that I sold.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">city-policeman</hi> 628). From information, I went on Thursday, 26th Feb., about half past 9 o'clock, after the prisoners—I found Grady in a lodging house, in Goulstone-street, Whitechapel—I asked him if he had been in company with Scott—he said, "Yes"—I told him I should take him into custody for robbing an old woman in Artillery-lane—I asked him if be knew Scott was in custody—he said, no, he did not know that—as I was conveying him to the station, I saw him fumbling at his trowsers pocket—I took hold of his band, and took two pincushions from him—he told me he had received them from Scott, and Scott committed the robbery—I took him to the station—I then went in search of Parsons—I apprehended him in Duke-street, Union-street, Bishopsgate—I asked him if he had been in com<lb/>pany with Scott and Grady—he said he had—I told him I should take him into custody, on suspicion of robbing an old woman in Artillery-lane—he denied all knowledge of it—I searched him—I found on him a packet of nails, a tin box, a duplicate, and a halfpenny—when I took the nails, he said he had purchased them at the old woman's to mend his shoes—I went after Knight, and apprehended him in Whitecross-place, Finsbury—he was in bed—he got up, and I asked him if he had been in company with Scott, Grady, and Parsons—he said he had—I asked him how long he had left Scott—he said about 7 o'clock—I asked how long he had left Parsons—he said he had not long left him—I told him I should take him into custody—while he was dressing, I saw him concealing something under the bed—I pulled up the bed, and saw it was a packet of nails—he also produced this staple—he said it was what Scott committed the robbery with, while he and Parsons were purchasing nails—I have compared the mark on some drawers in the prosecutrix's house with this instrument, and they correspond exactly—I matched it with them on 27th Feb.—I examined the back of the pre<lb/>mises, and found some marks on the tiling and wall—they must have got on a dust bin, from there to a washhouse, or leanto, and from there to a first floor window—it could be opened without force; there are two screws, but it is very old, and could be opened without difficulty—I did not observe any marks of violence on the window—I saw marks of dirty feet on a chair.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drover, and live at Dalston. I have been in the habit of driving cattle for Mr. Pickett for seven or eight years—on Friday, 19th March, I took ten cows to Smithfield for him—he went there with me himself—there were nine milch cows and one brown cow—Mr. Pickett remained till near 3 o'clock; he then left roe—the price that was fixed on for the brown cow, or heifer, was 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the others were to average about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I saw the prisoner in the course of the day—he made a bidding for three of the cows, but the red cow was not one of them—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185204050063"/>
               <p>I refused his bidding; I did not sell him any cow that day—I did not receive any money from him—I did not enter into any bargain for the tale of a cow with him—about 4 o'clock, I sold one of the cows, and went into the Bull, public-house in St. John-street, to receive the money for it—I had driven the cattle out of the market, and the cows were all safe when I went into the Bull, which is, perhaps, 100 or 120 yards from Smithfield—I left Cun<lb/>ningham, the drover, in charge of the cows—when I came out of the Boil, the cows were standing in front of the door, and we drove up St. John-street—the officer would not let them stand any longer—they were driven up Sutton-street, to be milked there; and after that, they were driven to Ayles<lb/>bury-street—after they got to the bottom of Aylesbury-street, I counted them, and the red cow was missing—the drover was then pone—I went back to Mr. Curry's, at whose place the cows had been milked, and made a com<lb/>munication to him—I saw the red row again on the Monday following at Mr. Amos's shed, at Stepney; it was the same I bad missed.</p>

I know you"—I said, "Do you?"—she said, "Yes," and asked me to go a little way with her to her aunt's, and told me to tell my mother her name was Thomas; and she said she knew my mother when I was a little thing—she told me I lived at Mrs. Green's in Broad-street—I had lived there, but not then—I went with her down a street opposite the Post-office, and she bought me a pennyworth of sweet-stuff—she gave me a little knitted basket, and saw me wrap my money up, and put it into a little bag, and then into a box, and put the box in my basket—I stooped down to do something to my dress, and put my basket down to do it—she took up my basket, and I said, "Put that down"—she did not do so, and I got up and took it from her—a little while after she told me to go down that street oppo<lb/>site, while she went to her aunt's to get some playthings—I waited for her five or ten minutes, looked into my basket, and found the knitted bag sad As money gone—the little box was not gone—I had never seen her before—I am quits sure the prisoner is the person—we were together three-quarter of an hour.</p>

I became acquainted with the prisoner about a week before 30th of last Sep., and gave him four debts to collect for me—one of the debts was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., due from Mr. Chisholm, of Cornwall-place, Holloway—I have never received any money from the prisoner—on 30th Sep. he called on me and said he should be obliged to summons Mr. Chisholm for the debt, and he should want 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that purpose—I gave him that money—he said it would be necessary to summons him to the Sheriffs' Court, in Red Lion-square—I saw him again on 9th Oct., when he told me he had taken out a summons against Mr. Chisholm, and that it would come on for trial on 15th Oct.—on 15th Oct. he came again, said he had appeared at the Sheriffs' Court, and there was no one there from Mr. Chisholm to proceed with the case, and that it would be advisable to take out an execution on his goods—I asked him what amount of money he wanted, and he said 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I gave him, and before I gave him that I wrote this paper from his dictation (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I and he signed it, and one of my servants also (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Sheriffs' Court, Red Lion, Oct. 15th 1851—I hereby authorize John Brown, my collector, of 5, Alfred-place, Blackfriars, to take an execution on Mr. Chisholm's good and chattels situated at No. 11, Cornwall-place, Holloway, Middlesex, for goods sold and delivered, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; expenses, summons and levies, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; execution on goods, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; total, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; signed William Saville, John Dommett, and John Brown"—That "John Brown" is the prisoner's signature—before I parted with this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I believed that the representa<lb/>tions he had made of having taken out a summons and attended the trial of Chisholm's case were true; I should not have parted with my money if I had not believed so—the prisoner called again on the evening of the 20th Oct., and said he had come to take the goods and chattels of Mr. Chisholm—he went to Mr. Chisholm, came back and said he had found out that the goods were not Mr. Chisholm's, and the only thing would be to take out an execu<lb/>tion against him, in order to tell whether the goods were his or not, and that</p>

               <p>because if I saw anybody waiting probably I should come forward—if I did receive any I put it to the account of the person who paid it in—if required I should enter it in the pass book at the time; it is very often required—sometimes the customer takes the pass book away with him, and sometimes be leaves it—money is often paid in by one person to the account of another—I do not make up the pass* books—I do not know whose handwriting this pass book is last made up—I know the handwriting of very nearly all the clerks, those who have been there seven years certainly—one or two clerks have left in the last two years, perhaps more—I know their writing—I believe this entry of the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not the writing of any clerk in our house—is not the writing of any person I know—I do not recollect any mistake similar to this occurring since I have been in the bank—a sum may appear is a pass book which has been questioned, but this was twelve months before it was questioned—there may have been a complaint by a customer that money has been paid in on his account, and not credited to him—I do not recollect any charge of dishonesty against any clerk since I have been there—I never recollect taking any money of you—I am not aware that I have ever seen you in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Great Grimsby, and am agent for Mr. Howard. I appointed Cooper master of the <hi rend="italic">Experiment</hi> on 2nd Jan. last—he had made one voyage in her before; he had only been ten or twelve days in he employment before 2nd Jan.—she was sent from Great Grimsby on 4th Jan.—at that time a man named Dennis was mate, and Swale was the teaman, and there was a boy on board named Ford—the instructions I gave Cooper were to go and catch a voyage of fish and bring the fish back as soon as possible, as I should send them to London—he was to get the fish off Grimsby, at what they call the fishing grounds off Flamborough Head—under ordinary circumstances they are away three or four days; that is the average time of a fishing trip—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Cooper on 8th Jan.—it is his writing, though he has not signed his own name to it—(read—"Scarborough, 8th Dec. Mr. Wooster, Sir,—We arrived in here last night very leaky indeed, we could scarce keep her up; we had a little fish, out very stale; we could not sell it at all, and we had no provisions on board;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185204050088"/>
               <p>we <hi rend="italic">was</hi> able to borrow a sovereign of a man here to buy tome, and wish you to send it by return of post, because he is a very poor man and wants it. Please to send word what we must do to the vessel, she is not fit to go out again. You must send some money to repair her with, for we cannot get any done here without, and direct your letter for William Beeson, fishmonger Scarborough") I received that letter on 9th or 10th Jan.; the date of Dec. must be a mistake—I did not send any money in consequence of that—I sent a man to see if what Cooper stated was true, and gave him orders to have the vessel <hi rend="italic">caulked</hi>, if necessary, and gave him money for the purpose—he went there and did all that was necessary, and left—about 13th or 14th Feb. I saw Dennis the mate and Swale—they made a communication to me—I received this other letter from Cooper—it is his writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"New Dieppe, 7th Feb., 1852. Mr. Wooster, Sir,—We arrived in here on Saturday; we <hi rend="italic">was</hi> blows here short of provisions, and went to the English Consul for some money; he let me have some, but not enough to serve us to pay all the expenses. I went to him again for some more to pay the harbour dues, but he would not let me have any to pay it with, so the harbour master has stopped us here. We cannot get away for the sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they are a very queer lot of people about here. There is a <hi rend="italic">biliy boy</hi> lying here almost the same way; the Consul will not let them have money, nor anything, so we must lie here without provisions or anything. We had an old anchor and chain we woe obliged to sell to buy things for the vessel; and I do not know how long we may be lying here if they do not get paid their harbour dues. I should wish to have some money to get clear of this lot of villains, for they are big rascals, and I do not know what to make of them at all. So no more at present from your bumble servant, J. W. Cooper.") The vessel was brought back to Grimsby by Mr. West, and the prisoners were sent home in custody—I have here an in<lb/>ventory which I made of the things in the vessel when she sailed from Grimsby (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—at the time I gave the vessel in charge to Cooper there was on board 180 fathoms of chain cable, two bower anchors, two keilges, one boat anchor, four small anchors, two grapnels, a two-hour glass, three glass compasses, and five jibs—when the vessel came back, a great many of these things were gone—I missed one bower anchor, two kedge anchors, about 120 fathoms of the chain cable, the two-hour glass, a compass, a jib, and a quantity of rope—the value of all the things that were missing was, I should say, up<lb/>wards of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the value of the vessel is 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cooper.</hi> You say you shipped me as master, and told me to go and get a voyage of fish, and get back again; you never said any such thing; you said, "When you come in, bring me a pair or two of soles," that was all; not a word was mentioned about getting a voyage of fish, or anything else. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did mention it; he was well aware that a vessel is never gone above two or three days—I had no intention of trusting him with the vessel for eight, nine, or ten weeks—I did not mention the number of days he was to be absent, but I naturally expected he would not be gone more than three or four—the crew were to have half what the vessel earned, the master was to have a share and a quarter and half a quarter, and the men a share and half a quarter each—there are eight shares—they went on the share system—they bad about a month's supply of provisions; the object of that was to prevent dock dues—there is a dock at Great Grimsby, and every time a ves<lb/>sel comes in she pays 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; so she was victualled for a month that she might come into the roads, and go out again—he made a voyage before as mate, and was only gone four or five days—a fishing voyage of nine or ten weeks would not be profitable—we never allow our vessels to be out that time—</p>

               <p>our object was to send the fish up to the London market by the Great Northern Railway; we have a contract with that company for that purpose—I did not authorise Cooper to go to New Dieppe for tobacco or spirits.</p>

                  </hi>. I was seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Experiment.</hi> On 4th Jan. we sailed from Grimsby—Cooper was the master, Dennis mate, and a boy named Ford was on board—we fished off the north ground, about sixty miles from Grimsby, we caught seven pots of soles, and several baskets of <hi rend="italic">offal</hi>, such as haddock and plaice—we took them into Scarborough, and the soles were sent off by railroad—Dennis then left the vessel, and the prisoner Palmer was taken in his place—he was known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Dover Dick</hi>—while we were at Scarborough, Cooper said that the fish fetched 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me he had sent the soles away by railway, but the other part of it was sent for manure, it was no use, it was so stale—he did not mention Mr. Wooster's name—we went out again on another trip and caught some more fish—before that, the vessel was repaired at Scarborough; the repairs were done under the direction of Mr. Scott, a man who was employed by Mr. Wooster—after that she was pretty tight—she made a little water, but nothing of any conse<lb/>quence—we then fished about thirty or forty miles from Scarborough—we caught about ten baskets of soles, and three baskets of brill and turbot, and five or six baskets of <hi rend="italic">offal</hi>, such as haddock and plaice—we took them to Sun<lb/>derland, and Cooper sold them—I do not knew exactly what he got for them—I got some of the money; some he gave to Palmer, and the other he got for himself—we were by the share; there was no reckoning up about it—I bad asked him before we got in there if he could let me have a sovereign or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as I had a wife at home, and I bad been five or six weeks on board and bad only had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; so I believe I got as much as was due to me—Cooper and I both joined the vessel, together—he was then mate—that was not on this voyage—I got very little money before—we went into Sunderland on the Tuesday, and left on the Saturday; while there I heard Palmer make mention to Cooper about taking part of a troll warp ashore to sell—he did not do it—I heard him propose to take some rope ashore to sell—I told him it would be foolish to attempt such a thing as that, if he did he would be sure to get taken to gaol—he said, "You are a fool; there is no fear of these lads, they are not like other lads"—once before that I heard him say that he would go across, provided he could get anything to go for—he did not say where he would go, further than that he would go across—that is generally understood to mean going across to Holland—he did not say for what purpose—it is un<lb/>derstood to mean going for tobacco—I have heard him say that he could draw money on the vessel—it was once talked of that if they could not get a freight at Sunderland they would go to Yarmouth, and see if they could get one there—they did ndt say anything to me about the stores—I left the vessel, because they were taking rope ashore, belonging to the vessel to sell, and they were going smuggling, and all that, so I saw it would not do, and they were too much given to drink—I knew very well that by going <hi rend="italic">across</hi> they meant going smuggling—they were short of provisions, and they talked of laying up the stores to buy some—when I arrived at Grimsby, I saw Mr. Wooster—I was told he wanted to see me, and I went and made a communication to him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185204050090"/>
               <p>—I heard Palmer say that he had been across three or four times—I do not know whether Palmer sold any of the rope at Sunderland—he was getting it ready to take ashore when I left the vessel—Cooper was then ashore—I do not know whether he knew of it or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cooper.</hi> He said at first that he saw me take the rope ashore, and now he says that I was ashore at the time; I was on deck when he left, and bid him good-bye; this is the first time he ever went a fishing voyage, and he does not know what price fish fetches. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is my second voyage, I hid been out with Cooper before; we were then out four or five clays—we went out from Grimsby and came back to Grimsby—Cooper did bid me good-bye when I left the vessel—I do not know the value of fish—at the time Palmer was packing up the rope, Cooper was asleep in ray bed—I awoke him and got my clothes ashore before the rope went, for fear I should be connected with it—that was on the Saturday morning—I had heard him talk about selling it on the Friday night.</p>

The prisoner and the last witness were in my custody in Newgate, both under sentence—for about fourteen days they were in the same ward—the prisoner was discharged on 15th March—it is not true that Gilbert has misconducted himself in any way, and been punished; on the contrary, he is one of the best conducted men in the prison.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon of Westminster Hos<lb/>pital. I examined the deceased about half past 10 o'clock on Monday morn<lb/>ing, and found a scalp wound about an inch long on the left side of the top of her head, exposing the bone—I examined it with a probe, but could detect no fracture—she appeared to have lost the use of her lower limbs—I sent her to the ward, and in order to make a more careful examination I enlarged the wound, but could detect no fracture—she was very noisy and clamorous, and resisted my endeavours to examine her—internal remedies were given to her, and a blister was applied to the nape of her neck—her limbs continued, more or less, in a senseless state till night—I sat up till 2 with her, and desired the nurse to call me if any change took place—her body was convulsed on the left side; she went off into a sleep, and I was not sent for—next morning I went to the dead house and made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there were no marks on the body, except that on the scalp; the hone was exposed, and the <hi rend="italic">periosteum</hi> knocked off; there was no internal injury besides that—the brain was apparently healthy, with the exception of a small spot of softening in the lower part of it, not at the part corresponding with the wound, on the opposite side to the convulsion; it was an old affair, and unconnected with the blow—the spinal marrow was healthy, the heart was extensively diseased—I cannot form any judgment as to whether she was in the habit of drinking or not—there was a large abdominal aneurism of the aorta—the kidneys were dis<lb/>eased; the lungs were healthy—the smaller vessels of the brain were diseased—it was the same description of disease which pervaded the heart, arteries, kidneys, and the softened part of the brain—she was thirty-two years old, I believe—having been told that a blow was given, I am bound to say that was the cause of death—I believe the blow would have caused her death, although these was no internal disorganisation; I am bound to say so by common tense and reason—a blow of that kind, though not attended with any fracture of the skull, would be likely to prove fatal to a person in that state of disease—the least shock in a diseased state of the system might proof e fatal—she was most extensively diseased; microscopically, there was not a sound tissue in the body—the disease was a fault in nutrition—a blow like that might be inflicted with an instrument of this kind—it would be likely to produce the symptoms on the skull, and the loss of the use of the limbs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Not except the party had been diseased in the way you have described? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a blow which gave no fracture at all would be likely to produce such appearances in the limbs—I have seen instances of death with not a symptom externally and scarcely any internally; and I have seen many cases where death has been produced by a blow where there has been hardly any external and no internal trace—I believe a woman being in a violent passion, swearing, and gesticulating, would, if in a state of disease, accelerate death, and so would anything that would produce a great effect to the mind, any shock to the nervous system—I nave heard that she was swear<lb/>ing violently at the prisoner, and that she struck him twice with her fist—</p>

               <p>that would have a tendency to accelerate death in her state; but still I think a blow would have a tendency to have that effect.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you had found no marks of a blow, and had heard a description of her violence and passion, would that be sufficient to account for death in such a subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I believe it would—my opinion then would have been that she died from excitement, some shock to the system which I could not trace—if I had not heard of her being in a passion, but saw the marks of the blow, I should have given a confident opinion that death was caused by the blow—it is a constant thing for people to die of inflammation of the brain, and yet we cannot detect microscopically any cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having evidence of a blow, and of her being in a passion, can you state which of those two caused the death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The blow was on the left, and the convulsions were confined to the right limbs, and when one side of the brain is injured, the opposite side of the body always is affected—she bad not lost the sensation of the left leg, only of the right.</p>

On 20th March, from 20 minutes to half-past 2 o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by my servant—(I had gone to bed at 11 the night before)—I got up, and opened my bedroom window—it looks into a yard at the back of my house—I saw a man run along the yard—I called out to know what he wanted—he made no answer, but went to the bottom of the yard, and got over the pales, into a lane which leads into Epping Forest—I cannot speak to the person of the man; it was very dark—I rang the bell, and Squires, my potman, came down—we searched all the first floor of the house—we did not go down stairs—we found nothing wrong on the first floor—I went to bed again, and Squires went to bed—my servant called me in the morning, and I went into the back kitchen, about 10 minutes before six—that is under my bedroom—I found a window looking into the yard open—it had been pushed up from the bottom—there are five shutters outside that window, which are kept in their place by a bolt and a fastening inside—the middle shutter had been taken down—a piece of wood had been broken</p>

On Saturday morning, 20th March, I was on duty near the Rose and Crown, at Leyton, at a quarter before 3 o'clock—that is about a mile and a quarter from Mrs. Burford's—I saw the prisoner coming down James'-lane at a very quick pace, in a direction from Leytonstone, in a direction from Mrs. Burford's—I stepped up to him and walked by his side for a short distance—I asked where he came from; he said from London, and he had been to a village just below—I walked with him as far as Mr. Masterman's park, about 200 yards from where I first saw him—I observed he had got something in his pocket—I asked him what he had in his pocket—he said, "I will show you," and he immediately struck me a violent blow over the head with this instrument, which knocked me down—I saw the instrument at the time; this is it, (<hi rend="italic">producing a large crowbar</hi>)—I saw he took it from his pocket—he then jumped over into the park and ran away—I got up and endeavoured to follow him, but was unable from the effects of the blow—it was just under my hat, and above the ear—it made a wound; it slit the back of my ear—there is a scar now—I afterwards saw sergeant Archibald; he is the</p>

Curtis's premises at Stratford—two other persons, named Langshire, were employed to cart the deals—the deals were at West Abbey-wharf—none of them were sold, or were to be taken to any private person at all—we never do so; we bring them from the wharf to the premises, and send them to the buildings—we never sell them, or very seldom.</p>

Curtis's—I went down Ham-lane to the Abbey, and then turned to the right; supposing a person came from the wharf, he would go half way down Ham-lane and turn to the left—I saw this cart with a load of deals near Costigan's houses—there is no thoroughfare there, it only goes down to the marshes—I saw it come back again empty in five or ten minutes—the same man was with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman to Jane Jenkins, who keeps the Centurion, at Deptford. On 19th March the prisoner came to our house, asked for half a pint of porter, and I served her with it in a pint pot—in consequence of suspicion I watched her, and she sat down on a seat behind the beer engine, and then went out—I missed the pot, followed her, overtook her, and asked her where the pot was she drank the beer out of—she began crying, and begged me not to say anything, and gave me the pot from under her shawl—I gave her in charge—I asked what she was going to do with it—she said to take it home to her son—it was quite empty—it was the property of Jane Jenkins.</p>

"The man that had robbed me," and remarks similar to that, and to the same effect—the prisoner had access to my berth at times—I arrived in England on 1st July, 1860—the prisoner had left the ship about the beginning of March, 1850—I caused a man named Robinson, who had been my cook on board, to be taken into custody—he was tried in this Court, and sentenced to six months imprisonment—he was tried for stealing the whole amount, including the half note—I afterwards received some information, which induced me to look after the prisoner—I did not succeed in finding him till about seven weeks back—I was in the parlour of the Mitre Tavern, in Wool with, one evening—he came in, and when he saw me he appeared rather surprised—I called him by his name, Gilbert—he turned round and said, "Are you George Rice, who was in the <hi rend="italic">Firebrand</hi>?"—I said, "Yes, bow about the bills that you robbed me of?"—he said, "Come outside and talk to me about it"—I would not do that, but gave him into custody—the part of the note was the right hand half—the half without the "Five" upon it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Cabban, of Stockwell-street, Greenwich—he is a linendraper. On 26th Feb. the prisoner came to the shop—I had not known her before—she came about half past 9 o'clock in the morning—she asked to look at some silks—I showed her some—Mary Thompson assisted me in showing them—I showed them on the counter—the customers are on one side of the counter and the shopmen on the other—she did not buy anything—two days afterwards I missed a remnant of silk of five yards and a quarter—I missed it because a customer who had had a little of it previously came to match it—I am able to say it was part of what I showed the prisoner—I did not miss it when the prisoner left, because I did not clear the counter: another person did—this is the piece of silk (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I next saw it at Mr. Nash's, in London-street—I am, positive this is the piece—I am sure this, was placed before the prisoner—two days before that I gave leave for ten yards of it to be cut, and ten yards were cut, and that left five yards and a quarter; and I know it by this stain on its outside, which was from the running down of the window, and the last customer objected to it on that account—this is not a very uncommon silk—other shops may have the same, but from the marks I have mentioned I identify it; and from the length of it—to the best of my knowledge the prisoner had a black mantle on, the same as she has now, but her features I am quite sure of.</p>

"No"—(when she pawned the silk she gave the name of Watson)—I asked her whether she had not pawned a piece of silk at my house—she said, "No"—I told her I was positive she was the person who pawned it—she said I was mistaken—I took the silk in myself, and I asked her what name it was to go in—she said, "Watson"—I am sure she is the woman.</p>

Bank-note, got it changed, and gave it to my husband—within a month or two of my husband's death I requested the prisoner to write to let the gentlemen at Christ's Hos<lb/>pital know that he was dead; she promised to do so, and nothing more passed on the subject till just before Christmas last, when she wished me to go to Mr. Onslow, the minister of Newington, and to ask him for a paper—she said it was a paper from Christ's Hospital, and I thought she had written over there—she said if I took it in as a blank, and reported his death, I should get 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I understood she had written again—she said yes, but she thought the letter was not gone, and that the paper was at Mr. Onslow's—I did not go to Mr. Onslow's—on 5th Jan., this year, she said she had seen Mr. Stathan, the curate, and he said I was to go to Christ's Hospital and get the paper; and that if I took it in and reported his death, I should get 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. given me—I went to Mr. Onslow's, and received a paper, which I took home, and gave to the prisoner, as she said as I was going to work, if I would allow her to carry it to Christ's Hospital, it would prevent my losing a day's work; that if the gentleman gave her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., she would give it me, and asked if I was afraid to trust her—I said I was not—I gave her the paper, and went out to work; when I came home she told me she had taken the paper, that there was no one but a boy, and she could not report the death, and give up the paper until the 10th of the month—on the 7th I re<lb/>turned home, and she told me my children had burnt the paper, and I should get myself into trouble; I should get locked up for twelve months and she six months, for having the paper destroyed—she said that repeatedly, on different days—on one occasion she said, "Do you wish me to get the money for you?"—I said, "No, Mary; not for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would not have you do it"—she said, "Then say no more about it, the paper is burnt; and if you do I will throw myself in the river"—she always told me that if I said anything about the paper I should be sure to be locked up; in consequence of which I at last mentioned it to Mr. Reed, who lodged in the house, and requested him to go to Christ's Hospital and inquire about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nine years—I have had no words with her only about this paper, because I would not believe it was burnt—I mentioned at the Court that she said, "Do you wish me to get the money?"—I cannot read or write—it was a printed paper that Mr. Onslow gave me—I know it was not filled up—I never went to Christ's Hospital myself, with the prisoner, or without—I have known the prisoner nine years, living with the same employer, Miss Seaward.</p>
               <p>Rev. <hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR CYRIL ONSLOW</hi>. I am rector of St. Mary, Newington. In Dec. 1851, I received this paper by post; it was in blank, except the name, Robert Lusby; here is the postmark on it—I know the widow of the late Robert Lusby, who was a blind man—she came to me on the subject of this paper, a fortnight or three weeks after I received it—before she came to me a female had been to me—I do not remember her—it was not Mrs. Lusby; I know her—she came a few days after, and I gave her the paper blank, as I had received it—I knew her late husband was at that time deceased.</p>

On 5th Jan. this year, the prisoner said she had been to Christ's Hospital, and there was nobody there to receive the paper—she was' speaking to me and Mrs. Lusby—she had no paper then—on 7th Jan. the prisoner said to Mrs. Lusby, after she came home, that her children had burned the paper, and they would both get into trouble—after that, at Mrs. Lusby's request, I went to Christ's Hospital, and was shown this book—I believe this signature, "Mary Ann Lusby," to be the prisoner's writing, from what I have seen her write—this "Mary Ann Lusby," immediately over it (<hi rend="italic">the signature in Feb.</hi>,) I should think is the same—I believe this "Mary Ann Munson, 41, Gros<lb/>venor-park, Camberwell," on this paper, to be also in the prisoner's writing—I believe this "Robert Lusby" to be also her writing (<hi rend="italic">the receipt in question</hi>).</p>

               <p>matter not connected with the house at all—I entered that in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-book at the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-yard—I have not got that—I entered the other in the house-book, because the payment was made at the house—the entry in the book is at the bottom of the page—it was entered in the regular way, and at the time—my wife saw me enter it—she did not look over my shoulder while I was doing it—she was in the parlour—there was nobody else in the parlour—the book was in the parlour, I took it there—the money was not in the par<lb/>lour; it was in a tin box in a bag in the bar—the box was not locked—I have servants, but we never allow them at the bar—my wife fetched the money—I have been married about ten years to my present wife—she is the sister of Miss Maslin—Miss Maslin lives on her means, with her mother: I swear that—she was never a common servant; she lived thirteen years in one family—she left about seven years ago—I did not when I became a bankrupt assign the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> over to her—the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> were siezed in execution—she put in the execution—I owed her 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she put in an execution for the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, and also in the house—she did not seize the property in the house, she seized some of the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—that was a month or six weeks before my bank<lb/>ruptcy—I went through the Bankruptcy Court—my sister carried on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> business during that time—she carried it on up to 1851—I have got the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> now, for her, not as trustee for her—I pay her so much a year out of the business—I pay her 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year until I pay her off—I have not paid her above one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid her by instalments, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, as she wants it—she is not here—I have no regular time for paying her—my agreement is to pay her so much a quarter, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I think—I swear that—that is in writing and on a regular stamp—she lets me pay when it is convenient—she lives sometimes with us and sometimes with various friends—she is living now just by Devizes—when she is with me she only comes on a visit—she does not wait at the bar, that I swear—I did not borrow this money of Stowell to pay my sister, for I had not at that time paid. her anything—I borrowed it to pay the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> duty—I entered the payment of it in the public-house book, because I paid it at the house—if I had paid it at the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-yard I should have entered it in the yard-book—my sister did not pay the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> duty, as she was not then in town—I managed all the business—she did not know Mr. Stowell at that time—I applied to him to lend me 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 22nd Feb. 1850, and he refused to let me have it unless he got my sister's name to the I O U—it was not paid at the time it was due—it remained unpaid till June—it ought to have been paid on 22nd March—my sister did not pay it because she had no money; all the money was in the business—she was sued, and she then paid it—I paid the money, at least Mr. Preston paid it—I rather think he got a bill discounted and paid it—I had the money from him—I believe it was got by a bill which he got discounted—I think I accepted the bill—Mr. Preston drew the bill—I accepted it, and left it for him to get discounted—I do not know who cashed the bill—I have paid it—it was paid some time last summer—it was for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that left something over—I think we paid it out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> business—by <hi rend="italic">we</hi> I mean myself—the business belongs to my sister—I do not know exactly how much I got from Mr. Preston for the bill—I think it was a two months' bill, and I think I paid 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I took the bill up and paid him—I cannot tell you how much money I actually received from Mr. Preston, I think all the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within about 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have no entry of that—I do not know that my wife knew anything about it—I believe I paid the bill when it was at maturity—I will swear it—I know I have never been sued in any way, and when I had the money to pay Mr. Preston I paid him—I cannot tell you how I paid it, it must have</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to pay him back the second sum without getting back the first I O U? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, we were on such terms of friendship together, that if it had been 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should not have hesitated; as he promised to send it, I took no further heed—my solicitor, Mr. Preston, wrote for them to Mr. Games, after the action was brought on 6th June for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against my sister—that was after the action against my sister was settled—Mr. Games wrote to Mr. Preston for the payment of the I O U for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told Mr. Preston it was paid, and that he must apply for it—I swear I instructed Mr. Preston to write for the I O U's—I cannot tell you the date; I think it was about July—I swear it was before Oct., 1851, and before Aug.—I should not like to swear to a particular date, for I am not certain—it was at the end of the settlement of the action with my sister.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at that letter (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>); did you see that about the time it was written? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; as soon as Mr. Preston told me he had received this letter I told him to write to Mr. Games for the I O U's—this letter is dated 5th July, 1850—I told Mr. Preston to write for the I O U's on the very day he told me he had received this letter—it was in June, 1850, that I quarrelled with the prisoner about the action brought against my sister—I should think it was about two months after that quarrel that I instructed Mr. Preston to write to Mr. Games for the I O U's—I have no doubt of that—I am quite sure I gave those instructions long before Christmas, 1850—my sister was in service thirteen years—it was about eight years before my bankruptcy that my sister advanced me the money—some of that money she had saved, and some she had left her, and some was the pro<lb/>duce of some property which was sold, and I received the money—I had to pay her so much till I paid off the debt—my assignees were fully aware of this transaction with my sister—they made investigation of it, and never took any proceedings to set it aside—at the time of my bankruptcy I do not think that my real debts were above 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not owe much as security for my brother, for I paid it by instalments—I owed the Anchor Life Assurance Society 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.: I had paid all but 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I attribute my bankruptcy to having become security—a portion of it was for my brother-in-law, and a portion for a person of the name of Ellis—what I owed at the time of my bankruptcy, as far as my brother-in-law was concerned, was about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and for Ellis about 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—since my bankruptcy I have paid some debts, above 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have paid that to creditors under my bankruptcy—some of them were trade creditors—I state, on my oath, that I have paid about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know what has become of the book in which I entered the payment of the ten guineas—a man whom I had living with me for about nine years, I detected in dishonesty, and discharged—I told him to leave every document and paper he had got concerning my business, and when he went away I could not find the book—I have since asked him for the book, and he said he had not got it—that book was always at the stable, and I have never seen it since—I took out a summons for perjury against the Stowells and Garnett before the motion was made for a new trial.</p>

I did the work in it—I do not exactly know whose business it was then—I suppose it was my husband's—he had to account for it, what came in, and what was sold—I do not know who he had to account to, the business was carried on in the public house, and we had a man there from the brewery—the license was sever transferred.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a short-hand-writer. I was pre<lb/>sent at the trial, in the County Court, of Stowell against Kennett, by a Jury—I took notes of it—I have not got them here—I examined this copy with the original notes directly after it was copied from them—it is not my writing—by refreshing my memory by this, I can state what Mr. Stowell swore on that occasion—he was examined as to whether Mr. Kennett had paid him an I O U for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and, as nearly as I recollect, he denied ever having been paid that sum—I remember a question respecting an I O U for ten guineas, and his answer was, that he had not received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mr. Kennett, or on his behalf—I think those were the words, if I recollect right—I recollect his stating that two I O U's were produced, one for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and another for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not think I should know them again—there was something mentioned about 28th Feb. about them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Hoop and Grapes, Broad<lb/>way, Westminster—I know John Stowell—I have been intimate with him four or five years—I have known him a great many years—I became bankrupt in 1850; and owed him the sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and after that time, on 28th Jan., I borrowed 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him, which was to be paid him on 28th Feb.—I was to pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for interest—on 11th Feb. I borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him, for which I was to pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. interest—he had been in the habit of lending money to me—the interest was regulated in many ways—he used to have my horse and chaise, and drive with me, and he used to have gin, ducks, fowls, and cigars—I was in the habit, besides paying him interest, of supplying htm with articles which I had in my house—I stated these circumstances in the County Court, in Oct. 1851, and John Stowell admitted it himself in the County Court—I heard him asked questions as to whether he had not had gin, and articles, I deal in—he said he had had gin, fowls, cigars, and various things—the ques<lb/>tion put was, whether he had received anything else besides money—when he has had these sort of things for money, I would say, "What am I to pay you for this?" and he would say, "I have had the horse and chaise, and I have had the gin, I shall only charge you so much for this"—the interest was generally regulated when money was borrowed—I paid him the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 28th Feb., and the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 18th or 19th March, at the Elephant and Castle—my wife paid him the 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in. our house—Mr. Younger was with me when I paid the ten guineas—I took the money from the stables—I carried on a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> business besides that of a publican, and that was the produce of the stables—I have a desk in the stables, but in the stables I had then, I had a counting house—there was a place for books, which was locked up—the foreman takes the money every night, sometimes I ask him for it once in two or three weeks, and sometimes oftener—I have taken sometimes 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day—I do not known whether Mr. Younger saw me take the money from my wife—I think he was in the room when I took it off the table—my wife counted it—I gave it, to her—I think there was more than I paid Mr. Stowell—I am sure my wife counted it—an entry of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Was made at the time in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a day book which is kept in the house for any payment my wife makes, or anything—these are all payments—here is an entry of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 28th Feb.—that entry was made on the day I paid it—I believe this adding up over leaf was made at the end of the week, but it is not my adding up, it is my wife's—about 6th June, 1850, I quarrelled with Stowell—I had some words with him, and from that time down to Oct. 1851, I did not see him or have any con<lb/>versation with him—he did not, during that period, directly or indirectly apply to me for these two sums—I gave two I O Us for these two sums, but did not get them back from him when I paid him—when I paid him the 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I asked him for the I O U—he put his hand into his</p>

               <p>breast-pocket, and said, "Dear me, I have left my pocket-book behind," or "I have left my pocket-book at home"—when I paid him the other sum I said, "Now, John, you have the two documents to give me"—he said, "Dear me, I forgot it; I will tend them over in a <hi rend="italic">poster</hi>"—he never sent them to me—after I quarrelled, or bad words with him, at the beginning of June, I instructed my solicitor to apply for them; that was shortly after June, 1860—I never received them—he never applied, directly or indirectly, for them till I received the summons in the County Court action—when the sum<lb/>mons was heard the plaintiff was no suited by the Judge—the case was after<lb/>wards tried by a Jury, and a verdict given in my favour—I never got any answer to the application I instructed my attorney to make—Thomas Stowell was examined in the first action; Mr. Garnett was not examined—he was on the second examination—I do not recollect John Stowell being sworn; I was not in Court—I did not hear him examined the second time, nor Garnett—on the second occasion all the witnesses were ordered out of Court—I heard Thomas and John Stowell examined on the first occasion—Garnett was not found then—I should think a month or six weeks elapsed before he was appre<lb/>hended—I was not present at his apprehension; I saw him after he was apprehended—I was sent for, and rode with him in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the police-court with the policeman—I said to him, "I never saw you before I saw you at the trial"—he said, "I am aware you did not"—I asked him if he had been a witness for Thomas Stowell before—he said, "Yes," and said he would tell all in the morning; that he had been drawn into it, through poverty, by the Stowells—he said the last time he had been a witness he put his name to several bills of indictment (I think he said four) against brothel-keepers, and one was against a man of the name of Lewis, or Levi, in Exeter-street, and that Stowell told him to put his name to it, it was no matter, and he went before the Grand Jury, I think he said at Middlesex, and then he ran away—I think that was all he said—Thomas Stowell did not call on me after the end of 1850, or at any time, and ask me for payment of the I O U's—after these indictments were found, he was out of the way from Jan., in this year, and I had to offer a reward of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his apprehension—he was appre<lb/>hended by a man named Richard, or Richards—I found a man who I gave 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to tell me where he was, and he was apprehended through my instrumentality—there is no entry of the payment of the ten guineas in this book—we never enter any money in the book, except it is paid for the house—if you look at part of that book, you will find a part of the money I took home from the stables to the house—my wife enters it in the book, and money she takes she books against me—this book contains nothing but the payments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you say your wife gave you credit in this book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not a very good scholar; I will show you (<hi rend="italic">looking at the book</hi>)—if you look over leaf you will find the payments for wages—the book is begun two ways; you will see it on the back leaf, at the top of the leaf; it is "Cash—cash," and if you turn over you will see where my wife has paid the coachman and the ostlers—we have only latterly kept the account of the stable in this book—if my wife takes anything for me, she keeps the account there against me—the account for the stable is in this book for Feb. and March, 1850—that it since we have had a new man—this account, March, 1850, is when my wife has paid the wages on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understood you to say, in the early part of your examination, that you made no entries in this book of what you paid at the stable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; this was paid at the house—it is entered in this book—this is where it was paid from—all moneys paid by me or my wife were entered in that book—if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185204050136"/>
               <p>it is for the use of the stable, it is entered in this book, all money for the use of the stable, be it for what purpose it may—I was incorrect in saying no payments for the stable were entered in it—what I mean is, that all moneys which my wife pays, are entered in that book, for whatever purpose it may be—if I pay money, or my men pay money in the stable, we have a book there for the purpose of putting it in, or else when we count up our takings and expenditure for the week my wife could not do it, unless she could show me where the money was gone.</p>

               <p>pended for nine months for bad book keeping, and then I got a third class one—during the whole of the nine months, I was carrying on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> business in my sister's name, for her—it was during the nine months that I borrowed all these sums—my wife carried on the public house business, for the benefit of the estate till the thing was settled—I was examined yesterday, and swore distinctly that I had paid back both these sums, the one at my own house and the other at the Elephant and Castle—this book was produced—I did not hear myself charged with perjury, and with having falsified this book—I heard you called me a swindler, but you had no proof of it—I was out of Court when you addressed the Jury yesterday—I did not hear what his Lord<lb/>ship put to the Jury—this book was produced, and I swore, as I have done to-day, that these entries were made at the time—I know that after swearing all that, the Jury acquitted John Stowell—I cannot help that—I know that Mr. Stowell and Mr. Davis, his attorney, have over and over again offered to me to compromise and not go on with it, and John Stowell came to my soli<lb/>citor and offered him 580<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. not to go on with it—I was not present—I and Mr. Preston did not make any arrangement about Garnett—I did not give him any instructions to go into the gaol to see Garnett; I know that he did go into the gaol and see him—I only know of once—I do not know what busi<lb/>ness he had in the gaol with Garnett, the person he was prosecuting—I have never asked—on my oath, it was not on my own suggestion and promise that Garnett pleaded "Guilty"—I directed Mr. Preston to make no offers to him; I mean to say, I held out no inducement to Garnett—I sent him no presents into Newgate, nor do I know of Mr. Preston sending him any presents into Newgate—what Mr. Preston went into Newgate for I do not know; he has not told me—I mean to say he told me he had seen Garnett in Newgate, and I did not ask him what he went for—I have not seen him since, except in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and at the police court—I had no communication with him there—there used to be a benefit society at my house—I held the cash and gave security for it—the box was never lost, nor the cash, or any part of it, while I had charge of it—the same society is not at my house now—I never had any accusation of the kind ever hinted against me—I have got a society at my house, which has been there these ten years, and I hold their money without any security—this book is partly in my wife's writing and part in mine; some of this page is mine and some is my wife's—I account for this great <hi rend="italic">splotch</hi> of ink by one of my little boys getting the book one day when it was lying on the table.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I was present at a payment of some money which took place between the defendant and my husband on 28th Feb., 1850—John Stowell came to our house about I in the day, and had dinner with us; after dinner Mr. Kennett told me to get the money—I went to the bar, fetched the money, and paid him 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I counted it out on the table; 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in silver; I cannot speak to the exact amount, and the rest in gold—he made the remark, "Dear me, how am I to take this silver? have not you got any change?" and I lent him a chamois leather bag which I made myself—he put the money into it, and put it into his pocket—I asked him for the I O U, and he said he had left it at home in his pocket-book, and he would send it over—this entry on Mary Ann's account, on 6th June, 1850, is mine, and I paid it on that days it was the last day Mr. Stowell was at our house, about 11 in the morning.</p>

I think it was a week afterwards—he was remanded for a week—this statement was produced before the Magistrate, and Mr. A'Beckett would not receive it as evidence; I do not know why—it was produced before him—I think Mr. Preston, the solicitor, produced it—I believe it was given, back to him—I was not there when the depositions were taken.</p>

On Sunday evening, 1st Feb., about 7 o'clock, I saw the prisoner at Wandsworth, coming in a direction from Mr. Hahn's premises—when he saw me he crossed to the other side of the road, and stopped a minute—I went towards him, and he set off running as hard as he could, and I lost sight of him—I noticed he had something bulky in his pockets—I saw him in about five minutes after, standing against the Roman Catholic chapel door, with seven or eight other lads—I knew his person, and am certain he is the lad—I went, caught hold of him, and asked him what made him run back when he saw me—he said he never saw me, and he did not run back—I asked what he had got about him—he said, "Nothing"—I saw he had something, felt round his jacket, and in the inside pocket found this plane, three chisels, and a brad-awl—he said they were his—I took him to the station, he resisted all the way, and in the scuffle I lost one of the chisels.</p>
