               <p>I am a purveyor of scales and weights to his Majesty, I live in Butcher-row, Temple-bar, I am brother to the prisoner and likewise Elizabeth Smith, I thought it fit to convince her of her error, but not to punish her too far for making a report about me, I served her with a Marshal's Court writ as soon as the trial was over, there she said she would be damned, or words to that effect, if she would not hang him, this was on a Friday, and she cried about John, my mother said he had been terribly injured; I went down to the witness Smith, and told her it was very hard she did not go to see her mother when she was dying, she said there had been a great deal of confusion in the family, but she said positively at that time she had them from my mother; as they said he would not be tried to-day, a young man at Newgate door told me so, I applied and asked Mr. Pitt if he could let me in, he knew they would not let me in, so that I could not know from the prisoner when his trial would come on exactly.</p>
               <p>Clerk of Arraigns. The prisoner had particular notice he would be tried at nine o'clock this morning.</p>
               <p>Court. The evidence does not support the charge of stealing them in the dwelling-house, if he did steal them at all he stole them from his own cart; if the prisoner did take them from the cart, instead of carrying them to the place where he was directed, that is a sufficient stealing in point of law to constitute a felony; they were delivered to him to carry to a particular place, if he took them out of his cart with intent to steal and convert them to his own use, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100006"/> is a felony, but there is no pretence to say they were stolen in the dwelling-house.</p>

            . I am a recruiting serjeant, I was at Birmingham when this happened, on the Sunday after I came to town Mrs. Batster was apprehended, they searched but not properly, I believe they were Denmore, Catchpole, and Seasons, I was not present when the others were taken, I was present when they found the petticoat upon Rawlins. Mrs. Batster desired, last Thursday was three weeks, to be admitted an evidence, she asked me if she could be admitted an evidence; a considerable time after Batster was taken I had been down to Birmingham and up again, in that interim of time, it might be three weeks after she was taken up, I told her I would do all I could in my power to save her, but not to send me upon a foolish errand before an alderman of the city of London, without she could bring good grounds for being an evidence. I went to her next day, in Wood-street Compter, and found she was in the same story, and she desired me to go and make application, which I did upon the examination day, she called me again, and said, do you know your wife's clothes,</p>
               <p>I said I do not, if they were my own I should know them, she said do you go to the Poultry Compter, and you will find her petticoat. She was examined when the the officer came, and my wife found her petticoat upon Rawlins's back, according to the directions of Mrs. Batster; out of decency I went into another room; the officer has the petticoat here; I desired my wife to pull off one of her three petticoats she had on, that the officer might have the petticoat to keep.</p>

               <p>Court. Has that prisoner that goes by the name of Moreing been in custody at Clerkenwell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was he in that goal? - I cannot say; I have known him these three years before he was committed, he has a brother and a sister, and neither of them can speak or hear; I am a servant to the keeper of Clerkenwell, I have seen him backwards and forwards, his father and mother are not living.</p>
               <p>What parish do these people belong to? - They have lived some time in St. Ann's, Soho.</p>
               <p>You have known the man these three years? - Thereabouts, here is a person knows him better than I:</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he is deaf or dumb? - Yes; I have never heard him speak any farther than making a noise, I really believe him to be deaf and dumb.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this evidence appears to be sufficient to satisfy us, we have no reason to suspect the contrary, but that this man is really deaf and dumb, you will judge of it and find your verdict, whether he is deaf and dumb by the visitation of God, or stands mute wilfully and out of obstinacy.</p>
               <p>Jury. We find him deaf and dumb by the visitation of God.</p>
               <p>Court. Let him be taken from the bar, we will not try him; I shall represent his case, and he will be properly disposed of by his Majesty.</p>
               <p>The court then proceeded in the trial of

               <p>When I went down in the morning the little girl got out to let me into the kitchen, there is a bolt about the middle of the door, which opens from the stairs into the kitchen, she jumped out of bed and let me in, said I, how could you sleep so long and not open my house before, Lord, madam, says she, Jemima, is not here, says I where can she be, says she I don't know, here is her stays, stockings and shoes; here I thought she must have gone up stairs; says she, lord, ma'am, I never was so frightened in my life; I found the shutters opened, and the sash raised up, so I suspected she was gone, I looked about, and I missed my watch which hung by their bed side, I looked about the kitchen, and missed four gowns, and several other things that lay in a great basket ready for the washing; I went for Mr. Hill, and told him I was robbed, he spoke to the little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100013"/> girl, she said she knew nothing about it, at last she did say, she saw her go out of the window, and saw her pack up the things, and that she was gone down in the country.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I told her we would not do any thing to her, if she would tell the truth, if I got my things it was all I wished for.</p>
               <p>Have you seen the things found in the indictment?</p>
               <p>- FARREN sworn.</p>
               <p>I went down with Mr. Hill and found the things at the place, and I found the etwee in her pocket, the stays upon her, and other things up stairs in a box.</p>
               <p>(Mrs. Hill is desired to speak to the things in the bundle.)</p>
               <p>This bed gown I know, I had it on the very day before, this bed-gown she had on her is mine, I cut it out, and made myself another gown she said was her's; said she bought two gowns at an auction, she knew they were her's, this old cloak I know to be mine, these shoes too.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. She acknowledged having taken one watch, that the mother was gone out to sell it; it was a woman's watch, with a shagreen case; no promises were made her to confess; 15 guineas were gone.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hill deposed she could not be certain they took the fifteen guineas, as her keys were left in her drawers; the stays, and all the things together are worth 5 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. I cannot tell the value of the watch; the watch must be worth a guinea, it had a gold dial plate on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. Here were three of these rings on, they have taken them off, and put a seal and key on, to make it appear like a man's watch.</p>

               <p>All I have to say is, I did not live there as a servant at first; they keep a house of ill fame, I went in the house and catched the small-pox, and was in the hospital ten weeks, my mistress desired me to go into men's company; I did; I did not receive any wages; I have no witnesses; I have no friends in London.</p>

            . The 28th of last month I met with Mr. Burn, a servant under my master, I went with him to Goswel-street, with a cart that belongs to Mr. Preston, we set our cart at the place called the gulley-hole at Mr. Ratcliff's, we stopped at the bell ale-house a little below; we left our cart while Burn went in for money, while we were in the house they took the cart and horses away, Collier and Birch came out together, after we had weighed our rags, the prisoners joined us at the ale-house, we went out all together, Burn said let one go one way, the other the other, to see if we can find our cart and horses that are lost, accordingly Mr. Burn went off, I know the prisoner very well, I have drank with them, Burn knew them as well as I did; we went to look for the cart and horses, they crossed the street, to the hat opposite Charter-house-wall, there stood this dray, the fore horse was on one side and hooked upon one side, Collier went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100016"/> and unhooked the horse and rode him to Clerkenwell-Green, Collier got off and Birch got on, there were none but Birch and him, I followed, then Burn went to look for the horse and cart.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>He turned another way from us, as soon as he came out of the house Collier unloosed the fore horse of that dray, got upon him and rode him to Clerkenwell-Green, I might be nine or ten yards from the dray when he took the horse off, at Clerkenwell-Green, when I came there Collier got off and told Birch to get on, he did and rode down Turnmill-street, they came back again and found our cart, and they tied on the horse to the tail of the cart.</p>
               <p>Did not you go and offer this horse for sale? - No, they stopped much about the pitch of the hill, on Clerkenwell-Green, I don't know that they went to any house there, Collier got off there and Birch got on, they went down Turnmill-street, they stopped on coming back, when they found our two horses and the cart, they tied this horse to the tail; and they drove it to Mr. Paris's house, what they said I don't know; his house is in Ray-street, Clerkenwell, they might stay there three or four minutes, it was only Birch and Collier, when they had left Paris, they tied the horse on and drove the cart to Bloomsbury, Burn came to us, I said they would get themselves into trouble and advised them to untie it, they did, Paris and some more men came up, and Collier ran away.</p>
               <p>You saw them take this horse and tye it to the cart and carry it to Paris, what did you think they meant to do with him? - I cannot tell, no good I thought, I don't know whether they took him to sell or no, I was afraid to stop them when they took it; I had not the sense or wit to tell any body about it. I only watch'd them, I advised them to take it to an Inn and the right owner might have it the next morning, I walked after them, Collier was at Clerkenwell-green sometime before I got to them.</p>

               <p>Those two men were with them? - Two at the door and two at a distance, and a little farther off; I asked the price, they asked 35 s. I said I don't like it, and I will not have it at all, he halloed to one of the others to know what he would take, there were two at the door and two more appeared to be in company, I did not think I was safe in stopping them.</p>
               <p>They appeared to be all of the same company? - I understood so.</p>
               <p>About five or six minutes before we stopped the cart, for me to take the horse away, they all four stopped, I went to the watchman who denied lending us a hand, after I looked round the horse, I did not like him, and I went in again, I was not out two minutes, I then determined to follow them, and went out again directly. They were never out of my sight, I first saw the four together in Ray-street, about a hundred yards from my house, they went all together, the four men went all together up the hill with the cart.</p>
               <p>(Denmore called again.)</p>
               <p>Where did you stop them? - I ran as far as Theobald's Row, when I saw them together sometime, when we got up beyond Bloomsbury I told Paris to stop them, he said he would not till they got home; I crossed over, and then there were four or five talking together.</p>
               <p>When did you first see more than three men? - I did not see three men till I came to Bloomsbury; I only saw two when I saw Mr. Paris first, I believe there was one walked behind Paris, when they came opposite Bloomsbury they cast up and they all met together, and stood talking, and I went to the watchman, and I said the horse was stole, for they came to offer it to sale, the watchman said they did not affront him and he would have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>To Paris. Was it before or after Dinmore joined you, you saw four men together with the cart? - Before.</p>

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>There was very little doubt they had been at work, their hands were very black, there is a great deal of grease employed in the work.</p>
               <p>From Morris. He tells you there were two candlesticks standing by the large press? - There were two candles burning, I did not say candlesticks.</p>
               <p>Were my hands black and greasy as if I had been at work? - They were.</p>
               <p>From Norton. Whether I had my coat on?</p>
               <p>Court. He has sworn you had it on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carpmeal deposed he went to the house, and found the door and opened it, and saw the same persons, in the same situation as the former witness described, and added, (the press was produced in court) their hands were dirty, there were two presses, a large cutting out press, a die fixed, and a halfpenny between the dies, there was a bushel of halfpence and a bushel of blanks, here is the halfpenny I took from between the dies, two gentlemen marked it.</p>

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>It was a very trifling time after the robbery when I got to the watchman, I saw one of them coming through the posts soon after, and I said this is one of them.</p>
               <p>Which of the prisoners was it? - The one in the green coat, Hutton, he was just coming out of the gate, I said here is one of them, and the watchman took hold of him, Bailey was close behind him, and the other watchman said, there is the other, he run a few yards, about ten, the watchman after him, I jumped over the post at the time, and said, knock him down, I and one of the watchmen pursued him, he went a few yards; he stopped, the watchman took hold of him and I assisted; I had never seen either of these men before, I walked very fast, I suppose it was not ten minutes past eight, it was not moon-light, neither was it dark, I had perfect light enough to distinguish any person, likewise gold from silver, if I took it out; I suppose they might be with me a minute before they blinded my eyes, I never had my eye from the man with his hair lashing about his shoulders, they are in the same dress, I am as clear of them as can be; the other man never came near me, I never was so certain of any thing in my life as Hutton with his striped waistcoat, the watchman had hold of Bailey in the road when he dropped my stick, a few yards from where I took him; I did not see him drop it, the stick is in court, I said, the stick if it is mine has a notch in it, a yard from the end, it is a holly stick, I have had it several years, I am a cornet in the horse guards, I could have brought the man that made the notch in the stick; the stick was picked up by the watchman who has had it in his care ever since, we found the book and handkerchief, my handkerchief was white and purple border, marked J. D. after we got out of the gate we got a lanthorn from the quarter master of the light horse, it was just coming through the posts the handkerchief was found.</p>

               <p>From the prisoner Hutton. I should be glad to know how he described us to the watchman before we came up?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent. I gave no description of them; it was within half a minute after I got to the gate they came up, I had not time, I was out of breath much, and could scarce speak, I suppose it is three quarters of a mile from the place, it was so light I could distinguish them very well.</p>
               <p>How long were we out of his sight before we were taken up, as he said before the justice he had stopped two men before he stopped us, and let them go again? - The watchman stopped one man that I spoke of, and I said I believed it was not him.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was it after the robbery before you got up to the gate? - I believe it was about nine o'clock when I got to the gate, I asked the watchman as we come along, to the best of my thinking it had struck nine.</p>
               <p>How long time might be taken up before you got to the gate, and how long after you was robbed? - It was about twenty minutes past eight when I was stopped by them, and some little time after I got over the wall and ran pretty fast, the robbery might be about half an hour before I got up to the gate, they were taken about nine.</p>
               <p>From Hutton. I should be glad to know how he knows my voice?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent. I have no knowledge of their voices, I saw them when they spoke to me, I have no recollection of their voices.</p>
               <p>You did not know them before? - No.</p>
               <p>From Bailey. When we were searched before he left us, whether we had any money or handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent. There was none of my money found upon them, there was one remarkable thing, a Scotoh halfpenny, but that I will not swear to, there was a duplicate or two found upon them.</p>
               <p>From Bailey. Ask him, how long he could suppose the prisoner that robbed him, was going from the place where he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100030"/> robbed, to the place where we were taken?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent. I was twenty minutes going from Kensington church, I walked prodigious fast.</p>
               <p>Court. The people who robbed you, if they had walked quick, might they have got out of Kensington gate before you got to it? - They might.</p>
               <p>There was time enough for them to have got out, if they walked as fast as you did? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I had hold of him by the collar, I said he has just now dropped a stick, the gentleman took it up, and said, this is my stick.</p>
               <p>Did he describe any marks upon the stick? - Yes; he said there was a mark in it about a yard from the bottom, (the stick was then produced in court).</p>
               <p>To Mr. Dent. Is that your stick? - Yes; this is the same stick, they cut the bark at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Hollywell. I asked Mr. Dent to go back, as probably we might find the things lost, we got a candle and lanthorn, and the first thing we found was the book, close by where they were taken, and a few steps farther there lay the handkerchief, here is the book and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent deposed it was his, and marked I. D. said he had the stick almost three years, and that a light horseman wrote his name on the book at the justice's to know it again, the stick was cut to measure a hundred yards, as there had been a race in the Park, it was cut to measure a yard.</p>
               <p>The Jury desired to look at the stick, and one of them measured it by a rule, and said it was a yard from the bottom to the notch.</p>

The day this affair happened I was going to Kensington, I saw this young man in the morning, he went home to dine in the city where he lodged; I promised to meet him in the afternoon, which I did, at the upper end of Bond-street I told him I was going to Kensington to call upon a gentleman for some cloaths; going along Oxford-street we got into Grosvenor gate, and went across, that was about eight o'clock; I heard some people rustling in the grass, two or three, I said here is some people coming, we had better go and see what it is, no, says he, come along, we did, I was stopped coming through the gate, I said, take care what you do; as to running away I had no power to run, it was impossible, they took hold of me; if I had been guilty of any thing of the kind I should not have come that way; I expected a witness here, my attorney was here last night.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Haines deposed she kept the George, in East-Harding street, that she knew Bailey perfectly well to be a very sober young man, that she had known him four months, that he used to work very well at his business, that he was a gold-worker.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Tiley proved the two sheets, one is marked, the other not, I gave them her to put on the bed, I am sure of it, I mangled this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I acknowledge making use of the things, I had not left the apartment, I told her I would put them in the place, I am innocent of the other affair, I had a witness here, a gentleman who keeps his carriage was here to give me a character, but my name was not in the bill, it is all spite and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did this woman ever pawn any sheets and blankets before with you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Which is Davis? - He with the red, I am very positive of him, and I am sure Brewster was there, I was sent for to the Rotation-office, I saw him, and picked him out from all the rest, I did not know he was a prisoner, it was Brewster that was there, Davis was taken about a fortnight ago, I knew him directly, none of the things I lost has been found.</p>
               <p>Brewster. Would you please to look at this commitment, that the woman swore before the justice, she has said, my lord, a great many things more than were last swore at the justice's she did not say there were-any aprons lost.</p>

               <p>(The cloak produced which the child had on, and the witnesses shirt all bloody).</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the persons of either of the prisoners with certainty? - Yes, my lord, Davis was the man that came up to me first, it was moon-light, and I am not insensible of the consequence of what I am speaking, if I was not certain I would not swear it, I am positively certain.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other? - I went to the Rotation-office, the prisoner Brewster was sitting on a box, I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100037"/> there and perfectly challenged him in my mind, to be one of the three, but cannot so positively swear to him, I believe him to be one; none of the property was found.</p>

               <p>I was sitting at home in Holywell-street, in the evening, I heard cry of stop thief, I ran down stairs, and saw a person running on the other side the street, crying out stop thief, I saw Wimckle look frightened and cry stop thief, I caught him, not seeing anybody else, he said he was running after the thieves, I told him as I saw nobody else I should stop him; I should have let him go soon after, but he plunged out of my hands and fell in the kennel, I clapped my knee upon him and then struck him or pushed him, I know not which, there was a person stood by said, well done, sir, says I, why the devil do not you take hold of him, then he assisted me, I do not know him, he lives in our street, I saw the boy, Taylor, soon after, in a few minutes he said, that is the man, we took him to the Watch-house.</p>

               <p>Court. There is no evidence respecting Mills, as to burglary, the law considers it of so high a nature, that if no property is stole, it is still a capital offence, if committed with a felonious intention; here the charge is of a complicated nature, and the general indictment for a burglary, involves in it several lesser charges; it charges the breaking and entering the dwelling-house in the night, and stealing in the house goods of a certain value, so that on that indictment, the verdict of a jury may be found five different ways, you may find them generally guilty, which includes the whole of the offence, the breaking and entering in the night, and stealing the property, or you may find them not guilty of breaking and entering the house, but guilty of stealing in the dwell-house, to the value of forty shillings, or under forty shillings, or you may find them guilty of stealing but not in the dwelling-house, nor of the breaking and entering but of the single felony only, or you may generally acquit them; in this case the first that of the burglary is not supported, because there must be breaking as well as entering; it is clearly held to be law, that if persons get in at an open door, or window, though there is an entering of the house, there is no breaking to constitute the burglary to find them guilty, there must be actual proof that the doors and windows were shut; I think you must clearly acquit both the prisoners of the burglary; if they are guilty of stealing at all, there can be no doubt that it was stolen in the dwelling-house from the circumstance of the case, if you find it forty shillings or upwards it will be capital.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. As I was going home after I had done work, I met an acquaintance, and he asked me to go and do a job, to take a copper out, he thought the funnel must be stopped, I told him I must go back and get my hammer, accordingly I went to get my hammer, and knowing the shutter was but just nailed, it might be the course of a minute or better before I found the hammer, and just as I found it there came a parcel of people hooting and halloing, and a parcel of boys stood on the brick wall, I looked at them some time, after that I came out, and as I was coming on I struck my foot against something which threw the water up; I was at work on the premises, and all our tools were there, I did not think of bringing any body to my character.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Was he at work there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Did you know that this was a capital indictment against you? - No, my lord, I understand nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. It is peculiar almost to the crime of burglary, that though no property at all is taken, yet if the house is broke and entered in the night time, with intention to steal or commit any other felony, in that case it is as much a capital offence as if property was stolen.</p>
               <p>Jury. The witness said he never saw him before that night, and then he said he worked there.</p>
               <p>Holmes. He had been at work, not that I saw him, I know there were bricklayers at work, I believe he was one.</p>

               <p>Describe in what manner he had cut it? - There were six different places, there were three places where the water came out.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this pipe fixed to your house? - It was fixed up with wall hooks, the wall hooks were not out of their place, without one or two, it was pushed off from one on the highest side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never touched any pipe at all.</p>

I went and found it particularly bolted and chained, I sat myself down to work a quarter of an hour and heard the same alarm, I went up stairs and searched the house and found nobody; I presently heard a knock at the door, soon after another, I went and opened it and found nobody, he left the door on the chain, not bolted, the boy came in from his errand, went out again, I chained it at his return; he found a man standing on the stone, he asked the man what he wanted; he said he waited for a young man that was some doors farther off; we soon heard a noise again, went up stairs and found the shop stripped, the private door open, and the drawers open, and I went and fastened the private door and we called the watch, they came and searched the house, there was a scarlet habit missing and other things. I pulled the door to and chained it, it has no lock, there is a place for persons to put in their fingers to open the door, for the family convenience, the prisoner Griffin knew of it, he lived servant there a quarter of a year, it is a private latch, it goes exceedingly hard, the chain is a short chain, that any person may put in their hand, that knows the way of the door, and lift up the chain.</p>

               <p>How near was he? - He turned just so, and hit him just there, (pointing to his stomach and turning round) it must be from his beginning to go round to face him, it must be his intention to fight him again.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday evening last, about six, I was settling my accounts for that day, in Messrs. Boldero's shop, when the prisoner came in and asked me where Smith, Wright, and Gray lived, I told him No. 21, in Lombard-street, he then put his hand on this bag, which was lying on the counter with many bags of gold, and took it off the counter and ran out of the shop, I immediately jumped over the counter as well as I could, and called, stop thief, I pursued, him down Princes-street, he turned into a court which leads to Lothbury, instead of pursuing him in the court, as several were after him there, I ran to catch him as he came out of the court, I presently saw him seized in Lothbury, I did not see him throw down the bag, he had it not when I saw him seized, I found the bag at our shop when I came back, one of the clerks brought it, I staid to collect part of the silver which had fallen in the street, I do not know who brought the bag back; I picked up about seven or eight shillings, I cannot tell, I put it to the remainder, and found when I counted it, six-pence deficient: the sum I had counted it for was 7 l. 17 s. 6 d. when I counted it a second time, it was 7 l. 17 s. I then put a seal on the bag.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any mark on the bag that enables you to know it was the same bag? - I used it every evening these six months.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a common bag? - Not very common, here are some stripes in it which make it very particular.</p>
               <p>(The bag handed up.)</p>
               <p>Court. No, it is not a very common one, are you sure it is the bag that was lost off the counter? - Certainly, my Lord, quite sure, no doubt at all; I sealed it immediately after, it has been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday as I came to our house Messrs.

I took him to the compter, he said it was his first fact, and he said he was a waiter at the Antigallican.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I never did any thing of the kind before, and I hope, my lord, and the gentlemen will do the best they can for me, and Mr. Fountain whom I lived with between five and six months, and Mr. Best that is now here, whom I lived with upwards of two years, will speak for me, I have been intrusted with some hundreds, and I may say a thousand or more; I have been out of employment ever since Christmas, and I have a wife and two children at home, and therefore, my being out of employ, and making away with every thing, I did not know of doing the thing half an hour before I did it; at the time I did it I was not in my senses.</p>

               <p>Court to the Jury. I believe in this case you will be eased of the comitting of the fact, for the prisoner is indicted for stealing this lead, generally as the offence of stealing at common law, of any other property, now there is an act made in the reign of his late majesty, which makes the offence of stealing lead when fixed to a dwelling-house, a felony, and the reason of that act of parliament was, that before that time, it was holden, that the taking away the lead, or any other thing fixed to the freehold, was considered not felony, but if the property had been severed, then it became felony in any other case, it was to provide against this mischief, that the act of parliament was made, to indict a more exemplary punishment on such offenders; the indictment now not being upon the statute, nor having pursued the words of the statute, you cannot find him guilty on that, and the evidence does not support the indictment at common law, therefore upon this indictment in point of law, whatever the fact may be, the prisoner must be acquitted.</p>

               <p>On Monday the 11th of March, we were going to spend the evening at Islington, five of us, three went to a house in Featherstone-street, I and Mr. Bull to the Red-Lion, while we staid there, the three men that stopped us came out of the Red-Lion, and walked up towards the Green-gate, we followed them, when they came to the green gate they were under the Shepherd and Shepherdesses wall, we went across the road, they went on, we followed, when we came between the ditches they slackened their pace, and the last of them stopped behind, we all passed him, and one of our party had passed the two first.</p>
               <p>How many were you? - Five together, when he was passed they catched hold of his breast, and said, damn your eyes, where are you going, I went to the man that was attacking him, and caught him fast by the arms, and went into the ditch with him, we tumbled into it; he kept jobbing at Mr. Bull, who said he was wounded, I looked, and saw he had a sort of a dagger in his hand, while they were stopping Mr. Bull, he ordered the man with him to fetch the other back, while I lay in the ditch, this man came and cut me over the back, a hole through my coat and waistcoat, and my hair almost all off my head, my stock-buckle was bent double.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Five of us were going to Islington to spend the evening, we were at the Red-Lion, the corner of Old-street-road, just by the pound, we stood by the house about ten minutes before eight, when we were at the corner of Old-street we saw three men come out of the Red-Lion, when we were by it, I observed to the gentlemen along with me, it looked as if they were going on no good.</p>
               <p>Where is the Green-gate? - It is close by the City-road; Brightwell is at Hicks's-hall getting a bill, he was foremost, they told us we must have separate bills, he passed unmolested at first, he was about five or six yards before Mr. Bull, Mr. Wilkinson next to him, Brightwell was suffered to pass; when Mr. Bull was attacked I went to his assistance, and threw Lake into the ditch, and fell in with him, Mr. Bull jumped into the ditch immediately to assist me, I observed he made short pushes with something in his hand at Mr. Bull, as I had hold of him behind, I could feel his arm jerk, I did not know he had any thing in his hand at that time, Mr. Bull called out he was wounded, then I looked and saw the dagger.</p>
               <p>There were three of these men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was engaged with Burrell? - Yes; he knocked the hanger out of the handle,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100062"/> he has got the hanger or cutlass here, the man who dropped behind was engaged with one of our people; after I perceived the dagger I swung him round and threw him on his face, then the man that was before came back, while I lay at top of him, and cut me over my back, and cut my hair almost all off my head, I was obliged to let him go, and he got over the ditch immediately.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoners, do you know any of them? - Yes; the middle one in black is the man that I had in the ditch, (James Lake) he is the man I threw into the ditch, I cannot swear to either of the others, I had seen these three men come out of the Red-Lion.</p>

               <p>It was pretty dark at this time? - It was pretty dark, Mr. Bull was the first person they spoke to, we fell in side-ways into the ditch.</p>
               <p>I suppose you did not keep your feet, either of you? - Yes; both were on our feet when we got into the ditch, I can safely swear to Lake that he was the man I had in the ditch, nothing more passed than damn you stop, where are you going.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of February last, near eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I was walking up Fleet-street, the prisoner asked me for a bit of tobacco, seeing me take some, I gave him a bit, and we walked together for fifteen or twenty yards, several persons were going before us, there lay a purse between both our feet, seemingly a silk purse, he picked up the purse, I cried halves, he then said, if I would go to the next public-house he would give me half, he turned round by <placeName id="t17820410-49-crimeloc265">St. Dunstan's</placeName>

               <p>Alderman Hart.

            , the fruiterer, in Covent-garden, who told me the man would bring me in for Compound Felony; we went to Bow-street, and the prisoner was committed, I have the ring and direction, it is in my possession, Guest had it three weeks.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know this ring is the same? - I look on it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Can you swear positively it is the same? - No, my lord, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is counsellor Fielding in court, I was told that the bill was thrown out.</p>

               <p>You cried halves at first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know you had no right to it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Then you knew somebody else had a right to it, you thought it was lost by somebody? - I knew it was not the man's property.</p>
               <p>It was a third person's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>With what conscience would you think of defrauding the man of it? - I did not know who it did belong to.</p>
               <p>But you might have advertised it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you were both rogues alike, you both agreed to cheat a third person? - Beging your pardon I had no such meaning.</p>
               <p>Then you would have proposed advertising it? - I did.</p>
               <p>You did not say any thing? - I did.</p>
               <p>The ring you had worth two hundred and forty pounds is not here, is it? - I imagine I had no such ring.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is a ring, but he cannot posively swear it is the same.</p>
               <p>The ring you gave to Guest might have perhaps been worth two hundred and forty pounds, you have not sold that ring now and put the money in your pocket? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>That is well, you advanced five guineas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You expected to have had some more money, and you was to have given up the ring? - Every man has a right to have something for picking a thing up.</p>
               <p>I think not? - What is he to put it down in the street again?</p>
               <p>No, he should seek for the owner? - I never heard any man say so before.</p>
               <p>You should have said, let us lodge it in some banker's hands? - I wanted to go to the jeweller's.</p>
               <p>Why they persuaded you out of your christian name almost? - Certainly, sir.</p>
               <p>You are sure you did not defraud the man out of some money? - Yes, sir.</p>
               <p>You defrauded him out of the ring, worth two hundred and forty pounds? - I wish it had been worth that.</p>
               <p>If it had you would not have met him any more I suppose, it is a long way from St. Dunstan's church to the Borough, you did not go to any jeweller's for fear they should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100065"/> own it perhaps, and the receipt shewed it belonged to a jeweller? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor enquired whether they had lost a ring? - No; they kept the receipt.</p>
               <p>What name was it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You can read? - Aye; but very indifferently.</p>
               <p>Could not you read where the man lived who sold it? - I did not take any particular remarks.</p>
               <p>Was it a receipt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A receipt of whose, of Morrison of Cheapside perhaps, you took care not to see the man's name? - I saw it but do not remember.</p>
               <p>You know you could have enquired at any jeweller or silversmith's shop? - Most of these people that go upon this footing, persuade people out of their reason, I was persuaded.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A gardener.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At Isleworth.</p>
               <p>That is not far from London, you know what tricks are? - I come to London sometimes three times a week, sometime four.</p>
               <p>To Covent-garden market? - To Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Still better? - I sell my own property.</p>
               <p>And other people's sometimes? - Not without it is to oblige a friend.</p>
               <p>Oh, to oblige a friend you would sell other peoples property sometimes, you have been in this way of life some years? - Forty years and upwards.</p>
               <p>Aye, and coming to Newgate-market three or four times a week, and yet never met with such a thing before? - He was a clever looking man.</p>
               <p>Why, you are a clever looking man? - I am not half so handsome as he was, to look at.</p>
               <p>If he had brought the money you would have returned the ring? - Certainly, sir.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Mr. Child's, and enquire about that head clerk? - I sent.</p>

               <p>Are you wise enough to know it? - It was a dark room, and I could not distinguish what it was till I had had it and looked at it; when I came into the Borough I certainly did consent to take the money at first, till a friend told me I was in the wrong.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say, they told me there was no bill found, my friends were waiting yesterday.</p>

             I suppose; I hit him on the side of the head with a stick I had in my hand, on which he instantly got out of the ditch and hegan to cut away at me; I kept off his cutlass with the stick some time, at last he cut me through the hat, (he shewed his hat with a cut in it about two inches long). I knocked the cutlass out of his hand, I thought I had broke it, he ran away; immediately after we found this in the ditch (producing the blade of a cutlass with a handle.)</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>How do you know it to be Harris? - I am sure of it, he passed me afterwards, he cut at me several times, and I saw his face perfectly clear, I am very sure he is the man that cut at me; he was one that staid behind, and I being the hindermost man of our company I looked at him and saw him and saw him very plain, I looked at him while I was engaging him; it is natural for a person when engaged in single stick to look at the man full, to look steady in his face to see his eyes.</p>
               <p>Have you any knowledge in single stick? - A little I have.</p>
               <p>Was it-light enough to see his face? - Yes; I have no doubt about his face.</p>
               <p>Have you nothing to say about the others? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Mr. MYLES sworn.</p>
               <p>There were three men you met? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One of them laid hold of Mr. Bull, I understand, and you attacked him? - Yes; I throw'd him into the ditch.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Burrell. Did you hear any thing said by any body? - No.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Myles. What did you hear said by any of them? - When Lake catched hold of Bull, he said, blast your eyes, or damn your eyes, stop; where are you going? Immediately I pushed at him, catched him round the arms and went into the ditch with him; he spoke to a man along side of him, and said, damn him fetch him back.</p>

               <p>Did you see any weapons? - When in the ditch I saw this dagger, as I looked on it to be.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing to say against Lee? - No; I cannot swear to him, I believe nobody can swear positively to Lee.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was the foremost, we were going from Bunhill-row on the 11th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I perceived three men behind me, I endeavoured to overtake them but could not, they walked very fast, about forty or fifty yards; when I came to Gray's farm, I found I was pretty near them, there was a path with two ditches, one on each side, when I got there I overtook one, two were on my left hand and one on my right, I saw the vacancy to go between, and I said, come along, to the rest of my friends, I had got a few yards a-head when the man came and seized hold of my collar, holding a cutlass up, and pointing it towards me; he said, blast your eyes you bloody bougre, where are you going? he had hold of me a few minutes, during which time I heard one of my friends say, damn me, I have done for one of them, for I have broke his cutlass; I thought he had an intent to let me go, by moving me from the spot where I was, I took hold of his hand and forced it from my collar, then he left me to go back to the other, I kept the path, and when I got up to the place where they had been engaging, I saw two men on the bank, who ran away.</p>
               <p>Do you know who the man was that had hold of you? - I believe him to be the stoutest man there, Lee.</p>
               <p>Had he any weapon? - He had a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>What is your reason for believing him to him to be the man? - I have not the least knowledge of his face, I cannot say to his face, I think by his size, he appeared to have a brown coat on, buttoned up, I saw him on the Friday following at the Rotation-office, I think he wore the same dress with the man that attacked me, I do not know his voice.</p>
               <p>Does that shake your opinion as to his being the man? - No, it does not, I still believe him to be the man, I thought he made use of another voice when he stopped me first, and a different one before the justice.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a shagreen case maker, springer and liner in the watch branch, we were five of us going to the Red-Lion, Islington, we meant to make a party to oblige a friend, and we met at the Blue Anchor, Bunhill-row, I never knew either of these men before.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Burrell. At what distance could you discern the face of the man that attacked you? - I was as close to him as any man that was engaging.</p>
               <p>Was it not rather dark? - Rather dark, not very dark, there were some stars out, Harris wore a flapped hat, not a round hat.</p>
               <p>Do you know that it is usual for sailors to carry cutlasses? - I do not know that he, was a sailor, I know he had a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Harris was called on his defence, and said, I have nothing at all to say.</p>

             was driving a cart with three horses; that the prisoner was driving Lord Verney's coach, that he drove the horses against him, and threw the man down; and the indictment states that it forced the cart over him, and so gave him a mortal wound; the sustance of the charge is, that Lord Verney's coachman threw the man down under the wheel, and must hove done it on purpose; but from the evidence there is no foundation to suppose that he drove the cart over him, from the situation he was in; - we may pretty well collect the substance of this indictment, badly as it is penned. It is a charge against the prisoner of having either wilfully driven his horses against the man, with a design to throw him down, and so endanger his life, by falling under his own cart; or it is at least, a charge of having driven his own coach so negligently and carlessly, as by that carelessness and negligence to expose the driver of the cart to be thrown down and killed; in one case it will be murder, in the other manslaughter. If a man seeing a carman in a situation standing by the side of his horses, the cart going on and not liable to be thrown down by his own horses, if he will drive his coach upon him maliciously to throw him down, the necessary consequences of which would be to expose him to meet with such an unhappy accident as this, he would be guilty of murder for so doing; but if he did not do it wilfully, and on purpose to do mischief, he could not be guilty of the murder.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>He said, that as he was coming down the street a gentle pace, and had got to the bottom of the street, the carman turned in, that he necessarily described a circle, and brought in his horses on that side he was obliged to bring his horses, which was the wrong side for him to have come down, that he stopped his carriage, that the man ran forward, probably to lay hold of his horse, to take care the cart was brought up, so as to let his lordship's carriage pass, in doing which, his foot slipped and he tumbled, that his carriage did not touch the man at all, but in running to lay hold of his own horse he tumbled.</p>
               <p>Lord VERNEY sworn.</p>
               <p>Deposed, that he was coming gently down Bennett-street, which was his general practice to go gently, that he never suffered his coachman to drive fast, that whenever the coachman attempted to do it he stopped him, that the carriage stood still when a very heavy laden cart was coming into the street, which he could not pass, till the cart had come forward enough to let his carriage come into the street; that he was looking to see what it was which occasioned the carman stopping, that he saw the carman running, rather staggering, as if he had slipped, that it did not occur to him, either of his horses could have touched the man, that it was a young horse on that side, but that he never moved, that the man staggered in that manner, that the horses were coming up on his lordship's carriage, that the man fell down just opposite to his chariot door, directly under the cart wheel, that the cart passed on, and there was nobody there to prevent it, it was so sudden a thing it could not be stopped, that he sent for an apothecary, but the man was dead, that in his apprehension the coachman was not in the least to blame, that it was a meer accident from the carman's turning in when he had got so near the end of the street, and it was the effect of the carman running to lay hold of his horses, that caused him to slip and fall; that he could not take upon him to swear positively his horse did not touch the man, as he could not see the horse's head, that his chariot has a box to it; the whole line of the horse he could see, but he saw nothing of the horse touching the carman, that the prisoner has been his servant a great number of years, that he was bred up in his family, that he never had any complaint against him, he is a very careful driver, and a very good servant, and very unlikely to be neglectful where danger might happen in consequence.</p>

               <p>Upon the 31st of March, last Sunday week, there had been an information given to the office, of five footpads robbing about Pancras, we were ordered out, seven of us, we went to the George, at Pancrass, we went there about eight o'clock, we asked the woman for a candle and lanthorn to go and search the workhouse, we went with a candle and lanthorn to search the old workhouse, we were told they used to harbour there; we had not been long come out of that before we met the five footpads, all together, five of them, the first I laid hold of was Clark.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - This might be near nine o'clock, if not quite.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was it? - Between the George and Pancras workhouse, I laid hold of Clark immediately, one of our people said, there were seven of us, they are all here together; Clark immediately drawed his hanger upon me, and M'Manus came up to my assistance; says he, you bloody thief you, if he had not come up directly, I would have cut your head off; we secured him, he dropped his hanger immediately, the others ran away, our people took him home as fast as they could, I went to Mr. Hemmings's, of Cold-bath fields, as we heard one lodged there I told him we had been attacked by five, and four had got away out of the five, I think if all our people had come up we should have got most of them; Clark made use of a very particular expression, says he to them I saw the light in the old workhouse, and I said it was the traps, (meaning the thief-takers) one made answer, no, it can't be the traps, it must be the old woman that used to lay there.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examinations.</p>
               <p>Did they say it to one another? - No; he said it to me, that they had said, it must be the traps, and that he said, no, it cannot, it must be the old woman that lies there.</p>

               <p>This was a little before nine o'clock? - It might be thereabouts, we did not go out till after eight o'clock from the George.</p>
               <p>What did you do with Clark? - We brought him immediately to Bow-street.</p>

When I got hold of Clark, says I to Jealous, run after that tall fellow, he is a soldier I am sure, you can run faster than I; he came back a little after and said they had got into the fields; then we went down with Clark to the George, we washed his head which was bloody, we got him to town, when we came to town the watchman was going ten o'clock.</p>

What became of you after Clark was taken? - We took him into the George and stopped there a few minutes, and then brought him to town; Mr. M'Manus and some other officers went to the watchhouse, and we went to Hemmings's, I looked upon it near half an hour before we got to Hemmings, we got there a little before ten, or within a few minutes, as soon as we left Hemmings the watch was crying ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>How far is it from the place where you took Clark to Hemmings's? - It is no great way, Mr. Hemmings's is in Cold-bath-fields, and this is a little beyond the Adam and Eve, at Pancrass, it is not above ten minutes walk, but we stopped some time to look in the ditch for the cutlasses, where they got over, and that detained us.</p>
               <p>Mr. M'Manus was asked what time he got to Bow-street with the prisoner? - He said as they passed by Red-Lion-Square, the watchman was going ten, that he stopped some considerable time at the public-house where he carried Clark.</p>

               <p>I went up to Middle-Row, Holborn, the narrow way of Holborn, and was coming home again, I went to ease myself at this place they said they saw me come out of, and was coming across the way, I had my hat in my hand, and they laid hold of me and took those things I call my property from me; that watch is mine, I have had the dollars three months, I bought the watch of my brother, and gave him two guineas and a crown for it, there was no body else with me, I never saw this man at all, there was a dollar, two half crowns, two new shillings, two old ones, a sixpence, and my watch and handkerchief there, upon one side with I. W. upon it.</p>

               <p>I found a bridle, and a sledge hammer, and two empty sacks in the warehouse, where the potatoes were, and the bridle and saddle, and I found the harness in Irish-court. I am a green-grocer, the prisoner at the bar came to me on the 20th of March, about half past seven and lifted up the latch of my door, and asked me if I wanted to buy a lot of potatoes, I live in Woodbridge-street, Clerkenwell, he took me to the bottom of Freeman's-lane, beyond London bridge, and they were in this warehouse, nine sacks full and two empty, he told me the price was 16 s. a sack, he then said 15 s. I offered 12 s. and said I would have two, he said it would not do, he came back with me to the bridge, I was going away, he asked for the other shilling, I would not give it, he said I should have them at twelve, I said where can I find you, he said at the Cock in Freeman's-lane; when I came there, with Mr. Delavall, we took the prisoner at the bar, I went to Mr. Dawson, the potatoe-merchant about it, and he told me not to buy them, for a load of potatoes had been stolen out of a man's yard.</p>

               <p>Concerning what that woman has been saying, I can prove an alibi; whereas as to the potatoes, the man came to me on the Monday evening, I have been in the potatoes business, I have laid scores of pounds out with Everingham, whom the sacks belong to; I kept a warehouse in Old-gravel-lane, and was a salesman for farmers six years, and my father for twenty years before that; business being dead, within a twelve-month, I moved; a man came to me on Monday evening with the appearance of a gentleman, and told me he had a quantity of potatoes to dispose of for a debt, and asked if I would buy them, I told him I did not know, where did they lay, he said they were in a warehouse on the other side of the water, would I go look; I said I would go; the next day about two o'clock I went with him to the warehouse, it was not locked, he took about a handful out of the sack and told me they were washed, I said I would not buy them, being washed, as there were so many, I knew they would lose their colour before I could sell them; he said as I had been a salesman for farmers, would I sell them, and he would pay me for my trouble; I told him I would endeavour to do it, I went to this man and informed him such things were in my care, I went to the warehouse, it did not belong to me, I never saw the warehouse in my life before, I offered this man the goods for 15 s. a sack; knowing the goods being washed, and so many, they would change their colour; the man refused to give it, he said it was too much, the goods had changed their colour then already; I told him I would take 12 s. which he agreed to give. He appointed a time to meet me, and that is all I know of the matter.</p>

               <p>I thought you said you let it go? - No; I catched at it as it came out of my fob, after his giving it a severe tug, he let it go, I think he had got it so far, that it was completely out of my pocket when I catched at it, the watch-chain, and every thing was quite out of my pocket, I am quite sure of it, I catched the watch with my hand.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether upon his first examination he did not say, his watch was only half out of his pocket.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. John's, Wapping, a person came past me and said, there was another in great distress, that he had been robbed of his watch and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100085"/> handkerchief, another person came with a message to the same purport, then I went down, and when I came down to Execution-dock there was a croud of people; some cried out, here is the headborough, others, there is no occasion, they have delivered them up to the press-gang; I turned round and said, a press-gang had no business with a thing of this nature, I should take them into custody, and I took them before a justice. As I laid hold of Ford, he damn'd me, and would not go without a coach, I told him he should go, and must go, at last he said he would; I searched him and found a handkerchief on each, and a picklock-key on one of them.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. Did not Baker say the watch was half out of his pocket? - He said it was out of his pocket, so as he catched the watch in his hand, and they had hold of the chain; he said then as he does now, that is, what he said at Sherwood's.</p>

             deposed, that he saw Mr. Marshall have the two prisoners in custody, that he searched the last man and found a key on him; he was present when Baker was first examined, he remembers, he said, that the prisoner had the watch chain in his hand, and he catched the body of the watch in his hand; he said one catched hold of the flap of his coat, and brought him round; that one had hold of his arm, and one catched hold of his watch with the other arm.</p>

               <p>I go about with a jack-ass, I went to a person that keeps a green-stall; and as I was coming back this man stopped me, and said you want to rob me of my watch; I said let me go, he let me go, it was quite day-light, then he came again, and catched hold of me and swore I should go to gaol; this man came up directly, and said, what are you about? he had me on the ground; says he, I will take you to gaol, you are his companion, or confederate, or such thing as that, and I will have you both to gaol. Justice Sherwood asked him if we had any arms about us, he said no; and if they had had me in a bye place they would have murdered me. Says Mr. Sherwood, did not he put you in bodily fear? he said no; Did not you find a knife about them? - No; he said Ford put a long stick down his throat, and that did put him in a little fear, but he was in no other fear. Mr. Sherwood said they have put you in fear, and you must go and file a true bill against them, and get these rascals out of the world.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ford. He said yes and aye to every thing the justice said, and he never asked no questions at all.</p>

               <p>Are you sure these are the same men that took your watch and handkerchief? - I am positive of it, they was not two seconds from me, I turned my head round every minute to see how near they were to me, I had a view of them constantly; I do not know that ever I saw Wapping, at twelve o'clock at night, so free from people in my life; there has been a neglect of bringing a young woman here, whose name we have forgot, she swore to seeing them there.</p>

               <p>That gentleman is a runner, he came to serve a warrant, when he came up I picked up the glass among some dung in a stable, it was standing up against a wall, this young woman and I was going to look for my husband, she had it to a pawnbroker's, and pledged it for three shillings, and we had one shilling a piece out of it, I thought she had sold it out, this man came by at the time, he asked me about the glass, and said, the man was an old neighbour, if I would get him the glass he would get me clear; they got me in liquor, Mr. Sherwood's clerk told me to say keys, I do not know the consequence of saying keys, I had no other key in my pocket than my own, when I came out of the office, he took and beat me very much round my loins; when I came to Newgate, I did not know what it was for, as for the keys we know nothing of them, nor the other things, we had only the bare glass, and that we found among some horse dung, I have no witness about it, but this girl and me were together; that gentleman there took and beat me like a stock-fish, my father and mother are dead, and I have not a creature in the world to speak for me, I have this woman, and this woman to witness, who are my fellow prisoners, to prove that Mr. Sadler was there, he took and gave me a kick, and he had a little rattan like a cane in his hand, and he took and beat me,</p>

               <p>- Aldus, (a pawnbroker) produced a watch, and deposed the prisoner had pawned it with him.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his defence said, that he had the watch left with him by a gentleman, whom he had carried in his coach to pay for his fare, from Bond-street to Whitechapel, because he could not change a guinea, and that he had took his number, and that he had let the gentleman have 16 s. besides; that he told him where he lived, that he did not know what to do to go home without his money to his master; that the gentleman not coming to him directly, he had pawned the watch with Aldus, and intended to let the gentleman go with him, and take it out of pawn when he would call for it and pay him his money again; that he went and asked one Mr. Higgingbotham first to let him have the money to go home with, before he went to pawn the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Higginbotham, deposed, that he knew the prisoner to be an honest man, that the defence he had made in court, was true, so far as respected him; that he had come to him in the morning and asked him to lend him half a guinea on a watch, told him he had been carrying a gentleman, that he wanted to carry home his money to his master; that this was in the morning between four and five; that he did let him have the money and take the watch, that their house is generally up all night, that they supply the Bath, Bristol, and Gosport coaches, coming in and going out, that he redeemed it of him the next day.</p>
               <p>Seven persons were called, who gave him a very good character.</p>
