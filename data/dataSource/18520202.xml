On 31st Dec., about a quarter before 7 o'clock, I was in Cheapside, and saw the prisoner in Bow Churchyard at the dark part, placing something under the left arm of his coat—he then came out into Cheapside, and went towards Leadenhall-street—at that moment I saw Trew, my brother officer—we followed the prisoner into Fenchurch-street—I stopped him in Fenchurch-buildings, and asked him what he had under his coat—he said he was a respectable man and a gentle-man; he produced one of his cards to Trew, and asked by what authority we stopped him—we told him we were police-officers, and were about to produce our authority (I was in plain clothes)—I said I should like to know what it was he had got under his coat—he produced from under his coat this piece of mousseline-de laine—there are thirty-six yards of it; it was not in any paper—he said he had bought it of a Mr. Reed, in Tottenham-court-road—I said, "What is Mr. Reed's address?"—he said he did not know; the fact was, he had sold Mr. Reed two pounds of cigars, at 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound, about ten days previous—he did not say where—he said he had met Mr. Reed in Tottenham-court-Road, and he had not the money to pay him, and had given him this piece of goods to hold until he could pay it—Trew asked him which way he came from Tottenham-court-road—he said he had taken an omnibus at the corner of Tottenham-court-road and rode to the Bank, and from the Bank he walked to where we saw him, Fenchurch-buildings—Trew asked him if he had not been in Bow Churchyard—he said no, he had not been there that night,</p>

               <p>he could take his oath of it—I then said I had seen him there a very short time ago—he then said he had forgotten himself; he got out of the omnibus just by St. Paul's instead of the Bank, with the exception of turning up some court in Cheapside for a necessary purpose—Trew then said, "You had better tell us plainly in what way you did come;" and the prisoner said, "I walked the whole of the distance; I did not ride at all"—I said, "This is a very unsatisfactory account, and I must take you to the station"—I took him to the Bow-lane station, searched him, and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. seventeen duplicates, a latch-key, and a plaid scarf—he said at the station it was a Mr. Reece, and not Mr. Reed, that he had it from—he did not know the address.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Hertfordshire police. On Monday night, 12th Jan., by the directions of my superior officer, I went to the premises of Mr. Kemble, at North Mimms—I concealed myself in the rick-yard, under a shed there—there was a load of clover hay in a cart, ready to go to London, on the top of which was a truss of clover hay—about 20 minutes to 3 o'clock Plummer came—he stood about some little time, looked round him, and afterwards went directly across to the rick-yard—there was a stack of meadow hay there, which I had put a mark into; and when he got over into the rick-yard, he went to the meadow hay, cut a bundle of it, and tied it up—I after<lb/>wards found that bundle tied to the front of the cart, what is called a swinger—I afterwards saw him bring it out of the rick-yard, and lay it down by the side of the cart—I saw him set out about 3 o'clock—I and Ryder followed the cart to the Swan with Two Nicks, Finchley-common—Reynolds is the ostler there—I did not know him before—Plummer drew the horses up in front of the house, and went up the yard—I stood by the cart—he went up the yard, and was gone several minutes—he came back, got on top of the cart, and took a bundle of clover hay off, which he took round the house, to the yard at the back; but I lost sight of him, because I stopped with the cart—after some time, I had a signal from Ryder—I went and assisted in taking the prisoners—I found the swinger tied on the side of the cart, and in it I found my mark (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I was with Bourne—I saw Plummer put some meadow hay on the cart, and about 3 o'clock in the morning he started for Loudon—when he got to the Swan with Two Nicks, at Finchley, he stopped, and went to the stable door—he called out, and Reynolds, the ostler came—they conversed together about five minutes, but I was not near enough to hear what was said—Reynolds then went into the back-yard, and Plummer went back to the load of hay, took part of the truss of clover hay from the top, put it on his head, and carried it about fifty yards into the back-yard, where Reynolds was standing on a short outside step-ladder leading into a loft—Plummer said to Reynolds, "Where will you have it?"—Reynolds</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The examination of the prisoner before Mr. Commissioner Holroyd on 17th Nov., 1851, was here read: he described himself as a general dealer, of No. 9, Minories, and was examined at great length as to the nature of his dealings with the bankrupt, with whom he stated he had been acquainted twelve or fourteen months, and that his dealings with him had not extended to the amount of 1,000</hi>l<hi rend="italic">.; that as he kept no shop, the dealings had generally taken place at Benjamins Coffee-house, in Duke-street, Aldgate, Abraham's Coffee-house, and St. James's Coffee-house in the same place. After stating that he had obtained from Davis various deposit notes for goods pawned by him at Attenborough and Sowerby's, his examination proceeded as follows</hi>:—"I do not remember going with the bank-rupt to a pawnbroker's in Sloane-street, named Lamb, to redeem goods and I say positively I never did go there with the bankrupt, but I did go with the bankrupt about Sept. last, but cannot say what day in particular, to a pawnbroker's of the name of Russell to redeem some goods—the bankrupt requested me to go with him to redeem those goods, assigning as a reason that he did not like to go in and sign his name; I consequently redeemed those goods, and signed my own name on that occasion on the pawnbroker's ticket—I have been to Russell's on more than one occasion, but Davis accompanied me only on one occasion—both times when I went to Russell was about Sept.—they were both the goods deposited by Davis—he told me there was a nice lot of goods which he wished me to redeem, and the bankrupt gave me the money to redeem them with, telling me at the same time that he would sell them to me and agree upon a price—there was but a short time intervening on the two occasions when I visited Russell's—the bankrupt himself had the money with which he redeemed those goods, and I did not advance it for him"—"the bankrupt gave me the money on two successive days"—"I never did, on any occasion, redeem any deposit made by Davis to Mr. Lamb, a pawn<lb/>broker, in Sloane-street, and that I speak positively to"—"I never sold any of Davis's goods to Barnard Phillips, of Castle-street, St. Mary Axe—in my dealings with Davis I always dealt with him in my own name and on my own account, and not as the agent of another, &amp;c." <hi rend="italic">A further examination of the prisoner on 1st Dec, 1851, was also read; after stating that the goods he had redeemed were redeemed with money furnished by the bankrupt, it pro<lb/>ceeded</hi>: "In your former examination you stated you had never, on any occasion, redeemed any deposits made by the bankrupt at Lamb's, a pawn<lb/>broker, in Sloane-street, and to that you spoke positively; was what you then said in that respect true?—It was true; and I never redeemed any goods of the bankrupt at Lamb's. Are you quite certain of what you now say in that respect?—I am quite certain of that. Now, take care what you say; did you not, on or about 8th Oct. last, accompany the bankrupt to, or meet the bankrupt at, Lamb's, in Sloane-street, and then redeem two lots of goods pledged by the bankrupt at Lamb's, one lot for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other lot for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—No, I did not; I never redeemed any lots at Lamb's—I recollect on one occasion meeting the bankrupt near the Exhibition in the evening, and he asked me to accompany him somewhere in that neighbourhood, and I did so, but it was not, to my knowledge, to a pawnbroker's—the bankrupt went in at a private door, and the bankrupt beckoned me in, and I saw the bank<lb/>rupt produce some letter or ticket, and I saw some goods handed out, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202020027"/>
               <p>I helped the bankrupt to count out his money—I then left the room, and the bankrupt on coming out told me he had a fine lot of goods which he proposed to sell me—I cannot say whether that was at Mr. Lamb's house—upon that occasion I did not produce the money, and I did not myself redeem the goods on that occasion—Davis had the goods in a brown paper, and I declined to purchase them as it was night—I took away the goods on that occasion, as Davis said he had no great coat pocket, and I had—on the same night I gave Davis those goods, and told him I would see the goods to-morrow—Davis then went away with the goods and left me—I did on the next day see those goods—I did not buy them, as they were too good for me and too high priced—I cannot recollect whether I purchased any small portion of them or not—I cannot recollect what was about the gross value of those goods"—"I have redeemed some goods at Russell's, in Shoreditch, but I cannot say the date nor the amount, nor whose tickets they where, nor if I received the tickets from the bankrupt—I cannot say if I redeemed any goods whatever at Russell's since 17th Oct. last—I redeemed on two occasions at Russell's goods belonging to the bankrupt, but those I redeemed some time in the summer with money supplied me by the bankrupt for the purpose, and on those occa<lb/>sions I delivered the goods to the bankrupt—I did not, to my recollection, on 23rd Oct. last, redeem goods pledged for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Russell's, in Shoreditch—I did not, to my recollection, on 21st Oct. last, redeem goods pledged for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Russell's, in Shoreditch—the bankrupt did not give me money to redeem the goods at Russell's, which it is supposed I redeemed on 21st and 23rd Oct. last, but I do not recollect that I did redeem any such goods about that time at Russell's—I take out a great quantity of goods which are pledged by other persons all over London, and I cannot recollect one transaction of that kind from the other," &amp;c.</p>

On 24th Oct. last T became a bankrupt—I had carried on business for eight or nine months preceding my bankruptcy as a general dealer—I from time to time obtained goods from Messrs. Holland, and other persons—I think I first bad dealings with Heilbron, in the early part of the year, I had one or two little dealings with him in the early part of the year—I began to have extensive dealings with him about the month of June—between that time and my bankruptcy I received from him, for goods, as near as I can possibly state, about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was not much difference between the value of the silver goods I sold him and what I was to have given for them to the persons from whom I obtained them—in the gold goods there was a considerable difference, I should say nearly one half—I cannot say what proportion of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for gold goods—I should say about a couple of hundred pounds was for silver goods, but I cannot say positively—the rest were gold—I sold them at about half the price that I was charged for them—I did not give any invoice with the goods before Sept.—there had been sales before Sept., beyond 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; some 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., some 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and upwards, and some 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave invoices at the request of Heilbron—he said that the persons he was acting for required invoices—I recollect pledging some goods at Lamb's, a pawnbroker's, in Sloane-street—I received these deposit notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the days on which I pledged the goods—one day was the 5th, and the other the 12th of May—I pawned various kinds of things on those occasions—there were gold chains and watches on the 5th to the amount of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I think I pawned a gold watch and a diamond ring then; and on the 12th, gold watches, gold chains, studs, and several diamond rings, to the amount of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those goods were redeemed, I think, in the early part of Oct.—Heilbron and I went</p>

Holland and Son—I made several purchases of them in Sept.—I recollect that I had some forks and spoons, I do not recollect exactly the number—it was about five dozen fiddle-pattern—I cannot recollect the weight—I sold them to Heilbron—I do not know whether it was the following day after I got them, or the day after—I had a pair of sugar-tongs and a sugar-spoon—I sold one pair of sugar-tongs and spoon to Heilbron, but I had sold a sugar-tong the week previous to another person—I have seen Barnard Phillips, but not to know him personally—shortly before my bank<lb/>ruptcy I did not know how to act or what to do, and Heilbron advised me that the best I could do was to say that <hi rend="italic">Dick, Tom</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> had the goods, and they could not do anything to me, or something to that effect—I cannot exactly say the words.</p>

I know Sole<lb/>man Davis—I have seen him at my house—these four deposit notes (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) are from my shop; one is 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., another 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the goods that they represent were redeemed by Heilbron—the entries are in the handwriting of a shopman who has now left me—I was not present when they were entered; I was when they were redeemed—I can only say from memory when that was—I remember they were all taken away by Heil<lb/>bron—I do not find my signature on either of the deposit notes—I find Heil<lb/>bron's signature on them—I do not know his writing—I was present, but did not see him write it—I saw him, and am quite sure they were received from him—there is nothing on them to show the date when they were redeemed—I can only tell that from the book—besides myself and my servant, my son was present—about a week or a fortnight after the last goods were redeemed, Heilbron came to my shop; I did not know of Soleman Davis's bankruptcy</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202020030"/>
               <p>at that time)—he came in and said there were proceedings being taken against Davis, and would I not say anything about his having redeemed more than two of the deposits—he said, "I know I signed my name to two of the depo<lb/>sits, but not to any more"—I told him I could not speak anything but the truth, I could not do otherwise; if I was asked the question I must speak the truth—I do not think he replied—I said, "I don't know your name, and don't tell it me"—that finished the conversation, and he went out.</p>

               <p>was all that was paid by him—here is a sum paid by Mr. Wood, but that was in the provision line—I know the money has not been paid, by Mr. Gray's name not being entered; but I have further proof; here is a letter, which is in the prisoner's writing—(this letter was dated 17th Jan., and in it the pri<lb/>soner stated that he had received of Mr. Gray 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Give me the account in which Gray's payment ought to have been entered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is the petty-sale book; he hands me the money, and I enter the account—in course of business, Gray's money would not have come in this petty-sale book; there is no possibility of that—the large items come here—here is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. entered; that is cash to myself—I happened to want some money, and I went to him, and got that—he did not come to roe daily and render his account—we have several men working; and at the end of the week, if he had not sufficient cash, he came to me, and I gave him money,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202020034"/>
               <p>and on Monday we settled; but on that Saturday it was his duty to come to me, because we had no men at work—on that Saturday he staid away, and on Tuesday I went and saw him in bed—he did not abscond—he was not absented from my service—I did not allow him anything for commission, only 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he had the care of the workmen, and travelled—there was no sign of his having absconded—I have a letter from him, in which he says he was going out of town, to see if that would do for him what medicine would not do.</p>

I have now three partners; I had then two partners—the prisoner was our collecting clerk in Aug. 1849—I think he had been so about six months—he was paid a weekly salary, and I think a commission beside—it was his duty to collect money from our different customers, and to bring it that night or the next morning to one of the partners with this book, which he was in the habit of taking—he took it from our counting-house every morning to collect, and he either entered the money in this book himself, and had the initials of a partner to it, or if another person wrote it there would be no necessity for the initials—I did not receive 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner on 14th Aug., 1849—here is an entry in Mr. Ward's account of 16th Aug., "By cash, on account, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and some other figures, which I understand to be, "less 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that may be dis<lb/>count, I do not know—this would indicate that the prisoner would only have to pay 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if it had been brought to me I should have taken the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this entry is the prisoner's writing; there are no initials to it—the prisoner ought to have had the initials of one of the partners to it—it would have been his duty to do so for his own security—there is no entry whatever of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. being received from Mr. Snell—here is nothing entered after 27th July except an entry of thirty-one gallons of ale returned; no cash—the prisoner went away on the evening of 16th or the morning of 17th Aug.—he gave no notice of his going—we did not owe hint anything; he had been paid to the previous Saturday—I think he left about the middle of the week—his wages were from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and some portion would have been due to him from the Saturday till the time he left—he did not come to claim any wages—this book came to us by post or by hand, I think on the day after he left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Robert Kalloway Meaden, a wine merchant, who lives in Walbrook; he succeeded Mr. Alexander in the business. About 28th or 29th Nov., the prisoner called at our counting-house—he asked if our gin, rum, and brandy were good—I told him they were—he said he had been in the habit of dealing with Mr. Alexander, and found his articles good—I said we had a large stock of Mr. Alexander's on hand—he said he had paid Mr. Alexander 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two years, and he had sold to some persons, and be should want some samples—he said he wanted two hogshead of gin, two hogsheads of rum, from fifteen to twenty dozen of fine old crusted port, and thirty dozen of champagne—on his making this statement, I let him have three samples of gin, rum, and whisky, in bottles, about half a pint each—when he said he had dealt with Mr. Alexander, I was going to refer to the books to find his name—he said he always paid ready money, and Mr. Alexander never entered his name; I should not find his name in the books—it was what the prisoner had told me, and his representing himself a customer of Mr. Alexander's that induced me to let him have these samples—I afterwards had a communication with Mr. Alexander—the prisoner was to call at 12 o'clock next day to take away fifty gallons of gin with him, and he was to pay in cash—he called at the appointed time—I asked him how much he should want—he said he should not take it that day, he would take it next day, and in the meantime he had made larger sales, and should want larger samples—I told him I had seen Mr. Alexander, and he knew nothing of him—he then said he did not know Mr. Alexander, neither did Mr. Alexander know him, but it was through customers that he had sent him that he had dealt with him—I asked him to mention the name of any one customer—he was not able to do it, but he wished me to let him look at the book, and be would point out several—I refused to show him the book, and he left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of King-street, Cheapside, in partnership with Mr. Ledbury. Early in Nov. I was employed by the defendant's creditors to look into their accounts—I first communicated with the defendants on 5th Nov., and went through their books with their assistance, and that of their clerk; and likewise made the necessary inquiries of them—I attained a certain result, which I mentioned to them—I told them that there appeared to be a deficiency between their debts and assets of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they had been in business about thirteen months—the deficiency bad occurred during that time—they stated their capital to have been, I think, about 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not count that capital in the deficiency—adding that capital would increase the deficiency to 3,230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in speaking of the assets, I speak of the assets which we could find on the premises—they accounted to me for the deficiency by stating that they had had great losses by selling their goods at a sacrifice—I did not find out what had been the loss each month since they had been in business—they gave an account of about l,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of goods that had been pledged with Monastery and Co., and they gave me up seventeen pawn deposit notes, I think amounting to about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which I have given credit in the assets—I think there is a surplus of between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between the amount they were pawned for and what they ultimately fetched.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202020040"/>
               <p>so—I swear that—they stated they had redeemed goods from time to time, but did not give me the amount—I did not look to the books to ascertain the amounts that were redeemed—I never have done so—I had no opportunity—I only had the books for a short time—there were entries in the books of what had been pledged—I do not think there were entries of what had been redeemed—they read from the books on the opposite side of the table, and I wrote it down—it was at a private meeting of creditors—I believe the books did contain to some extent an account of their redeemings—their debts were 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upwards, and their assets 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upwards—I am speaking from memory—I have a memorandum here, made by my clerk—the assets were, I think, 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and consisted of the stock in trade, fixtures, furniture, and a surplus of goods in pledge, a surplus above the amount advanced on them—the amount of the stock was between 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—fixtures and altogether, including some pianofortes, which they had bought on speculation, I believe the amount was about 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have the items here—I ascertained the value of the stock in trade by taking it down with the aid of their own people at the cost price—Ellis and Everington's account in the books appears to be an account of barter of umbrellas and parasols sold to them on the one hand, and on the other of silks bought of them—I cannot tell you the amount of goods purchased by Ellis and Everington—it is spread over a long period—it may probably amount to 1,477<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the books do not show the cost price of those articles—I have not seen in the books that the cost price of those goods was 1,724<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not seen the books since they were declared bankrupts—I am not accountant under the bankruptcy—I do not know whether the books show a loss by the bankrupts in their dealings with Ellis and Everington to the amount of 246<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Pawsons—it was not a meeting of creditors—I am not aware whether the prisoners had sent for Mr. Foot—when I went there Mr. Howell, of the firm of Ellis and Co., Mr. Pawson, Mr. Foot, Woolf,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202020041"/>
               <p>Lyons, and Messrs. Ellis's solicitor, Mr. Parker, were there, and a Mr. Jenkinson, came afterwards—the creditors asked the state of their affairs, and they said they could not tell the particulars, they were insolvent, and the creditors then requested them to execute an assignment and to sign a decla<lb/>ration of insolvency, both of which they did—I have no recollection of any other material fact—there was conversation about the state of their affairs, and that was the result—the bankrupts did not state that the cause of their bankruptcy was the requirement by Foot of security for a contract which he had entered into with them to the amount of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it did not happen when I was present—I do not know that I ever heard of it—I could not have forgotten it if I had—I may say I never heard of it—the assignment and declaration were printed forms, and were filled up in the counting house by Mr. Parker, the solicitor—I do not think that it was arranged that Mr. Jenkinson should write to the creditors generally—I do not know whether he had written before—Mr. Jenkinson was Mr. Foot's solicitor—from Messrs. Pawson's counting house we went to the bankrupt's warehouse, where they gave me up the keys, and I put a person in possession under the deed—I went to the warehouse for that purpose—my assistant went with me, and I there met one of the warehousemen of these wholesale houses, I forget which, standing at the door, I think he was from Ellis and Everington's or Pawson's—I do not know his name, he had been in—the bankrupts did not in my presence, at Messrs. Pawson's or at their own warehouse, ask permission to send for their solicitor—I did not hear any one, either from Ellis's or Pawson's, say that there was no necessity for it, and that they would protect the bank<lb/>rupts—nothing of the sort was said to them in my presence before they executed the declaration and the assignment—they assisted me in examining their books for about a week or ten days, and their clerk also—they rendered roe every assistance in their power, as far as I could form any judgment—I am not aware that they had bought and paid for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of cane in Oct.—they did not tell me so—no doubt there was as much as 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of cane on the premises, but I do not know when it was bought—cane is used in making parasols—I have no doubt there was an invoice of this cane, but I never saw it—I have not looked over the invoices.</p>

HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect to which of the bankrupts you made the application? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To Mr. Lyons; he gave me the information at once—it was at a meeting of the assignee, the solicitor, and Mr. Lyons—all the cheques to silkman amount to 812<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the first is June 27, 1851, 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the last is 24th Oct—I have got a list of them, taken down at the time in the bankrupt's presence, when the matter were inquired into—the right-hand page of this list is an account of the goods pawned, and the left-hand page is goods redeemed, and it goes over leaf—this statement has reference to the books; it is the result of my investigation of the pawning, in the presence of the bankrupt—this "A. J. Moss," on the right-hand side, means that the goods were pledged by him (Moss) for the bank<lb/>rupts—this is the cash-book I am referring to; I ascertained that these details comprise all the goods pledged at the pawnbrokers; we compared the books, and were able to find out the pledgings, and also the redeemings—I believe the balance between the amount pledged and the sums paid for redeeming, were accounted for, as nearly as possible—I went into the cash-book to see whether the amounts paid and the amounts received corresponded with the amounts given, and I found they did—we had the duplicates—in Oct. 1850, with the exception of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the balance was to the credit of Ellis and Everington, and amounted to a little above 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">looking at the bought ledger</hi>)—in Nov. there was a balance of 948<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in favour of the defendants (<hi rend="italic">looking at the sold ledger</hi>)—in Sept. there is nothing to the credit of Ellis and Everington in the bought ledger, but the goods sold by the defendants to Ellis and Everington in Sept. were about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in Aug. 1851, the goods sold to Ellis and Everington amounted as near as possible to 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I also find that in Oct. 1851, the defendants furnished Ellis and Everington with goods to the amount of about 286<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I find on 2nd Oct. they paid them in cash, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the last parcel of goods delivered by the defendants to Ellis and Everington, was on 30th Oct.—I find by the sold ledger that manufactured goods were delivered by the defendants to Ellis and Everington almost daily in Oct., except Sundays; and in the bought ledger there is a large item to Messrs. Ellis and Everington's credit, amounting to about 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a sum of 651<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is included in that—I find by the sold ledger, folio 7, that goods were returned by the defendants to Messrs. Ellis and Everington; the entry is,</p>

I was present on 25th Sept., when Lyons came—he bought a parcel of glace silk of Mr. Churchill, in my presence—he also had one other piece of silk, to see if it would answer for parasols and likewise to ask his partner—on the same day, by Mr. Churchill's directions, I went to Lyon's house, in Cripplegate—I saw him, and be told me he would take the parcel, at 21<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard; they were offered him at 21 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. told him I could not take less than 21 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "If they will answer the colouring of the fringes I have in stock, to make up for parasols, I will take them"—he had a box of fringes; and as he only had seen one piece of silk, he asked me if the colours of the fringes would answer to make them up into parasols—I told him I thought they would, as near as I could say, and he agreed to take the silks at</p>

Where is he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know; he left about five weeks before Christmas—I was present when Lyons first came to the shop, on 25th Sept.—I did not hear Mr. Churchill or Mr. Everington call him into the shop as he was passing through St. Paul's Churchyard—he came in alone—Mr. Churchill was not at the door, nor was Mr. Everington—I swear that neither of them were at the door, and invited Lyons in as he was passing by—I do not know whether Mr. Everington is here—Lyons saw Mr. Churchill first, but it was not a minute, I should think, before I saw him; I was called immediately; in fact, I was in the room, the silk-room—I did not hear Mr. Churchill say to him that day, that if he was buying silks, they had some which were worth his while to look at—the usual season for buying parasol silks is three weeks or a month before Christ<lb/>mas; it depends on circumstances, when they feel inclined to go into the market—I did not hear Lyons tell Mr. Churchill he did not think the figured silks would suit him; they were not strong enough for his purpose—I went to him the same day, in consequence of a message brought to Mr. Churchill, I do not know who by, or whether it was in writing—I did not tell Lyons that if be would take the silks at the price mentioned, Mr. Churchill would put him in some cheap glace silks, or anything of that sort—he had not refused to give the price asked for the figured silks—he offered 21<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the message to Mr. Churchill, and I told him Mr. Churchill would not take it—I do not recollect that he said he would not give more; he might have possibly—I do not suppose I was more than three minutes bargaining with him—I have told you all that took place—I mean to say, nothing was said about putting him in any cheap glace silks if he would take them, or any other silks—I do not know that he sent to Ellis and Everington to take these very goods back—if such a message had been sent, it most likely would go to Mr. Churchill—I never heard that Lyons said that these silks, when tried on the ribs of a parasol, frayed, and asked Messrs. Ellis and Everington to take them back—the figured silks were of a variety of colours—they were thin silks—I do not know the amount of goods purchased of us by the defendants.</p>

I should charge them 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the loan, either for a month or a week—that is the minimum rate—I find a pawning on 12th Sept., 1851, of four rolls of silk, and a second pawning on the same day of four rolls of silk, each for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—neither of those have been redeemed—I find on 26th Sept. a pawning of two gold watches and chains for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were redeemed on 11th Oct.—I find on 29th Sept. some silk pledged for 301., which have not been redeemed—I am reading from extracts which I took from my books at the request of Mr. Parker—a portion of it is in my own writing, and some of it in one of my young men's—it is correct—the books are here—the whole of the entries in the book are not my writing, as I did not make all the advances—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the bonk</hi>)—neither of the transactions of 12th Sept. are in my writing—I was not present—they are in the writing of Charles Corsby, one of my young men—he can be sent for in two minutes—the entry of the watches on 26th Sept. is also in his writing, and the 29th also—on 11th Aug., 1851, I find 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced on four rolls of silk, that is in my own writing, and the 12th Aug., 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on four rolls, is mine also—there is a second transaction on 12th Aug. of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on four rolls of silk, also in my writing—the fourth transaction on 15th is in my writing, it is 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on four rolls of silk—neither of the transactions on 4th Sept. are is my writing—I was from town then—the 15th Oct. sixteen remnants of umbrella-silk, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is my writing, and the same day, four rolls of silk, 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is my writing—the 18th is not in my writing—on 20th I find five rolls of silk, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 4th Nov. eight remnants of silk, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., both in my writing—that is the last transaction I bad with them—(<hi rend="italic">the witness Moss was here catted in</hi>)—that is the person who brought the goods.</p>

On Monday, 29th Dec., I left Barking, between 2 and 3 o'clock—I stopped on the road, at a person's house, in North-street—they asked me to have a glass of wine—I accepted it—I had but one glass from the time I left Barking—I reached Whitechapel-road, I think, between 8 and 9—it is seven miles from Barring to Whiteehapel Church—when I reached Whitechapel-road, near the workhouse, the prisoner spoke to me; he said, "Old lady, you seem very tired"—I said, "Yes, I am"—I cannot say whether it was 8 o'clock, or a little more; it could not be so late as 9; I had not noticed the clock at all—the prisoner asked if I had come far that day—I said, "From Barking"—he said, did I live in town—I said, no, I lived at Deptford—he said, "You are not going home to-night?"—I said, "No; I am going to my sister-in-law's, who lives in Barbican; I am going to sleep there to-night, and go home to-morrow"—he said, "If you will come along with me, I will show you the nearest way to it"—I thanked him, and, he seeming a working-looking man, I thought I would go along with him—he said, "I think you are a country-woman of mine"—I understood him to be an Irishman—I said, "Perhaps I am"—he walked on, and I said, "I am rather too tired to keep up with you"—he said, "I will wait for you;" and he walked rather slowly—I had bad feet; I could not walk so fast as he—when we got to Spitalfields Church, he seized me with his left hand, and struck me with his right hand, and knocked out my teeth in the front—he took away my shawl, and searched my pocket, and found 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was wrapped in a bit of brown paper—he took that away, and hit me again, turned to the left of the Church, and ran off—the second blow knocked me down on the pavement—I cried out, "Murder" and "Robbery!"—a woman picked me up, and a policeman came and took me to the station-house, all over blood—I then made a complaint, and gave a description of what sort of man he was—I did not go to Barbican that night; I was ashamed to go to my sister's—I went back to where the woman gave me the glass of wine—she sheltered me for that night; I sat in a chair—I came up to town again on business about a fortnight afterwards—I was in the neighbourhood of Bishopsgate-street, and I met the prisoner between two other Irishmen—he turned his head on one side—I went on the other side, to see if I could see any policeman—the prisoner went into a building there—I came up on the Monday afterwards, and made an arrangement with a policeman to meet me the next day, about 1 o'clock, next door but one to the building where the prisoner was, at a public-house—the next day I was there about half-past 12—I saw the pri<lb/>soner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202020052"/>
               <p>—he came to the bar, and asked for a pot of beer—the landlady would not trust him—he said to one of his fellow-work men, "She did right not to trust me; I never meant to pay her; I might not be here at night"—I spoke to the policeman, and he came and took him—I had an opportunity of seeing his person on 29th Dec. so as to know that it was him; I remarked his fea<lb/>tures so well, and talked with him so much—I noticed his whiskers—he wore the same dress that he wears now—I had only one glass of wine after I left Barking.</p>

                  </hi>. I did live at 106, New Gravel-lane; I have left it; I lived there at the commencement of Jan.; it is a brothel; I kept the house. I had some girls living in the house—they were Mary Ann Smith, Margaret Donovan, Emily Willis, and Sarah Slater, and Ann Copas, who was the servant—Slater was not a prostitute, nor yet Copas—Slater is my cousin—to the best of my recollection, Slater had been staying at my place about three weeks, since she left her place—I let her remain at my place till she got another situation—she had been living at my house three weeks prior to 8th Jan.—she slept there every night, in the same bed with me and Copas—I knew James Almon, he was a seafaring man—he came to my house on the Sunday night as this happened on the Thursday—he boarded at Mr. Bell's boarding house, but came to my house to sleep with Smith each night—on Thursday morning, 8th Jan!, about 2 o'clock, I was in bed with Copas—Mary Ann Smith, Slater, and Willis, were in the room, and Margaret Donovan came down into the room—I remember the time of the two foreigners coming into the house—I was then in bed with Copas—Slater was sitting on a stool close to the fireplace—Emily Willis was sitting on the side of the bed—Almon was sitting on the left hand side of the fireplace, and Smith was sitting opposite him—there was no other person in the room at the time the</p>

               <p>two Spaniards came in—I did not see them come in till I beard the two young girls come into the parlour along with them—I saw the girls who came into the parlour with them—I did not know them; neither of them were any of my girls—they wanted beds for the night—I said I had none; my beds were all engaged; I had only beds for my own lodgers—upon that the two girls went away—the Spaniards still stopped there—seeing other girls in the room, they were laughing at them—that was in the parlour—there were two candles burning on the table—one of the Spaniards, the one that is not here, took a candle off the table, turned round to the drawers, and took a glass off the drawers, and made motions to his mouth that he wanted some<lb/>thing to drink—he gave Emily Willis two sixpences—she gave them to Slater, and Slater went and fetched half a pint of gin and a pot of beer—after she was gone, the prisoner's companion went up stairs with Smith—the prisoner still remained in the parlour, talking to Emily Willis, by the side of the bed—Smith and the Spaniard were up stairs about three minutes, to the best of my recollection—nothing passed in the parlour after they left the room, further than the prisoner's speaking to Emily Willis, and the liquor and beer was placed on the parlour table, and the prisoner went up stairs to Mary Ann Smith—he was not above a minute up stairs before they came down—what was said up stairs, or what passed between them, I cannot say—he came down first, I believe, and his companion and Mary Ann Smith came down afterwards—Sarah Slater bad returned with the drink at this time, and it was standing on the table—there was no appearance of displeasure or anger at the time they came down stairs—they began to serve the gin out—it was handed all round to the persons who were in the room—we all partook of it, all but James Almon; he would not take the glass—it was offered to him by the prisoner's companion—he was a much taller man than the prisoner—Almon refused it, and the Spaniard turned the glass upside down on the table, and spilled what was in it on the table—it was a glass without a foot to it—he did it intentionally—Almon was then sitting in a chair by the parlour fire, where he first remained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you observe whether any displeasure was expressed by either of the Spaniards at the time Almon refused the gin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner was sitting on a chair by the bedside, and he got up and stamped his foot at the parlour door, and they both went out and said a word or two to them<lb/>selves in their Own language—I could not hear in what tone of voice they spoke, he seemed quite angry, he stamped his foot several times—to the best of my recollection they were talking in the passage outside the door about three minutes—at the lime the drink was handed round, Margaret Donovan was sitting on the side of the bed, she had come down stairs—after the Spaniards had been out in the passage they drew their knives, each of them opened a knife—Slater hallooed to me, and said, "Mary Ann, those men are opening their knives"—I said, "You run out of the door and get a police<lb/>man"—she went to the door, and she was pulled in by her hair, and thrown light into the middle of the room, I do not know by which of the Spaniards, I was in such a confusion; I was still in bed—the prisoner then came to the side of the bed, threw the bed curtain on one side, and held his knife over me—Slater said, "Mary, Mary, get out of bed, he has got his knife over you, get out of bed or else you will be stabbed, and I got out of bed and <hi rend="italic">creeped</hi> down by the side of the wall—I saw something in his hand, but he held it with the blade down so, Almon was still sitting by the fire in the same chair where he had been all along, be never moved off it at all; he had a small cane in his hand, and he kept burning it in the fire, playing with it,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202020061"/>
               <p>and never turned his head round to notice what anybody was doing in the room—when I got out of bed, I ran and threw open my window, and before I got to it to open it, Almon got up to go to the drawers to get a pipe off, and before I had time to get to the window, the prisoner stabbed Almon, just by the side of the bed—I did not see what he stabbed him with—the bed comes close up to the door, the foot of the bedstead comes over the doorway—he was not quite a yard from the door at the time he was stabbed—the prisoner stood on his left, and the other on his right—they were a deal nearer to the door than Almon—the drawers stand against the wall, about half a yard from the door—it is a small room—there had not been any quarrelling in my room that night, not a word occurred from any one of the parties—I did not hear the Spaniards talk at all in English to anybody—the prisoner was <hi rend="italic">romancing</hi> in his talk to Emily Willis—I could not understand it, she was laughing—she can talk German, and she kept talking a few words in her language, (German), but I do not think he could understand it—after Almon was stabbed he fell to the ground—I ran immediately to the window and pulled the Venetian blind down, and threw open the shutters—the prisoner's com<lb/>panion was nearest to the door, he ran first and the prisoner ran afterwards—Almon was taken from my house to the hospital—I did not go to the hospital to see him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Sarah Slater go for some linen that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not that I am aware of—some people outside gave in two linen aprons through the window—Slater was not sent out for any linen that I know of—I was in bed very soon that night, I dare say at half past 10 o'clock—I was awake at this time—I do not know that Slater went out at all that night—Mary Ann Smith was sitting in the parlour when the Spaniards came in—she had been sitting there about an hour—I had seen her, and been talking to her for an hour before, I will not be positive for a few minutes—I did not know either of the girls who came in with the Spaniards—when they came in Smith was sitting down by the side of the drawers, not far from the door—the drawers are about a yard long, and she was sitting in a chair just against the side of them—she had both her bonnet and shawl on—she had been sitting there, as near as I can tell, pretty near an hour—Slater was sitting on a chair by the fire, doing nothing—the two girls who came in with the Spaniards came against the threshold of the door, they did not come right in as I told them I had no beds for them—Almon had been sleeping with Smith for some time before—she left her former lodging, and came to my place—I have kept this brothel going on for three years—during that time I have not been in any trouble about my place; I have been in trouble, but not on account of that—the last time I was in trouble was last April—I was charged with felony, with robbing a man, not in my brothel, in the same lane, but not in my own brothel—I got six months—I was not tried at this place, somewhere in Clerk en well—I was in company with another female when I robbed the man—it was Elizabeth Donovan—that is not the person who is living with me now, nor any relation of hers—Elizabeth Donovan was not tried with me, nor was any man tried with me—I was charged with stealing six sovereigns—the man I robbed was not hurt, he did not complain of being hurt—I came out of prison in April, I had been in six months—I have not been in trouble since April, I have had warrants out forme for assaults—two, not more; I paid the fines, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was for assaulting Sarah Fore<lb/>man, a brothel keeper, the same as myself; she broke my windows, and I assaulted her—it was both times for assaulting her—she assaulted me and I</p>

               <p>assaulted her—that is the only thing since April—I was not tried on any other occasion, except in April, not since April—before that I was, eight years ago, that was the first time, that was on a charge of a gentleman's watch—I had six months for that, it was a charge of robbery—that was in the City—I was then on the streets—those are the only times; I was never convicted only those times—I have been in prison for assaults and <hi rend="italic">rows</hi>, and that like, I am sure I cannot tell you how many times.</p>

                  </hi>. On Thursday, 8th Jan., I was lodging with Mary Ann Kirwin, at 106, New Gravel-lane. Early that morning the prisoner and another man came there with two girls—I had not known either of them before—I was standing at the door when they came in—there were a great many in the room—Mary Ann Kirwin, Ann Copas, Margaret Donovan, Mary Ann Smith, a German, and Sarah Slater—Almon was sitting by the fireplace in the same room—he was sitting there when they came in—the two girls asked for a bed—mistress told them she had no beds, and the two girls left the house directly—the prisoner and the other man remained—the other man gave me two sixpences to get some drink—I gave them to Slater, and she brought in the drink—the prisoner's companion went up stairs with Smith—he was not up there many minutes—the prisoner went up stairs after him, and they came down together, and Smith with them—they then poured the drink out, and we all drank except Almon—he refused taking the glass—I did not hear a word said by him or any one else at the time—Almon got up and offered the prisoner's companion a chair—he refused taking it—he said, "No," and nodded his head—I could not understand what they said, because they spoke in their own language—they then went out into the passage, and opened their knives—I could see into the passage—the room and the passage is very nearly in one—they were not many minutes in the passage—I think about five or ten minutes—I could not say how long, for I was so frightened—they then came into the parlour with the knives opened—Mary Ann Kirwin was in bed with Ann Copas—the prisoner held the bed curtains up, and held the knife over Kirwin—Slater said, "For God's sake get out of bed or you will be stabbed," and Mrs. Kirwin got out at the foot of the bed and said to Slater, "Go for a policeman, for they mean some mischief"—she went to go for a policeman, and the prisoner took her by the hair of her head, dragged her in, and held the knife over her—Almon was in the room when this took place—he did not do anything, he was a <hi rend="italic">sky-larking</hi> with Mary Ann Smith for the cane—he got up from his chair to get his pipe from off the drawers, and the prisoner stabbed him, and he immediately fell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had there been any previous quarrelling between Almon and the prisoner, or his companion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, there were no words, not in the least: to the best of my belief they were strangers to one another.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">sky-larking</hi>, as you call it, was between Mary Ann Smith and Almon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he had the cane, and was playing with it—the cane is not here—I have seen it since—it is burnt at the end—I believe they have got it at the house—it was not a cane that was occasionally used as a poker—he was playing with it in the fire, and <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> with Mary Ann—Mary Ann had been up stairs to go to bed with the Spaniard, but he would not pay her beforehand—the prisoner asked me to go to bed with him, but I would not, for I was very ill; I had been very bad in the house for about two hours before—we did not go into the back room together—I did not move out of the front room—he asked me to go to bed with him—he could speak a little—he said, "Bed"—that was while his companion was up</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say you were not all trying to prevent him from going out before he had paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not try to go out till he had committed the murder—I did not get any money from either of them, except the shilling—I can swear that—I got that from the prisoner's companion—it was two sixpences—I had my gown off, I was going to my bed, as I was very bad, I had a shawl round me—I did not take my gown off while the prisoner was there, but before—I did not take my shawl off while the prisoner was there—I can swear that—I had my shawl on, and my petticoats on—I say that Almou got up to get his pipe, because I saw him do so—he went to reach his hand over to get at it, as the prisoner stabbed him—I cannot say whether he reached over with the hand that had the cane in it—he had the cane out of his hand then—I swear that.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had your companion, Smith, been out that night at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, she had been at home a good bit, I should say about an hour and a half—I saw Weipperman there—he came down after Margaret Donovan—that was before Almon was stabbed—I cannot say whether he had a poker in his hand—I believe he took the poker up—he was by the fireplace at the time—that was at about the same time that Almon was reaching his pipe—Weipperman put the poker down again, I believe—I did not see him take the poker at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a French polisher, and live at 9, Phcenix-place, Somers-town. The prisoner lodged at my house between three and four months, she had two children, a boy aged seven years, and a girl about nine months, which was called Emily Harriet—on the night of 8th Dec., the prisoner went out at about a quarter before 9 o'clock, with a female companion—I went into the street, and followed them into Chapel-street, where they <hi rend="italic">picked up</hi> a man, and I watched them to the church way; I then returned home, and obtained the assistance of Pearce, 149 S—we went into the prisoner's room, the door of which was not locked, and there found the two children—the infant was lying on a bundle of dirty rags on the hearth, with nothing to cover it but the frock it had on, and an old cape attached to its body—there was no fire, but there was about a quarter of a cwt. of coals in the room; it was a very cold night—there were children's clothes in the room, such things as hoods, frocks., petticoats, worsted gaiters and caps, they would have been produced here, but they were too filthy to bring—these was some bread and dripping in the room—the boy was in one corner of the room, on an old flock bed with nothing to cover it but his own clothes, and both the children were covered with vermin—the prisoner did not return till 10 next morning—I had noticed before that the prisoner was in the habit of leaving the children, but had never before had an opportunity of getting into the room—the prisoner went out to work generally two or three days a week—I have noticed her go out at various times—I worked in the next room, and have frequently been at work till 3 in the morning, and she has not been home then—she generally went out about 8 or 9—I am not aware that any person was left in charge of the children when she went out, I never saw any one—I never saw her take the children out with her when she went out—about a week before this, I had applied at the prisoner's door for some rent, and I then said to bar, "Mrs. White, it is quite time we should part; if you do not get out of my place as soon as you can, I will bring down the law upon you for starving the child," and I was grinned at, and laughed at, and dared to do my best and my worst—on finding the child in this state, I carried it to the poor-house, Pearce went with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the surgeon of St. Pacer as' Workhouse and Infirmary—I was at the workhouse when this child was brought there on the night of 8th Dec.—I examined it and found it in a very dirty, filthy, and emaciated state—it was covered with vermin, and was labouring under disease of the mesenteric glands, which are glands in the lining of the abdo<lb/>men, and have considerable influence on the digestion—the disease of these glands would cause the emaciated state of the child—from the state in which I saw the child, I attribute the disease to neglect, and want of proper food—want of cleanliness is a proof of neglect—the child was properly takes care of, all the vermin entirely removed, and in two or three days it appeared to have somewhat improved, but it died on 18th—I did not from the first anticipate its recovery—I opened the body after death, and then found the</p>

                  </hi>. I am brother to the landlord of the Three Rabbits. I recollect seeing the prisoners in the tap room on 23rd Jan.—Stevens had a velvet coat on, and he was sitting on the seat—Osborn was standing by him—the potboy came to me and gave me a shilling for half a pint of beer; I gave him change—he came to me again and gave me a shilling; he said it was for a pot of porter, I gave him change—he came to me again and gave me another shilling, and I gave him change—he came to me again and gave me a four shilling, and I gave him change for that—I put those shillings into the till—there was other silver there, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, I could not say to what amount—Stevens left first;—I then saw Osborn leave—my mother ordered me to go after him, which I did—he told me not to come near him—I saw him take something from his trowsers pocket, and throw it down, about 100 yards from, the Rabbits—I gave both the prisoners into custody—I went back to the place where I saw Osborn throw something down, and found a bag containing three counterfeit coins, and two coins lying outside the bag, wrapped up separately in tissue paper—I put them in the bag, and took them all to the inspector—I received another shilling from Mrs. Othen, which I also gave to the inspector.</p>

I was sitting in the bar on 23rd Jan.—Barnes, the potboy, brought me a shilling—I put it in the till, separate from other money—I saw my son receive four shillings, he put them in the till—I had cleared out the till before we sat down to tea, about 5 o'clock—all I had left in the till was a shilling, five or six sixpences, and a half-crown—after my daughter had taken a shilling I went to the till and took out the shilling which I had put a part—it was not a good one—I gave it to my son to take to the station—I first gave it to my daughter, she bit it, and returned it to me—I then gave it to my son.</p>

                  </hi>. I am daughter-in-law to the last witness. I was in the bar on 23rd Jan., Osborne asked me for a pennyworth of vinegar, and he gave me a shilling in a piece of thin white paper—I took it to the light, best it, and returned it to him—I told my mother—Osborn then left, and my brother went after him—after my mother had looked at the other shilling—I saw Stevens in the tap-room that night—after the prisoners were taken, I went out with my brother, and saw him find the bag of money—there were three shillings wrapped up in paper in the bag, and two shillings lying outside—one of them was the one that I bad bent—alter my brother had gone to the station, I returned to the Rabbits—I looked in the till, and found four more bad shillings—I took them to the station, and gave them to the officer—I found only one other shilling in the till, beside the four bad ones—there were some sixpences and fourpenny pieces, but no other shilling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On 14th Jan., about two o'clock, I received information—I ran through my shop into my back garden—as I passed through my shop, I noticed my till was drawn out, and was left about half open—I went through my garden into a field called Lady's-well field, and there saw the three prisoners, 150 or 200 yards from my premises, walking together—I had known them all for years—I walked up to them and asked them for my money—they all answered that they had no money, and they did not know what I meant—I took hold of Rogers, and How—I found that Rogers meant to struggle, and I told How he might go if he liked, as I knew him so well, I could take him to-morrow—Mr. Anderson came up, he took Hoban, and told him he might go—Mr. Anderson assisted me with Rogers—going to the station we met an officer, and Rogers looked at me and said "Mr. Carter, will you let me go if I give you your money?"—I said, "No, I will give you in custody"—he put his hand in his pocket took out two half-crowns and two sixpences, which he dropped into my hand—I had had a bowl in my till, and as we were going along Mr. Anderson called out "Hold hard, Carter, there goes your money"—the prisoners were breaking the bowl up, and throwing it away, and Mr. Anderson thought that was the money—he picked up this part of a bowl in the field—I believe this to be mine—I had my money is a bowl like this, and the bowl was gone from the till, and some silver that was in it.</p>
