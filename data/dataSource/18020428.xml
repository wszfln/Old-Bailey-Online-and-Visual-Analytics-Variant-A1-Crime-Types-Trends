               <p>THOMAS BROWN sworn. - I am a smith: On the evening of the 12th of March, I was going up John-street, I saw the prisoner standing at Mr. Evans's door; I then saw a tray fall, which the prisoner took up, and walked away with.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the door was it? - A. It was partly in and partly out; I saw James Evans go after him, and take him; the tray was brought back to the shop; this is the same tray.</p>
               <p>PHILIP SIMMONS sworn. - I am a butcher: I had been to Newgate-market, I was going up John-street home, and saw the prisoner looking at a tea-board; it was hanging at the side of the door; I waited, turned myself round, and saw the prisoner walk away for the space of five yards; he came back again, and looked at it a second time, and turned it over; I thought to see in what manner it was fastened; I desired a young man and a young woman, that was coming by, to take notice of that man, for I did not think he was after any good; and, as I was speaking to them, I heard the tea-board fall; he went away with it, and young Mr. Evans came out, and I told him to go round the corner directly; I had a load upon my head, that I could not go after him myself; I waited there till the man and the board were both brought back.(The tray was identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have very little to say: I think they have aggravated the business in two instances, to make it a capital offence.

               <p>Q. What day were you robbed? - A. On Thursday night, the 28th of January; the prisoner lived with his brother, and I was taking some money of John Stevenson, at the King's-arms.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get there? - A.Between six and seven o'clock, and staid till after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I had been drinking a little, but not to hurt me; as I was going home from there, down <placeName id="t18020428-7-crimeloc35">Colnbrook-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, know either or all of them? - A. I knew the prisoner, for he saw me put the money into my pocket, and he called a man up to help him, saying, it was a twenty pound job.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it? - A.Rather darkish; next day I said, three thieves had robbed me, to my family, and that Hummerston was one of the gang, but only said so to my family, who are not here; having lost two horses, and my cattle dying, I made no enquiry about it, as I could not afford expence; I was sent for to the Justices, and the prisoner was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you were sober enough to know him? - A. I don't know all the people that were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280006"/>there, but he was peeping in at the door, and saw me put the money into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You had been drinking? - A. Yes, a little hot-pot, which is been and gin.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the prisoner lived with his brother, yet you did not go to any constable or Justice? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a month between the time you were robbed and when he was taken up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Aldridge, and what you said to him? - A. Yes; I said, I had been robbed by some of Hummerstone's gang, disguised in light-horseman's jackets, but I won't say whether I told him two or three, nor can I say whether I saw him that night, but think I did, and told him I had been robbed by three men.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark? - A.Darkish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you everhear there was forty pounds reward, as you have told us you were low in money? - A. Yes; but I don't do it for the sake of that, it is done to break up the gang.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever charge Stevenson with robbing you? - A. No; I said he kept me dilly daily so long getting change, or it would not have happened.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he was not there, or, that you did not observe him? - A. He was not there till after I had paid him the three pounds nine shillings and sixpence, and called

               <p>Cowen. One of these waistcoats has my private mark upon it, E; the other waistcoat has got a little bit of a darn upon the front of it; the white waistcoat was my own wear, I had not such another figured waistcoat in the house; the shirt is marked K.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you sure you did not sell those things to any body the day before? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought these things of a Jew; if I had stolen them, I should hardly have worn them the same day.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Warren: On Friday, the 19th of March, the prisoner came, and asked me to change two lawn handkerchiefs which she had bought a day or two before, and left at the shop, saying she would call for them in a day or two; she then had them changed for two policat handkerchiefs, and wished to look at some muslins, saying, she wanted a dress for a friend; there was a piece in a manner fixed upon, but there was not enough of it, and she said she would only take half a yard; I pressed her to purchase a quantity, and in looking over the wrapper to find a piece of a sufficient length, I missed a piece of muslin, but did not take any notice of it to her then; the only reason I had to suspect her was, that she had been twice before to the shop, and I saw her put her hand under her cloak, and rather suppose she took it at that time; she paid the difference of the handkerchiefs and the muslin, and went out of the shop; I followed her, and brought her back, upon which she gave Mr.

             the muslin, as he has related; I fetched Mr. Saunders, the constable, who has had the muslin ever since, which I am sure was in the wrapper, and which I afterwards missed.(Nathaniel Saunders produced the musli, which was identified by Mr. Warren.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I brought it away in a mistake; for I put the things I had bought and that muslin all in my pocket at the same time; I was not over the threshold of the door when the gentleman laid hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Baxter.) Q. Did you wrap the things up yourself? - A. I put them in a paper, and rolled them up, and gave them to her; the muslin she stole. GUILTY, aged 26.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness; I lost a great many things; the first thing I missed was a card of black lace, about twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the value of that card of black lace? - A.Six guineas.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you miss any other card of black lace? - A. Yes, I missed a quantity of brown striped sarcenet, I should suppose about twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that? - A. I should suppose about two shillings and six-pence a yard; these are the only things I recollect missing myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you miss them from? - A. We only missed them by searching; there was a small piece of white lace missing, I understood Miss Jones had taken it up stairs; I enquired of her for it, and she said she could not tell where it was.</p>
               <p>Q.When was that? - A. On Thursday, the 8th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she continue in your house till the 8th of April? - A. Yes, Mr. Sowerby made a mistake; it was April, and not March; she staid in the house till the 10th.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you miss the card of black lace from? - A. I missed it from the lace-box, on the 8th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that had you looked into that box? - A. I cannot exactly say; I had not an idea that such a thing was gone; it might be more than a month or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else? - A.No; we found other things which I had not missed.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to imagine it was the prisoner who had taken these things? - A. Being informed that she had taken a bit of white lace up stairs, I asked her for it, and she said she could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she admit that she had taken it up stairs? - A. Yes; she said she meant to card it, and had put it in her bosom, and took it up stairs; the sarcenet was found in a small box of her's; a lady's pelice had been cut off it; I brought it down stairs, and asked Miss Jones if she had taken that up too, and she said, no, she had bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had the care of the sarcenet ever since? - A. Yes. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at it, and say if you are sure that is the sarcenet from which the lady's pelice was cut off? - A. Yes; this is the place where it was cut from; here is another piece of sarcenet that I found in her box; I thought I had some like it, and I sent for my own, and found this piece join it exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you that piece here? - A. I have;(Produces it.) I had desired Miss Jones to go up stairs with me, and let me see her box; I found a number of pieces of muslin and a variety of triffling articles.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find the goods in question? - A. On the 8th of April; the other articles are pledged.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the persons who had the care of those things - who missed them? - A. All the young people.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here? - A. Here is one, Miss Wilson; every young person in the house has access to all those articles; when a dress is wanted, they go and take what they want.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate to Miss 
               <persName id="t18020428-14-person113">Jones</persName>
             the loss that you had sustained? - A. Yes, and she said she did not know any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make that communication? - A. On the 9th; she cried very much, and gave me three duplicates that morning, and said, that was all that she knew about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the duplicates? - A. Eighteen pair of stockings, two table-spoons, and twelve pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of receiving these duplicates, go to the pawnbrokers? - A. No; the pawnbrokers are here.</p>
               <p>Q.Who is Lockwood? - A. Mrs. Lockwood is my mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This young lady came to you in December? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She came to improve herself in her own line of business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been in the business before? - A. She told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she offer her services for wages, or upon a premium that she was to give you to learn the business? - A. Upon a premium; she was to give me at first twenty pounds, and she was to stay three years.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was she to learn? - A. Mil<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280010"/>linery and mantua-making; but, before it was finally settled, I thought it too long, and we agreed that she should pay thirty pounds, and stay one year.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was that paid? - A. She said it was not quite convenient for her father to pay it till the last day of February.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons have the conduct of your business? - A.Sometimes more, and sometimes less.</p>
               <p>Q. How many, from the month of December to April, were concerned in the management of your business, under your control? - A. Six.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, if any customer were to come to your shop? - A. It is not a shop; it is a private house.</p>
               <p>Q. If any customer came to you, they might all have the control, and serve your customers? - A. Yes, at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you there were fourteen yards, you suppose, of black lace? - A. No, I said I thought about twelve, but I was not quite certain; it is point ground lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, in your line of business, you had a large quantity of black lace? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. More than one card, I suppose? - A. Yes, a great many cards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken stock shortly before? - A.It might be six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q.There was nothing particular in your black lace distingushable from other black lace? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither can you tell us, in the course of six months, how much you might have sold? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When these things were taken, the probability would be, that they might have been taken at different times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As you cannot ascertain the exact quantity, you cannot, of course, six the value? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Have you measured the card of lace? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Can you state, that that card of lace positively had not been sold in your shop during six months? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You can venture to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Miss Jones was crying at the time, and shewed great contrition? - A. At first she denied it; then she gave me three duplicates, and said, that was all; and afterwards she gave Miss Wilson two duplicates.</p>

               <p>Q. How was the other door broke open? - A. It was bolted, as well as locked, inside.</p>
               <p>Q. How had it been opened? - A. It was burst open, the staple was burst off; it was the bursting of that open that alarmed me.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE ROMLEY sworn. - I am an officer,(produces the property); I searched the prisoner, and found nothing upon him but a common knife; being without a hat I asked him what had become of his hat; he said he had lost it in the scuffle; the prosecutor went back and found the hat.</p>
               <p>Payne. Q.These are my boots, they were hanging up in the window; when I caught him he had them in his hand; on my return from the watch-house, I found his hat in the passage, some matches, and a bottle of phosphorus.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I understand that Mr. Romley has been putting this man in the way of getting forty pounds upon my conviction; I have not been out of trouble long; I went to inquire for a man of the name of Murray, and being in liquor I went to a wrong house, and when I went in, that man knocked me down; and, as I had an undoubted right, I knocked him down again.</p>

               <p>Q. Who else were there in the shop? - A. Mr. Willes, and John-Augustus Brookes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he your partner? - A. No; they were setting an account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You said nothing to this woman before she put this piece of cotton to the other side of the counter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not charged her with any thing? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you been serving upon that spot? - A. On the spot where the prisoner first came in, I had shewn a lady some things; but where the prisoner threw the print from her, was three yards from where the print had laid.</p>
               <p>Q. All that she did, was to remove this to the other side of the counter? - A. No; she had it between her thighs.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280013"/>Q. Did you see it between her thighs? - A. No. I saw her take it from there; she put her hand there, and the print flew from there to the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not have been sliding down, and she removed it up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not - do you mean to swear the print might not have slipped down on the side of the counter on which she was? - A. She was not near enough to catch it; if the print had been lying there, I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not come up to her? - A. Yes; I was standing close by the side of her.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know any thing of this woman before? - A. No, I have never seen her before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>THOMAS-FAIR WILLES sworn. - I am shopman to Messrs. Janaway and Brookes; I was standing at the farther end of the shop, and was desired by Mr. Janaway to pick up a piece of print, which I did; how it came there I do not know; I had my back towards her at the time.(John Hobbs, the officer, produced the property, which was identified by the prosecutors.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the piece of print till the gentleman picked it off the ground, and said, I meant to steal it.</p>

               <p>Q.Tell us what conversation you had with Mr. Cock respecting the property of the deceased; and particularly, whether you had any respecting the five per Cent Annuities? - A. Yes, we had; because we calculated what the profits of the three and four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280017"/>per Cents would produce, and what the amount of the legacies would be.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Storey had stock in the three and four per Cents as well as in the five per Cents? - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. You calculated them, and had conversation with respect to the five per cents? - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the nature of the conversation you had with the prisoner respecting the five per Cents? - A. The general drift was, whether it should be parted with previous to the dividends becoming due at Christmas, or whether we should wait till after Christmas.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any objection? - A. I did; because the testator ordered the legacies to be paid within three months.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any paper of the testators which purported to be an account of his property? - A. I found an account between the testator and Mr. Benjamin Cock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, in any conversation you held with him respecting the sale of the five per Cents intimate any knowledge of his that the testator had realized the quantity of stock? - A. On no occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask you whether he communicated to you that it was all exhausted and gone? - A. He never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of making calculations - look at this, and tell me whether it is the writing of the prisoner? - A. Yes; he copied this from a similar account which I drew out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any statement respecting the supposed 7000l. five per Cent Annuities? - A. Yes there is.</p>
               <p>Q. He making no observation to induce to believe it was not standing there, copied that paper, and took it by way of direction for his conduct, for the manner in which he was to act, making no observation that there was no such fund to act upon? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter and tell me if it is your writing? - A. Yes; except the copy of a letter from John Storey, which was copied by my direction.</p>

               <p>Q. What was arranged? - A. With regard to transferring stock; instead of giving time, we settled it; and he said, Sir Andrew Hammond left it to my discretion; he was to pay the difference, or receive it, as it might be taking a hundred stock as a hundred pounds value.</p>
               <p>Q. In the whole of that conversation he never communicated that it had been diminished? - A. Never.(Extract of a letter, dated Chatham, November 17, 1801, signed William Jeffereys, directed to Mr. Henry Cock, Solicitor, No. 9, King-street, Cheapside, London.)</p>
               <p>"Respecting the payment of the pecuniary legacies to the legatees, I have duly considered, and the best opinion I can form of the subject is, that they should, agreeable to the will of the testator, be paid immediately to all, as well to the residuary legatees as to the others; it was proposed to leave the legacies to the residuary legatees unpaid until the final share was made, but as that will, from necessity, be some time first, and as the proposed forbearance was on account of interest, I think they had better be discharged at once; the legacies given to the residuary legatees are various in amount, and consequently will be intitled to have a proportion of the accumulated interest; and it would puzzle and perplex much to make such division of the whole, to pay each alike would be unfair; and to pay the whole, at present, each would reap the benefit arising from the legacy in proportion to the worth; if interest was my motive, for this advice I should enjoy that interest; by forsaking my plan, therefore, that cannot interfere; I have no other wish but to do what is right, and simplify the accounts; I wish, therefore, with the approbation of your brother, and Sir

               <p>Q.Endeavour to recollect as near as you can? A. It is impossible to recollect that immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you continue, from the time you first began to receive the same sum annually, to go on receiving it at stated periods, or was there any intervention? - A. At times the payments used to vary.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please your Lordships, Gentlemen of the Jury, very little capable at any time of addressing a Jury of my country, I am much less able to do so upon an awful occasion like the present, yet I confess to you my feelings have been considerably relieved by the extreme, liberal and candid manner, in which the Gentlemen have conducted themselves towards me this day, and I am the better enabled to address you, because the result of this enquiry is so different from that which has gone forth to the world, and is so inconsistent, that I humbly look with confidence to an honourable acquittal, and towards being restored by your verdict to Society.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you have an important duty to perform; you have either to restore an individual to society, or to send him to certain death; I may say certain death, because we all know that you are the dernier resort, from your verdict there lies no appeal, and I am confident you will weigh it with judgment and with mercy, peculiarly in a case of this sort, where there is no ulterior resort whatever.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I should not have the presumption to address you, if the law of the land had not prevented the learned Gentleman, who has paid such unremitted attention to the case, from doing it for me, he could do me justice in much stronger terms than I can myself; but when I look to the noble Lord, who presides, and to you, Gentlemen, I have nothing to fear; I trust you will allow for the inaccuracies of my speech, and that you will look at the case in all its bearings, and if you are convinced, upon the evidence that has been adduced against me, I am guilty, let me be consigned over to the laws of my country; but if the whole tenor of my life has been according to the rule of right; if I have continued to act upon the principles of honour and honesty, and if the evidence, as far as it has gone, has been consistent with that character which has been gone into, then, Gentlemen, I feel confident in the event of your verdict.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I did think, on the part of the prosecution, there would have been a clear consistent statement before you; I should have thought charging me to have forged this power of attorney, that they would have begun at the foundation of the crime to shew that that power of attorney was forged; they have shewn no such thing, or attempted it; they ought to have gone on, and to have shewn you that the power of attorney, in October, 1800, was a forgery; that they have not done. What is it we then come to? the power of attorney in April, which is charged to be the forgery, and we will go to the evidence on which it is founded. There is one thing before that, because the Gentleman has been pleased to say, that it afforded some strong presumption, and I admit that suspicious circumstances have been laid before you, but unfortunately I have not the opportunity, by evidence, of compleatly elucidating them, but will say, it is bare statement; there is not positive evidence against me. I shall pass over all the different witnesses which have been called as to the entries in the Bank-books for form's fake, and will admit that there was such a sum as 5000l. sold out; the only questions you have to try, are, first, whether it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280021"/>under a forged instrument, and, in the next place, whether, if it was a forged instrument, I was the perpetrator of it, or uttered it, knowing it to be forged.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the first material circumstance, I shall observe upon, is this, I take it in all cases, it certainly is not possible to shew the perpetrator of the act; in this case they cannot, for it is impossible to shew the perpetration of the deed; in order to be convinced that an instrument of this fort is a forgery, you will first look to the signature of the party himself, and next to those of the attesting witnesses; what is the evidence, taking the signatures first, I think it is clear, that I was in the habit of confidence sufficient to be intitled to receive under it; I think the gentlemen have produced to you a power of attorney, authorizing me to receive dividends upon the then stock, therefore you have it before you on the shewing of the prosecution, that I was in the confidence of the testator, and was allowed to receive his dividends; was it inconsistent, therefore, that he should allow me to sell it out when necessary? and here I must make an observation upon the evidence of Mr. Packham, who said I had received the dividends on his stock, implying that stock was gone, though it will be found through the whole transaction, his confidence had not been broken in upon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is but justice, if it will assist you, to say, that respecting the servants of Mr. Storey's, you conducted yourself with great fidelity.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sir, I thank you for correction me, I may have mistaken the evidence. Gentlemen, you have the evidence before you of Mr. Jeffereys, that this hand-writing is not, in his opinion, the hand-writing of Mr. Storey; there is not one single other witness, nor is there an iota of evidence before you that it is my hand-writing. I will now resort to the attesting witnesses - the first is

            , and is it possible for you to conceive if they were written by me, that they would not have got persons to prove it was my writing? They ought to have gone to that point, and shewn to you that it was not merely suspected to be a forgery, but that it was a forgery created by my hand; they have attempted to effect it out of Court, but they failed in effecting it in Court.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, Mr. Francis is asked whether there was one

             living at Rochester; he tells you there was not. I am not disposed to quarrel with that - but the solicitors who conduct this prosecution were, so soon as the circuit was over, required to give me the names of the witnesses, which was refused, and which, if it had been complied with, I would not have been contented with calling a single tax-gatherer - I should not have stopped there; I should have sent down persons of diligence and activity, and if I found it was impossible to discover them, I should have put One Hundred Pounds Reward in as large figures as they put for my apprehension, and called upon them, for the sake of public justice, to come and speak before you. On this part of the question, I think they have gone a very little way; they have given us very flight evidence indeed, and it merely depends upon the opinion of Mr. Jeffereys, that this is not the hand-writing of Mr. Story, who was a man afflicted with the gout, eighty years of age, and liable to an hundred variations in his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The greater part of this case has been occupied by inquiring not so much whether it is a forgery or not, but with reading the correspondence between me and the executors, subsequent to the death of Mr. Storey, all tending to shew most unquestionably that there existed, at the period of Mr. Storey's death, 7000l. stock. I do not mean to deny those representations, they are proved; I would have admitted them, if my Counsel would have permitted me; it is unquestionably true, I have constantly admitted to the executors that 7000l. was there, and have acted upon it as such, and if the thing had remained undiscovered till this moment, I should have continued to do so, but does that prove the charge? The question is, Whether it be a forgery or not? Whether their confidence was broken in upon by the conduct I pursued, and not giving me an opportunity of replacing the money which I acknowledge is converted, but I say there is no proof of forgery, and you have a right to infer from the confidence placed in me by Mr. Storey, with respect to his own dealings, that I might be authorized to transfer any of the stock, and I might have gone on representing it as still standing in the books, whereas it was not; for I wished to keep the deception up, and I did keep it up to the testator till his death.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, If there was any idea in my mind that I should be placed in this tremendous situation, is it probable, that on the 19th of August I should be at the Parsonage-house, and every where to be found, and my papers liable to be inspected by every body who chose - is it not more likely, that, after the death of Mr. Storey, I should have gone off with those sands which Mr. Jeffereys intrusted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280022"/>me with? The fact is this, and you ought to try that fact, Whether it be most consistent with my representation, or with the representation made by the prosecution, then you ought to pause, and consider whether it is a forgery, and whether I am the perpetrator of it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The probate of the will was produced to you, and I apprehend it may be read in evidence; I defy them to shew that any sum of 7000l. 5 per Cents. is taken notice of by the testator by any one letter or declaration of the testator, that he had such stock, because it does not exist; they cannot prove it - they cannot shew it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, There is another thing: When one of the witnesses was asked as to the testator's handwriting to this instrument, the learned Judge was pleased to ask whether he spoke with as much certainly as the subject was capable of? Most undoubtedly, the witness did say, I speak with as much certainly as the subject is capable of.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have now given you a few observations, not with that ability with which they would have been given by my Counsel, but in the best manner I am able, considering the agitation of my mind. Hasty, crude, and undigested as they are, arising from my unfortunate situation, I trust you will give such weight to them as you think they deserve. The correspondence between me and Mr. Storey is destroyed, and it is utterly impossible to shew his directions to me; you will give the due weight to me observations I have made, and it only remains for me to address you upon my character - that character has been in part given to and I slatter myslef, those who will be seen here to-day, will not diminsh that which I have received; on that, I am willing to go to a Jury of my country, trussing my life in their hands, and to the law, perfectly satisfied that whatever they do, they will neither injure the one, or sacrifice the other.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280024"/>Q. Is there any way to go to the cellar without coming through your shop? - A. There is no other way, it is impossible; I came back between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner was then in the cellar; I had not time to pull off my bonnet and cloak when the officer came and took the prisoner into custody, he told him he wanted him about a little tobacco; he seemed very much confused, and said he did not know any thing about a little tobacco; I went down stairs directly the officer took him away, and examined the boxes; upon a large cover-head, upon which the boxes stood, was some loose tobacco, about six pounds, and the boxes standing by the side of a tub, quite empty.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they stand in the same place in which they were in the morning? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.During the time you were in the house, after you had seen the boxes filled, did any body else than the prisoner go into the cellar before you went out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This man had been a manufacturer of tobacco for himself, had not be? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he carried on no business in tobacco himself? - A.For the sale of tobacco, about a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the journeyman then employed with him? - A. Not any one.</p>
               <p>Q. You had employed a man of the name of Stevens before, had not you? - A. Never in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not weigh the tobacco in the morning? - A. I did not; the boxes generally contain about five pounds each.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is your son? - A. Twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there any thing more to be done by the prisoner to this tobacco, in order to manufacture it? - A. Only to run it through a sieve.</p>
               <p>Q. He must have taken it out of the boxes for that purpose? - A. He must.</p>
               <p>Q. And would this cover-head be a proper place for him to put it before he put it in the sieve? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KEMP called. Q. How old are you? - A. Twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you are to be sworn to? - A. To speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. What will become of any person, if, having sworn to speak the truth, they should speak that which is not true? - A. They will go into flames.(He is sworn.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. On the 19th of March, did you take care of the shop while your mother was out? - A. Yes; she went out about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time who was in the cellar? - A.Hobleman; he went away to dinner in about half an hour, he usually came back from dinner about one o'clock; that day he did not come back till above half after four.</p>
               <p>Q.During the time he was gone, did any other person go into the cellar? - A. No; he went down into the cellar before he went out; I asked him what made him stay so late; he said his child had had an accident, and had fell in the fire; I said, very well, and he went down; my mother came in in about twenty minutes, or half an hour after; and in about ten minutes after that the officer came.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from that time, till the officer came, had any other person but your mother been into the cellar? - A. No; I had been in the shop the whole time.</p>

               <p>ROBERT BROWN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am one of the officers employed at Shadwell-office: On the 19th of March, I was sent for to the shop of a Mrs. Stevens, in Ratcliff-highway, where I found a woman of the name of Coles, in the custody of Elby; Mrs. Stevens, and I, went to the house of Mrs. Kemp, and took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Stevens's house from Mrs. Kemp's? - A.About three quarters of a mile; Hobleman asked me what I took him for; I told him for a little tobacco; he told me he knew nothing about it. I took him into custody, and brought him away to Shadwell office; in going along to the office, he told me his mistress allowed him tobacco; I then asked him where he lived, and he pointed the house out to me; I afterwards went and searched that house, and, in a cupboard in the bed-room, I found these two parcels of tobacco, weighing six pounds and a half, (produces them;) I searched further in a little bit of a shed in a back part of the house, and found several parcels of tobacco in different parts of the place, but Mrs. Kemp did not identify them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Who was present when this conversation passed about his mistress allowing him tobacco? - A.There was no person with me, Elby was waiting in the New-road for me.</p>
               <p>Q. He does not talk very good English, does he? - A. Very good for a German.</p>
               <p>Q. He speaks broken English, like a German? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you might very easily have mistaken what he said? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a quantity of ochre at his house, did not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A large quantity? - A. Yes, there was a little cask about three parts full.</p>
               <p>Q. They tell me that will give a colour to tobacco? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did not his master admit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280025"/>that she had sent that ochre to his house? - A. Yes, she did.</p>

               <p>THOMAS ELLISON sworn. - I am a servant to Mr. Stevens, a tobacconist: On the 19th of March, Susannah Coles brought some tobacco, to our shop, which was afterwards delivered to Elby, the officer; she was at our shop twice that day; she came first about half past one, and then, by my master's directions, I followed her about a quarter of a mile: as she was going along the New-road, she spoke to the prisoner at the bar; Coles waited at the corner of Union-street about half an hour, till she saw him coming down the New-road; as soon as she saw him, she ran across the road to him; I saw her give him something, but what it was I cannot tell; after their conversation together for some time, about a quarter of an hour, I missed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she received any thing at your shop? - A. She had received fourteen shillings for the tobacco that she had brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Hobleman? - A. Yes, I knew where he lived; she came again in the afternoon, and brought seven pounds of tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you had the officer waiting to take her into custody? - A. No; I fetched the officer, and she was taken into custody; the tobacco was given to Elby.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. - Q. You never saw her at the man's house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So they talked together; but you did not hear a word? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Kemp.) Look at these parcels of tobacco found at his house; is it the same sort of tobacco that was contained in the boxes you speak of? - A. The very same; it had been cut that morning, I saw him at work upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it finished tobacco? - A. It was not; it had not gone through the sieve, nor ever does, it is returns, which will not go through.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the operation of sisting been performed when you saw it in the morning? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it since? - A. Yes it has.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there time enough for him to have fisted it before he went away to dinner? - A.He might rub a box through in a few minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been in the tobacco manufactory? - A. My husband was sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you yourself employed in it? A.Almost all the time; my husband was almost always ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to judge of tobacco? - A.Yes; it was of a particular flavour.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say, with certainly, that it was newly cut tobacco? - A. I am certainly positive of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Can you tell me what is the use of ochre? - A. For many things in the tobacco business.</p>
               <p>Q. It will give a colour to tobacco? - A.It will, to what you call dark sisting from shag tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. It will have the effect of making an inserior sort of tobacco look like a superior tobacco? - A. I never used any.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it is forbid to be in the possession of a tobacco manufacturer? - A. I don't know; a cask of ochre was sent to his house, but what he used it for I can truly say I don't know.</p>

               <p>Q.Was it your's or his? - A. I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it your's or his? - A. It was his while it was in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your property or his property? - A. I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay for it for your own? - A. I did; he persuaded me to buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was removed to his house by your desire? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He took it by your authority? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it been kept at his house? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How many months had it been kept at his house? - A. Not weeks, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give us some sort of guess? - A. No, I cannot.</p>

               <p>

               <p>Q. Did you see that tobacco produced at the Justice's, which was found at the prisoner's house? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it or not newly manufactured tobacco? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Fourteen pounds of tobacco would make a pretty large bundle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a process by which old tobacco may be made to resemble newly cut tobacco? - A. It may be mended, but cannot be made so perfect as that.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe ochre will give it a better appearance? - A. Ochre never was used by any person in the trade to tobacco of this description.</p>
               <p>Q. What effect will ochre have upon tobacco? - A. Ochre, when used, is used to tobacco of a different colour, to make it appear the colour of this.</p>
               <p>Q. Will that give to inferior tobacco the appearance of superior? - A. It is never used for that purpose, it is merely to alter the colour, and not the qualtity.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called four witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18020428-23-verdict125" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Had you observed Rutter sufficiently to know he was the same man when he was brought back? - A. Yes, I had spoke to him on the steps of the printing-office door about ten minutes before; I asked him what he wanted there; he told me he wanted no person in particular, and walked away; I am sure he is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if there was any body in your office at the time? - A. Yes, but not in the room where the paper was.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the people that you saw running were the same that were brought back? - A. Yes; we sent for Mr. Fletcher, the constable, and they were delivered to him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FLETCHER sworn. - On Monday, the 29th of March, about half past one o'clock, I was standing within my own door, and saw a person run very furious past the door; I then heard the cry of stop thief; I immediately opened the door, and ran out; the prisoner, Rutter, was then stopped by being thrown down; his heels were kicked up; I immediately took him into custody; I had information that Mr. Whittingham was robbed; I then took him to the corner of Dean-street, and by that time the other prisoner was taken. I called for assistance, and took them both to the Compter; the paper was delivered to me by Mr. Whittingham, and I have had it ever since; (produceit.)</p>
               <p>Whittingham. This is my paper; it is part of a quantity of paper that came in on the preceding Saturday; there were twenty-six bundles of it; I went into the room just before the robbery, for I had a suspicion of the prisoner Rutter; the paper was there then; when I came back, I looked at the room, and missed two bundles; the number on the paper is 620; I believe the Exciseman's name is

               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of the person? - A. I saw him but a very little time; I then lost sight of him; it was a bonnet I had just brought from the milliner's; the bonnet was picked up, and given to me; the prisoner said he had been knocked down by two men; he said he was sure, if I looked at him, I should say it was not him.</p>

               <p>Q. And he said, if you looked at him, he was sure you would say it was not him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so dark, it was impossible for you to swear to the person? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In your way to Chertsey, who did you see? - A. A man jumped over a gate to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was? - A. Yes; that was the man. (Pointing to the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell us if any conversation took place between you? - A. He jumped over the gate, and asked me if I was a Jew; I told him, yes; he asked me whether I would buy some wedge.</p>
               <p>Q. What is wedge? - A.Silver; he pulled out of his pocket a little salt-spoon; I asked him whether he had got any more; he told me, yes, he had got mere in plant.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by plant? - A. Hid; I asked him why he would not get it now? he told me no, it would not do now, for there was a man at work very near where the property laid, but he said, if you will meet me between six and seven, upon Staine's-bridge, I will go with you and sell it with you; then I said, suppose I meet you at home at your house? he said, no, it will not do at my house, I am suspected as a suspicious person in the town, and it is very likely I may have my house searched; I told him it was dangerous for him to keep that spoon in his pocket if he was in danger of having his house searched; he immediately took and dug a hole, and put the spoon into the earth, just by the gate where he got over; I walked with him better than half a mile back towards Staines, and told him not to deceive me, but to meet me there at the time; I left him, and wished him good-bye, then I went to the place where he had hid the spoon.</p>
               <p>Q.Why did you go back to that place? - A. I thought very likely he might meet some body else, and take the spoon out, and sell it; I dug up the spoon, and took it to a very remarkable place where there are three trees, and buried it again very safe; I immediately went straight to Chetrsey; when I came to Chetrsey, I went to an old woman, and enquired for a Justice of the Peace; I went before Mr. Whitaker, the Surry Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then give the same account you have been giving to-day, and afterwards pursue the directions of the Justice? - A. Yes, I told him every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do, in consequence of the directions of Mr. Whitaker? - A. I went to Mr. James, the Middlesex Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the same account to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18020428-48-person341">James</persName>
             that you had before given to Mr. Whitaker? - A. The very same.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of having given that account, what did you do? - A. Mr. James gave me a shilling to go to a public-house till the time appointed; I went, and the very moment I got to Staines-bridge, the prisoner came up to me, and said, it is rather too soon to go yet, let us wait here a little; He told me, on the very spot where he stood, underneath the Bridge were two watches that he had hid there, that he had got some time back; I asked him if he was ready to go, he said, yes, follow me; I followed him across a field, then he got over a white railing; I saw him stoop down, he took some turf off the ground, and took out a bag; he told me, here it is; I told him, bring it over to me, and as he was getting over, the constable came up to him, and said, you are my prisoner; it was agreed that the constable should be in waiting.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the bag in his hand? - A. Yes; I immediately went over to him, and drew this knife upon him, and told him, if he offered to stir I would cut his head off; I endeavoured to catch hold of the bag, he gave it a bit of a swing, and threw it over into the Thames.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the constable's name Holden? - A. Yes, a little man in a white coat; I saw a boat on the other side, and I called over, over; and then several people came round, one had a gun, and the prisoner was secured.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the boat come over? - A. Yes; and there was a barge coming through the lock, with several people in her, and they came to my assistance; the constable sent him away, and he was taken before Mr. James.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the prisoner was apprehended,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280036"/>did you hear him say any thing about this? - A. All he said, was, you need not be afraid of me, I shall not run away, I may as well be hanged as shot in the back; when I first saw the prisoner in the morning, he told me there was a quart pot, a pint pot, several table-spoons, several tea-spoons, several tops of pepper-castors, and I believe a pair of tea tongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever tell you where he got these things? - A. He said he had got them not far from the town.</p>
               <p>Q.What town did you understand him to mean? - A.Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever mean to sell these things when you should have got them from him? - A. I never meant to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean then? - A. I meant to have him apprehended immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. And with that view you went to the two Justices? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the salt-spoon that you dug up? - A. The next morning, after the prisoner was apprehended, I took it out, I found it where I had buried it, the high-constable went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the high-constable? - A. Mr. Slark.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mr. Stiles.) Q.Were you disturbed in the night at all? - A. I heard a noise, and I pulled my curtain on one side, and I think it was moon-light.</p>

               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Stiles.) Have you any thing in your recollection, that will enable you to six, at all, the time when you heard any noise after you had been in bed, or do you know how long it was after you were in bed? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any curtains to your window? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say whether it was break of day? - A. I think it was moon light; I should suppose I had not been in bed long.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you for supposing you had not been long in bed? - A. I rather think it was the turn of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was moon light? - A. Yes; I saw the stars.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. You are clerk to Messrs. Grayhurst and Company? - A. Yes, Michael and Susannah-Ann Grayhurst.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the gentleman at the bar, and tell us if you saw him at Mr. Grayhurst's shop on the 26th of April last? - A. I did, on Monday, this day week.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that shop? - A. No. 65, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business at the shop? - A. When he first came in, I was not present; I was called up to shew him the things that he asked for.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sort of a shop is it? - A. A silversmith, jeweller, and watch-maker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Did you shew him any thing? - A. I did; there were two or three articles shewn him before I came in; I was called to state the prices to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you shewn him? - A. A silver tea-pot and a plated tea-urn; the next articles I shewed him were a dozen knives and forks, a dozen deserts, and a plated bread-basket; he was then asked if he would like a coffee-urn to match the tea-urn; he asked me what a coffee-urn was; I pointed to it, and shewed it him; he said he would have it; I don't know that there was any thing else; he desired me to cast up the whole of them; I did so, to the amount of thirty-nine pounds, as near as I can recollect; he was in a great hurry.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he offer to pay you for them? - A. He doubled up a piece of paper, and walked up and down the shop; the whole of the time that he was in the shop, he appeared to me very much deranged; he appeared to stare at me very wildly several times; after I had added up the amount, and told him what it came to, he presented a piece of paper to me, solded up; he desired me to take it to where it was addressed, to bring the goods and the balance to Millington's coffee-house to Sir Thomas White; he then left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You of course looked at the paper that he gave to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it? - A. A draft to Messrs. Snow and Company for one thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you look at it before he left the shop, or afterwards? - A. I looked at it before he left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper? - A.This is the same.</p>
               <p>Q.Is there any drection upon the draft where Messrs. Snow resided? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him upon that subject? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you afterwards do with that draft? - A. I took it to a neighbour's, Mr. John Sommers, and desired him to present it; I told him the circumstance that I have stated before you, my Lord, and added, that I thought the person was deranged.</p>
               <p>Q. How far does Mr. Sommers live from you? - A.Just across the street; I returned again to Mr. Grayhurst's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - A. About an hour after I came back; I understood he had been there while I was gone to Mr. Som<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280038"/>mers's; I was called into the shop, and saw him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were present then? - A. Mr. Sommers was in the shop, and

            , and Mr. Paul; a conversation took place between Mr. Paul and the prisoner; he is a partner in the house of Snow and Company; some conversation had taken place before I came in; I heard the prisoner say, I supposed (to Mr. Paul,) if I told you that Mr. Cavendish gave me a thousand pound check, I mistated it; he, did not give me the thousand pound check, he gave me only a fifty pound; he then stated that a man on horseback rode after him, overtook him on the way, and gave him this thousand pound check.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state for what purpose he gave it him? - A. No; Mr. Paul stated to him that it was a serious circumstance, or something to that effect; Mr. Paul asked him to walk with him to the house; I imagined he meant his own house; he said, he would go with him; he said so readily; then he went away with Mr. Paul, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. It struck you very early that he was deranged and wild? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.These articles are not all plate, but several of them plated? - A. The best part of them.</p>
               <p>Q.When it was recommended to him to have a coffee-urn, he did not know what it was? - A. No, he asked the question.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you were more and more convinced of his derangement? - A. Yes; then he pointed at some candlesticks, and said, I will have them.</p>
               <p>Q.And then, with a flourish, he gave you a check for one thousand pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you looked upon it as the act of a madman, and returned the things that he had bargained for to their places? - A. Yes, there were but few of them taken out, and those were returned to their places.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact, you did not consider that any sale had taken place of these articles? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The note was thrown down, saying, send the goods and the change to Millington's coffee-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, when he went out of the shop, you looked upon him to be a madman? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q.And you did not expect, when you went to Sommers, that the draft would be paid? - A. No. I never expected it would.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you made use of the word to Mr. Sommers, that you would have it presented for form's sake? - A. I don't know that I exactly said for form's sake; I said, it must be presented, as it was given to me.</p>
               <p>Q. During this conversation, his manner was wild in general - here and there, there was a connected sentence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And he came into the shop, I believe, about an hour afterwards? - A. Yes, the third time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you make out any bill of these things? - A. NO.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to expect the draft would never be paid? - A.From the manner in which he gave it me, and the general tenor of his conduct in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.What was there to prevent the draft being paid - it was not a draft of his own? - A. It was a supposition of my own, which I stated to Mr. Sommers.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cliston. Q. You are foreman to Messrs. Grayhurst? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner in their shop at any time? - A. Yes, on Monday last, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; the prisoner came in, and asked the price of a silver tea-pot; I was in the shop when he came in; from the manner of his behaviour in coming in, I thought it was necessary to call Mr. Harvey up, to have more assistance in the shop; there were a number of goods shewn to him, and, as the things stood in the glass, he said, what is the price of these candlesticks? as soon as he was told the price of them, he said, I will have them, without examining the articles, to see whether they were good or bad; after looking at a number of articles my attention was taken to see that he did not commit any outrage, that I did not pay much attention to the things that were picked out; I recollect the tea-urn, and the coffee urn, and the tea-pot, and several other things; after they were looked out, he desired them to be cast up; they were cast up by Mr. Harvey.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Mr. Harvey inform him of the amount? - A. He did; he then gave him a piece of paper, which appeared to be, when it was opened, a draft of a thousand pounds upon Mr. Snow's banking-house; he ordered then the goods and the change of that draft to be brought to Millington's coffee-house; upon which he took himself away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who they were for? - A. I think he desired them to be left in the name of Townsend, in the care of Sir Thomas White; after he was gone, Mr. Harvey said, this man never intends to have the goods, let us put them away; then Mr. Harvey went out of the shop with the draft in his hand; while he was absent, the prisoner returned; he asked me if it was gone to the banker's; upon which I told him it was; he said, good God, and away he went immediately.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see him at any time after that? - A. Yes, an hour, or it might be two hours, I cannot say exactly the time the prisoner returned again; he asked if the draft was paid; a gentleman from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280039"/>the banking house, I believe his name was Paul, was close by the prisoner at that time; upon his asking me whether the draft was paid, Mr. Sommers said, that gentleman will best inform you, which was Mr. Paul; Mr. Paul asked him how he came by the draft, and he said, that he went down to Mr. Cavendish, and he gave him a draft of 50l. and that was all he would give him; he said, that going down the road a man came galloping after him on horseback, and gave him a draft of 1000l. and he said, good God! the old gentleman is in his dotage sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say he had said this upon receiving the draft, or did he say it in the shop? -- A. He said it in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. If I understand you right, from the time he first came into the shop, his conduct was so strange, and he looked so, that you thought it right to call for Mr. Harvey? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mean by that, that he stared widly? - A.He did, and walked about the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it the stare of a man out of his mind, as you judged? - A.It was, or I should not have left off serving him, and gone out of the shop for fear he should commit any outrage.</p>
               <p>Q.And when he was gone, you so little considered this a serious bargain to a man in his right mind, that you said the things should be put in their places again? - A. I did, and they were.</p>
               <p>Q. And many of the things that he took a fancy to, were not even taken from their places? - A. They were not removed from their places.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you happen to hear him ask what the coffee-urn meant? - A. I did, which struck me more that he was mad; I shewed him nothing after the tea-pot, for he walked up and down in that agitation, that it appeared clear to me the man was mad, and I went to the door for fear he should commit any outrage; I don't suppose the whole time of his being there was more than six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. From the whole of his demeanor, were you not satisfied that he was out of his senses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.You did not know the reason why the note was not given back to him? - A. NO.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What are you? - A. A tailor, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q.On Friday, the 26th of April, did James Harvey deliver to you a draft to take to Snow's banking-house? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Harvey.) What reason had you to employ Sommers to go with this draft? - A. Mr. Grayhurst was out of town, and he has often employed Mr. Sommers, when he has been in town, to present a bill for him, or any thing of that kind.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Sommers.) Q. Is that the draft you were employed by Harvey to take to Mr. Snow's banking-house? - A. The same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you present it for payment? - A. I did.</p>


               <p>Q.Was it paid or refused? - A. It was refused and stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at all before you had presented it? - A. I did not at all, to my knowledge; I was at Mr. Grayhurst's shop when the prisoner came in, and Mr. Paul followed him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the prisoner say any thing when he came in? - A.When he came in he asked, with a very quick voice, and a vacant look, if the note was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he know you had any thing to do with the note? - A. He did not know any thing at all about it; I was sitting in the middle of the shop, and he might suppose I belonged to it; I at that time saw Mr. Paul coming to the door; I told him, that gentleman, now coming in, would give him every satisfaction; I immediately addressed myself to Mr. Paul, and said, this is the gentleman, sir.</p>
               <p>Q.You had not seen him yourself before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, your saying this is the gentleman, was merely supposition? - A.From the description I had had of him, I knew he was the man; Mr. Paul immediately took the prisoner again, and entered into conversation with him; Mr. Paul prefaced his observation, by saying, it was a delicate and unpleasant business, for the draft that was sent to the house that morning, was suspected to be a forgery; to the best of my recollection, Mr. Paul asked him if he had the draft from Mr. Cavendish; the prisoner immediately answered, yes; but in a moment, he asked Mr. Paul, did I say I had it from Mr. Cavendish, I beg leave to correct that, for I had only fifty pounds of Mr. Cavendish; says he, upon my way back, on some common, which he mentioned, I don't recollect what common, I was overtaken by a man on horseback, who gave me a 1000l. draft, he said, good God, the old gentleman is in his dotage, sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that reflection made, as applied to Mr. Cavendish, giving him a draft upon the common? - A. I understood him so; Mr. Paul then asked him for his address, he immediately took a card out of his pocket, and under the printed words of his name, he wrote his address; the prisoner observed, that as the note was stopped, the business had better rest there; that he approved of Mr. Paul's precaution in stopping the draft, if he was not satisfied. Mr. Paul said, then I dare say you will have no objection to go to the house, meaning their banking-house; the prisoner immediately consented; I followed him all the way up, and saw him safe into the banking-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Curiosity took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280040"/>you over to see if the man was come back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were the person that he addressed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And while the conversation was going on between Mr. Paul and him, he heartily approved of what Mr. Paul had done? - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Does Mr. Cavendish keep cash at your master's house? - A. He does.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he at that time to the amount of 1000l. at your house? - A. I dare say he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the writing of Mr. Cavendish? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt that it is not his handwriting? - A. I don't believe it is.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that draft, and tell me if it was paid at your house the same day as the draft of Mr. Cavendish? - A. This draft was paid the following day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be Mr. Cavendish's hand-writing? - A. I do; it is a sort of handwriting that I have been used to.</p>
               <p>Q.Before the draft for 1000l. was presented at your house, did you see the gentleman at the bar? - A. Yes, about ten minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. Relate exactly and minutely all that passed between you and him before the 1000l. note was presented? - A. He came into the house, and enquired whether a draft of 1000l. had been presented for payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention whose draft for 1000l.? - A. I enquired of him whose draft for 1000l. and he replied Mr. Henry Cavendish's; he then went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any means to satisfy him whether it was or not? - A. He did not give me time, he went away immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not tell him whether the draft had been paid or not? - A. I told him no, it had not been presented, and then he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that of your own recollection, or did you refer to the book to ascertain? - A. Yes, I referred to the book; he came in the second time, and did not speak, but sat down on a stool by the sine of the counter, and pulled off his hat, wiped his face, and seemed agitated; then he got up and went out; I had not missed him from the counter a minute, I dare say, before the draft arrived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards receive that paper? - A. Yes I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the draft had been presented did that paper come? - A. About three minutes after the 1000l. draft was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know who brought it? - A. I don't know his name, the man who keeps a small shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it Williams, who keeps the chandler's shop in Devereux-court? - A.It is his son I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again afterwards? - A. Yes, I saw him come into the house with Mr. Paul.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what passed after he returned with Mr. Paul? - A. NO, I did not; a constable was sent for and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Raine. Q. The second time that this gentleman came into your shop, he sat down, wiped his face, and seemed in a state of agitation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And went out again without enquiring after this or any thing else? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That appeared strange to you, did it not? - A.It looked odd certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you at all expect that the person who came there was at all deranged? - A. I had not time to form an opinion, he was there so short a time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did he first ask you? - A.Whether a draft of 1000l. had been presented.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him any answer before you enquired whose draft he meant? - A.No, he had got the door in his hand when I asked him whose draft he meant, and he said Henry Cavendish.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you asked him that before he had the door in his hand to go out? - A. That was the only enquiry he made; whether a draft had been presented of a 1000l. I asked whose draft, he said Mr. Henry Cavendish's.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had given him no answer before you asked him whose draft? - A. No, I had not: I reserved to my book and said no; it was then that he had the door in his hand and went out.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that? - A. This is the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you property to that amount, in your house, belonging to Mr. Cavendish? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280041"/>Q. Are you acquainted with Mr. Henry Cavendish's hand-writing? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that his hand-writing? - A. I believe it not to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, in consequence of some conversation you had with Sommers, you stopped payment? - A.Mr. Gubbins came to me with this draft, to ask me if I thought it was Mr. Cavendish's hand, and whether I would have it paid, I told him I thought it was not his writing, and I would not have it paid.</p>
               <p>Q. The paper you now have in your hand is a draft for 50l.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that his hand-writing? - A. Yes, I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I will just take the liberty, for form sake, of asking did you ever see Mr. Cavendish write? - A. I have seen him write often.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. After you had stopped payment of the draft of 1000l. what then? - A. At the moment I was questioning Sommers, a boy brought in the paper which I have in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q.In consequence of what the boy stated to you, where did you go? - A. I first went to Mr. Grayhurst's shop, in order to ascertain that that was the person who brought the draft, I then went to Bow-street to consult with Townsend, and then I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what the boy had told you did you go to Devereaux-court? - A. I did sometime after.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after? - A. I should suppose rather more than an hour; I went into a chandler's shop in Devereaux-court, and there I saw the prisoner at the bar conversing with a woman, who seemed to keep the shop; from his conversation with the woman, I conceived he might be the man in question; I asked the woman if the boy was within who had brought a note to our house, upon which the prisoner left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How close was he to you at the time? - A. Quite close; it is a very small shop; I followed the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the woman made you an answer whether the boy was within or not? - A. She said the boy was not within, and then the prisoner left the shop; I followed him and kept him in fight, and I fancied he saw I observed him; I still followed him; he crossed the way, as wishing rather to avoid me; he then passed up between the New-Church, in the Strand; I still followed him; he soon after stopped and looked in at a print shop; I did the same, until he went on again; he soon after turned into Mr. Grayhurst's shop, which confirmed me in the belief that he was the man I wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow him into the shop? - A. I did; upon coming into the shop, I found him conversing with persons in the shop, and asking why the draft was not paid, upon which, one of Mr. Grayhurst's people seeing me come in, said, here is the gentleman who will tell you why it is not paid; upon which I said, to the prisoner, there are some suspicious circumstances about this draft that I shall be glad to have explained; I said, considering him as a gentleman, I wished he would sit down, and let me converse with him upon the subject; he said readily, I will give you any information in my power, upon which we both fat down in the shop; I said, will you be so good, Sir, as to tell me how you came in possession of this draft? he said, I was sent by the Duke of Devonshire to his cousin Mr. Henry Cavendish, for the purpose of soliciting relief for Mr. 
               <persName id="t18020428-49-person366">J. </persName>
            Cavendish, a prisoner in the Fleet, which is the name the draft is made payable to; he stated that Mr. Cavendish gave him two drafts, one for 1000l. and one for 50l. that the 50l. he had paid into his bankers, Messrs. Biddulph and Cocks, and the 1000l. was the note in question; very soon after this he corrected himself and said, I mistated to you that I got the 1000l. from Mr. Cavendish, I only got 50l. from Mr. Cavendish, a man on horse back came gallopping after me, whom I do not know, and said Mr. Cavendish has relented, and sent 1000l. more; upon which he took up his hat and was preparing to go away; he said, I am not in want of money, when you have satisfied yourself of the truth of the draft, I conclude you will pay it; he was preparing to go away, I felt determined he should not go away without being further questioned, I then asked him if he would be so good as to go with me to the banking house, and enable himself to judge of our reasons for refusing it; to this he readily consented; we went together from Mr. Grayhurst's to the banking-house, and in going along conversed on many subjects, particularly as to Mr. Cavendish's habits of life, in which conversation he was perfectly clear; he gave me an account of Mr. Cavendish and his habits, which led me to conclude he knew something of him; he also told me some of the particulars of the causes of the imprisonment of Mr. Cavendish, who is in the steet, by which time we got to the banking-house, I put him into the back room, and told him I must be under the necessity of detaining him; I sent for a constable, and then for a Bow-street officer; he said it was very inconvenient to him to be detained there; he had business in the city which would suffer by his absence, and requested I would let him go; he was then taken to Bow-street, and there left.</p>

               <p>Q.During the whole of your interview with him, from the time yousaw him in Deverea uxcourt till you left him at Bow-street, did it ever occur to your mind, that, from his general department, he was a man labouring under any derange<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280042"/>ment of mind? - A. No, certainly not, on the contrary I thought his general deportment that of an innocent man, or rather of a man who made himself appear innocent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. After he had told you he had received them both from Mr. Caveadish, he corrected himself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home from Mr. Grayhurst's shop, he entored familiarly and reasonably into a full conversation with respect to Mr. Cavendish, and the young man in the Fleet? - A. I led him into conversation to amuse him as we past along, to find how far he was acquainted with the family.</p>
               <p>Q.And he communicated his knowledge of the family without any reserve? - A. Yes, and with a great appearance of innocence, as I thought.(The thousand pound draft read.)</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the examination signed by him? - A. It was written by me, and signed by him in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the contents read over to him before he signed it? - A. I read it over to him myself, and asked him if he perfectly understood it, and whether he had any objection to sign it; he said, he perfectly understood it, that it was true, and therefore he could have no objection to sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, at that time, the least suspicion that he was a man who had not his inte lects about him? - A. There was one part particularly; that, in which he says, Mr. Chesterman overtook him upon the road, and delivered the note to him; to which I called his particular attention, stating to him, that the truth or salsehood of tha would be so easily proved, as he assured me he knew Mr. Chesterman, and there was extreme danger in admitting such a knowledge of the gentleman, unless it was true that he actually did know him, and delivered to him the note; but he was so consident, and behaved in such a manner, that convinced me the impression was strong on his mind that the fact had really taken place the preceding day, and therefore I really did believe that he actually was in a deranged state, for that reason.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the only reason for your thinking so? - A. No; he afterwards walked about the room singing and whistling, shewing evident signs beyond what I have now stated of a deranged mind, or such a degree of insanity as to throw one off one's guard, and make one believe he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. If I under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280043"/>stand you right, your notion was, that he was at that time acting, as is very common for a madman, under mistaken impressions? - A.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Townsend? - A. I have known him since the middle of last April; he was recommended to me as a man of honour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he, to your knowledge, or by your authority, made any applications for pecuniary assistance among your friends? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you aware, before the Monday on which this business happened, of any intended application by him to Mr. Cavendish, of Clapham? - A. Yes, I did, in consequence of a letter I received from the Duke of Devonshire.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you aware, from any thing the prisoner had told you, that he meant to make application to Mr. Cavendish, of Clapham? - A. He told me some days before that he had made an application to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on Monday morning, the 26th of April? - A. I did, about eleven o'clock, or between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what conversation happened respecting this business of Mr. Cavendish? - A. I asked him if he had obtained any money from Mr. Cavendish, and he said he had not received any money from Mr. Cavendish, but Mr. Cavendish does not say but what he will assist you at a future time.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you saw him on the Monday, did his manner at all strike you as being particular? - A. He seemed to be in a great hurry, as he generally was when he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all that struck you on that day? - A. Nothing more; I had been accustomed to see him conduct himself in that way, always in a great hurry, and wishing to get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion of his being incapable of doing business from derangement? - A. If I had suspected him to be incapable, I should not have taken the liberty of sending him with a letter to the Duke of Devonshire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. I take it, unless you had supposed he was in his right mind, you would not have commissioned him to apply to any of your relations? - A.Certainly not; he was recommended to me, in a very strong manner, as a man of humanity and honour.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not from any accidental intimacy between you and him, but from the recommendation of other? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by the recommendation of one, or two, or three? - A. By the recommendation of one.</p>
               <p>Q. His constant way was to be in a hurry? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he leave it with you, or did he leave any cash? - A. I paid him five pounds, the other forty-five pounds was placed to the credit of his account.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you observe any thing particular at that time more than at any other time? - A. Not that day particularly, but at other times latterly I have; he has been particularly enervated; his hands shook a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q.From his behaviour, had you any idea that he was deranged at all in his intellects? - A. I cannot say my observation went so far as that.</p>

               <p>Mr. JOSEPH HIGGINSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. Q. You are a merchant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were acquainted with the gentleman at the bar for many years? - A. For many years; we were at College together.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his habits of life - polished or otherwise? - A. A man of education, accustomed to fashionable society, and perfectly discreet in his demeanor: On Sunday, the 18th of last month, I went to dine with the Rev. Mr. Maule, who is chaplain to Greenwich Hospital, and we were sitting after dinner, Mrs. Higginson, Mr. Maule's family, and I; when, about five or six o'clock, Mr. Townsend entered the room, much to my surprise, as I knew he had not been invited, and was scarcely known to the family; and his manner surprised me still more, for, without addressing himself particularly to any of the company, or apologising for his extraordinary intrusion, he laid hold of a small table, which stood in a corner of the room, pushed it forward, set down, and said he would dine there; Mrs. Maule expressed her concern that the dinner had been removed some time, and, being neither hot or cold, it would be unpleasant, but said, there was cold meat in the house; he answered, in a hurried manner, that that would do, but that he must have potatoes; the servant was desired to bring up the cold meat and potatoes, but on returning with the cold meat, he said there were no potatoes; on which Mr. Townsend surprised me, by desiring him to go to the Sceptre tavern for some; I expostulated upon the impropriety of giving such trouble, upon which he made use of an oath, saying, d - n it, I have credit there, let them charge it to my account, or I will pay for it. In the interval, before dinner was brought up, Mr. Townsend had some conversation about our friends at Bath, which appeared incoherent; he said, he had just returned from Bath, and had been overturned in a gig at Reading, and bled five times, which led to the conversation, and his answers appeared very unsatisfactory and incoherent; when the ladies departed to the drawing-room, to whom he was very inattentive when present, he still surprised and mortified me by the indelicacy of his conversation with Mr. Maule, a respectable clergyman, with whom he was scarcely acquianted; I had never observed such conduct in him before; his conduct was so eccentric, so extravagant, and so wild, that I considered him under temporary derangement, or that it must be the effect of continued intoxication; I took him in my carriage part of the way home, when he left me. The next morning he called upon me, when his conduct was very unusual and extraordinary, for, when he came into the room, he neither inquired how we got home or any other circumstance; then he looked at the tea-table, and expressed a wish to have such a tea equipage; and, among other things, he told me that the Duke of Devonshire was to bring him into Parliament, and that he expected to get the agency or receivership of his Grace's rents, so that he expected they would produce him a thousand pounds in the course of the year. I then began to think him an object sit to be confined, which idea was corroborated by what I heard; and I even consulted my friend, Dr. Hamilton, and eminent physician, on the subject: On Friday I saw him again; Mrs. Higginson had asked me permission to give orders to the servants to deny him, on account of his wild manner, and accordingly had been denied on the Thursday, but on Friday I was called down, and found him there; he addressed me in a very abrupt manner, desiring me to write to my friend, Sir

I knew he was settled in England, and had left the Irish bar several years; I expostulated upon the absurdity of such an idea, and he said, he could attend to the duties of his office, and still live in England, which confirmed the suspicions I had he was deranged; and, on Monday, the 26th, I made application to Mr. O'Brien; I did not know any of his relations in England, and not withing to take upon myself the responsibility of confining him, I went to Mr. O'Brien's house, but he not being at home, I left a card, informing him I had called respecting a mutual friend, but that the subject was of too delicate a nature to state on paper, and therefore requested an interview with him as soon as he could favour me with it, or words to that effect; I did not receive any answer from him till Tuesday night, and on the following morning I waited on him, and then, for the first time, to my astonishment, learnt he was confined upon a charge of forgery.</p>

            , to write to Lord Eldon, to write to Lord Redesdale, to get him a place of commissioner of hankrupts; his manner was so wild and incoherent, it confirmed me he was insane, and I urged my partner to take some sleps towards getting him confined. Mr. Townsend called on the Sunday morning, and then his behaviour was wild and incoherent; he told me he was going to Elstree to visit Mr. O'Connol's family, and, from the state of his mind, as it appeared to me. I lamented very much that he should think of going there at all.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. Q. You are an attorney? - A. Yes, and have known Mr. Townsend two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, of late, observed any alteration in his conduct? - A. Yes; last Wednesday week he called upon me in Serjeant's Inn, and came into the room in a very volatile and particular manner - in a very hurried manner, and said he wanted 30,000l. upon an estate, that a receiver was to be appointed, and then he was going out of the room again; I called him back, and laughed at his request, it being so ridiculous, and asked him where he was going? he said, he was going to Hampstead; I asked him if he would go with me to Hornsey, which he did. Going along, he talked of having taken a house at Camberwell, and that he was about to be married to a lady of large fortune, and many other extraordinary subjects of conversation; when we got to Hornsey, he in an unusual manner, set himself down, with his knees close to the fire, and asked what we had for dinner. and said he must have some cold roast bees and potatoes, which we had not; he found fault with the fallad, and otherwise conducted himself in a way that struck me with astonishment; the next day, when he was going away, he walked off with a favourite dog, and went on so as to induce me, at the time, to declare I was sure he was out of his mind, and that I would go after him, which I did, and got the dog back; the whole of his conversation was so indecorous, indecent, and unlike what it ever was before, that I was convinced he was out of his mind, and, upon coming to town, I communicated it to Mr. Higginson the next morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. RODERICK O'CONNOR sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q.Did you see that unfortunate man at your mother's on the 17th of April? - A. Yes, and on the 24th, when I thought his conduct very odd to what it was before; he asked my mother for a piece of beef that lay on the table, to take home with him in his gig, wrapped up in a napkin; he told my mother he would pray for her all the days of his life, if she would let him take the piece of beef away with him, which he did, but before he went, he invited himself to dinner the next day, and said, he would come at three o'clock, and we might dine at any time we liked; on Sunday he came after we had all dined, and he sent me into the other room to see if there was a fire, for he was very cold; the fire had been just lit, and he told my mother to come and make it up, and bring the bellows to blow it; I hardly knew what to think of his conduct.</p>

               <p>Q. So that you had it from himself, that all the implements and tools were left with the brother? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had it from himself, that his wife went to the brother to get these things? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you given evidence before you received that letter? - A. I believe about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q.Having had all this time to reflect upon the dreadful situation of the prisoner himself, and of your own situation, you have disclosed to the Solicitor of the Bank, and to the Magistrates, all that you know? - A. I have, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q.Let me exhort you to consider where you stand, and tell me if it is true, as far as you have related, that the prisoner was so concerned? - A. Every thing I have said is true.</p>
               <p>Q. You are aware you have called God to witness the truth of what you have said; and also, of the dreadful situation of that man? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me call your attention back again to Weston street; all the implements that were made use of there, you learnt from him, were destroyed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What notes were struck off from any of the implements that he had at Weston-street when you saw him at work - what sums? - A. Five pound notes; nothing else at Weston-street.</p>
               <p>Q. And after this it was, that you received from him this five pound note that you gave to Miss Siddons? - A. Yes.(Two letters from the prisoner to Gillington, read as follows:)"My Dear Gillington,"I have seriously considered my situation, and how I stand for mercy at their hands if I do not exert myself in time; for by lying by dormant, and saying nothing, would never get me off; therefore it is the best to take advantage of what little time there is left, to persuade them to accept of my plan, and so soften them to save my life for transportation; for if I receive sentence of death they cannot save me, as the public clamor would be so great against me then. - What you alone have said is sufficient to do me out, though I know you cannot help in on your own account, but be as light as possible on me, as I hope that Dick will be sent to Canterbury out of the way. I am very much in doubt of my plan being accepted, as there was a man of the name of Weston suffered six years ago, who offered another for the same purpose, but they would not listen to him; and by their eagerness at present, in prosecuting me, I sear they are determined on my ruin; but they never shall know a word of it without saving my life first.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280049"/>"I write you this, that your sears might not take the alarm, as you might think I wanted to get the inside of you, as an evidence, by my sending letters out, and thereby you might conceive a dislike to me, and so injure me the more on my trial; but may I never see God if I have the least notion any longer of such a proceeding, nor had I since you done so yourself. If nothing does to save me, let my death be a curse on England for ever; indeed, it is the only consolation I have, because, if England had not stirred up a rebellion in Ireland for its own purposes, and so set us all starving, we never should think of doing what we have done.</p>
               <p>"If I'm cast, offer to transport yourself to save me for the same, as I intended to do so for you, because we might get off for America from the Bay. If I die, I intend to have a merry death, for I will petition the Bank to allow me an Irish piper, from the time I receive sentence, to play in my cell, and promise to give them the plan before I am turned off, but disappoint them after in giving it.</p>
               <p>"I intend from this out to pester them with letters, and enlarge on the merits of my plan, and tell them what advantage it will be to them, and the nation at large, (for it really is a capital one) as by it their credit will be firm, &amp;c. &amp;c. and it is impossible to imitate it without a speedy detection.</p>
               <p>"I must put a great deal of blarney and boasting in it also, as there is nothing like impudence and persuasion in such a desperate case as this, for it will do more than the interest of the Court with them, or the first man in the land, for instance, Governor Wall for that.</p>

               <p>"If they reject my offer, I must change my battery with them after sentence, and get friends out doors to annoy and frighten them into compliance by the transparency, and threaten to spread it like wild-fire, over town and country; this, or something like it, saved Lane."</p>
               <p>"Dear James,"If Betsey has stagged on us our sate hangs on a wire; therefore, you must only make the best of it on the trial to clear up the point about the girl's knowing of it. I am sorry you did not tell it at first more clear, and it would have saved you from anxiety of mind; as well as me, if any thing bad should happen to you, I have no chance at all.</p>
               <p>"If in case that my plan is rejected, and that "I am doomed to de gad," (which God forbid) they will, of course, get a letter from abroad about the transparency; of course, you will be questioned about it; do you then deny any knowledge of the party or parties concerned, but that you believe that there are a great number of my particular friends who know it, which I have told it purposely to, in case any thing had should happen me; you may say there are three or four in Ireland who know it, as you heard me several times say so, and those are relations of mine, (young men); say then that I have a great number (you believe) of acquaintances from different parts of Ireland, for that I have been in a great many towns in my rambles through Ireland, and that I have lived in Cork, Limerick, Kilkenny,&amp;c. &amp;c. where it was impossible for you to know my acquaintances, as you never were in any of them towns; besides, I was twelve months, or more, here before you came.</p>
               <p>This is the way Newell worked on the Secret Committee, and so horrified them to proclaim Martial Law.</p>
               <p>If you see the Griffin then any way thoughtful, or thinking what to do, take advantage of it, and say that you also heard me often talk of a plan I had in view to prevent forgeries, but that I said I was afraid of their having some knowledge of me, which prevented my ever offering it; pretend to be innocent of my having any discourse with you in the prison.</p>
               <p>If all this does not do, and that you don't stand my friend so far, the Lord have mercy on my soul! I communicate my last thoughts to you on this paper having a confidence in you, that you won't betray my intentions, even if it was to save your life, which it would not if you were cast.</p>
               <p>I would have wrote to them about the plan before, only I knew when you would hear it you might suspect it was about other business, therefore I thought it better to defer it till I communicated my thoughts to you on the subject, to make your mind easy; however, if you have any doubts still on your mind, tell me candidly of it to day.</p>
               <p>By writing to them in time, they may take my letter into consideration, and it might hinder them from looking for evidence to swear against me, as I have put off so little - and they might overlook the printing of them, &amp;c. As Dick would be a sufficient meal for them to satiate their vengeance on, and they might say the rest were sled.</p>
               <p>In case I die, and that you survive, petition to have me buried in Pancras, Sommers Town; but I cannot tell, in case of forgery, whether my friends or the b - y doctors can have my body; I would like my friends to have it of course, and to be buried six feet deep.</p>
               <p>I believe Lymbery is in custody since the day he went to Pentonville, as he would have gone to tell Dick of what happened; it is natural to think so, as being an acquaintance, same as Miller; besides they might have doubt of your information, which would make them keep him; it was lucky, however, for had Dick heard of our being in custody he would have come forward without asking, or running away, which you may judge from his letter, and so swear every thing plump, as to leave no hopes for either of us.</p>
               <p>"Lymbery gave me to understand that he heard some broad hints of the cran from Lauglin, &amp;c. &amp;c.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280050"/>so I told him about it, for the purpose of bringing me news, but he never got one, as I knew he had not the courage to do it.</p>
               <p>"I will write to Carolan to-day, watch for him at the window at one the next day, and at three o'clock also; if he puts up both his hands in the air, it is a token that he got two letters from me, and one for Beisey. And if he points to Pentonville with his hand, it is a token that she got it safe. - If he is determined to stand my friend he will put his hand on his breast. - If there is a shark in the house he will take off his hat.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gillington.) Q. Do you know who is meant by Dick? - A. Power.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Power a man connected with you in this business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Matthew Power the same person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is meant by the word cran? - A.Forged notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is meant by Carolan? - A. He was an apothecary.</p>
               <p>Q. What connections had you two with Carolan? - A. We were very intimate with him two years; and latterly, we joined in a medicine, he was a proprietor, and we gave him money.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you become possessed of that money? - A. By forged notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know, of your own knowledge, or from any thing the prisoner has told you, where it was he frabricated the paper, if he did fabricate it? - A. I saw him compleat it in Bristol.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know from him how he came first to forge a five pound note? - A. I believe, by the instigation of Power.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company when there was any conversation between him and Power upon this business? - A. I was; Power told him it would be better for him to engrave a five pound plate; he said, there was no more danger, or not so much, in passing a five pound note than a one; this conversation was at Bath, and the prisoner agreed that he would engrave the plate if Power would get him a good copy.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by a good copy? - A. A new note; a new original Bank of England note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Power procure him one? - A. He did, for cash, at the Bank, which e gave to Fennell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go to Bath? - A.He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he commence his work of engraving? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the plate that he afterwards worked at Pentonville? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his having been in possession of any other plates at any time? - A. Yes; a two pound plate I saw him engrave.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that? - A. He told me he left it on the step of a door, somewhere about the neighbourhood of Clerkenwell, or Grays-Inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Q.When did he say that? - A.About August last.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever, in your own custody, that plate? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q.How did it get out of your hands? - A. I gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. And he told you he had left this plate at the step of a door as you have described it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you had the possession of the plate, and had an opportunity of taking notice of it, was there any thing upon it, by which you can safely say you should know it again? - A. Yes; it was bruised on or near the edge of it, as if by accident, and the maker's name stamped upon the back of it, it was delivered to me by his wife.</p>
               <p>Q.Just cast your eye upon that, and say, if you think that is or is not the same plate that you delivered back? - A. There is a mark on this that there was not on that, here is the remains of the mark yet, and there was something on the plate then that does not now appear.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, or not, believe that that is the plate you delivered back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there an x at the back of it? - A. Yes, there is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing about the maker's name that leads you to believe it is the same? - A. All that I remember of it is, that there is an x in it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was this mark over the figure of 2 upon it when you had it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did he tell you why he desired to get rid of this plate? - A.Because there was no paper made for one and two pound notes, and he should have the trouble of making another machine, for the engraving was altered in the two pound notes, and that was of no use to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else? - A. He said, out of a joke, he would send it to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were examined against the prisoner on the Tuesday after he was brought to town? - A. Not against him; on my own account.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you were first examined against the prisoner? - A. I do not exactly remember the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you were brought to town? - A. I believe about a fortnight, or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you were examined before the Magistrate, you were examined at the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. My learned friend asked you whether you had disclosed the whole to the Bank, and you said you had? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you give me within a trifle, the number of forged Bank-notes you told the Directors of the Bank you had put off? - A. I believe I did not tell them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280051"/>Q. Now speaking quite within compass, can you tell us how many forged Bank-notes you have put off, one hundred? - A. Yes, more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Two hundred? - A. More.</p>
               <p>Q. Three hundred? - A.More than that, I suppose five or six hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. You know them all to be forged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was taken up at Liverpool, and when you was brought to town, and charged before the Magistrate, you knew perfectly well you were charged with the crime of forgery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, with a consciousness in your own mind of having put off five or six hundred, and that you were in custody upon that charge, I take it for granted, you began to think your days were numbered, that your end was near? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. It then occurred to you, that it was a more convenient thing to be hanged by proxy than in person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you told the Bank, if they would save you, you would give evidence against the prisoner? - A. I told them I would tell all I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not expressly state that you would give evidence against the prisoner, if they would spare you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them so to understand? - A. I told them I would tell all I knew concerning the forgery, and all who were concerned in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you named Power to them, did you? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You named the prisoner to them? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And Miller? - A. No, he was not concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. He was your very particular friend? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. You offered to give evidence against these persons, if they would save you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard that Miss Belley Evans was seduced by the prisoner, under a promise of marriage - was she not living in the house with him and his wife? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was lodging in the same house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you were confined, you and he were both confined in Cold Bath fields prison? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw each other frequently? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw each other after you had given information? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you intended to do it before you did it? - A. Not long, it was asked of me.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew perfectly well you should be hanged if you did not - A. I did not know.</p>
               <p>Had you the least doubt that you should be hanged? - A. I thought I should.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew you should be tried? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you should be hanged? - A. No, I did not know whether I should or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt? - A. I was tolerably sure I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, in order to make sure that you should not, you knew it was convenient to get his hand; did you not tell him, if he wrote to the Bank, it might save him? - A. I told him it might.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not get the letters from him for the very purpose of producing them in evidence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What then? - A. That he might save himself, because he told me his plan would save him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not desire him to write these very letters for the purpose of you yourself giving evidence of them? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you desire him to write them for? - A. I did not desire him.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say, you desired him to offer his plan to the Bank, with a perfectly friendly view to serve him? - A. Yes, certainly I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not told any body before hand, that you could get a little writing from him? - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not suggested that it would be convenient to get a little of his writing to confirm the evidence of a man like you? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. It passed but lately - you have been telling us the transactions of months and years past, you might tell us what has passed within these six weeks? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You were kept separately - for what purpose was it you were suffered to talk to him, was it not on purpose to get something out of him? - A. No, it was not, the room that I was in was at the top, and he was at the bottom, and my door was left open, so that I might have gone down into the yard, and spoke to him through his window.</p>
               <p>Q. The door was left open that you might go and converse with him? - A. Not for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not these conversations for the purpose of getting evidence against him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you never wrote to him with a view to get any thing from him? - A. Not any thing to give in evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never write to him with a view of getting an answer from him of any sort? - A. I wrote to him about some money that he owed me.</p>
               <p>Q. About nothing else? - A. And to tell him to exert himself with his plan, and send it to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Any thing else? - A. That I would serve his wife if I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not write with a view of an answer? - A. I expected he would send an answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you employ as your messenger? - A. The turnkey.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner then in Cold Bath-fields? - A. No, in Newgate.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280052"/>Q.Did you not send by the turnkey a pencil, for the purpose of getting an answer? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the turnkey to take a pencil with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now man, look that Jury in the face, and say if you did not write that to get an answer to give in evidence against him? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is as true as all the rest you have sworn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Though you would utter five or six hundred forged Bank-notes, I dare say you would not tell a lie for the world, you are a man of great veracity - have you never said, you would not mind how you swore? - A. I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say, you should not much regret a false oath? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never said, you would no more mind taking a false oath, than swallowing an oyster? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never said you would not mind swearing falsely to an Orange man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been a little awkwardly situated in Ireland, have you not? - A. Not much.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of charge did any wicked man bring against you, a worthy member of society, I dare say you were innocent. -</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot make him worse than he has made himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did some vile, wicked, ras cally informer charge you with any thing? - A. I was taken up as a United Irishman.</p>
               <p>Q. I will not ask you what oath you took, because we knew that before - were you ever questioned in any other sort of Court in London? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor in Dublin? - A. I was by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said, you would no more mind swearing falsely against an Orange man, than you would eating an oyster? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a man of the name of Barton? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you never say that in the presence of Barton? - A. I never said it in any one's presence to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. To your knowledge - it is a matter of doubt then, is it? - A. I am almost certain I did not; I do not recollect ever so expressing myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. The prisoner knew that you had given information before the Magistrate, and had made your terms with the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would very willingly that his life should be saved by his plan going to the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that forms a great part of the letters? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He himself knowing, when he conversed with you, and when he wrote to you, that you had given evidence against him, and were to come here against him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are both of the same persuasion, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. My learned friend asked you if you had not been concerned in these iniquitous transactions to the amount of five hundred pounds - who had you all these notes from? - A. From Fennell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in town before you sent to the solicitor of the Bank, telling him what you would do? - A.Three or four days.</p>

               <p>Q. Having done this, what did you afterwards do? - A. I attempted to search them, and the prisoner at the bar resisted; I said, it was too late, and I must take all from them; I searched them, and found a quantity of money, gold watches, one upon each, bank-notes, breast-pins, and trinkets of that nature; I sent for a hackney-coach, and took them before the Mayor.</p>

He lodged with me in the month of August, 1799, and for about five or six months he went by the name of Findlay; I know Gillington, who used to come backwards and forwards; he went by his own name.</p>
               <p>AMY DANSEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a plate of copper at any time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When was it? - A. I don't know the day of the month; it is six or seven months ago.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you find it? - A. At the end of Sassion-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on any Fair day? - A. Yes, on Peckham Fair day; I found it at No. 11, Little Saffronhill, on the third step of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and say whether it is the same? (shewing her a plate.) - A. Mr. Pontisex's name is on it, Shoe-lane.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you take it to? - A. To Mr. Butler, of Wood-street, Spa-fields; it was mentioned to the Gentlemen of Hatton-garden, and I was fetched there directly; Mr. Butler took me and the plate together, and there it was left.</p>
               <p>Mr. GARNETT TERRY sworn. - Examined by Mr Fielding. Q. You are engraver to the Bank of England? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that five-pound bank-note? - A. It is a forged one.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that plate - how long have you been an engraver? - A.Thirty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to form any judgment whether the engraving of that plate and the five-pound note are done by the same person? - A. I examined them by two impressions, and I believe they are done by the same hand; the same mode of applying the tool, and the same mode of finishing the up and down stroke of the legs of the M's and N's, in each, of them; we find no difficulty; we know different person's work, and we know the mode of applying the tool, and cutting the stroke.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that now produced? (shewing him a round piece of wood.) - A. This appears to be a bit of box, and this to be a part of the bottom of another press.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that flat board? - A. I never saw it before; it seems to have had whiting on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it to lay work upon? - A. Such a thing as this would do as a plank to put between two rollers for printing, and then the impression would be made; this is what we call the part of a cross, which is applied to a spindle.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that be an effential article to complete any thing printed? - A. Yes, it is stained with printing-ink, I perceive.</p>
               <p> - CARPMEAL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are an officer? - A. Yes, I searched the lodgings of the prisoner, in Weston-street, on the 27th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any graving tools? - A. Yes.(Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Terry. This is a proper graving tool; this we call a draw-point, or burnisher, but I don't think it has been used for that; they are part of such tools as must be used in engraving.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the paper which was found there - is that a paper upon which a fabrication may be made? - A.It is not such paper as the note is; it is extra thin post.</p>
               <p>Mr. Terry, Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say that note, which you have examined, and the paper, are not of the same quality? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to the press, it is not complete? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, are the other things in such a complete state to be used without something else belonging to them? - A. No, there must be something else.</p>
               <p>Q. Every engraver must have a complete press for the purpose of taking off impressions? - A. Yes, he could not do it with such as these.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, the papers which were found in Mr. Gillington's possession, which he says were of my writing, are nothing but a gross forgery of his own, I fancy; I have some witnesses to prove Gillington's oath is not to be taken.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A victualler, in Windmill-street, in the Haymarket, and keep the Ham and Windmill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Gillington, the witness, who has been examined here to-day? - A. Yes, he lodged at my mother's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known much of him? - A. I have known him for about three years.</p>
               <p>Q.Is he a man, who, from your knowledge of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280058"/>him, you would venture to believe upon his oath? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why would you not believe him on his oath? - A.Because I have heard him make frequent declarations that he would not mind taking a false oath if he had any interest at stake.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he more than once repeated that, or once particularly? - A. I recollect a particular circumstrice; there was a dispute about whether any Lord was called upon to take an oath, and one said, he only said upon his honour; and then Mr. Gillington said, it was all nonsense about an oath, he would no more mind swallowing an oath than he would swallowing an oyster.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. What were they talking about at this time - about the united Irish? - A. No; some one said, a Lord was not called upon to take an oath, only to declare upon his honour; and another said, a Lord was sworn the same as any one else.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that you were singled out to-day to tell us this? - A. I don't know I am sure.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This was in a public-house where they were all drinking? - A. Yes, about nine months ago, as near as I can recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the company? - A. A man of the name of Moore, and another of the name of Sarson; I only saw the prisoner two or three times with Mr. Gillington; he came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. It shocked you very much to hear a man talk so? - A. I thought it a very improper expression.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you? - A. An Englishman; I was shocked at the expression, or I should not have remarked it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing particular? - A. I met with Gillington at a public-house, in Poland-street, and the conversation was with respect to a man who had fled from Ireland, and for whom there was a reward offered; Gillington, at the same time, got me to write a letter to this young man; he had fled for a rape committed on a young lady, a relation of the post-master of the town where Gillington came from; he fled, and two men were hung; there was a reward for him; I wrote a letter for him, and saw Gillington some time after, and asked him if he had sent it off; he said, no; but he had copied it, and put another name to it; he wanted me to have this man apprehended, and I received a letter from Mr. Fennell some time after, not to have any thing to do with the man's life; I talked to Gillington respecting the affair; he laughed at me, and said, he would think nothing of taking a thousand false oaths to hang an Orange man if it came to that.</p>

               <p>Q. You have seen Fennell and Gillington in company together since that? - A. They were in company.</p>
               <p>Q. They were very intimate - were they not? - A. I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen them in company together? - A. Four times, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. How long since? - A. The last time I saw them was in the beginning of last August; there were a great many in company.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did the prisoner live in August last? - A. His house was in Bristol.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he live in London? - A. He did, for he was in London, but I cannot say where he lived.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Is he a man you would believe upon his oath? - A. No, he is not.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at those two letters? - A. If those are his hand-writing, it is not similar to any I have seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it is or not? - A. I do believe it is not, but I cannot say it is not upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. How long have you been acquainted with him? - A. I have known him about four years, and have been in his company a dozen times; I have seen his letters to his wife.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you read the whole of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a fourth time? - A. I cannot swear to the fourth time; I might see him write many more than four times, but three I will swear to.</p>
               <p>- KIMBER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. Do you know the prisoner's hand-writing? - A. I don't know, whether I do or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write? - A.Only five or six weeks in another man's books; I have known him to write, but not seen him write; I have been concerned in business belonging to another man, and he has wrote in the book; I have not seen him writing, but I have seen his writing.</p>

               <p>Q. You do allow prisoners pens and ink, but see what they send out - was Gillington allowed pen, ink, and paper? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You ordered no pens, ink, and paper to me before I was sent to Newgate? - A. No, I did not, probably my father did; prior to your last examination, you wrote letters privately to Gillington, that is a convincing proof you had pens, ink, and paper.</p>

               <p>Q. You never saw me write letters? - A.Never.</p>

            , West Moulsey-lodge, Surrey; on the 13th of March, I came to town to see my friends; I went into the city, and returned towards home about three o'clock in the afternoon: I parted with a friend of mine in Fleet-street, that was between three and four o'clock; I then took a hackneycoach to the Golden-Cross, Charing-cross, because I thought I was rather behind my time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your only reason for taking a hackney-coach? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What state were you in? - A. I was not in a state of sensibility.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean that you had drank too much? - A. I do; I was set down at the Golden Cross, Charing-cross; and there I requested of the prisoner at the bar to direct me the way to the White-Horse-Cellar, where the coach went from; he was standing near the gate-way of the Golden-Cross; he was dressed in a white jacket, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the stage go from the Golden-Cross? - A. No; I told him I wanted to take the stage to go to Hampton; he agreed to go with me, and I gave him fifteen-pence; I had a bundle, which I desired him to carry: He took me out of the road, but not being acquainted with that part of the town, I could not tell where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you now know where he took you to? - A. Yes, to <placeName id="t18020428-59-crimeloc323">St. James's, near Jermyn-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. That is the direct road; what passed then? - A. He told me the Hampton coach was gone.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were you when he told you that? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280069"/>A.Near St. James's Church; I refused to go any further, and he desired to be satisfied.</p>

               <p>Q. You had given him fifteen-pence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then? - A. He insisted upon having what property I had about me: I put my hand to my pocket, with a view of securing my watch; I had it in my hand, and he snatched it from me; at that moment a young man collared him, his name is Terry; he asked him what he was going to do with me; the prisoner told him I was his sister, and he was going to take care of me to the inn.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect all this, you are sure? - A. Yes; the young man took him into a public-house and sent for a constable; the property was taken from him, and he was taken to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose watch was this? - A. It was a watch belonging to the Honourable

               <p>Q.(To Terry). Did he say he was assisting her, or that she was his sister? - A. He said she was his sister; for I put the question to her - young woman, is this your brother; and she said, no, it is not.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you able to discover the countenance of the man? - A. No, he held down his head with a disposition to hide his face; two other men then came running violently down the court in a direction from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of those men? - A.At the end of the court there is a small gate, the first man that went out shut the gate after him, and the other two men got to the gate together; a scuffle ensued between them and me, they got the gate open; I did not observe them sufficiently to know their countenances; I pursued them into Wine-office-court, where the man was found, who was tried and convicted at the last Sessions.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gleed. Q.You are a watchman, in Fleet-street? - A. I am; I was called by Mr. Troughton in the night of the 9th of February, about a quarter before one o'clock; I went up Peterborough-court with him; Mr. Troughton saw a man standing by the cellar door; Mr. Troughton asked him what he had been doing there; he said, he had been up the court; he desired me to lay gold of him, and stop till he saw a little further; I had my lanthorn in my hand; Mr. Troughton laid hold of him, and he struck Mr. Troughton; the prisoner is the man, I had seen him before in Fleet-street; I helf up my lanthorn to see what he and Mr. Troughton wer going about; I am sure the prisoner is he man, I have no doubt at all of it; he broke his hold, got away from Mr. Troughton, and made his escape.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You knew the prisoner perfectly well before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You have told this story before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you were examined before, did you say that you knew any one of the men? - A. I said, the man that struck Mr. Troughton was dressed in a light coloured great-coat.</p>
               <p>Q.That is any thing but an answer - when you were examined before upon the trial of Bean, did you say you knew any one of the men you saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280071"/>there? - A. Yes, the man that struck Mr. Troughtort was a hard looking man.</p>
               <p>Q. I will read over to you the evidence you gave upon that occasion - (reads it, See Page 179.) Did you venture to swear that you knew that man? - A. Yes, I was asked the question if I had known the man before, and I said I had seen him in Fleet-street, and knew him by having that great coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you swore you had seen that man in Fleet-street, whoever he was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the former trial? - A. I swore so here.</p>
               <p>Q. In this Court? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon Bean's trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You now venture to swear positively, that, upon that former trial, you swore you knew that man by having seen him in Fleet-street? - A. Yes, by the same reason Mr. Troughton thought it was Bean who struck him, and I made answer, and said, it was not Bean that struck him, on the account that he was a hard looking man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a watchman? - A. About six months.</p>
               <p>Q. How much a day are you paid? - A.According to the months; sometimes one shilling and sixpence a night, and sometimes one shilling a night.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the consequence, if this man is convicted? - A. I look upon it my poor foul will be in torment.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know the consequence, before a man leaves this world; there was a reward of forty pounds in the case of Bean, was there not? - A. I did not know it, for I was never acquainted with it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not go, the next Sessions, before the Judge who is now trying, and receive your share of the reward? - A. I have since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not expect a share of the reward, if this man is convicted? - A. I shall expect it, as well as another; but I would not be here for that.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask you that; do you not expect it? - A. To be sure I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Holland? - A. I have heard of him, but never had any conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. Have you any doubt of the prisoner being the man who struck Mr. Troughton? - A. Not the least.</p>

               <p>Q. What countryman are you? - A. An Irishman: On the 6th of January I went to Somerset-house for my wages; I received a 5l. note and a sixpence; when I came out of the Pay Office I saw the prisoner, I am sure he is the man; he said young man you seem to be lame; I said yes, he said he was very sorry for my being so bad; he said he had a brother who died at sea, and he was come up from the country to receive his prizemoney: Upon that he walked along, and a pocketbook dropped before us; he reached to it, and I reached to it, but he had it first; upon that he laid hold of my hand, and said, whatever is in this book is half your's; with that he brought me down Fleet-street to Salisbury-court; we went into the parlour of the Blue Last public-house, in Salisbury-court; there was nobody in the room; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280072"/>prisoner called for a pot of beer, or a pot of ale; we had not been in the room two minutes, before another man came in, with a newspaper in his hand; he asked if there was any thing particular between us; he wished to read the newspaper; he did not wish to disturb us: The prisoner pulled out the pocket-book, and opened it; on one side he found a bill, and, on the other side, a diamond cross; he shewed the bill to the gentleman to read; he said the bill was of no consequence to either of us, and kept it; he said the bill was for one hundred pounds; that the diamond was worth the same: The prisoner said, he had a friend in town, and he would go out and get me forty pounds to my share of it; he went out, and, all the time he was gone, the other man was doing me, and trying to get out of me what money I had got: He asked me if I had any money; I, at first, said no; he said, he would not bring any money back with him, and it was bad for me; I had better get some money for him: The gentleman said, he had fifteen pounds that he would help me to; then the prisoner came in, and said, he could not find his friend; he asked me, what money I had got; I said I had got five pounds, and the other man said he had fifteen pounds; that would make it twenty pounds for him, till eleven o'clock the next day when he would sell the cross, and call upon me and settle it between us: He took down my name, and where I lived, No. 63, King-street, Bloomsbury; I gave the five pounds to the prisoner, and the other man gave him some paper; I did not see whether it was notes or not: The prisoner then gave me the cross; the other man came out with me; I left the prisoner at the door, then I went home; I staid at home the next day, expecting him, till half an hour past the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was it, before you saw the prisoner? - A. On the 2d of March, I saw him facing Somerset House; his partner, the gentleman who was reading the paper, was with him; I saw him first; they were together, with three or four tailors, up a court; I ran over towards them, and, the moment they saw me, they ran up the court; I went after them and secured the prisoner; I laid hold of both, but I was very lame at the time, and I could not keep them both; I took him to Bow-street, and I was sent from Bow-street to the Lord Mayor, at the Mansion-House: I gave the cross to Mr. Canner.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: On the 1st of April, a little before nine at night, in Wellclose-square, I saw the two prisoners in close conversation together; Kemp had a piece of timber; they were talking very low, which gave me a suspicion; after a few minutes they parted; the prisoner Kemp put the timber on his shoulder, and went towards Parson's-street, East-Smithfield, and Norrish went towards Well's-Gardens; I followed the prisoner Kemp into Parson's-street; he stopped at a chandler's-shop, and took the timber off his shoulder, and laid it down by the kerb-stone; he then went into the shop, and, in about seven or eight minutes after that, he returned with a lighted candle; he then went into the cellar underneath the shop; he came out of the cellar again with a saw; he then took up the timber, and was going to cut it; I caught him by the collar, and asked him where he brought that from; he told me a man had given it to him to carry, but he did not know who that man was; at that time the prisoner Norrish came down to the same shop, with the fellowpiece; my brother officer,

             sworn. - Corroborated the evidence of Smith.</p>
               <p>- SIMMONDS sworn. - I am a lawyer; I sawed this timber for Mr. Waller before it was stolen; I knew it to be his property; I had seen it about two or three days before it was taken away; they were both cut out of one piece; I sawed them at Mr. Bartlett's timber-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them to the building in Well's-Gardens? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pratt. Q. Was this shiptimber? - A. No; I cut it for joists; I cut a nail in two in it with a saw, which is very remarkable.</p>
               <p>Q. I should think pieces of joists must be very much alike; how could you know every distinct piece? - A. I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. It is nothing extraordinary that you should meet with a nail in an old piece of timber? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never saw any other piece of timber, of the same length, the same thickness, and the same quality? - A. Yes, a great number, the same day, for Mr. Waller.</p>
               <p>Waller. I have no doubt of its being my timber; there were two mortice holes, at a certain distance from the end, which is very different from any of the rest; they laid at the outside of the rest; I missed them from the outside; it is twenty-five feet long.</p>


               <p>Kemp's defence. On the 1st of April, I was at a public-house, eating my supper, about eight o'clock in the evening; Norrish told me he had brought two pieces of wood, and asked me to assist in taking it home; I went with him, and he brought two pieces, and placed them against the rails; I took it for him to where this cellar was, and the officer took me.</p>
               <p>Norrish's defence. I bought them for five shillings, for fire-wood.</p>
               <p>The prisoners each called four witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say it was his hat? - A. He owned to it, and took it; I said to the prisoner, you are a carpenter, are not you; he replied, yes; I said, how came you to do such a thing as this; he said, I had better do that than worse, they can't hang me; they can only transport me; says I, if we let you go on this way, you may get at my house; he said, no; you know the gutter is not so easy got at there: Going down Oxford-street, he wanted me to let him run away, and tried several times to get from me; but I kept hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the lead? - A. It was not taken off the premises; it is rolled up, I suppose, about two foot at each end; it was begun at both ends, but not cut, the whole length of the middle gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it separated from the building at all? - A. No.</p>

            ; when I came home with him, I went into the parlour even with the kitchen; Mr. Abrahams said, this woman has opened the door of the liquor closet, she smells so strong of liquor; we could not find her; I opened her box, and found two books, one a prayer-book, belonging to a former servant, the other a tutor to my daughter, when she was a child; the other things were found between the sacking and the bed; this sheet I had missed ever since Good-Friday; it was whole when I missed it, it is now cut to pieces; I was really suspicious that she had taken a bottle of liquor, and concealed it in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had but five pounds ten shillings a year, and I had received but one shilling and sixpence, and therefore I could not have much to spend in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Abrahams.) Had you a good character with her? - A. Yes, a very good character, where she had lived two years and a half.</p>

As I am innocent, I trust to your Lordship, and the laws of my country, being quite ignorant, and unable to speak for myself. I remain, with the utmost respect, your Lordship's obedient and very humble servant."</p>

             sworn. - I am shop-boy to Messrs. Gedge's: On the 17th of February, the prisoner came into our shop; I went with the prisoner to Mr. Cannon's, No. 5, Leicester-place; the prisoner knocked at the door, and asked if Mr. Cannon was within; he knocked at the door, and the servant said, Mr. Cannon was not at home; then he went over to Messrs. Christie and Shaw's; I went with him; he knocked at the door, and asked if Mr. Christie was within; the boy told him he was not within; and he asked if Mr. Shaw was within; he said, Mr. Shaw was within; he said, that would do all the same, and he went up stairs; Mr. Richardson gave me the bill of parcels to go with the prisoner, and I gave it to the prisoner in Messrs. Christie and Shaw's passage; he said, he would bring the money in a few minutes; he came down in about five minutes, and asked the boy for a pen and ink; he took him into the office, and he wrote at the bottom of the bill, "Mr. Cutfield, pay the above to the bearer;" he told me to go to No. 4, Leicester-place, and Mr. Cutfield would give me the money; I went there, but no such person lived there; while I was standing at the door, I saw the prisoner go up Leicester-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him again till he was taken up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he was taken up? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure he is the same man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you deliver the parcel to him without meaning to receive the money? - A. I meant to receive the money when he brought it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever received the money at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How much was it to come to? - A. One pound fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Can you swear to my being in your shop on the 17th of February? - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see me before that period? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive any instructions from your master what to say before you came to this Court? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Are your books here? - A. Yes, the prisoner kept the waste-book and the ledger. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that sum brought to account in either of these books? - A. No, it is not: On the 21st of January, he went at his usual time to dinner; he did not return that day; but, on the following day, a little girl came with a message that he was too unwell to come to business, and he never returned afterwards; I went round to Deal, Dover, and Folkstone, in pursuit of him; he was at last found at Liverpool; I was directed to him by the name of West.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that no other person received any of the wholesale accounts? - A. There might be a chance case, if a person was going by a person's door, I might have desired him to receive it, but I do not know that I ever did.</p>

               <p>JOHN GOODRICH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What are you? - A. I am servant to the prosecutors: On Saturday, the 27th of February, I saw the prisoner, above an hour, walking backwards and forwards by the gate, under which there were such bars as this now produced; I lost sight of him; but afterwards saw him brought back with this bar, which, I have no doubt, is one that lay under the gate.</p>

               <p>THOMAS NEGUS sworn. - I work in the yard, and was coming up it with some iron, when I saw the prisoner draw the bar out of the yard, and run off with it, drawing it after him; I had some bars on my shoulder, and could not follow him; but I gave the alarm to Williams and Brown, upon which he was brought back in a few minutes; I am sure the prisoner is the man who took the bar.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILLIAMS sworn. - I am servant to the prosecutors, and heard the alarm given by Negus; upon which I pursued the prisoner, and took him between three and four hundred yards, with a bar of iron on his shoulder; he begged I would let him go, and said he did it for real want.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took it, I confess, and bare necessity prompted me to do it, for the present support of my family, a wife, and three small children.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Was the table, in question, under the green cloth at all? - A. I did not put the cloth aside to see, but a hard substance was there, which was gone in the morning; I saw you bring the table out of the pantry at half-past four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did my mistress ever pay you the bills when I was present? - A. When taking away the breakfast things; I have lived in Mr. Mackay's service four years, and the prisoner three months.</p>

I was, and found the prisoner in the drawing-room asleep, on a sofa; he had a gown over his shirt, and something tied round his head, but nothing else on: I was shewn a drawer which was broke open, and this turnscrew fits the place; I saw a green cloth on the ground, in the pantry, thrown down in a heap; there was a false key in the lock, which could not be got out; I waked the prisoner, and told him to dress himself, and go along with me; he wanted to know what was the matter; I told him he was best able to judge, and took him to the watch-house; the housekeeper had told me the story in his presence; but he did not deny it, or say any thing.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You live in Great Cumberland-street? - A. I do: I went out of town the 12th of April, and left particular directions with the prisoner, not to be absent from the house after ten o'clock, and to sleep in the butler's-pantry for safety; I returned to town on the 18th, and was told this story by the housekeeper; I opened the table, and there were one five pound note, four two pound notes, and two one pound notes, five guineas and a half in gold, nine shillings in silver, a watch and gold seals, and a pocket-book, with gold instruments; this key was in the lock, and this is a key which Mrs. Mackay had inadvertently left in the drawer; it belongs to some drawers where there is great property; I will not be positive, but I think it possible, and believe the prisoner has been present, when Mrs. Mackay has paid her weekly bills.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The morning Mr. and Mrs. Mackay left town, I went up into the drawing-room, to take the breakfast things away; I put them on the tray, and, turning myself round, I hit the tray against the table, and struck a small part of the inlaid work off; the day following I had a few jobs to do, and did not wish any-body to know I had broke it; therefore I took it down into the pantry, with intent to fasten on the work; I went out to spend the evening; I left it in the pantry; when I came home, I went to bed, and seeing the table, I got out of bed to take it up stairs, that they should not suspect I meant to do any thing with it; the housekeeper has said, I delivered a key into her possession; and my master says he took it out of the lock himself; therefore, what key I could deliver to her, I don't know; I have a wife and three helpless children, entirely depending on me for support, and are the principal sufferers; if I am excused for my first error, I shall be extremely cautious of my future conduct.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Mrs. Laking.) Q. Was the table broke? - A. Not that I saw; I never examined it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Yes; my son, William Bedford, is my partner: On the 29th of March, I was sitting in the accompting-house; there is a glazed partition between the warehouse and the accompting-house; and, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a man go past the door, and Hayman, my porter, who has absconded, go hastily, and speak to him for a short time; then the prisoner came in, and put a sheet, or wrapper, which he had under his arm, upon the corner of the counter; and Hayman came hastily to about the middle of the warehouse, and caught up two pieces of calico from a pile; then he came a little further, and took another piece; he doubled them all together, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280087"/>gave them to the prisoner, who helped to put them in the wrapper, and went out, taking them with him; I pursued him; and, before he got to Cheapside, I got sight of him; he turned towards St. Paul's; I followed him, for he was walking gently, and took him by the arm, saying, where are you going; he said, to the New Inn, in the Old Bailey; I asked him where he got those goods; he said, he got them from a person in a street near; I told him they were my property, and he must go back with me, which he did; and, when I got back, I found my warehouse open, and Hayman gone; I asked the prisoner who he was, and where he lived; he said he was a jobbing-porter; a ticketporter came by, who knew him, and said he believed he lived with Mr. Mawson, which he did; I examined the property, and found it to be three pieces of printed calico, consisting of twenty-four yards each piece; there is our private mark, and they cost us more than nine pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You did not know the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your servants knew your accompting-house had that commanding view? - A. I don't think Hayman knew I was there; the light is such, that two or three people might be sitting in the accompting-house, without the people in the warehouse seeing them.</p>
               <p>Q. It was by invitation from Hayman, your servant, that the prisoner came into the shop? - A. Yes, I should imagine it must be from what he said to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in, every thing that was done was by your servant, who has absconded? -- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner being a porter to Mr. Mawson, it was nothing uncommon for him to have a wrapper? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you first he was a jobbing-porter, and you have found out that he had been but very little time in that service? - A. Yes, and he came back directly, and gave up the property; he said he was going to the New Inn, where, he supposed, somebody would be to take them from him; I asked him who; he said he did not know; perhaps it might be my porter.</p>

               <p>EDWARD BENTLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are the chief clerk in the Accomptant-General's office, in the Bank? - A. I was; I know the prisoner; he first came into the Bank employ on the 1st of January, 1799, and was employed in the Bank on the 26th of March, 1801, to post into the ledgers, or to read from the cash-book, Bank-notes paid on the 24th of March, of certain denominations, of 100l, 200l. and up to a 1000l. it appears he read from the cash-book that day, for I know his hand-writing, and he had access to the file on which the notes were placed on that day: On the 24th of March, 1801, No. 6528, for 50l. came in; the 25th being a holiday, the notes paid on the 24th were posted on the 26th, and he put it on the file; the entry is made from the folio of the cash-book, previous to its coming to our department, and a clerk calls over from the cash-book, who, on this day, appears to have been the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain slowly and shortly what is done with a Bank-note that comes into the Bank for payment, as to its stages, and its cancelling? - A. It is cancelled by being punched; the cashier's name is taken off by the inspector before it comes to us; it then goes to the entering clerk, who enters it into the cash-book, and then punches it; after the balance of the evening is made, the files are locked up in Mr. Newland's strong room, and delivered out to the Accomptant's office the next day; when the note is so punched, it is our evidence that the note has been paid, and the entry in the cash-book corresponding with it.</p>
               <p>MANOA SIBLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What are you? - A. I am clerk in the Bank: On the 24th of March last, there was a Bank-note of 50l. No. 6528, entered by me in the cash-book, (looks at the cash-book); the whole page is my writing; after I enter the notes, I punch them; this number was punched, and put upon the file.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note - do you recollect it? - A. No otherwise, than by knowing there was such a number, and such a date, (looks at several notes); with respect to these notes, they appear to be entered before they were cancelled, which sometimes is the case in the hurry of business; the name of the cashier has not been torn off this note, yet it is punched.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you explain how it happens that it is punched through the white part, instead of the proper part? - A. We punch a quantity at a time, and if one happens to be reversed, the punch goes through the wrong part; after the notes are punched, they are put on a file, and taken to the Treasury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. You are the person who punched this very note? - A. Yes; those punch them who enter them.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was put on the file on which cancelled notes are? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Though you have not struck the puch through the proper place, do you consider it a cancelled note? - A.Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q.Look to the ledger, and see if you posted it on the 26th of March? - A. That article is erased, but from posting the article preceding, and those immediately following, I have no doubt it was posted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your only reason for saying you know it was entered, is because of the entry before and after? - A. It is, and no other.</p>
               <p>Q. You see here (shewing one of the books) there is no entry, and yet, one before, and another after? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>JOHN WINTER, Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You are solicitor to the Bank? - A. Yes: On the 11th of February, I attended a committee at the Bank; the prisoner was in an adjoining room; I went to him, and questioned him, without making any promise whatever, as to his connection with Hayley, who, he admitted, he had known sometime, but denied having any money transactions with him, except as to a sum of two pounds; I then stated to the committee what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280090"/>the prisoner said, as to his connection with Hayley; I had been in the committee-room but a short time, when the prisoner was admitted, and he suggested to the Gentlemen present, that he wished to explain himself; I then took a minute of what he said, which was this - "That in March or April last, 1801, some notes were taken from the file, with a view to shew they might be re-issued; I did not attempt to pass any till I became acquainted with Hayley; I took them off the file; the whole which have not been passed, are in my possession; 750l. have been passed; the notes (meaning those which had not been passed) are at No. 18, Bride-lane, at the house of Mr. Browne, an attorney; I erased the Ledger, no person was privy to it; I have 400l. in cash, Mr. Hayley has a further sum." I then accompanied the prisoner towards Bride-lane, and in the way he suggested that the notes were not in Bride-lane, but in a house in Salisbury-court; we went to a house in Salisbury-court, where he delivered a packet to me, which contained the whole of the notes, taken off the file, which had not been issued; I then accompanied him to the house of Mr. Browne, in Bride-lane, and he there delivered to me a tin box, containing good Banknotes and post-bills to the amount of 370l. he said there was 400l. but that he had taken out 30l. the day before; in a pocket-book, which he gave me, there was a paper containing several receipts, signed by

               <p>"Gentlemen,</p>
               <p>"From the present mode of conducting your great and momentous concerns, it is in the power of your servants to injure you to a very considerable and serious amount, without your being able to discover the delinquents; this is a fact which can be proved to your entire satisfaction, as the thing has been already done to the amount of some hundreds of pounds, but without the smallest intention to defraud. It has been for some time observed, the very serious consequences which might ensue to you, in case your servants should be inclined to take the advantage in their power; and the great importance it would be of to you to-have this defect remedied, which, although it could not be done, but at the hazard of all that is dear, and at the hazard of being detected, yet has there been one, who, from a desire to convince you of the truth of it, to find out a plan to prevent it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280091"/>doubtless with a view to benefit himself, has conceived he would be intitled to a handsome remuneration, and has been bold enough to hazard the event, which of course he must abide, not doubting, but when you are convinced of the truth, you will think him fairly entitled to the reward he asks for his upright intention, and for the perilous situation he has put himself into in case of discovery; but, Gentlemen, it has never been the intention of the writer to wrong you of a single shilling; neither will he, for in case you shall not accede to his proposal, he will return you the money, and you shall not be able to know from whence it comes; on the contrary, should you agree, he will make it clearly appear to you the amount of the property he has taken. If the person alluded to does make the discovery, and likewise points out a plan, which will, in future, render the same attempt vain, and sure of detection, he previously claims for himself, and all concerned, a free pardon, and promise not to be in the least molested, and also 5000l. and an annuity of 500l. per annum during life, or 10,000l. without an annuity. Your answer, through the medium of the Morning-Post, is desired; and if the requests of this letter are complied with, the party will come forward and give every explanation; should it be the wish of the Governor and Co. to see the party, the following from is humbly submitted.

               <p>Q. Do you know that man? - A. I am satisfied he, Hayley, is the person I received the fifty pound note of, on the 26th of January, 1802, (looking at the note;) I believe this to be the note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You cannot swear to it positively? - A. Not positively, because I received another of Hayley.</p>
               <p>Q. At the same time? - A. No, on the 31st of December; I really believe it to be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Did the person who offered it write any thing on it? - A. He wrote William Harrison on it, which is on this note.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you see two large letters, B. and C. on the patch? - A. I do, and believe it to be the note I received.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, that is the case for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. I submit to your Lordship there is no evidence in this case to affect the prisoner; this is a prosecution grounded upon the Act of the 15th of

            . which says, "That if any officer, or servant of the said Company being entrusted with any bill, dividend-warrant, bond, deed, or any security, money, or other effects, belonging to the said Company, or having any bill dividend-warrant, bond, deed, or any security, or effects of any other person or persons, lodged or deposited with the said Company, or with him, as an officer or servant of the said Company, shall secrete, embezzle, or run away with any such note, bill, dividend-warrant, bond, deed, security, money, or effects, or any part of them, every officer or servant so offending, and being thereof convicted in due form of law, shall be deemed guilty of felony, and shall suffer death as a felon, without benefit of clergy." - My Lord, I submit in the first place, that the prisoner at the bar was not entrusted with the possession of this note; your Lordship will see what this note is - it is a Bank-note of 50l. that is the Bank-note he is charged with embezzling; and an embezzlement, within the act, must be of something of which the person was in custody - if you will look at the evidence of the first witness, you will find the prisoner never was entrusted with it; on the contrary you will find, that the only notes with which he was entrusted were notes from 100l. up to 1000l. that being the case, I submit, upon the evidence for the prosecution, that this note of 50l. was not such a note as the prisoner was ever entrusted with, and that therefore the allegation in this indictment, to being it within the Act of Parliament, cannot be proved; on the contrary, it must be negatived, for, in order to be within the Act of Parliament, it must be a Bank-note with which he was entrusted, which, in this case, it appears he never was.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I submit also, that this is not any one of the things described by this Act of Parliament; the words of the Act are "any bill, dividend-warrant, bond, deed, or any security, money, or other effects." I submit that this is neither of those things; it is, as the last witness has said, that which was once a Bank-note. I submit to your Lordship, it ceased to be a Bank-note. I submit to your the embezzlement was made; and in order to support the indictment, it is necessary it should have been a Bank-note. I submit, it ceases to be a Banknote the moment it is paid into the Bank. It is admitted, by Mr. Garrow, that it was a paid and cancelled note. I do not know what is meant by a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280092"/>cancelled note, except it is that which was once a note, but by the act of cancelling, ceased to be a note - it cannot come within either of the words mentioned in the act - the meaning is, a note of value, whereas, this was of no value to any person; it had performed its office, and was by them deposited upon the file, from which it was never again to be issued to the world; it was compleat wastepaper.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am aware that you will find, at the end of the clause, the words "or other effects;" I conceive the meaning of this is, other effects, which we enumerated before; it will be therefore to say, when it has complemed its office, and has returned again, whether it is one of those other effects. I will trouble you with no further observation at present; but as there is no decision on this Act of Parliament, and Mr. Garrow has stated that it is a most important question, not only to the unfortunate man at the bar, but to the public at large, I humbly hope your Lordship will respite the judgment till it has been considered.</p>
               <p>Mr.Garrow. My Lord, I entirely agree with the concluding observation of my learned Friend, that this is a most important Act of Parliament; and I agree there has, fortunately for the public, been no case that has called for a decision on this point; but I should be extremely sorry it should pass, as admitted by me, that there is any thing in the objection, because it might produce serious inconvenience; therefore, I think it my duty to give the answer that occurs to me to the objection, feeling by no means any inclination to press your Lordship to a decision of the case, it there is any doubt which may make it a fit subject for further consideration.</p>

               <p>Court. Looking through the Act, I think it is proper, as there has been no decision, to get the opinion of the twelve Judges. I think it ought to be considered, as there has been no decision upon it, though I have very little doubt on the subject.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am perfectly satisfied, and have no with to answer the objection; but it does appear to me, that the answer is so obvious, it might be more convenient that I should do it, than that it should be supposed there is more in it than appears upon the face of it. I have no wish to argue the point, but if your Lordship will permit me, it will be more satisfactory to say a word or two.</p>
               <p>My Lord. with regard to the first objection, a fact is proved in the case, which does not warrant my learned Friend in his objection; for he supposes that the prisoner, in the course of his duty, as clerk at the Bank, had no trust with regard to the fifty pound Bank-note; but there he misconceives the evidence; the evidence is, that he had the duty of entering the notes in a book, and that they are all put on a file, and being bound to take the file into his possession, he is necessarily entrusted with the file that contains them. That objection has nothing in it, for I state this difficulty, and it is sitting it should be understood, that every person employed in and about the Bank of England, are, for the purposes of a criminal prosecution, liable to the extent of answering, with their lives, if they embezzle or secrete any thing which, in the discharge of their duty, comes to their hands; that is a distinct proposition, which I will state once more, for the purpose of being corrected in it if I am mistaken; having considered it with more able persons than myself, that every person, as an officer or servant in the Bank of England, who, in the course of his duty, has the means of obtaining any Banknote, bill, deed, or other thing, or which may be entrusted with him, is for the purpose of criminal prosecution, liable to suffer death, if he embezzles or secretes any part thereof.</p>
               <p>My Lord, to bring this to the business of common life, I will suppose it to become a question, whether a gentleman's under servant has stolen a silver tankard, and is liable to punishment. - No, because he is not entrusted with it, but the butler is entrusted with it, according to my learned Friend's argument, and therefore, he cannot be found guilty. Put, I say, if this man is entrusted with a file of cancelled notes, which having performed their duty, are filed, and he takes a 50l. Bank-note off that file, I say he is guilty of a breach of duty, and of embezzling and running away with effects, within the meaning of the Act of Parliament. Your Lordship will take the cause, which I think extremely proper, but it does not appear to me, that there is a great deal in the objection. My learned Friend should be apprized of what are the Counts of this Indictment. The second Count states it to be a paid note, that is to say, that the prisoner, being an officer and servant of the Bank, and so entrusted, with force and arms, did secrete and embezzle the said paid note. Are these words in this Act of Parliament, which can embrace a paid or a cancelled note? I don't insist upon the first Count, that this is a Bank-note, but I certainly, by the bye shall say, as against the prisoner, it is out of his power to say it is not a Bank-note, when he puts it out again. The Legislature meant to do something more than to protect the then-existing Bank notes; all their deeds, and all their bills, demandable, supposing them to be notes which might be embezzled, and all the effects of the Bank of England. Is it not a part of the effects of the Bank of England? Is it of no value? Is it not of importance to the Bank of England? I stated, in my opening, that these notes are not put into the fire when they are brought in, which would be a ready receipt to prevent offences of this fort, because it cannot be done as long as the commerce of this country is so extensive, for there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280093"/>may be a thousand instances occur, in which some particular note may be to be resorted to for the interest of the public. It is a part of the effects of the Bank of England, for the purpose of being evidence of it having been paid, and to trace it through the different hands, if it should be necessary to be inquired into. I submit it is a part of the effects of the Bank of England, of the description of a paid note; but as this is to be the subject of further inquiry, I shall not waste any more time. I thought it my duty to say thus much, as it might be an inconvenience to the public, that the objection should be thought to stand unanswered.</p>
               <p>Court. He is charged with secreting and embezzling a certain paid note, which certainly comes within the meaning of the Act of Parliament; the servants of the Bank are so very numerous, it would hardly be able to reach them if it was not so; however, the case shall be reserved.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg to leave my defence to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Bentley.) You told us the cancelled notes are put upon a file? - A.They are put on a file promiscuously, without distinguishing fifty-pound notes from those of a larger denomination; they are intermixed as they are paid; a five-pound note may be next to a thousand-pound note, and a fifty-pound to a hundred-pound, and so on; there were fifty-pound notes, and notes of every description on the file.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q.Several people had access to the file? - A. Yes, twenty different people, whose duty it is. GUILTY, <rs id="t18020428-110-punish585" type="punishmentDescription">

             sworn. - I am book-keeper at the Blossom's Inn: On the 21st of April, in the evening, Mr. Campion's cart came to our yard, and hearing he had lost a box, I run down the gateway, and saw two men turn up Castle-court with a box; I cannot say which of them had it, but I defined one of them to put it down, which he did, and began to cover it over with a black apron; I took hold of them, and asked them where they brought the box from; one said, he did not bring it from any where, but they were going through the passage, and saw the box standing there, and was going to see what it was; I said, I should not let them go, and one of them bit my hand very much; I called out for help, and assistance came; then they were sent to the Compter.</p>
               <p>May. Q.Did you not say before the Magistrate that there was another person in the cart to mind the property? - A. Yes, there were two in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see either of us with the box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Which of us? - A.I cannot say which; you were both close together.</p>
               <p>(The box produced, and identified.)</p>
               <p>May's defence. We had been into Cannon-street to see a cousin of this young man's, and, coming home, we turned down Milk-street; I said, stop, I want to make water; I went up the court, and that gentleman came up, and said, you have stole this box; I said, what box? and he took us.</p>
               <p>Hunt's defence. I was waiting at the corner of the court for him, when that gentleman came up, and laid hold of me; I said, I would go where he liked, for I was innocent.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr. Carter.) Q. The basket was for the purpose of carrying the things in? - A. Yes, and he might have left it at home; the value of the three tumblers is about five-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The night on which this happened, Mr. Carter sent me to the warehouse to look out different patterns, and to take them to Harley-street; I did so; and before I had time to put down the different patterns, when I came in, he asked me for them, which I gave him, without any hestitation, not knowing he meant to charge me with felony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carter. The story, with regard to the patterns, is true; but, with regard to taking the tumblers, it was an hour after; I gave him no orders to take them whatever.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280096"/>ELIZABETH VANSES sworn. - I am daughter to the prosecutor; about five or ten minutes after he went out, on the 11th of March, a knock came to the door, which I opened, and the prisoner came in, she said, give us a piece of bread and butter, I said, in that chest; she then said, who has got the key? I said, my father; she said, there are more keys than one? I said, yes, but I must not try to open it; she said, where does your father keep his watches? I said, up stairs, and he had the key; she said, can't you frisk a watch? I said, no; then she said, she would learn me her trade, and we should go to St. Catherine's lane together; just as she said, that, a gentleman came for his watch; he said, he felt himself indisposed, and begged I would get him a little liquor; the prisoner, before I could get up, took hold of the bottle and the sixpence, which he gave her, and we fetched the liquor, but she would have the common liquor instead of the best, and kept the difference; we came back, and the gentleman offered her a glass, which she took, and beckoned me out: I was afraid she would try to get something if she staid, and I went with her; I wanted to get away from her, but she would not quit our house, without I went with her; we went down Goded-lane, and as I was going along, I saw the end of my father's neckcloth hang out of her pocket; I said, that is my father's; she said, you lie; I put my hand to her pocket, and felt something like a book; then we went home, and parted between Henry-street, and New-street; I looked for the prayer-book and neckcloth directly, but could not find them.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you know the prisoner before? - A. I knew her four or five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q.What was she? - A.She stiles herself a frisker; I did not know what it meant, till they explained it to be a bad girl; she said, first, would I frisk a watch; but when I said I did not know what she meant, she said, would I thieve a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you seen her? - A.When I came out with work, she and others always used to surround me, when I used to come out with two or three hundred pounds worth of value of my father's master's, wanting to get the property from me; she lived in Henry-street, near Old-street-square, where her companions live, they call her the queen of the square; since she has been in prison, she has sent her gang, who said, they would murder me if I appeared against her.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know the person who came for the watch? - A. Yes; I was afraid my father would lick me, if he found her there; I am sure the neckcloth was on the table, and the prayer-book laying by it, which I had just laid out of my hand; they were found upon her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The reason you went out, was, to get rid of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The gentleman sent you for some gin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you drink any? - A. I did not taste it, I am not suffered.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he know the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Before he came, had you threatened to hang yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.The gentleman dropped half-a-crown, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Which you said you would keep for his sake; did not you? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not take it with you out of the house? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not take your own handkerchief off and put it on her neck? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever been at Dr. Latham's? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>- LUCAS sworn. - The prisoner was described to me, and I took her; I searched her, and found a neck-cloth and book; she denied it at first, but when I found them, she acknowledged taking them.</p>

               <p>Q.How long had you been acquainted? - A. About three months; I have never seen my shirt or money since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not two other men who used to go through our room? - A. They used to go through our room to their lodgings, and who ever went down last, used to carry the key.</p>
               <p>Q.Did we not always go out first, and leave them in bed till ten or eleven o'clock? - A.Sometimes they went out first, and sometimes we went out first.</p>
               <p>ANN MILLWARD sworn. - I am the wife of Joseph Millward, and live in King-street, Seven-Dials; the prisoner, and the last witness, came to lodge with us about seven or eight weeks ago; they had the one pair of stairs front-room; there were two other lodgers, single men, who used to go through their room; the prisoner was on duty at the brewhouse on the Friday night, and came home on the Saturday morning; I saw no more of him till Monday about twelve o'clock; I gave him the key; he was up stairs about half an hour, and then brought the key down again, and said, he was going to work at a brewhouse over Westminster-bridge; he paid me one shilling and six-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280099"/>pence for his share of the rent; he went away, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DONALDSON sworn. - I am one of the constables of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields; I went with the prosecutor to the Angel at Hammersmith; we found the prisoner with a good many brick-makers, dancing; the prosecutor pointed him out to me; I told him I had a warrant to apprehend him, for robbing his bed-fellow of nine guineas, and a shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he said any thing, had you said any thing to him that could induce him to make a confession? - A. No; I took him out of the taproom into the bar, and he said, I took the shirt away, but as for the nine guineas, I never took them; I brought him to town, and took him to the office; going through the passage, I said to him, what have you done with this poor fellow's money; he then said, the money is all spent, I should not have taken it, if I had not been very drunk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am quite innocent of the affair; when I was brought to the office, the officer told me to say, yes, right or wrong, and, being in liquor, I did not know what I said; he told me I should be cleared if I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Donaldson. He was perfectly sober; it was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A. Yes; but I was unsensed, because I was frightened, as he said I should be imprisoned six months, and afterwards, transported for seven years; I think, the public-house was in King-street, the sign of the Grapes, just at the end of Shepherd's-mews; when we came out of the public-house, he told me I must get out of town by four o'clock the next day; I told him I could not till five; then he said, I must go to the City in the morning; next morning, he came to help me to the coach with my boxes, or else, he said, they would be after me again; I then suspected him, and told him he was a rogue; I then went to Bow-street, and inquired whether there was a warrant out against me; they said, no, and I took a warrant out against him; I never saw the other man before; we drank at every public-house, first, ale, and then, gin and water, but I drank very little; I don't know who kept the house; the prisoner was a job-tailor.</p>

On that night, a person came, and apprehended me, who said, he was a Bow-street officer, and asked me where Mrs. Moysey was; I told him, and we went to her; it was for taking things out of the house where she lived with a man as his wife; I was left in execution, and was given to understand she certainly had got many things off, such as sheets, and so on; as to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280100"/>the money found upon me, I took it of three different people; she once charged a man with a rape without any cause.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Moysey.) Q.Did you ever accuse a man of having committed a rape upon you? - A. Yes, I did; the prisoner persuaded me to do it; he did commit it, and the prisoner went with me to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Kennedy. I am an officer, and the prosecutrix employed me to take a man from a public-house for committing a rape upon her, which I did, and took him before Mr. Conant, who saw through the business, and discharged the man; the story was - she lent some money to the man to go into a public-house, and she was to be his house-keeper; he left the house, and she was turned out.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character. GUILTY, aged 37.</p>

               <p>JOHN MOORE sworn. - I live at the Blue Posts, in Tottenham-court-road; I was standing at the door when Glover was making water, and saw the prisoner take his silver watch out of his fob, and walk away; I was called in to my business, and, in about ten minutes, the prisoner came in again; the prisoner, the prosecutor, and others, had been drinking together; the people said, what a d - d villain he was, to take the watch from the man, and the next day he was taken up.</p>
               <p>- KENNEDY sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: On the 15th of March, the prosecutor came to me, and said, he was robbed; we went together to the barracks, and he pointed out the prisoner; I asked him what he had done with the watch; he said he took it, but had lost it entirely, for that it was not pawned; it has never been recovered.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Glover.) Were you drunk or sober? - A.I was merry.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in the house with that man, and had been drinking with him for eight hours; we were both in liquor, but I never saw any thing of the watch. GUILTY, aged 28.</p>

             sworn. - The prisoner first came to our house the latter end of January, and staid seven weeks; he represented himself to be a soldier, belonging to the 27th Light Dragoons; he run up a score of upwards of eight pounds, which I asked him to pay; he pretended to go to the office to get the prize-money he had to receive, and he would pay; on the 24th of March, he took me to Mr. Crosdale's officer, who, he said, was the agent belonging to the regiment; I waited for him just by, and he returned to me, saying, Mr. Crosdale was not at home, but that the clerk said, if he called at five o'clock, he would receive his money; when we went at five o'clock, the officer was shut; he said, he knocked at the door, and spoke to Mr. Crosdale, who told him to be there the next morning at ten o'clock, but then it was past office-hours; I went with him next morning to the same place; he came, and told me, Mr. Crosdale was not at home, but that he was to call at half past twelve, which he did; I was in a public-house, almost opposite; then, he said, he must wait a little longer, the course of half an hour, or so, when he went again, and brought back a loose paper in his hand, and said, I must go to Mr. Davison's, in Millbank-street, Westminster, which I did, at No. 21, and Mr. Davison told me to get a few lines to certify that Mr. Crosdale had drawn the money, and crossed the books; the prisoner was to wait till I went back; on my return to the public-house, he was gone; I did not wait long, but went to Mr. Crosdale's office to enquire after him, when I found he was an impostor; the next day, he was taken; I did not authorize him to go to my sister for money on any account, nor did I pass my word for any sum whatever, or remain at any place as security for any sum.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not give you a note to go to Mr. Davison's to receive prize-money, when I was sick - did you not write a note, and I sign it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you not convinced at that time I had money coming to me? - A. They told me, if you had a proper certificate from the regiment, they would pay, if you had any money due.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not Mr. Young, the lawyer, go down to Milbank-street, and tell you there was money coming to me? - A.He said, he had been to seek after it, and he understood there was prize-money to receive for the Cape of Good-Hope.</p>
               <p>Q.Did I not give you a note to go to the India-House? - A. Yes, and they said they knew nothing of the note or him who wrote it, but if there was any money due to him, he must get a proper certificate.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not Mr. Young write a letter to get a certificate? - A. He did, and I received an answer from Lieutenant Hughes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had money coming to me, sufficient to pay the debt; I own to the debt, but not to receiving the money under false pretences.</p>

            . chap. 85. which recites, "Whereas, bankers, merchants, and others, are, in the course of their dealings and transactions, frequently obliged to entrust their servants, clerks, and persons employed by them, in the like capacity, with receiving, paying, negociating, exchanging, or transeferring money, goods, bonds, bills, notes, banker's-drafts, and other valuable effects and securities; and, whereas, doubts have been entertained whether the embezzling of the same, by such servants, clerks, and others, so employed by their masters, amounts to felony by the Law of England; and it is expedient that such offences should be punished in the same manner in born parts of the united kingdoms. Be it enacted and declared, by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that if any servant or clerk, or any person employed for the purpose, in the capacity of servant or clerk, to any person or persons whomsoever, or to any body corporate or politic, shall, by virtue of such employment, receive, or take into his possession, any money, goods, bond, bill, note, banker's draft, or other valuable security of effects, for, or in the name, or on the account of his master or masters, or employer or employers, and shall fraudulently embezzle, secrete, or make away with the same, or any part thereof, every such offender shall be deemed to have feloniously stolen the same from his master or masters, employer or employers, for whose use, or in whose name or names, or on whose account the same was or were delivered to, or taken into the possession of such servant, clerk, or other person so employed, although such money, goods, bond, bill, note, banker's-draft, or other valuable security, was, or were no otherwise received into the possession of his or their servant, clerk, or other person so employed; and every such offender, his adviser, procurer, aider, and abettor, being thereof lawfully convicted or attainted, shall be liable to be transported to such parts, beyond the seas, as his Majesty, by and with the advice of his Privy Council, shall appoint, for any term not exceeding 14 years, in the discretion of the Court, before whom such offender shall be convicted and adjudged."</p>
               <p>The prisoner was found guilty upon this indictment, but a motion having been made in arrest of judgment, Mr. Common Serjeant, who tried the prisoner, thought proper to refer the case to the consideration of the Judges, and it was accordingly argued before them, by Counsel on both sides, in Hilary term last; it was objected, on the part of the prisoner, that the statute, upon which the indictment was founded, has not created the embezzling by clerks and servants, do nomine a substantive felony; but having enacted and declared, that, under such circumstances, the offender shall be deemed to have felonioulsy stolen the same, from his master or employer: the statute has made the offence larceny, and, consequently, that an indictment, grounded upon this statute, must have the requisites of an indictment for larceny, at the Common Law; but here money is alledged to have been feloniously stolen, taken, and carried away, and is not expresly averred to be the money of any person whatever, and therefore it is the opinion of a majority of the Judges, that the objection taken to this indictment is well founded, and consequently judgment, upon this indictment, must be arrested.</p>
