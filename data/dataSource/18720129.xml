                  </hi>. live at 61, Theobald's Road, Holborn, and am a collector—the prisoner was a servant in my employ—on the morning of 5th January I was awoke about 4 o'clock by Mrs. Guthrie, one of my lodgers, and went down stairs to the back parlour—I found the curtains were burnt, the arm chair was on fire at the time, and the bar of a little fancy table was burnt nearly through; that was out, it had been burnt, and a child's chair which was underneath that table was also burnt—there was some paper burnt, in the cupboard, and on the top of that there were three pieces of wood; the paper was burnt, and the wood had been blackened and charred—the flooring was burnt, and the wood round the window was charred—the table which was burnt was in the same position as it was left over night—I went to the prisoner's bedroom—the door was partly open, and a pail put against the door, apparently to keep it open; that was where she sleeps—the prisoner was partly dressed, with her night dress over her other things—when I came down she was in the room, on the threshold of the door—the bed was not made; she had not made it for the night, as she generally does—I said to her "Esther, have you set fire to this place?"—she said "No, somebody must have been in and done it"—her room was close to the room which was burning—I said it was very strange that it should be on fire in such different places—she made no reply to that—there were three places on fire—I went to the door and got a constable—the prisoner's room is next to the room that was on fire, and her room door was open—when the constable came, he asked me if I would give her in charge—I said to him when he came in, "I wish to give my servant in charge for attempting to set fire to the premises"—the con<lb/>stable questioned her, and she said she broke open the cupboard to get some tea—he asked her if she had done it—she said she opened the cup<lb/>board to get some sugar to sweeten some tea that she had made, and we found there had been no tea made—she said she dropped the paper in the cupboard, where the wood was put over it, an she went to get a light to look for the sugar—there was a grate in the room, but there was no appearance of any fire in it—the prisoner said "I dropped the paper inside the cup<lb/>board"—the cupboard door was open, and I saw the charred paper there—she said she forced open the cupboard door with the screw-driver—the door was locked over night—she said she had got out of bed, went to the cup<lb/>board to make some tea, and forced it open with a screw-driver—there was</p>

I am the wife of James Guthrie, a compositor—he is dying of consumption—I lodge in the house of Mr. Brogden—on the morn<lb/>ing of 5th January, about 4 o'clock, I had occasion to get up to attend to my sick husband—my room is two floors above the shop—my room became full of smoke—I took my lamp and went down stairs to the kitchen—I found the fire was not there and I went to the passage, level with the shop—I looked in the parlour but I could not see my hand before me, for the smoke was so great—I put my hand against the door and put my leg against a zinc pail which propped the door open—I went in to where the prisoner slept—she was lying on the bed, partly dressed, but her night-dress was over her petticoats—I said "How can you lie there with the place all on fire, and this smoke?"—she said "I have not done it, some one must have come in and done it"—she raised herself up in bed—I looked into the adjoining room, that is the back parlour, and I saw the easy-chair was all red, on fire, and I instantly closed the door and proceeded to Mr. Brogden's bed-room and he came down—the prisoner's door was propped open by a zinc pail—it was the next room to the parlour—when Mr. Brogden arrived he moved the burning furniture into the yard—the prisoner's mistress said to her "How can this fire have come here?"—she said she did not know anything about it, that somebody must have done it—her mistress then said "What can have become of the curtains, where can they have gone to?" and she said "Did you go to bed?"—she first said that she did go to bed—her mistress said "If you did go to bed you had no candle or matches; how did you come by the light; you must know how you got the light, Esther?"—she said "I never turned the gas out"—and she also said she had not been to bed—her mistress said "How was it you did not go to bed, or what male you get up; if you acknowledge going to bed, what made you get up;" and she said "I got up in the night to make tea"—her mistress then went to the sideboard cupboard and she perceived that it was forced open and the look was partly hanging down—she asked the prisoner why she went to it, and she said she went to get the sugar to make tea in the night—when the constable came she said "I broke open the cupboard by a screw-driver"—she said that in going to the cupboard she had dropped a piece of paper and that set light to the long curtains and that she pulled them down—they were long white muslin curtains, and were attached by a string at the top</p>

I was called by Mr. Brogden to his house, 61, Theobald's Road, Holborn, about 5.15 on the morning of 5th January—I went into the back parlour, and saw the prisoner and Mrs. Brogden and Mrs. Guthrie there—Mr. Brogden said "Policeman, this is a very mysterious affair; someone has set fire to my furniture here in the back parlour"—Mrs. Guthrie was standing on the sill of the door—she came into the room, and said about 4 o'clock she came out of her room, and found the place full of smoke; she came down stairs, and saw the prisoner lying on her bed, partly dressed; she pushed open the parlour door, and saw the back parlour furniture in flames, burning; after she had woke the prisoner up, she asked her how she could account for the fire, and she said she knew nothing about it—the prisoner was present at that time—I saw an arm chair that Mr. Brogden had taken out into the back yard, and a child's small chair—the legs were burnt and black—the parlour window was burnt very much, and a pair of curtains had been pulled down, and were partially burnt—the cupboard in the sideboard was open, and at the entrance there was some paper and wood built up—there were three separate places in the room where fire had been—after Mrs. Brogden found the cupboard broken open, she said "Esther, you must know something of this, sleeping so close to it"—I was examining the cupboard at that time—there were marks on it, and there was a screw-driver close by—the prisoner said "I forced open the cupboard, for the purpose of getting some tea and sugar, and I must have dropped the light in the cupboard when I was looking for the tea and sugar"—Mr. Brogden then said "I shall give her into custody for forcing open the cupboard, and on suspicion of setting fire to my place"—she said "I know nothing about setting fire to it; I did not do it"—she was taken to the station—I found on her a bag of money, containing about 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and copper—there was a farthing, which Mr. Brogden identified as being a portion of his money.</p>

On 2nd January, about 1.20 a.m., I was on duty in High Street, Bromley, and heard a cry of "Murder!" and "Police!"—I found the prisoner at 5, High Street, sitting on the floor just inside the door—I asked him what was the matter—he said "I have done it at last, I have cut my wife's throat"—I went into the shop and saw the prisoner's wife sitting in a chair, with a wound on the right side of her face, and her dress saturated with blood down the front—I asked her in the prisoner's presence how it happened—she said "I don't know"—I followed the track of blood into the back room behind the shop, where there was a bed, and found by the side of the bed this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), open and covered with wet blood—I afterwards showed it to the doctor—I went back into the shop with the knife in my hand, and the prisoner said "That is what I did it with, I have murdered my wife, I shall be hung for it"—I asked her in his presence how it happened—she said "I was helping him into bed when he flung his arm round and struck me, I put my hand up and felt blood"—I took the prisoner to the station on a stretcher—he was sober.</p>

On Sunday morning, 7th January, about 12.30, I was on duty, in company with Mason, in Charles Street, Drury Lane, and heard the sounds of a scuffle in the middle of the road—I saw a man fall to the ground, and six or seven persons on top of him at once—I went towards the spot, and saw five men run away—I saw the prisoner—she was the last one that left him—she was atop of him—just as I got to them she started to go away, and she kicked his hat away, and tried to pick it up—I ran past the man who was on the ground—I saw his watch lying on the ground—I stopped the prisoner till 418 came up—I left her in his charge while I pursued the others, but I lost them in King Street, Drury Lane—when I came back the prisoner said she had nothing to do with the robbery, but she knew the men, and could take us to their lodging—the prosecutor had got up when I came back—the other constable picked up the watch and gave it to me—the prosecutor was intoxicated, but he had been knocked down and kicked, and cut under the eye—as soon as he saw the prisoner he said that is the one I will give in charge for robbing me—after charging the prisoner I went again to the spot, and found this piece of chain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Manners, and live at 195, St. Leonard's Road—the prisoner and deceased lodged there as man and wife—on 27th December, about 8 in the morning, I saw the prisoner after he had spoken to my little girl—he said "Go up stairs to Harriet"—I asked what for—he said "Harriet is bad"—I went up with him, and found the deceased lying in the middle of the bed, partly dressed and unconscious—her mouth was cut, and her eyes black and shut—I saw a cut, on the right eye, I think, and blood was flowing from it—I lifted up her chin, and called her "Harriet! Harriet!" but she made me no answer—she only moved her hand and her mouth—the prisoner said should ho go and fetch three-pennyworth of brandy—I said "Yes," and he went and fetched it—she took it—I fed her with it with a spoon; she swallowed it, but it had no effect upon her—she never spoke at all—I said to the prisoner "Who-ever done this?"—he said he did not know—he then left, and said he was going to his employer at the Isle of Dogs—between 11 and 12 o'clock I sent for a doctor—I stayed with the deceased until the prisoner returned, between 1 and 2 in the afternoon—she seemed just in the same condition, quite unconscious—she moved her hands and mouth, but never spoke—I was not with her when she died—I had seen her last before this on Boxing night (Tuesday), between 8 and 9—I saw her and the prisoner both at the Elder Tree public-house, Poplar—she went out and went home, and the prisoner stopped with me and my husband, and we went to the St. Leonard's Arms—we did not go home till about 11 o'clock, but the prisoner left us about 10, and went home with a pot of half-and-half in a can—that was the last I saw of him that night—when I went into his room the next morning I saw the can on the table—it was the publican's can—Mrs. Hogan took it up when the potman called for it, and I saw blood on it, as if it had been taken hold of with a hand stained with blood—that was about 9 or 10 o'clock—the prisoner had left before that—Mrs. Hogan wiped off the blood—it was about the middle of the can—I let lodgings at this time—besides the prisoner and deceased Mr. and Mrs. Hogan were lodging with me, and two or three men lodgers—the prisoner has lodged with me three or four years—the deceased had been with him about nine mouths, and they occu<lb/>pied that one room—she used to call him <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>—all the lodgers have keys of the outer door—the prisoner's room was the back room, first floor—I slept in the front parlour, not the room under the prisoner—my little girl slept in that room, and a little boy two years old—the two men lodgers slept up stairs in the first floor front, with my sons—I went to bed that night about 11.30—I believe the prisoner and deceased were in their room then—my little girl let them in—they lived and slept in the one room—the two men lodgers were not at home that night, nor my son, they had gone to the play, and did not come home till late—their room and the prisoner's adjoin—only a wainscot separates them—I am certain the two men did come home and sleep there that, night; they came down and had their breakfast the next morning, and I saw that their bed had been slept in—when I lifted up the deceased then I saw a ring round her neck, I mean a crease, a mark like something round her neck—I can't say how that had been caused, it looked as if she had been pulled up by</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edmund Hogan, and lodge with the last witness—the prisoner and deceased occupied a room on the same floor as ours—there are three rooms on a floor—on Tuesday night, 26th Decem<lb/>ber, boxing-night, I heard the prisoner come home, about 10 o'clock, or it might be a few minutes after—the deceased was not with him—I had not hoard her come up—the prisoner came up stairs, and went into his own room—I heard him open the door, go in and shut it; I did not hear it locked—about four or five minutes afterwards I heard him open the door again, and come out on the landing to fetch a pail, which they kept there—I heard him move it, and I heard the deceased say "Oh, Jack, don't!"—I had heard no noise or anything before that—he went back into the room, and shut the door again—a few minutes afterwards I heard a great noise in the room, as if someone was dancing and jumping about, and it shook my room—I did not hoar anyone speak—my husband came in soon after 10 o'clock, and he began to sing; he had been out, being boxing day, and I remarked to him "<hi rend="italic">Ned</hi>, you are singing, and Harriet and Jack are dancing"—I thought they were dancing—it was quiet then for about ten minutes, and my husband and I went to bed, and when I was going to lie down I heard the noise again, as if someone was dancing, and it shook my floor, and as if someone fell up against the partition that parted their room and mine—I suppose that was about 10.30 or 10.40—I heard no<lb/>thing more that night—next morning Mrs. Manners called me into the prisoner's room, and I saw the deceased lying in the middle of the bed, with the clothes covered up over her—she had on her stays, an apron, petticoat and shift—the stays were laced up—her mouth was split right open down to the chin—her eyes were both black and closed, and there was a great cut on the eyebrow—I believe it was over the right eye—I spoke to her two or three times, but got no answer—there was a red mark all round her neck, as if something bad been tied tight round the neck—there was a black and blue mark round her neck—it could not have been caused by any part of her clothing, or the bed clothes—her face was very much bruised all over—I saw two great places of blood on the floor, and splashes of blood on the table—there was no cloth on the table—I saw two or three splashes of blood on the fire-place—there were no fire-irons—the blood on the floor was dry—it looked as if it had been wiped over with something—I know that they had a pail, which they used to keep on the landing, and I saw that pail in the room in the morning—I had not noticed the pail on the lauding the previous evening—it was a wooden pail, with an iron handle, and I believe three iron hoops round it—on the table I saw a public-house can—it was half full, or perhaps more, of beer—it would hold a quart, not more, I think—it looked like beer—I did not taste it—when the potman came for the can I flung the beer away, and saw a great mark, as if somebody had laid hold of it with a bloody hand—there were three or four finger-marks—the can was not painted or japanned, it was a clean tin can—I saw a broken chair in the room, with spots of blood on it, that was under the bedstead, pushed up against the wall—the back was broken right off, and the bottom was all broken up; it had no covering to it; it was a cane-bottomed chair—the deceased and I wore on friendly terms—we had been out together on the boxing-morning, and had two pints of ale—I was very often in her room—I was in there about 3.30 on boxing-day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187201290024"/>
               <p>—I did not notice the broken chair then—it might have been there—they had three chairs, including that—I did not see the prisoner in the room on the morning of the 25th—I saw him about 8 o'clock, as he was coming back, with three-pennyworth of brandy, that was before I went into the room—as I was going out on an errand I noticed his appearance—I noticed blood on his right hand, round his nails, and under his nails—I looked at his hand, and he put it in his right hand trouser's pocket—he was in the habit of wearing Blucher boots, similar to these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw the prisoner again about 1.30 in the day, when he came back from the Isle of Dogs, and I said to him "Oh, Jack, how did this happen?"—he said "I don't know, Mrs. Hogan, I was <hi rend="italic">tight</hi> last night, I was very drunk"—we used to call him Jack—there were two men lodging in the house, but they were not home when this happened—I can hear when they come in—I did not hear them at all that night—I saw them come down stairs next morning—I saw that their bed had been slept in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). I arrested the prisoner at 195, St. Leonard's Street—I told him what it was for—he said "I will go with you," nothing further—at that time the room door was locked by the Coroner's officer—about 8 o'clock on Thursday the 28th, I went to the room with the divisional surgeon, Mr. Brownfield, and there found the body of the deceased—she had three heavy cuts on her face, one on the right eye, blood was then oozing out of it, one on the right side of the head above the eye, and one on the right side of the face near the chin—she also had a large black mark, a bruise, on the right arm—the room was very much upset—the little furniture that was in it was in a disordered state—there were two broken plates or dishes near the bed, with marks of blood on them, which appeared fresh at that time—I produce some plates that I found underneath the bed—I have not got the broken ones here—I pointed them out to Mrs. Hogan—un<lb/>derneath the bed I found part of a broken chair—it did not appear to have been broken recently—I examined that carefully—there was a large spot of blood near the fire-place, about a yard from the bed—there were spots of blood on the leaf of the table, as if the blood had spurted from the ground upwards—the leaf was down—the blood on the floor appeared as if it had been wiped over with some cloth—I did not find anything that had been used for that purpose, no towel or cloth—there was no wash-hand basin in the room—I then went to the station and charged the prisoner with causing the death of the deceased—I examined his clothes—I found blood stains on the left leg of his trowsers, they appeared fresh then, and as if they had been wiped—these are the trowsers, they are corduroy—I pointed them out to the prisoner, and said "What is this?"—he said "it is beer"—there are also marks of blood where it is</p>

               <p>turned up—those marks appeared to be fresh, they were not quite dry—this was on the Thursday evening—they were not dry as they are now, and the stains are not so visible—the prisoner's boots were taken off, and the left one was pointed out to me by a constable—there was a mark of blood upon it—it appeared to be covered with mud round the sole, but there was no mud where the mark was, the blood was above the mud—the marks were redder then than they are now—I had no doubt as to what the marks were—I showed them to Dr. Brown field that same night, about 10.30—he is not here—I also showed them to Dr. Kennedy, who is here—I have had some experience in wounds and blows—they appeared to me to have been produced by kicks—I thought so at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mrs. Manners, and live with her—on the morning of 27th December, about 8 o'clock, I was down stairs in the kitchen, having my breakfast, and saw the prisoner come down from up stairs with a pail of water—he was dirty—he had on the same things that he has now—he had no jacket on, only his trousers, waistcoat, and shirt—he threw the water down the sink—they used to keep the pail up stairs, and used it to wash in—they kept a can full of water in the room, behind the door—he did not take any water up stairs with him—I saw the prisoner and deceased come home on the previous night—the deceased came in at 9.30—my little sister let her in—the prisoner came home at 10—I let him in—he brought a can of beer with him, and he went up stairs to his own room—about four or five minutes afterwards I heard a noise as if they were dancing about—the place was shaking—I thought at the time that they were dancing—they were then quiet for a few minutes, and then they began again, and I heard the deceased say "Oh, Jack, don't!"—I heard nothing else that night—next morning, after the prisoner had emptied the pail and gone up, he came down again—he was then washed and was cleaner—he said "Emma, go and tell your mother I want to speak to her"—I went and told her, and she went up.</p>

                  </hi>. On 22nd November I think, I met William Syers in the Old Kent Road, and drove with him to Cinnamon Street—I saw five bales of cotton, similar to this, put into his van—I did not see who loaded them—we then drove to 8 1/2, Hermitage Street—the name over the door was Walmsley and Co., cotton dealers—it is at a blacksmith's shop, the bales were not taken through the blacksmith's shop, but through the entrance—if there is a warehouse there, it is a very small one—I did not see it—I saw Charles Syers go to Middleton's wharf, on 4th December—I saw four bales loaded into his van, just before 2 o'clock—I followed and saw them de<lb/>livered</p>

               <p>at Newcomb and Dunster's, French Horn Yard—Sharpe and Syers assisted in loading—I saw Newcomb on the steps at French Horn Yard—he looked over into the van, apparently counting the bales.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Belsize Park Gardens, Hamp<lb/>stead, and am a wharfinger, in partnership with two others, at 8, Bride's Wharf, part of the wharf is in Cinnamon Street—Burton was head-foreman of our establishment, and Edwards was the cotton foreman—Baker was an occasional foreman, and he was frequently employed to make deliveries—Sharpe was an occasional labourer, employed at Burton's discretion—a car<lb/>man who applies for goods presents the order at the counting-house, and the clerk appointed for the purpose enters the order in a book—Mr. Chap<lb/>man, or any clerk, would enter it into an order-book, to register it and give it a number, the order would then go from him to the clerk keeping the stock-book, ho would refer to the stock-book to see that the order was pro<lb/>perly signed by the person authorised to take the goods, and if he found the order to be correct, he would sign it, stating the time it was presented, and giving full particulars for the identification of the goods, in order that the foreman in the warehouse would know where to find them, or they would go to the chief foreman, Burton—after the delivery took place, the foremen, Burton or Ellis, or a foreman appointed by either of them, would endorse on the back of the order the full particulars of the bales so de<lb/>livered,</p>

               <p>giving the marks, numbers, weights, and all particulars—he would then hand the delivery-order into the counting-house, where a clerk would make out the receiving note to Messrs. So-and-So, "Please receive, &amp;c."—the name of the ship and the port that she came from, giving the full particulars of the marks and the numbers which had been endorsed on the delivery-order, and the number of bales and the weight, on the counterfoil of which he would take the carman's receipt for those goods, and the carman would take the receiving-note and show it to the con<lb/>stable before the van left the premises—Burton, Edwards, and Baker, were aware of the course of business, but I will not say as to Sharpe—no unmarked goods, to my knowledge, are on our premises—the delivery-order would contain the same particulars—bales of cotton consigned to our pre<lb/>mises, as a rule, are marked "S. &amp; C. C," in a diamond—they have not the name of the ship, but there are letters on the heads and sides of the bales—one bale here has had the end cut out, and another piece sewn in its place—on this second bale the marks have also been cut out, and these pieces of gunny have been sewn in the places, this was originally marked the same as the others—the mark on the side has been cut out as well, and parts of old gunny bag have been sewn in.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in the house with Mr. Rosenstein when this affair took place, as errand-boy—on Saturday night, 9th December, they had been to some place of amusement—when they came up stairs the deceased began swearing at the prisoner, and he said "The idea of a woman like you going out and getting drunk, and giving a good half-sovereign for a bad one," and he swore at her—she did not quarrel with him—I was in the workshop, and they were in the bedroom, on the same floor—next morning I was lighting the fire, they were in the bedroom, and I heard him swearing at her—she answered him, but not to blackguard him in any way—they sent me out to get some soap—that was about 11.30—the quarrelling commenced about 11.15, in the morning—I was lighting the fire then, and that was when I first heard him swearing at her—I went out for the soap, and as I came back I saw him coming out of the barber's, with his head bleeding—my mistress was not at home, and I went with my master to Mrs. North's house—I met him coming out of Paget's—he went to his own house, and then to Mrs. North's, in Dean Street—I did not see the prisoner there, and from there we went to King's College Hos<lb/>pital—I saw his head dressed, and I then returned home with him—he went to bed, and he sent me down to fetch Bosman, his foreman—he had about eight men and two or three women working for him—Bosman came about 6 o'clock in the evening, with his mother, and they remained some time with my master—Mrs. Rosenstein came home on the Tuesday week—my master was very ill then, and confined to his bed—she attended to his heads, and dressed it when he returned.</p>

               <p>in the habit of drinking—I saw him partake of the best part of a pint of rum on the Sunday night, the same day that it happened—he took it neat—he was drinking after that on the Wednesday night; he drank rum then—I fetched three half-quarterns, and he and a man named Fisher shared it between them; that was neat—he had a fall on the Wednesday—he was sitting on a chair, leaning his head on the table in the workshop—he fell off the chair, he fell sideways, and struck his head against the leg of a side-table—that was about 9 or 9.30 after he had finished the three half-quarterns of rum—the workmen had all gone—Mr. Fisher had gone—I lifted him up and led him to his bedroom—on the Thursday morning we were going down Lincoln's Inn Fields, and he complained of a pain in his head—we were going to the Civil Service—he worked for them—I used to keep his books—he said "I have got a pain in my head this morning" and I said "Yes, you had a fall last night," and he said "Yes, I know, I had been drink<lb/>ing"—coming back from the Civil Service he had some drink, he generally calls at one house—he went into the public-house and I waited outside—when I led him to bed on the Wednesday he was intoxicated; he could not walk—that was from drink—he generally took his meals in the workshop—he had been drinking rum before in the day, before Mr. Fisher came—I fetched it from the <hi rend="italic">Ship</hi>—I had fetched two half-quarterns, I think, no one shared that with him, that was in the day time, and he had been out alone before Mr. Fisher came—I went to the hospital with him on the Tuesday—after the Thursday and before his death, he drank port wine and rum—every day he drank something—he took port wine four or five days before his death—Dr. Mumford was there then—I don't know whether he ordered the port wine—he used to drink rum at the same time as he drank the port wine—I had been with Mr. and Mrs. Rosenstein about four or five months—I have seen the deceased drunk a good many times, and when he was drunk he was very quarrelsome—he was always quarrelling with his wife and fighting when he was drunk—he has thrown things at her—the quarrels generally commenced on his side—she was a sober woman, and her conduct was always kind towards him—when she came back during his illness she used to make him everything he wanted, and she dressed his head.</p>

               <p>went to 6, Little Turnstile, where I saw the prisoner—I was in uniform—I told her I should take her into custody for causing the death of her hus<lb/>band by striking him a blow on the head, on 9th December, and she would have to go with me to the station—she said "It can't be helped; I suppose I must go; but I have plenty of witnesses to prove he fell down since"—Mr. Bosman was there, and as we were leaving the room he said "You had better tell the whole truth"—when we got into the street the prisoner said "I will tell you; we had a quarrel on Saturday night; we had been out to a music hall, and on returning went into a public-house in Great Queen Street, and had two three-pennyworths of port wine; I placed a half-sovereign on the counter, and the landlady took it up and broke it in two"—I saw it afterwards, it was broken in half, but it was good, there was a flaw in it—she said "We quarrelled about it, and he went on at me, and on Sunday morning, when we got up, he commenced again; I was stooping down to light the fire, and he struck me over the shoulders with a poker; I jumped up; I picked up something, I think it was a poker, and I struck him on the head; it bled much; I was frightened, and went away, and did not return till the following Friday"—I took her to the station, where she was charged—Bosman followed to the station, but he could not hear what was said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and house surgeon at King's College Hospital—John Rosenstein came there about mid-day on Sunday, 10th December, with a severe wound of the scalp, which was bleeding very profusely—I examined it, but could detect no fracture at that time—I probed it—the wound was on the upper part of the head, almost in the middle line, but slightly on the right side—it did not present any severe symptoms of any kind at that time—it was about an inch long—I felt that the wound had penetrated the scalp and reached the skull in one small point—I dressed the wound in the ordinary way—I saw him again on the Tuesday, about 10 o'clock in the morning, at the hospital—I dressed the wound again, and I did not see him after that until the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I should think such a wound as that was would be more likely to be caused by an instrument than a fall, but I should not like to give an opinion as to the kind of instrument that inflicted a scalp wound—it seemed to me to have been caused by a blow—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and I identified the same wound which I had dressed on the Sunday—when we removed the covering of the skull, we found the periosteum of the bone bared in one small point—upon scraping away the periosteum, we found a depression about the size and shape of an almond on the skull—on removing the skull cap, we found the inner table of the skull fractured at a point corresponding with the depression on the outer table—the fracture had not penetrated the brain, but one of the sharp points had slightly scratched the membrane between the brain and the skull, causing a slight extravasation of blood there—we removed the membrane and found a large amount of <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> over the right hemisphere of the brain running down the middle line between the two halves of the brain—underneath the right hemisphere of the brain between it and the lower brain there was another clot of blood, and there was a small amount of <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> on the left hemisphere—there was also a bruise on the right groin and another on the right collar bone, but I could not tell how they had been caused—I should think the bruise on the shoulder was caused by several blows—I don't think one blow would have caused it—the cause of death was undoubtedly the effusion of that matter on the brain which was caused by the irritation of the splinter of bone, which rubbed the membrane outside it—the fracture, such as it was, was in the interior part of the scalp, and the fragment irritated the membrane outside the brain, and so caused the effusion—when I dressed the wound there was nothing which led me to detect that depression or fracture which I found at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—there was a depression on the outer part of the bone, the fracture was inside—I think the fracture was produced by a severe blow from some instrument with a projection of some kind—I should think that this rim of the poker would be most likely to have caused the wound—if it had been caused by any other part, I think the fracture would have been different—you would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187201290041"/>
               <p>have a long fracture—I don't think it was caused by the flat part, but either by the knob or the rim—the external wound would have been different—it would have been a wound with two or three angles to it, I think—I have heard about the deceased falling and striking his head against the table leg—that would not produce such a fracture, in my judgment—if it opened the wound so as to cause blood to flow, it would not affect the fracture, only the wound—his chance of recovery from the first was very slight; almost nil, I think—intemperate habits, such as drinking raw rum might have ac<lb/>celerated the effusion of matter, and so accelerate death, but it would not otherwise have affected the fracture.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not make the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination myself—I assisted—Mr. Mills made it, and I made the notes—I said I should not like to give an opinion as to the instrument which caused the scalp wound—the almond-like depression might have been there when I used the probe, and I should not have discovered it—it was not a fracture at all—the roughness could not be felt by the finger or the probe—the periosteum covered the bone, and it was only in one point that bare bone could be reached, and the probe, although touching the bare bone, would run over the periosteum—the almond depression must have been caused by a blow of some kind, and there can be no question that the blow which caused the scalp wound caused the depression—an injury might have caused it subse<lb/>quently to the time I saw it—it is most improbable, I think, that a fall would cause such a fracture, with such a laceration of the skull—the singular leg of a table would be very much like the rim on the poker, but I don't think a fall against it would cause such a fracture—in the one case the man would be passive and the object active, and in the case of a fall the man would be active and the object passive—the scalp wound would be different in that case—I am against the theory that the fall against the table caused the injury we found at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I admit that that and the use of the rum would accelerate death—I think the fall would accelerate the consequences of the fracture, if it struck the same part, but it would not cause the fracture itself—a man of temperate habits would have a much better chance of recovery than a man who indulged in quanti<lb/>ties of raw rum—the wound would be more fatal to an intemperate man than a sober man—I should say the poker was the most likely instrument to have caused both the scalp wound and the fracture—when the man came on the Sunday, from the wound and his general bearing I did not apprehend that his life was at all in danger—I did not see him after the Tuesday—I had told him to come again—I did not discover at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion ny other wound on the head than that which I have described.</p>

I keep the Hand and Flower beer-shop, in Queen's Road, Mortlake—on the night of 14th January, I went to bed about 10.50, the house was safe at that time, as far as I know—I fastened the back-door the last thing—about 1 o'clock, I was awoke by hearing someone in the house—I got out of bed and opened the window and looked out, I saw a man leave the house, he came out of the back door; I did not know that man—I afterwards saw the prisoner come out of my back door with a lighted candle in his hand—that is the place where I keep my beer—the prisoner had been a lodger of mine—I knew him well, and am sure he is the man—he had on the same dress he has now—I called out "Halloa, what's up there," and the prisoner looked up with the lighted candle in his hand and said "If you will come down you will see"—I put on my trousers, and went down, but the men were both gone—I am sure that the fastening of the back window was all right when I went to bed; when I came down it was on one side—a pane of glass was broken opposite the fastening, and a piece of paper had been pasted over it—it was inside there that the beer was kept—it was an eighteen gallon cask; I had tapped it that afternoon, and bunged it down; it was quite full, and in the morning about six gallons was gone—there was only my wife and children in the house—I had closed the house and bolted the door about 11 o'clock.</p>

               <p>stranger to me—on that day he called at my office, Walworth Road, and applied for a loan—I advance money on bills of sale occasionally—he offered, as security, a bill of sale on his furniture, at Norman Road, Stock<lb/>well—the understanding was that it would run over twelve months, but he said that it would only be a short time—I went to see the furniture, and asked him if he owed any rent—he said no, he had only been there a quarter, and the rent was paid up to Michaelmas—an appointment was made on the 23rd for the 25th—I asked him for the receipt for the rent at the settlement, and he produced this document, in Mr. Harris's pre<lb/>sence, which I believe to be genuine.</p>

On Saturday morning, 6th January, I was on Brixton Hill, going towards London—I met Christian and Webb at the top of Brixton Hill, close to the milestone, between the Crown and Scepter and the Telegraph—it was about 5.50—Christian asked me the way to London Bridge, and the way to Croydon, and how far it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187201290051"/>
               <p>—Webb asked me which was the nearest railway station, and I told him Brixton—I told them it was about four miles to London Bridge and about seven to Croydon—I went across the road after they left me, and took off my great coat and cape—I then followed them—I met two constables, Trigg and Godden, and I spoke to them—I saw a carriage going towards Croydon, and I jumped up behind, and just before Streatham Railway Station I met the three prisoners—I had passed them before I got off the carriage, and then I came back and met them—they were all three walking together—Anderson left the other two just before they came to me—he had no hat on—Anderson went across the road, and Christian and Webb walked up to me—I collared Christian by the neck, and Webb ran away—I sung out "Stop thief!" as loud as I could, and the two constables came up—I said "Spring the rattles," and they did so—I said "They have gone down the railway cutting"—they went down the cutting, and I held Christian until the other constable brought back Anderson—I said to Christian "What have you got in your pocket?" he said "Nothing"—I put my hand in his left-hand trousers pocket and took out a knife, and these sugar tongs and spoon out of the other pocket—I said "What have you got in this, pocket?"—he said "You are not going to search me here"—we had a severe struggle—I called out, and the railway-man came to my assistance, and I took this toast-rack out of his pocket—Anderson was brought back, and I identified him as the man who had just left—they were taken to the Brixton Police Station—I after<lb/>wards went down the railway-cutting, but I did not find anything there then—I did not know the men before—from enquiries and information I received, I went to Webb's house, 70 1/2, Goulston Street, Whitechapel, on Thursday night last—I saw him and said "I am going to take you for being concerned with two others, committed for trial, in breaking into the dwelling-house of Mr. Cosins, at Clapham Park—he said "That is a bit more you have got up for me"—I took him to Brixton Station and found a piece of paper with the name of Solomons on it, which is Anderson's proper name—I knew him by the name of Solomons, from this photograph—he was convicted in that name—I have no doubt Webb is the man—I gave a description of him.</p>

It was twenty days afterwards that Webb was taken, on Thursday, 25th, at 70 1/2, Goulston Street—he keeps a barber's shop there—the piece of paper I produced is very likely part of a bill—I did not inquire whether Webb was known by the name of Solomans—he sent for a man by the name of Green, who was the landlord—I have seen Green here.</p>

I was—twenty or thirty yards away then—he collared Christian, and the other two ran away down the railway cutting—I ran down after them, and I saw Anderson about 150 yards down the cutting—he was walking, and he turned and came back to meet me—he had no hat—he said "One has run by and knocked my hat off"—I turned my light on his face, and said I should take him—I took him back to Parslow, and he said he was one of them—I afterwards received a sugar basin from a railway porter, and he showed me where it was found—it was about twenty yards from where I took Anderson—I don't know what became of the other man—Godden was with me at the time.</p>
