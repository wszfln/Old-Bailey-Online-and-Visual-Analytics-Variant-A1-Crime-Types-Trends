I was waked by Somebody's twitching my Hat away, for I had put the Loop of it about my Finger. I started up upon my Breech, and, God! says I, where's my Shoes and Buckles? Says a Man, who was not far from me, There goes he that has got 'em, and pointed to the Prisoner, who was running off. I saw my Hat in his Hand, and followed him barefoot. He dropp'd my Hat, and jump'd over a Bank into a Garden, and I after, and took him. Now are not you a Rascal, says I, to rob a Man of his Clothes? You think to get the Devil and all of a Man, if he is but a little tight and clean. He called after the other Man, who followed at a Distance, and said, Jack! where' the Man's Shoes? but he sheer'd off. Then, says the Prisoner, if you'll go with me to Rag-Fair, plausible you may find him a selling them. So I collar'd him, and took him with me, and he went from one Place to another under that Pretence, but only wanted an Opportunity to get off; and so I got Help and secured him.</p>

On the 2d of August last I went with my Wife to Harrow, and as soon as I came home my Daughter told me that I had been robb'd; that the Prisoner went away between six and seven in the Evening, which was about an Hour and a half before my Return; that upon missing him they had some Suspicion, and went up and found my Drawers broke open; upon which, they inform'd my Neighbours, Mr. Brown and Mr. Sheppard, of what had happen'd.</p>

               <p>Mr. Dyer. Yes; that very Morning I took 10 s. out of one of the Drawers, and lock'd it, and saw all the rest were fast, but at my Return I found them all broke open. In one Drawer there was between 70 and 80 l. taken out, 500 Guineas from another, and the third was a little Drawer, in which my Wife had laid up several remarkable Pieces for my Children, Crowns, Half-crowns, Silver Groat, Three-pences, Two-Pences and Pennies, and these were all taken away. The Prisoner was taken in about five Hours after, with all the Money upon him, except 15 l. 4 s. which he had laid out in buying a great Coat, Whip, Boots, Sputs, a Trunk to put the Money on, and several other odd Things. I went in Pursu't of him towards Harwich, but he was taken in Kent by others who followed him in Dover Road. I did not see him till the Saturday following, and then he confess'd to me that he had broke open my Drawers, and taken my Money.</p>

            . Two Hours after the Robbery Mr. Brown and Mr. Sheppard sent for me, and told me the Prisoner had robbed his Master of 5 or 600 l. and desired me to go in Pursuit of him. It happen'd that I took Post horse at the same Inn as the Prisoner did; and at the second Stage, which was Dartford in Kent, I heard that such a Person as the Prisoner was but just gone out of the Inn, and could hardly he got 40 Yards off. I follow'd, and in about two Miles he was stopp'd by another Person who had got the Start of me, and brought him back, and we return'd to the Inn at Dartford. John, says I, how do ye do? - How do you do? says he again. God, says I, John, I am glad to see you; where is the Money? 'Tis in that Trank, says he I ask'd him how much there was? He said he had not told it yet, but had intended to tell it as soon as he came to Rochester. Upon searching I found there was 546 l. 3 s. 6 d. in the Trunk, besides other Money that he had about him. Then he gave me a Seal with which I scal'd up the Trunk He confess'd very readily, and was willing to come home with me, but we sat up there all Night. I ask'd him how he could serve his Master so, and what he had propos'd to do with the Money? He said, his Master was a good Master, and that he intended to make his Master Returns in Goods for the Money, designing to go directly to France, and so to Legborn, and from thence to send over Bermudas Hats to his Master. It seems there was some Money in his Clothes that were in the Trunk, which I did not see. He was afterwards sent to Maidstone Goal, from whence he was removed hither by a Habe Corpus.</p>

Some Irishmen, of whom the Prisoner was one, coming behind them, and hearing what Sudlow said, they ask'd if he had found Six-pence? He said yes. Why then, says one of them, 'tis mine. How do you know, says Sudlow, has it any Mark? Damn you, says the other, 'tis mine, and I'll have it. Well then, says Sudlow, you shall have it, if you'll give me a Pint of Beer. No, damn you, says the Irishman, I'll have it without, or I'll have as much out of your Bones. Sudlow, at last, gave him the Six-pence, and as soon as he had got it he knock'd Sudlow down with a Stick, though there was no Provocation given; and then the rest of the Irishmen fell upon him too: Some of them had Sticks, but I can't say the Prisoner had any; so they all fell to fighting: Sudlow was very much abus'd, and cut in the Head. He went into the House, and got his Head dress'd, and then coming out again, they fell upon him afresh. The Deceased was then standing at the Tavern Door in his Waistcoat.

Upon which the Prisoner step'd up to him, and said, Damn you, you Rascal, do you Chatter? At this the Deceas'd began to strip; but, before he could get his Clothes off, and while his Arms were pinion'd behind him, being part out and part in the Sleeves, the Prisoner fell upon him, and knock'd him down against the Bench with his Fist, by which Blow the Deceas'd's Lip was cut thro', and then, holding the Deceas'd up against the Bench with his Knee, beat him in a violent Manner, and afterwards kick'd him on the Belly, so that his Belly was broke.</p>

They swore they would not stand for Marks; but Mark, or no Mark they would have it; and one of them held up a Stick, and offer'd to strike the Porter, and he, rather than be beat, gave the Six-pence to one of them, who, notwithstanding this, as soon as he had got it, knock'd the Porter down, and beat him unmercifully.

            . Going along Prince's Street with another Porter, I stoop'd down, and took up a Six-pence. Luck Thee here I says I to him, I have found Six-pence. What, says he, best Thee found Six-pence? that's good Luck indeed, let's have a full Pot out of it? Some Men follow'd us, and one of them own'd the Six-pence, which at last I gave him, and as soon as he had got it, he knock'd me down with a Stick, and I saw several Sticks among them.</p>

There was a Braise six Inches long in the Groin a little above the O Pubs, and upon opening the Abdoman, I found the Intestines were forced into the Scrotum. They were turned black, and the Stench was very offensive This Rupture was the cause of his Death; it was impossible he should have liv'd in that condition, for it hinder'd all the Operations of Nature, so that he could neither make Urine nor go to Stool, but whatever he took in could have no Passage taro' him, but must have been discharged again at his Mouth, and he must have lain in violent Torment.</p>

On Monday his private Parts were swell'd up bigger than my two Fists; I sent for Mr. Godfrey, a Surgeon, belonging to the Guards, and he order'd some Stuff to bathe him with, but it did not abate the Swelling, and my poor Husband was in such Torment, that he could not rest Night nor Day, but cry'd out like a Woman in Labour, from the Time he was brought home, to the Time of his Death, which was on the Friday Morning following; he had no Passage below, he never went to Stool or Urine the natural way, but all came up at his Mouth; and before this happen'd he was very well, and in as good a State of Health as any Man in this Court.</p>

Laud, says I, this is like Mrs. Till's Ring. Gode daum you, says she, she never bade such an a Ring in her Leef; and afterwards she said, her Master had the Ring, and then she sent to borrow three Rings to see whether I would swear my parjur'd Oath upon the wrong Ring, and so I went and told Mrs. Till how and about it.</p>

            . On the 28th of July, just at Midnight, as I was crossing Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, I was set upon by five Men; it was a very clear Star-light Night, and I could see very plainly. Grace came up first, took me by the Collar, and said, Damn you, you Dog, stand, and deliver your Money; if you speak a Word you are a dead Man. I look'd him very hard in the Face. Two others then rifled my Pockets, and while they were taking my Money, a short Man in a Cap and a blue Jacket, whom I take to be Richardson, came behind me, struck me on the Arm and took my Hat and Wig. - I look'd over my Shoulder and saw him. - Him and Grace I remember, but I don't know Smithson. - Grace held me fast, but took nothing from me.</p>
               <p>Grace. How long was it after the Robbery before you saw me?</p>

I reel'd against a Stationer's Bulk, but presently recovering my self, I miss'd my Handkerchief, and follow'd them up Brownlow-Street, and at the Upper-end of it, next Bedford-Row.

            , and they being taken in such Clothes, and brought before the Justice, when he was present, he said, he was certain both to Simonds and to Sutton. He was desired to be cautions, because the Mens Lives were at Stake; but he said he was positive of it. - It was afterwards buzz'd in our Neighbourhood, that he was about making the Matter up. I ask'd his Wife about it, and she said, Mrs. Sutton had indeed been with her Husband, but he was a Man of more honour than to take Money to stop the Prosecution. And the Woman who keeps the Crow Alehouse, told me, that the Prosecutor and Sutton's Mother had been at her House together.</p>
               <p>Court. What one or the other told you is no Evidence. Is either of them here?</p>
               <p>Waker. Yes; here's Mrs. Turst.</p>
               <p>Court. Mrs. Turst, has Sutton's Mother had any Conversation with your Husband?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Turst. Yes; she was twice at our House, after my Husband had sworn before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. And did she desire him not to Prosecute, or at least, to be favourable?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Turst. Yes; and he answer'd, The Law should take place, and desir'd her not to trouble him any farther, this was the first Time; but she came again, and intreated for her Son, and protested he was innocent, and my Husband told her as before, that the Law should take place; and I don't know that he was with her afterwards at the Crow Alehouse or any where else.</p>

            . I keep a Broker's Shop, in High-Holbourn. About ten Weeks ago, two Men came into my Shop, and ask'd for a Case of Pistols. I shew'd them a pair, they look'd on them, and ask'd the Price, I told them 10 s. or 10 s. 6 d. I forget which, they laid them down, and went away. In a little time, they came again, and another Man with them, and said, they were dear; I told them I would take no less, and then one of them gave me a Shilling Earnest, and said they would fetch them before Night, and at Night two of them came, and brought the rest of the Money and took them away.</p>

               <p>- Philips. I was in the Square with the Nurse and the young Lady. When we return'd, and Mrs. Cope found she had been robb'd, I went among the Hackney-Coachmen, and enquir'd if they knew who had carry'd such a Fare. By eleven at Night, I found the Coachman, who told me, that he took up such a Person in Brook-street, and carry'd her to the Vine Tavern in Holbourn, where she treated him. Thence he drove her to London-Bridge, where she bought two gold Rings, and after that to the World's-End. I went to the World's-End after her, and saw her and a Man in their Shifts at the Window, but as soon as they perceiv'd me, they shut the Sash down, and the Man and Woman of the House came in their Places, and ask'd What I wanted? I told them my Business, and they said there was no Body in the House but themselves. But when I got in, I took the Prisoner and the Man in the Yard, as they were getting over the Pails. How do you do, Nanny? says I. Fellow, says she, I know you not. And at the same Time I perceived she was fumbling with her Fingers, to get the Rings off. I call'd a Watchman, and searching her, found 31 Guineas, a half Crown, and 3 s. 6 d. in her Pocket. I ask'd her whose Money that was? and she answer'd, What's that to you, Fellow? But next Morning she own'd, that the Money, the Rings, a Necklace, and other Things that were found upon her were all her Mistress's.</p>

I saw the Money there on Sunday the 15th of July, which was 2 Days before I lost it, and I went out about my Business, and the Prisoner had the Keys of my Room to clean it, and she lived by Grays-Inn-Lane, and she was my Acquaintance; and I came home again, and the Door was open, and so was my Box; and the Money, and the Seal, and the Linen were gone. And I went after her, and took her by Brooks-Market, with my Linen, and 3 Handkerchiefs and a Stock; and this Linen was 2 Yards of blue and white Linen, and it was in my great Box; and she was rescued from me by 2 Men, and we had a Constable, but he had no Warrant, and so he said he could not hold her; and afterwards we found her at Mr. Calender's in Kingsland-Road with another Woman's Husband that kept her Company, and we got a Warrant and carried her to Clerkenwell, and she confess'd before the Justice.</p>

            . The Day my Uncle was robb'd he sent for me, and I went with him to enquire after the Prisoner at Holborn-Bars, we heard she had been there, and was fuddled, and went away in a Coach. Then we went to the Castle in Brook's-Market, and she had been there too, but was gone. We went out and met her in the Street with the Linen upon her. We got a Constable, and coming to Saffron-Hill, 2 Men came up, and said, she should go no farther without a Warrant, and so she fell down, and we could not get her along. The Constable desir'd us to make it up, because he could not carry her before his Majesty - the Magistrate, without a Warrant; so she said she'd give my Uncle the Remainder of the Money, which was 6 Shillings and a Penny, and he took it.</p>

            . The same Morning the Prosecutor was robb'd I saw the Prisoner in a Brandy Shop; she pull'd out nine or ten Guineas, and had got a new Gown and new Shoes and Clogs. I did not know of the Robbery then, but the Prosecutor told me of it soon after. We found her in Brooks-Market, and he said to her, Sarah! how came you to rob me? I rob you? says she, here, take your Linen. So we got a Constable, but two Butchers rescued her, and she beat me, and threaten'd to cut my Throat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor and I lived together as Man and Wife, but not contented with that, he lock'd me up for three Weeks together, and would not let me see Man, Woman, nor Child; and so at last I got away, and because I did not come home again when he would have had me, he said he would transport me. I have got three Love Letters here that he sent to me since I was in Newgate.</p>

I went up Stairs to Mrs. Bishop, and told her my Daughter was very Forward. She ask'd me how I meant forward? I told her, and shew'd her the Linen. She said, that could be no natural Thing, and bad me examine the Child, and so I did. I ask'd her what was the Matter? and promis'd not to beat her, if she would tell me the Truth.

               <p>Mason. Yes, she was torn as much as a Child could be. Court. How far do you think she had been penetrated? Mason. I can't say exactly, but as far as could be in Reason.</p>
               <p>Court. In what Condition was her Linen? Was it bloody? Mason. Yes, and I ask'd her how long it was since it was done? and she said, the last time was about a Week before, and that he had done it 3 times. The outer Parts were ulcerous. I said, I believ'd the Child had got an ill Distemper, and advis'd them to go to a Surgeon, because I had no Judgement in those Things. They went, but when the Surgeons heard how it happen'd, they would not be concern'd in it for fear they should have the Trouble of attending at the Trial, and so the Child was forc'd to be sent to an Hospital, from whence we brought her now. The Doctors there, said she must be laid down, but they would not do it till the Trial was over, because if they took her in Hand first, she could not be brought hi her.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you make any Judgment by what you saw on the Linen, whether there was an Emission of Seed? Though it might not be decent on any other Occasion, yet as a Man's Life is at Stake, there's a Necessity for the Question. Mason.

               <p>Court. Do so. It is not, indeed, a very decent Sight, but in this Case its necessary. - Let the Prisoner stand aside a while.</p>
               <p>The Messenger who was sent for the Linen, being return'd, the Prisoner was again set to the Bar. Prosecutor. This is my Child's Shift. Court. I thought it was the Prisoner's Shirt that was sent for! Prosecutor. Then I mistook; for I have not got his Shirt.</p>
               <p>Court. However, since the Shift is come, let the Jury look on it. - Is this the Shift the Child had on when she was abused?</p>

I live not far from the Prisoner, and have many times had her as a Patient, with violent Bruises and Cuts, when she has been beaten by her Husband, and I have often told her, he would certainly kill her sometime or other.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Palmer. Between 7 and 8, on Tuesday Morning, I heard an Outery, that the Deceas'd was murder'd. I did not wonder at it, for I had often heard the same. However, I went to see her, and found her speechless, but I fetch'd some Drops and gave her, and then she came a little to herself. Who has misus'd you so? says I. The Rogue my Husband, says she. What did he beat you with? - The Heel of his Shoe. - And with any thing else? - Yes, with a nasty ragged, rough pointed Stick. - Did. he give you any thing to drink? - Yes, a little sow'r Ale. I ask'd where she was hurt? She trembl'd, and pointed to her Head, Neck, Stomach, and Breast. I saw the impression of a Key, and something like Money on her Breast. She was carry'd upfor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173309120024"/> for dead, and when the Surgeon came to bleed her, the Prisoner came up too, and said, Damn her, is not the old Bitch dead yet! O fie ! says I. If she is not, says he, I will kill her, for I will be hang'd for her. Pris. Was not she drunk? E. Palmer. No, she was sober when I saw her at 11 a Clock o' Monday Night. Pris. Did not she go to your House for Drink ? E. Palmer. No; Mrs. Wood came for it. Court. If she was drunk, that will not justify you in killing her.</p>
