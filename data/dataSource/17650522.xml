            . I am an old cloaths-man; I took this piece of velvet out of pawn. (producing another piece.) The prisoner took me there to take it out. Another time I took three shirts out of pawn for him. The first was about a month before Christmas: I knew him before; he said he bought the three shirts in France, and wanted a little money; so I took them out for him: they were in Shoreditch: the velvet was at a pawnbroker's, in Bow-street, Covent Garden. I paid a pound or guinea for the shirts, and four shillings for the velvet; he said he got the velvet also in France, when he was there with his master.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hawkins. I am a salesman in Monmouth-street: the other witness and prisoner brought this boat to me to sell. (Produced in Court.) I bought it of Denison for 12 s. Seeing a crest upon it, I bought it in order to find out the owner, suspecting it to have been stolen: after that I took up Denison; he found the prisoner; he was taken before Justice Fielding; there he confessed he had taken the things mentioned in the indictment. He said two shirts and the sword belong to the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Wilkinson. There had been words about the work; she worked with my mistress in the making of soldiers clothes; they had words about the work, and about the things; the prisoner and her husband took other people's work, and would not work for my mistress; they worked for my mistress till about two months after she missed the things: she was to work the money out; but as she would work for other people, and not for my mistress, then my mistress call'd upon her for these things.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Porter. How came you, when you knew these things were gone, not to take her up?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Porter. Because she sell a crying, and said she would soon get them out again: I expected they would bring them home, but they did not, and the prisoner abused me so that I could not live in my own house for her.</p>

They insisted upon my staying all night; I said, I had no money, and must go: they began to come close to me; they got some halfpence from me; I had 4 s. and 6 d. in another pocket; they got it all away, I can't tell how; they were for getting my hat and wig; then they wanted my buckles, they were silver; I took them out and put them into my left side breeches pocket: they insisted upon my staying: I was afraid to fight: I said, let me go and tell my ship-mates, and I'll come again; they would not let me, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176505220006"/> pulled me down on the bed, and two or three pulling me about for five or six minutes, the prisoner asked me what I was doing; I said God help me, I wished I was below. Presently they said, young man, you are welcome to go: I felt for my buckles, they were gone: I went to the alehouse, there was the prisoner again: I asked her for my buckles; she said, I might drink some of the beer, but should not have them without I would give her a crown; I said, what must I give you a crown for, I never sat down in your house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get them again?</p>
               <p>Newman. No. She said she had the buckles: I said to the master of the house, must I have no help; he said, it was not done in his house: then she said, I should have them for half a guinea; but if I was saucy I should not have them at all. She said, if I would go back with her, I should have them in the morning. I went and staid there; she pulled my cloaths off against my will, and lay by the side of me in the bed: in the morning she asked me for a shilling for my lodging. She took my hat and wig from me: I took them and went away. I took her up next day about 11 o'clock: she said, the buckles were sold for 14 s. but did not say to whom.

            . I live in Leadenhall-street, and am a baker: on Monday the 6th of May I sent my man out with a basket of bread; he soon returned, and said his basket was gone again; this was the third I lost. I put on a disguise in order to see for it; I was directed by a brother baker to go to Chick-lane; I asked a baker there if he had seen any such; he said, here is a baker that has almost ruined me, by selling bread cheaper than the standard: I went on, and saw the prisoner pitch a basket and take six quartern loaves, two under each arm, and two upon his head, and go into this baker's shop, named Becket; I followed him into the house; the man and wife took the bread and set it on the counter: the baker's man went to secure the basket; I followed the prisoner towards the basket; and said, do you know who owns this basket; he said, no; he did not know any thing of it. I took him back to the shop; the man and woman began to swear they knew nothing of the prisoner: I took the prisoner before my Lord Mayor: we never got back the six quartern loaves; they swore so, and made such a to do, that I could not get at them. I doubt not but there has been 400 baskets lost within sixteen or eighteen months, with bread in them.</p>

            . I am a pavior's labourer, and live in Poppin's alley: I was going through the alley between 11 and 12 that day; I saw M'Guire take hold of the chain of the prosecutor's watch, and pull the watch out; he put it from his right hand into his left, and put it into his left hand pocket. I said, M'Guire, what are you about? why do you take the man's watch? said he, I'll take care of it for him: he then put his hand to the prosecutor's breeches pocket; hearing nothing in it, he took hold of his waistcoat, and in the pocket found some half-pence, and put them into his pocket; then he counted fifteen-pence half-penny, and said, fearing the man should go into any company he returned him them. Now, Dailey, said he, I'll give you a pot of beer to see this man home; said I, see him home yourself; you have got his watch. I went over to the Borough to my work, and staid there four nights: when I came home, as my wife and I were at supper, she told me that M'Guire and the other milkman had had a trial at Guildhall that day: I said, did he return the man his watch; no, said she; so I went and told Sherridon that I saw him take it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known M'Guire?</p>
               <p>Dailey. I have known him about thirteen or fourteen months: he lives in Plumbtree-court, Shoe-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Dailey. I went with him three days.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for your trouble?</p>
               <p>Dailey. I never had a farthing; I borrowed six-pence of him, that is all I got.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What sort of a watch was yours?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was a silver watch, with a silver chain and silver seal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all of the thing they charge me with: Mr. Sherridon and I happened to be together; we had three pots of beer in Poppin's-alley; then we removed to the Plough, in Black Horse alley; he forced me to stay with him: I told him I must go to my cow-keeper for my monthly bill, and I wanted money to pay it; he lent me half a guinea; we shook hands, and he went one way and I another: I went and paid my cow-keeper; and about two o'clock he and his wife came to the Red Lion, in Poppin's-alley; she demanded his watch and 7 s. 6 d. in money; she said, she catched him asleep with his breeches about his heels, and that he had been asleep in the street about an hour; that he could neither stand nor go: after that he came and demanded his watch of me, and 13 s. 6 d; I thought at first he was joking with me; I said, you know what is between us, I owe you half a guinea, and no more: about three or four days after he served me with a summons; I went and answered to it before Mr. Alderman Blackistone; I was there acquitted: after that this Dailey happened to be in the way; then I was served with another summons: Dailey owes me a trifle of money for milk; I had asked him for it; he swore he would be up with me; but I never thought he would be the man that would go to swear my life away: Mr. Sherridon never owned that I had his watch, till after Dailey came and swore I had it: since that Sherridon swears point blank that I had it: I never saw Dailey at the time they speak of, to my knowledge.</p>

            . I live at the Red Lion in Poppin's-alley: the prisoner and prosecutor were at my house on Easter Monday; the prosecutor was quite drunk; M'Guire was pretty sober: about two hours after they were gone, Sherridon's wife came, and said her husband had left his watch and 7 s. 6 d. with me; I said, good woman I do not think your husband is worth a watch: he came in the afternoon; he asked me if I saw any thing of his watch; I said to him, I did not think he was worth one: his wife abused him at my house, and said he had been out all night: she struck him; this was while they were drinking three tankards of beer together in the morning.</p>

I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176505220010"/> taxed the prisoner with taking the shoes; he said he knew nothing of them. The gentleman and I searched him; and upon searching him, we found a pair of spatterdashes under his coat, our property. (Produced in court.) They were hanging on a buck's horn just before; we did not find the shoes: as he opened his coat the spatterdashes fell down: the prisoner said they fell from the hook as he opened his arms; but the gentleman stood between the hook or buck horn and the prisoner; we sent for a constable, and he was taken into custody.</p>

            . About a fortnight ago, I was coming up Snow Hill; I saw some spatterdashes that I thought of a neat fashion; having an occasion for a pair, I went in and bespoke a pair: it was at the prosecutor's shop: they not being brought home on the Saturday, I went at night for them. When I came into the shop, there was this woman: I tried a pair, but could not get them on without assistance; the prisoner coming in for a pair of pumps, I was unwilling to hinder the business of the shop, and waited some time with one spatterdash half on and half off; the woman thinking the prisoner a trifling customer, as none would please him. she came to assist me again in trying the spatterdash on; but a woman being unhandy, I desired the prisoner to assist me; he did, but we could not get them on. Seeing they would not do, I was going away: the woman being very willing to do her husband's business, said she would have another trial: then her back was towards the prisoner, who stood half within, and half out of the shop. At last, when I found the spatterdashes hurt me, I gave it up, and desired her to tell her husband to wait on me, to make another pair: I think the prisoner had his answer before this: The gentlewoman looked in the window, and missed a pair of shoes: she said to the lad, Leave the pair of shoes you have got. She turned to me, and said, Sir, the boy has stole a pair of shoes. I went up to him, and said, Friend, I believe you are a thief; you shall not go: he threw both of his arms out in a very odd sort of a way; and as he opened his coat, I saw the part of the spatterdash that turns down, of a tan-colour, fall from under his coat: I took the spatterdashes up, and delivered them to the gentlewoman. I not knowing but he might have accomplices, I call'd in two gentlemen that were going by; in the mean time the husband came home; he sent for a constable, and the prisoner was taken to the watch-house; it being in my way home, I went along with them: I said to the constable, it is necessary to search him, to see if he has money enough upon him to pay for a pair of pumps. He was searched, and there were only two six-pences, and a piece of tin bent, so as to appear like a six-pence, found upon him. (The spatterdashes produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was a little in liquor; I went to my mother, and desired she would let me have a pair of pumps; she said she would not. I said I would have a pair; she said, then, if you will, go and chuse a pair, and come again after you have tried them on, and I'll give you the money. I went to the shop of the prosecutrix on Snow Hill; she shewed me a pair; I said they would not do; the gentleman desired me to help him on with the spatterdashes; the prosecutrix said, if I would stay till they had done, she would shew me more: then she said she missed a pair of shoes: the gentleman said, it is proper to search him: I threw my arms out, and hit the spatterdashes as they hung up, and they fell down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Houscombe and the prosecutrix being both asked again, declared they saw the spatterdashes under the prisoner's coat, and saw them fall from thence; and that Mr. Houscombe stood between the prisoner and the place where they had hung, at the time.</p>

I was to carry them half a guinea for them; she said she would give but eight shillings; I delivered the spoons and stockings back again, and did not see them after: I went up stairs to my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see these boys there at any other time?</p>
               <p>S. Williams. I remember seeing them there twice.</p>

            . Mr. Gilham sent me with a warrant to the prisoner's house about six weeks ago; the boy went along with me; I sat down in a chair, and told the old woman I had a warrant to search her house, and asked her about these spoons: at first she said the knew nothing at all about any such things, and did not understand our meaning in coming to her house. The constable went to searching her first; then she pulled out these five spoons from her pocket, and delivered them. (Produced in court.) I asked the boy if there were not six of them; the boy said yes: I asked her about the other spoon, she said she did not know where it was.</p>

            . I went with the last evidence; we told the old woman we came to search for six silver tea-spoons that Regan and two others had sold her: I desired her to let us look in her pocket; then she took these five out herself: I asked the boy if they were the spoons he sold her; he said they were: I looked on the backs of them, and saw the marks had been filed out: I asked her how she came to file the letters out; she said. she had had them five or six years: there was a watch and a silk cardinal found in her house, according to the boy's information; which the boy swore to.</p>
               <p>Regan. There were the letters T. M. E. upon the spoons; ( the spoons inspected by the court and jury); there appeared to be the letter T. not quite filed out, upon one of them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to two of the spoons, that with the letter on it. and another by a dent in the edge of the bowl of it, which I had observed before.</p>

               <p>There were spoons brought in by that girl; she said a young man sent them: I would not buy them: after that, on Good Friday, this boy came to me, he asked me if I would buy a little time thing; I said, I would not; he said, he would sell it me cheap: after he found I would not buy it, he said, if I would be so good to let him leave it in my house, he would come and call for it: six days after he came with five officers, and told them where I had put it over the chimney; and said, there is the thing: then he mentioned the spoons: I said, Gentlemen, I know nothing of the spoons; I had only five, which belonged to me; I took these out; then they said, these were the spoons they came for: I bought them three years ago, for old silver.</p>

I found two odd stockings in Field lane, at one Mrs. Norfolk's, and about a yard and half of lawn: I found 23 linen handkerchiefs in two parcels, in a place called Brown's Gardens, by Monmouth-street; (produced in court.) I can swear to the handkerchiefs to be my property. There were also a pair of stockings found at the house of Wilder, the prisoner.</p>

            , I, and Magennes stole these things.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Gammon?</p>
               <p>Parker. I have known him about eleven months: I am a gentleman's servant out of place: I lived at Mr. Penyman's, a sadler in Holbourn, as an errand boy; and after that I lived in Leicester-fields. I was born in Berkshire: I got acquainted with Gammon in St. Sepulchre's church-yard; he is about 16 years of age, and I 18: Magennes, he and I were playing at skittles at the King's arms in St. Giles's; that night, when it came to be dusk, we all came together, to see what we could get, down Holbourn, and up Gray's-inn-lane; we saw the prosecutor's door was open, and nobody in the shop; Magennes and I went in; Gammon stood and received the things of us at the door: I went in twice, and Magennes once: we went and put them behind a parcel of tember in a lane just by; then we went back, and I went in; and Magennes took the things of me at the door; we went and carried them to the rest: then we sent Gammon by the door to see if any body was near it; we went another way; and he was to meet us at the corner of a street; but Gammon went back to the timber again; Magennes and I were going by the door; I was going in again, and we saw a light through the door; Magennes said, do not go in any more, for the pitcher never goes to the well so often, but it comes home broke at last; so he would not let me go in: then we went to the goods, where we found Gammon watching them; we took each a bundle, and carried them to Holmes's house; she lodged up two pair of stairs, in Field-lane; there we opened the goods; there was about seven yards of printed cotton, a piece of Russia cloth, about three yards and a half; about five dozen and a half of lawn handkerchiefs, and about four dozen and a half of linen ones, about 50 pair of stockings or upwards, and some childrens stockings; I believe in all there were 60 pair; six pieces of plain lawn, three pair of leather gloves, three other pair, and three caps; there were two or three pieces of figured gauzes, about ten or a dozen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mrs. Holmes?</p>
               <p>Parker. I have known her about two months; she buys old cloaths, and sells them again at Monmouth-street and Rag-fair: it might want about a quarter of 10 o'clock when we got there: she bought the seven yards of cotton for a gown, and two small children's pocket handkerchiefs, for 11 s. and two pair of stockings for her maid for 2 s. one black ribb'd, four thread, and the other crimson coloured: we left all the things with her that night; she asked us where we got them, because she wanted to know where to go to sell them; we told her we got them in Gray's-inn-lane: I was recommended to her by others that had employed her to sell such things; we were to have gone to her in the morning, to sell her more things, as she chose to buy them at different times, and bring the money as she sold them: Magennes and I lodged that night at Mrs. Wilder's, in Black Boy-alley: Gammon lived in St. Giles's: we went home directly; Mrs. Wilder was suspicious that we had got some things: Mrs. Holmes came and told Mrs. Wilder there were constables about near her lodging and she was afraid they would searched her room; she brought the things in her lap, all but what she had bought; this was about seven the next morning; she said, the constables had said there were nothing but a parcel of thieves lived there: I and Magennes took the things of her; Mrs. Wilder said, there will be a search about here: she took the things and put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176505220015"/> them into a wheel barrow, and wheeled it out upon the dunghill, and put two other barrows by them, and covered them up; and said they would not think to search there: we then sold Holmes a few stockings for half a guinea; and a parcel of lawn handkerchiefs for another half guinea; which she took away with her; we trusted to her honour: in about two hours and a half after she came again, we wheeled the barrow into the room and took the lawn out, and let her have six small pieces and some gauze for half a guinea; she had all the lawn but one piece of about seven yards, which Mrs. Norfolk had: after she brought the money, she had some more lawn handkerchiefs for half a guinea; then she had a piece of 16 handkerchiefs, for which she gave us 8 s. Mrs. Wilder saw her buy all these. On the Thursday morning we disposed of all the things, except the two parcels of handkerchiefs that are produced here: Mrs. Holmes met us at the King's arms St. Giles, and paid us the last of the money, about three in the afternoon: we asked if the things would be safe if we should be taken up; she said, yes; for she sold them to a schoolmaster, and we should be very safe; for they were washed, ironed, and hemmed, before she parted with them: Mrs. Wilder would not let us stay at her apartment any longer, because we would not give her some gauze to make her caps; she said, if we did not take the things away she would throw them out at the door: I carried them under my arm to Mrs. Norfolk's, and asked her to let us leave them there till night; which she did: when we came she was not at home; her husband gave them us: we carried them to St. Giles's, to Gammon's: Gammon took them to the King's arms, and called a young woman out and desired her to carry them home: she told us after, she went and opened her bed and sowed them up in it. That night we all three went to the White Swan, at Black Friars, and lay there: we lay at the young woman's lodging on the Thursday night; and on the Friday we went to the Fox and Hounds, in Tottenham-court road, and sent for the young woman; we had three pints of half-and-half; the young woman went to see for Mrs. Holmes, to come to buy the handkerchiefs; she did not come. Then Ablet came, and said Sir

I applied to Justice Pell for a search warrant: the constable went and took possession of the two barrels: the following week, Whitham, who was in the Borough gaol, made a voluntary confession, before a justice in the Borough, of many robberies by him committed, and this among the rest: I took up Lewis at market; he acknowledged he bought them, and did not seem to desire favour: he said, Whitham brought them on board when he was in custody; I asked him what was become of the other pitch and tar that Whitham had brought at different times? he said, he had landed two barrels of pitch at Ipswich, at one Mr. Dimock's, a ship builder's yard: I went to Ipswich and there saw the two barrels, marked with the same mark: I believe Mr. Lewis would have made a very voluntary confession, if we would have admitted him: he said he always received them in the night.</p>

I said, the sloop on the inside where you came from; he said, nothing: I went on board the sloop; there were two or three sailors on board; it was Mr. Lewis's sloop; I saw the pitch and tar, and said what makes you receive this of Whitham; he has certainly stole it, for he is a bad sort of a man: they said, what is that to us, our master gives us orders to do it: one of them said the captain was in the cabin; upon which I went to the cabin door, and said, Mr. Lewis turn out, I want to speak with you; he said, I am not well; I said, what makes you receive that pitch and tar from Whitham, it is stolen; depend upon it you will be transported: said he, I know nothing of it; I did not see him; but I apprehend it to be his voice, having heard him speak since. I went about my duty; and Mr. Speck being a neighbour, I told him of it in the morning.</p>

I believe Mr. Speck came on board about 10 or 11 o'clock; he asked who brought them on board; I said it was Whitham; he said they belonged to him; but Mr. Lewis was not then on board: when he came on board in the evening, I told him there had been a gentleman there that had ordered me to take care of the barrels: there were two barrels of pitch carried down to Ipswich, the last voyage; Whitham brought them on board: they were put into the yard of

The course of our business is thus: I never take any money myself; but the drawers receive the money of the company, and deliver it to the book-keeper: I keep a regular account of all: the book-keeper gives security; for I used to trust the book-keeper two or 300 l. at a time: I had no security from the prisoner; therefore I gave him injunctions to pay the money every night, to a servant that I can put confidence in.</p>

The money I left with him was the balance of money on the former account; I settled before I went out; and this was the balance due to me: I told it over, and pushed it to him to take for change in the course of the business; he acknowledged there was so much due to me on the former account: there was the daily account under his own hand-writing: he had balanced the account, and had taken 21 l. that day: I went away when I delivered the 13 l. 14 s. he set it down in the book: I told him he was to deliver what money he took every night to the cellar-man; he said, he would; and I gave the cellar-man directions to deliver money to him every morning, as I had done, for change.</p>

In the year 1757, an information was filed against him and many others in the Duchy court of Lancaster, in the name of the Attorney General of that Duchy, on his Majesty's behalf, for erecting buildings, and inclosing great quantities of land, belonging to his Majesty, without any authority or right whatsoever, upon Enfield Chase, which is parcel of the Duchy of Lancaster, and the inheritance of the crown. The cause came on to be heard before the Chancellor of the Duchy, and Lord Mansfield and

            , as Judges assistant of that court, on the 3d of March 1764, and the decree was afterwards exemplified under the seal of the court. The defendants were ordered and decreed forthwith to deliver up to me, as his Majesty's Surveyor, possession of the buildings and lands claimed by them, for his Majesty's use, which the court, by the decree, declared to be incroachments upon Enfield Chase, and made in derogation and infringement of his Majesty's right and title. (The exemplification of the decree produced.) The prisoner had time given him to shew cause against this decree; for which purpose this subpoena, (a subpoena produced) under the seal of the court, was served on him, as will appear in evidence, on the 21st of April; but on his not shewing cause , the decree was made absolute against him, by an order of the court made the 16th of May 1764, and that order, together with the decree, were exemplified on the 23d of that month. Upon the prisoner's being served with a copy of this exemplification, and his refusal to obey the decree, on the fourth of July the court made an order that an attachment should issued against him unless he delivered up possession of the premisses mentioned in the decree, by a certain day, which he still refusing to do, an attachment issued against him on th 7th of August, for a contempt of the court. Upon the return of that writ by the Sheriff, that the prisoner could not be found, the court ordered an injunction to issue against him, which bore date the 21st of November 1764. The prisoner was by that writ commanded and enjoined to quit possession, immediately, of the premisses, upon pain of five thousand pounds, and to permit me to enter, and to hold the same for his Majesty's use, without any interruption or molestation. (The injunction produced.) This injunction was served on the prisoner, as will appear, on the 26th of November, and upon his refusing to obey it, on the 28th of November the court ordered a writ of assistance to issue, which bore date that day, directed to the Sheriff of Middlesex, and the Sheriff's warrant upon that writ to his officers is dated the 20th of December. (Both produced.) The Sheriff is by the writ of assistance commanded to put me in quiet possession of the premisses therein mentioned for his Majesty's use, and to attach the body of the prisoner for his disobedience to the decree, and contempt of the court. Previous to the filing of the information against the Prisoner and the other defendants, who were eleven in number, I had directions to let them know, they were at liberty to take down their buildings upon the King's Chase, and sell the materials for their own use. The prisoner told me he would never quit the house he lived in as long as he lived; that he would be carried dead out of it, and set the court at defiance. He afterwards put in his answer to the information, but examined no witnesses. Several of the defendants agreed to throw open their incroachments, others agreed to abide by the event of the suit, so that witnesses were examined on the part of the crown, and the cause heard against the prisoner and four other defendants only. The prisoner told me he would give himself no more trouble about looking for witnesses; he swore he would be at no more expence in the cause, and would never quit possession. It was on the 19th of June 1764, I served him with the exemplification of the decree; I told him, I believed it was not then too late to throw himself on the mercy of the court, and that if he would apply, the court would probably give him leave to sell the materials of his house, and put the money in his pocket; he said, the court might as well pretend to pull the King's palace down; I must take care how I came there; it should be the worse for any body that came there for any such purpose; he always kept that in his house which would defend him; he would never give up the premisses to the crown, nor any one living; that he would knock any man's brains<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176505220025"/> out, that came to take his house from him, and used all manner of abusive language. I represented to him the consequences of his obstinacy, and told him the Sheriff of the county would be directed to take possession of the premises, and send him to prison for his contempt of the court. His answer was, that, The court and all their officers might be d - d: he wished he could see any body come into his house without his leave, to take any thing he had from him; that was the sport he wanted to be at.</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner did you serve him with this exemplification?</p>
               <p>A. I delivered a true copy of it into his own hand, at his house; told him the contents of it, and at the same time shewed him the exemplification under the seal of the court, and demanded the possession according to the decree, which he refused to give, with many oaths and imprecations. The other defendants in that decree have delivered up possession, and now hold of the crown at small yearly rents.</p>
               <p>After the attachment issued against the prisoner, several attempts were made to apprehend him, but to no purpose: when the writ of assistance issued, other officers were added, belonging to the Sheriff of Middlesex, viz.

             mentioned in the indictment was one of them. They were to give me possession of the premises claimed by the prisoner, and mentioned in the decree and the Sheriff's warrant, for the use of his Majesty. I took my servant with me. We got to the prisoner's house about six in the morning: I went to the back-door, whilst the officers went to the fore-door. Within a very few minutes, I heard a gun go off. I then rode round to the fore-door, got off my horse, and went into the house: the officers had brought the prisoner down stairs into the kitchen; as soon as he saw me he said, G - d d - n your blood, this is your doing. He was then putting on his clothes, and put himself in a great passion, and swore incessantly. The officers gave me a gun, which they said he had shot off at them. The prisoner said, D - n you, what business had you in my house? (or my room). I perceived it was a rifle-barrel'd gun, that would carry a bullet only, and not shot. I was then desired to go up stairs to examine the room where the gun had been shot off. The room was on the right hand of the stair-case; I found the key in the door, which easily turned the lock: it was a spring lock: there was no latch, nor handle to the lock. I examined the door, and found there was nothing broke, nor any appearance of force used. The room was in a sinother from the gun powder, and I think the window was shut. I went towards the bed, which is opposite to the dco, and found the gun had been shot off from the bed; the ball had gone through a wooden mantle piece over the chimney, on the right-hand side of the room from the bed, had broke a glass all to-pieces, which appeared to have hung above the mantle-piece, then graz'd the wall on that side, and had struck against another wall facing the bed, which was a plaister wall, at some distance from the door, and on the same side of the room. I found one bullet on the mantle-piece, but that was not the bullet shot out of the gun, for it had not received any difference in shape Afterwards I sent my servant,

            , to search in the room for the bullet, which he will produce. When I returned down stairs, one of the officers asked the prisoner how he could be guilty of a thing of this nature; he answered, It was good enough for him. I told him I believed it was a capital offence; he made the same kind of answer, swore as many oaths as he could utter, and was extremely violent and turbulent. I observed to him, this rifle-barrel'd gun was only for killing deer, and asked him what he did with it; he said he had got his living by it these twenty years. He was afterwards carried to London by the officers.</p>

             are two persons mentioned in that writ: We had six assistants; we went to the prisoner's house on Enfield Chase; we got there a little before six in the morning, on the 13th of this instant: we had given directions to our men, and divided them, that they might not go all in together: the house was open. One of our assistants went in with a strange man; they were to go and call for a pint of beer as two strangers going by, and as soon as they were got in they call'd for a pint of beer; the prisoner's wife went down to draw it; they gave a signal, and Pawlet and Thomas went in: I followed them as fast as I could: I was on horse-back: when I got in they were up stairs or going up: I saw them going up while I was getting off my horse: I was up stairs, I believe, within two seconds after the gun was fired: I found Thomas and Pawlet in the room: Thomas had hold of the muzzle of the gun, and the prisoner had hold of the but-end, sitting on the bed, and they had hold of him: they had shov'd him back; he was rather lying, and in his shirt; they were struggling for the gun; I could hardly distinguish any thing for the smoke; it was a little room; I ran and opened the window: we led him down stairs: this is the gun here produced. He d - d us, and used us with a great deal of ill language, and wished he had killed two or three of us, after he was come down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons did you find in the room?</p>
               <p>Norden. There were only Thomas, Pawlet, and the prisoner; by this time Mr. Nuthall came in; the prisoner grin'd at him, and d - d him, and said he wished he had killed him; he said if he had killed him he would not have minded being hang'd directly. Mr. Smith came to London with him. After they were gone, Mr. Nuthall's man and I went up into the bed-chamber, and examined which way the ball went. I saw the dent in the wall; we saw the ball lying on the floor; he stooped down and took it up; it had gone thro' the chimney-piece, and graz'd the wall, and went back to another wall, where it lay. I put it to the place in the wall, it fitted the place exactly: I said I was sure that ball made the mark: the key of the door was on the out-side when it was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear any violence used on the door?</p>
               <p>Norden. No, there did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How large was the room?</p>
               <p>Norden. It is but a small room; it will hold a bed, a small table, and half a dozen chairs. The door opens directly facing the foot of the bed: the mantle-piece was to the left hand at going in: the ball struck last on that part of the wall behind the door, about two feet from the edge of the door: It is a square room, about 12 feet by 14 or 16; the door opens to the left hand.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the door is the feet of the bed?</p>
               <p>Norden. I suppose the door does not open above three feet from it; the room will not hold a table on each side of the bed; I believe there was a table in the room, but I did not take particular<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176505220027"/> notice: there was a chair in the room, for I sat down in one.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the bed did the prisoner sit upon?</p>
               <p>Norden. He was sitting on the left hand side of the bed when I went into the room, that side next the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the Sheriff's writ when the gun went off?</p>
               <p>Norden. I had that in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that time had you told the prisoner who you was?</p>
               <p>Norden. There had not been time for it, but I told him before those expressions came out from him, who I was, and what was my errand. I told him this was what I expected; for the country all round had told me what I might expect.</p>
               <p>Court. Look upon this name upon this warrant. (He takes it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Q. When was your name put to it?</p>
               <p>Norden. My name was not put to it when I first saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the seal to it when you first saw it?</p>
               <p>Norden. It was; my name was put to it after the seal was to it; that is what is done every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Smith when you went into the house?</p>
               <p>Norden. He was along with me, he followed me in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Smith's name to it when you first saw it.</p>
               <p>Norden. No, it was not; that was put in by order of the Sheriff; Mr. Grigg said he had recommended me to Mr. Nuthall, and I was present when my name was put in by one of our clerks at the office; and

            . I was with them on the 13th of May, at the prisoner's house on Enfield Chase, at six in the morning; we went to execute a warrant upon him. I went into the house as soon as the door was open, and another man followed me: I do not know his name; he belonged to Mr. Smith, and I belonged to Mr. Norden: when I came into the house I did not see any thing of the prisoner; I went up stairs, there was the key in the door, I turned that; there I saw the prisoner sitting on the side of the bed: the door opened without any noise at all; the other man was at my back: the prisoner presented this gun, and made a level at me the moment I came in at the door: he had nothing but his shirt on: I took hold of the muzzle and turned it off with my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to him when you opened the door?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I believe I was about three yards from the muzzle of the piece, or hardly so much: he never said a word till after the piece went off; I put my right hand to it, and laid hold of him; he said, if I did not loose him, he would kill some of us: I secured him as well as I could, and Mr. Norden was just at my heels: in the struggle the prisoner received some blow; the room was in a smother on firing the piece: the piece went off immediately as soon as I touched it.</p>
               <p>Q. What instrument had you in your hand?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I had nothing in my hand but a cane.</p>
               <p>Q. What had the person that was with you?</p>
               <p>Thomas. He had an iron crow, in order, if the door had not been opened, to open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Thomas. There were nobody there but the prisoner and us two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner's daughter?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I saw her by the side of the bed, in a room on the left hand, in her shift; the prisoner swore he would murder some of us: he swore below stairs a great many oaths he should have been pleased if he had but killed some of us; then he had not minded if he was hanged up directly.</p>

            ; I followed him as quick as possible; we first went into the kitchen or tap-room; then we went up stairs; he turned the key, and put his knee against the door, and threw it open on the right hand. We used no force as I know of, only turning the key that was in the door: when we were in I perceived the prisoner with one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176505220028"/> leg entirely out of bed, and the other almost out. I saw him level the gun at us. Thomas was so near him, he shoved it on one side, and it went off: the ball went through the mantle-piece, and broke a glass all to pieces; it went into the brickwork, and rebounded, and struck against the other side of the room, where it was picked up: I conceive it went off under Thomas's arm, and close to my head. Thomas said he had a warrant against him; we seized him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that before, or after the gun went off.</p>
               <p>Pawlet. To the best of my recollection it was before it went off; but it was so soon I cannot be positive; the gun went off as quick at our opening the door as I could go three or four steps. Thomas closed upon him, and bid him deliver the gun. He answered,</p>
               <p>"God d - n you, I</p>
               <p>"will not." After he came down into the kitchen, he said,</p>

               <p>"that scoundrel, I should not care if I was</p>
               <p>"hang'd." Going along he used many words to the same effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he assign any reason why he shot at you?</p>
               <p>Pawlet. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room when you first went in?</p>

I went to the prisoner's house on the 13th of May, with others, to take him, by order of the Sheriff; Thomas and Pawlet had been in the house before me; I was on horseback, and hearing the explosion of a gun, I quitted the horse, and ran up stairs: there I saw the prisoner on his bed, on his back, struggling with Thomas. Thomas was endeavouring to wrest the gun out of his hand; the prisoner would not part with it: Pawlet said, Mr. Smith, lo ok under the bed, and see that there is no more fire arms; I did; then we endeavoured to bring him down stairs; after which he was asked how he came to do so rash an action; he swore, and said, he was very sorry he did not kill three or four of us; then he did not care if he was hanged directly. As I was on the landing-place I saw the prisoner's daughter in a room on the left hand side, tying her petticoat on: It was opposite to where her father was; I think she was in her shift. I went into the room where her father was, and presently she came into that room to us. I came away with the prisoner that morning to London, and two other men. Most of the conversation was this, that he was very sorry he had not killed some of us; he was sorry he did not kill Mr. Nuthall: he said he had had the gun by his bedside for that purpose six months; for he knew of our coming.

            . Last Monday I went to the house upon Enfield Chase, where the prisoner lived: I thought, by the marks I saw on the room-door, that it was burst open: there were two marks above the lock seemed to have been done by a crow; they were about the same breadth from each other: I looked upon the mantle-piece, and observed the ball went through it, and went up slanting, not quite perpendicular: I think the gun must be rather grounded, by it's going up aslant.</p>

               <p>Brough. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell which way the gun went off?</p>
               <p>Brough. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see if it had broke the cieling?</p>
               <p>Brough. No, I think it could not reach the cieling, being not quite upright. I have known the prisoner about three years; he bears the character of a very honest man, as far as I know; he dealt with me for beer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Nuthall speak such words as the boy has mentioned.</p>
               <p>Norden. No, I never did; nor I don't believe he did say any such thing: I was near him; I don't believe we were five yards asunder all the time, till the prisoner was sent away.</p>

               <p>Norden. It was done thus; Pawlet held the crow in his hand, and the prisoner struggling ran his head against it; as soon as I saw the blood I challenged Pawlet with striking the prisoner: he said he did not, but the prisoner ran his head against it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pawlet. Did you see the boy in the bed chamber?</p>
               <p>Pawlet. No: the first time I saw him was in the kitchen.</p>

             had hold of the gun: the prisoner flung his head up, as the crow was in my hand, and the top of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176505220030"/> claws went against his forehead; had I struck him with it, it must have smash'd his head to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Nuthall say such words as the boy has mentioned?</p>
               <p>Pawlet. No, I did not: I heard Mr. Nuthall say, You are an obstinate old man; see what you have brought yourself to: I believe you will be hanged: I don't believe Mr. Nuthall made use of any thing tending to what the boy has mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith. Did you hear Mr. Nuthall make use of such an expression as the boy has mentioned?</p>
               <p>Smith. I was present with Mr. Nuthall from the time the prisoner was brought down, till his being put into the cart: I never heard Mr. Nuthall make use of such an expression: he told the prisoner he was an obstinate old man, and he was afraid he would be hanged for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Nuthall. Did you not mention a tree near the prisoner's house; and say, You should have the hanging him up on one of these trees.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nuthall. No, I never did; no such thing ever pass'd: I am sure I could not say any such thing: I told him he would probably be hanged for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make mention of a string on that occasion?</p>
               <p>Mr. Nuthall. No: on his being put in the cart he was extremely violent; he seemed as if he intended to do me a mischief, as he always did: he was tied with a string, and his hands were fastened when he was in the cart.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderman Tregothick. Last Monday was a week this thing happened, and on the Monday following I took a walk to the prisoner's house; there I saw a wretched old woman, and her daughter equally wretched, and that boy: I went up into the room and examined it; I observed the room was about fourteen feet from the door to the bed's head, and, I think, about twelve feet from the window to the chimney; the bed was taken down, by the mark on the wall it was about four feet from that side the room: the ball had entered the mantle-piece; it was a bit of deal, with a kind of a cornice under it: the ball went upwards about four inches, and beat off a large piece of plaister: I did not trace it any farther. I observed the bolt of the lock was not affected at all; the outside of the door had a mark upon it, two inches and five eighths from each other; they appeared to have been made by an instrument of that kind as mentioned: from the situation of the hole made in the mantle-piece I should imagine, if fired from the bed, it must have been about two feet from the ground. My idea of the matter was, there was some struggling (having heard the prisoner was a good marksman) to have directed the ball in that manner.</p>

I sent word down, after he was dead, and I had an order not to part with the money till farther orders; since that time there is a trial depending in the Commons. I had counted the money, and put it into a bureau in my parlour, under a great weight of cloaths, and told nobody where it was, not even my own child: on the 5th of May instant I took it out and counted it, and found there were eleven pieces looked to be very bad gold: I desired a gentleman that was in my house to count them; there were then but fifty-three guineas and eleven medals: the prisoner was my <rs id="t17650522-25-deflabel161" type="occupation">servant</rs>

She said she had taken it, and begged for mercy. I said, why did you put the medals in? She said she put them in to deceive me, that I might think they were guineas, but she intended to put the money there again; she gave me a guinea of it back, and said, if I would give her three weeks grace she would pay me all the money.

I desired her to put the money in the same manner as before, and let it lie till I came the next evening; she followed my advice: when I came the next evening, she desired me to count it again: I did, and found the medals had increased from eleven to fourteen, and there were no more than fifty-one guineas five shillings: then Mrs. Lamb said to the prisoner, Molly, I think you are a very bad girl, to use me so: she was asked when she took the first money out of the purse: she answered she took it out that very day Mrs. Lamb's son-in-law came there and mended a box: she was asked what she had done with the two guineas she had taken out between the Sunday evening and the Monday evening; she did not say what she had done with it, but returned one guinea, and begged for mercy, and said, if her mistress would let her alone for about three weeks, she would endeavour to get her the money again; then she seeing her mistress very angry with her, said, if she would let Mr. Burford, the son-in-law, go with her to the Globe in the Strand, she would raise her two guineas and a half: she said she had taken some of her mistress's linnen, and she made use of some of this money to fetch them out of pawn.</p>

The prisoner was out, and staid out all night; the next day I saw the money counted, and there were but fifty-one guineas, fourteen medals, and five shillings: when the prisoner came home. and was charged with this, she confessed she had taken them, and returned one guinea, and said, if we would let her go to the Globe in the Strand, she would get a guinea and a half more, and if we would allow her time she would get it all again; she said she had pawned things unknown to us, and she took the money to get them back again, and that she took the first money on Easter Monday: we lost many things while she was there; here are two aprons which we had from the pawnbroker, which she owned she pawned, (produced and deposed to.)</p>

I went again on Sunday, the 6th of May, by desire of the attorney who carries on the suit, to Mrs. Lamb, in order to take down what the prisoner could say as to the capacity of the deceased, the day the pretended will was executed. I thought proper to get sight of a lottery ticket, which belonged to the deceased, to see whether it was a blank or prize: Mrs Lamb went to look for the ticket, and she found it not in the same place: then she looked at the money, and the discovery happened.</p>

I hardly ever go to bed without burning a lamp in my chimney corner: I came down stairs, and perceived all my goods moved from the shelves, and one of my window shutters down: I let the watch-man in: I found the bolt of the hatch over the door was broke: my son made all fast over night: the shutter was taken down: the shop was open to the street: there was no glass: I went and put my cloaths on; after that either my son or apprentice called out, here are the hats, under the bulk before the door; they brought them in; I examined them and missed six of them: three of them were not lined; there was my brand-mark in them: the mark is R. R. I thought they would carry them to be lined, by which means I thought I might hear of them; I told it about in the trade, and desired the person to be stopped that brought them: on the Saturday morning I had a person came and desired me to go with him to Mr. Snoak's, in Little Turnstile, Holbourn: I went. Mr. Snoak told me he had finished one, and they had had it away; and would come for the other in the afternoon: he said he would tell them when they came it was mislaid, and we cannot find it; and do you plant yourself in the public house over the way, and I'll let you know: he went and shut his shop up, thinking then they would come; they soon came; then he came over to me, and told me to come: I went over with him, there I found the prisoner Carroll, and Bourn the evidence, and two other persons that were customers; Mr. Snoak said to me, there is one, and there is the other, pointing to them; then I put my hand on the evidences collar, and said, where are my hats; he pleaded heartily that he might not be hanged: then I said to the prisoner, if you do not let me know, I'll hang you too, and laid hold of him: somebody sent for a constable: Bourn said, he bought them of an old cloaths man: I think Carroll said, you lie, it was of a Jew: the constable seemed to know them both; he took them to the Round-house; then they were taken before Sir

               <p>Mr. Snoak. I live in Little Turnstile, Holbourn: on the 30th of April, about seven in the evening, the prisoner and Bourn came to my shop: I had sold Bourn hats before, at a wholesale price; he told me he had them raffled for, and said he was a hat maker: he said, I want you to line two hats and cock them up: I looked at them, and said, where did you get them? he said, he got them of a friend: he ordered a silk lining in one, and a linen lining in the other; to be done by next day at noon: the next day they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176505220033"/> both came again, and only the linen one was done; Bourn paid me, and took that away: on the other I observed the mark R. R. then I began to think they did not come honestly by them: I ordered my wife to put it out of sight, till I enquired at the dyers: on Saturday I saw a journeyman dyer: upon asking him, he said Mr. Robinson on Snow-hill marked with R. R. and he had lately been robbed: I desired him to go and tell him I had such a hat: Mr. Robinson came to me and said, he would swear this was one that he had lost: I said the men would be here to-night, and desired him to wait at the alehouse opposite me till they came; they came, and we secured them: he took hold of Carroll, and said, you dog, you will be hanged: Bourn began to cry, and said, Lord have mercy on his soul if he is. He asked them how they came by the hats? Bourn said, he bought them of an old cloaths man: Carroll said, no, it was a Jew you told me. He said he knew nothing about it: then Carroll said, Bourn knows nothing about it; pray let him go. On the Monday we took them before Sir

               <p>Robinson. I forgot to give an account of our apprehending the woman; I can only say the same as Mr. Snoak has.</p>
               <p>Blanch Bourn. I am a Carpenter, and live in St. Giles's; I have come from Ireland very near two years: I knew Carroll in Ireland; he plays on the violin for his living: on a Sunday night, about three weeks ago, as he and I came down Holbourn, with intent to rob, we came to Mr. Robinson's shop at about 12 at night; we had been drinking together at the George Inn, in Broad St. Giles's; he fell to working at Mr. Robinson's door; he went to feel whether the pins were in, and fast or not; he bid me to watch; I did; and can't tell how he got the shutters down then he called me to him, and persuaded me to go in; in going in he lifted my foot over an iron that was there; there was a plank on the inside that they used to make hats upon; I handed the bundles of hats over the plank to him; he stood out at the window, and he put them under the bulk at the door; from whence we intended to take them away; but he told me the watch was coming; and I made the best of my way out at the window, and he made off with eight hats: we made towards St. Giles's, to his lodgings, and he gave the hats to the woman at the bar; she was his bed-fellow: she put them into a box: the next day he said, he would buy linings and loops, and do them up himself: I said, I would carry them to an acquaintance of mine, Mr. Snoak; we took them to him on the Tuesday night, by which means we were both taken.</p>
               <p>Carroll's Defence.</p>
               <p>This man has perjured himself: I know no more of the hats being taken than the child unborn: I happened to be at the George Inn, Broad St.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176505220034"/> Giles's; he asked me to be a pint along with him, he sat down, and told me he had about half a dozen new hats, and if I wanted one he would deal reasonably; and that they were at his lodging, and if I would be there at four or five in the afternoon, he would shew me some: I went at that time; he was there, with the two hats in his apron; he took me backwards and showed me them; and said, if I pitched upon one, he would have it finished; and if I would go with him to a hat-maker in Little Turnstile, Holbourn, I might make the agreement; but he would not let me have one under half a guinea: we came to the end of Drury-lane; there was one Deacon, a brewer's servant, he asked him do you want a hat? they agreed for one; and he was to bring it to such an alehouse: he desired me to be there with my fiddle, saying, it might be something in my way: we went; Deacon was there; he took half a guinea for it; and asked Deacon to get him a customer for another: the Saturday following he came to the George Inn, in Broad St. Giles's, and said he was going for my hat; I went with him; he asked if the hat was done; Mr. Snoak said, it would be done in a quarter of an hour: while we were there Mr. Robinson came in, and we were taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Mr. Breadey. The prisoner was at my house last Saturday night; the first time I ever saw him; he had two bags with money tossing them about the table; there was another man with him; my wife thought the man might be a sharper; she asked him to leave his money till he was sober: he came to me and said, he worked very hard for it, and he intended to go home in a fortnight or three weeks: he put it on the table and reckoned it up; 35 l. 6 s. I observed a bad moidore; afterwards the money was sealed up: upon opening it I found a broad Jacobus; I did not see that; I imagine that was left in the bag, when we counted the money.</p>

               <p>Kelley. About four or five months; we went out together with intent to rob. He bid me go in and take it; I said, I have no apron, and you have; you may go in and put it under your apron, and bring it; he went in and brought it out. Then we went into an empty house, and took the lace off, and went to Monmouth-street and sold a petticoat; then he gave me a shilling and the hat for my share; I got it dressed.

I went into the housekeeper's room to carry up some butter'd roll; I came down and catched the boy Kelley in the Pantry; he hearing me coming, was for getting out, and would have made me believe he was just come in at the door: He said, Sir, do you know one

Before he was got out of the area I stept into the pantry, and miss'd two silver cups, which the young ladies used to drink out of: there was my Lord's crest upon them, a horse's leg and horse-shoe. I ran after the boy, and called him back, and said, Here are other servants, that have been in the house longer than I, perhaps they can direct you: he came back and said he was oblig'd to me. He staid by the area gate: I went and searched for the cups: they were not in the pantry; then I went into the hall and asked the servants if they knew any thing of the young Ladies cups; the boy hearing me, set off directly; I went and opened the door thinking I could easily catch him; but I could see nothing of him: he told me since he was taken he dropt down behind a post, and I ran by him.
