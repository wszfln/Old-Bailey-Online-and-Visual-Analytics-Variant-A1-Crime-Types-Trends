             sworn.</p>
               <p>When I am in town, I live in chambers, there is but one stair-case to the chambers, and they do not communicate, there are two keys, a separate key of each room, there are no duplicate keys of either room; the prisoner had been in my service occasionally for six weeks at Salisbury, not in my house, but at London, I took him to sleep in the chambers, he lived there a fortnight: on Monday the 21st of November, at six in the evening very nearly, I left my chambers, and left him in the chambers; I had at that time, put into my cupboard by the side of the chimney, in which I usually kept valuables, two pocket books, one including the other, and the inner pocket book including a Bank post-bill, value forty-eight pounds, which will be produced and sworn to, which I had received about a week before in a letter from my uncle in Wiltshire, who was the indorser; and there was another bank bill that is not in the indictment; I had taken out the pocket book that morning and examined the contents, I had not taken it from my person till I put it into the closet, I left the prisoner at six and told him I should return about eleven; I did not return till some time towards twelve, upon my return, I found the door of my own chamber fast, nor could I find the key; I found the door of the upper room fast, the outer chamber door, and after some search I found the key of that upper room (there was only one key to it, which was in the prisoner's custody) and I found that key thrown into a window of the staircase; I then proceeded into his room, and looked for his box where he kept his things.</p>
               <p>Was his door also fast till you found that key? - Yes, I found his box was removed, that gave me the first suspicion of a robbery, I sent the porter of the Inn to call up a smith to force open the door of my own apartment, that I might get in; he easily forced the outward door, it was only once locked, I then went into my room; I observed first that my cupboard door was forced, the lock was forced from the door so as to hold by only two of these screws; it had not been unlocked, but was intirely forced out, and so opened; I discovered that my pocket-books had been taken away from the shelf upon which I had left them; I examined my drawers, of which the prisoner usually kept the keys, and the drawers were opened, they were usually locked, and the key in them, and a considerable quantity of clothes and linen were gone, and on a small table near my fire-place, I found this iron chissel, and at the same time I found a hammer, which I believe belonged to my chambers; I found two or three papers of no consequence, but I knew they had been left in my pocketbooks that were in the cupboard; one was a card to see my Lord Bute's house, the other was a paper of no consequence, which I knew, which appeared to have been separated from the pocket-book, and it was in the outer pocket of the book; the next morning I made the earliest application to the public Office, and as I had a compleat description of my bank post bill, I went to the bank, and stopped the payment; and I went with some officers on Thursday the 24th, in search of the prisoner to Bath,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140004"/> and at about eight in the morning at the three Tons at Bath, I found the prisoner with two men sitting in a room there, he was dressed in my coat and waistcoat, one of the officers pulled off his neckcloth and shewed me which was mine, he had a shirt on which appeared to be mine, and Jealous found upon him a pocket-book which is not mine, but which did contain this pocketbook which is mine, and which I swear to, that did contain my notes; in my presence also were taken from the prisoner twenty-one guineas, and two shillings and sixpence, which were then acknowledged before the magistrate to be part of the cash for the notes; the remainder of the property will be proved.</p>
               <p>Court. I need hardly ask you, Sir, knowing your professional knowledge and caution; whether before he said that, you said anything to him? - I said nothing to him, and I take it for granted the officers are too much used to propriety in business, to do anything of that kind.</p>

               <p>Mr. Poore. It is the key of my chamber door, this coat and waistcoat were on his person when he was taken, they are my property, this coat I swear to.</p>

               <p>My Lord, according to the laws prescribed by my country, I have pleaded not guilty, to a crime of which I am certainly guilty; perhaps to the bench, and the surrounding audience, it might appear a subterfuge, was I to affirm, that at the commission of the crime I was totally deprived of my reason; about six days before that, I did come to that boy desiring him to open a lock, for I knew that there were valueables enclosed in a closet, which I opened afterwards; he could not open it then; afterwards Mr. Poore's key would not open it in the morning; he accordingly desired me to go and have the mistake rectified; I went, the boy came, or at least the <rs id="t17851214-1-deflabel4" type="occupation">servant</rs>

This morning I was surprised at my trial coming on, or I should have desired a gentleman to have attended to my character, which has to this moment been totally untainted, and has been always regarded, not only in a proper but an estimable light: at present I have nothing more to say.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 8, Holborn-court, Grays-Inn; on the 2d of this month, between eight and nine, I heard a double knock at the door, the girl came and asked me, if I should be at home to anybody, I told her not at that hour; she then went to the door and opened it, it was locked withinside, I then heard a man enquire if I was within, and in the space of a second or two, I heard the girl cry out, O Lord! I got from the chair where I was sitting by the fire, the door was close to me, and I saw the prisoner Leonard with a pistol at the girl's head, and I saw another man with him, but I cannot say it was the prisoner Wilson; for I did not observe him so much; the girl had a candle in her hand, I immediately thought of making my escape, there are two rooms, there was a bolt under the lock at each door, I bolted it, I then threw up the sash of the window, and got out into the Duchy Court, where my chambers look into, my chambers are on the ground floor, I then went into the Duchy office, and made an alarm from one of their windows which looks into Coney-court, and we called, porter, porter, a long time before we made anybody hear, upon their coming to us, I told them there were thieves in my chambers, and begged of them to come; I then went back to the window, and saw the candle on the table,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140007"/> and the door shut; in about a quarter of a minute I thought I heard the girl cry out, I sent somebody to put too my outward door on the outside, which had a staple and a hasp, and I understood afterwards, it was put too by a boy that was there, and I found the door made fast afterwards; in a few minutes afterwards Mr. Jones, the porter, and a lamp-lighter, went into the chambers at the window, and I went to the window and saw the prisoner Leonard come along very deliberately, he was in a scarlet coat, and had a pistol in one hand, he came up to the window, and said now for it, and held the pistol; he run into Gray's Inn-lane, in five minutes he was brought back again, Leonard got out and he run towards Grays Inn-lane, I saw the prisoner Leonard in my room, and I saw the property, it was my property part of it.</p>

               <p>Court. The only view you had of the prisoner Leonard, was by looking through a key hole, and when you saw him in the window? - I have no doubt of his being the man I apprehended, these are my shirts but they have no marks, they have been in the possession of the girl ever since; they were not carried out of my chambers, only taken out of one room into another; I value the two coats at twenty shillings, and my shirts, I value at three shillings, a piece, here are almost a new pair of black sattin breeches, I value them at seven shillings, I believe I put in the waistcoat at two shillings in the indictment; I suppose upon the most moderate calculation the things are worth five pounds.</p>

I am very sure these are the buckles that I saw Wilson take out of my master's shoes, I told him they were not silver, he had no occasion to take them, and he took out another buckle, and I told him the same, and he dropped one of them, and put these buckles in his pocket, and these stockings; he came and told me he would tie me, and put his hand over my mouth; I told him I would not be tied by him, nor yet my breath should not be stopped by him; I am sure they are my master's stockings.</p>

               <p>The prisoner has lived with a friend of mine, Mr. Meggison, in Hatton-Garden, I think upwards of two years, he behaved then very honest; he has been at my house I suppose 150 times; I told Mr. Meggison to come here, but he declined it; I looked in just by chance, and hearing that declaration from the prisoner, it had an effect on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140009"/> me.

               <p>He was in my service seven months lately, he left it the 1st of November; I have intrusted him with valuables in bank notes and other matters, and money; I had not any doubt of his honesty till this circumstance; I should have given him the character of a perfect honest man, there seemed an indolence about him, which I attributed to his suffering in America; he suffered in his health, and he could not ride well, these are the reasons for which I parted with him; but I kept him in my service nearly two months after I wished to part with him; because I conceived him a worthy man, and that he should not be turned out of service at a time when the town was empty; and when he left my service, I gave him permission to come and take his victuals at my house till he got into service.</p>
               <p>What part of the town do you live in? - Charlotte-street, Portland-place; I had an equal good character of him from Mr. Meggison; and he has only served two since his return from America, or in the West-Indies; and he was an officer's servant in America, and has been serving in the navy; I understand he was led away by an improper connection after he left me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner Leonard. Was you enlisted in America? - No, my Lord, I was an officer's servant.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner Wilson. Have you any thing to say? - My master is gone abroad about two months; there was a gentleman said he would come, but I believe he is not come.</p>

I went to apprehend the prisoner, and I took him going up to the gallery in Drury-lane, Play-house; I brought him back and told him that his master had charged me to take him into custody, I took him up on the 5th of this month, about eight; I brought him back to Mr. Young's, and I went up stairs to look over his box, and in his box I found three pair of new shoes, two pair of new buckles and other things, and he told me if I would send up for his mistress, he would tell her the whole business, Mrs. Young came up, I was present, and when she came up he said -</p>
               <p>Court. Before you tell this did you advise him to send for his mistress? - I told him, says I, young man, all the servants at present have their characters at stake, they will all be discharged, and it is a pity they should if you have the draft, and it looks very suspicious.</p>
               <p>Was that all you said? - It was, I called up his mistress, that was Mrs. Young that is here, and he told her he hoped it would be a warning to her, for leaving her draughts and her money about, that he had taken the draught and got the cash for it, that he had sent one Mad Jack to receive the money, a coachman; I then went and took the man into custody that went to receive the money, and a woman that went with him; here is a small bit of paper, where is put down how he expended a great deal of the money that was after he was apprehended, and the remainder, he said, he had lost at gambling, I found 1 l. 8 s. 2 d. upon him.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Young. When you was sent for, what did you say to him to induce him to tell you the truth of the matter? - I did not ask him any questions, I made him no promises, he owned he had taken the money, and said he hoped it would be a warning to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Lucas. Did not you promise me that if I would confess having the draft I should be forgiven and nothing said against my character?</p>
               <p>Lucas. No, my Lord, I do not recollect ever saying any thing of that sort to him, I only told him that the rest of the servants characters stood at stake, as nigh as I can recollect; I told him this, that it was a pity, if he had taken it, that the other people should lose their characters,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140012"/> that they would all be turned away; then said call up my mistress, call up my mistress.</p>

               <p>Tell us what it was. - We went up stairs, Mrs. Young desired us to go up stairs to see if he had anything in his box, and Mr. Lucas told him, says he, young man, it is a sad piece of work if you know anything of it, it is a sad thing the other servants should lose their places; but as for making any promises, I heard none, he seemed a good deal confused, and said, call my mistress, and she came up; and he said, Mrs. Young, I beg you will take care of your cash and drafts in future.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not you by when Mr. Lucas promised me that? - I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear him say, if any body came after my character, my mistress would take no notice? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. There is one thing that I have observed both you and the last witness have said, that you did not miss them till the 13th, till you counted your sheep? - No.</p>
               <p>Now, if you had so perfect an acquaintance with the faces of all the sheep, I should have thought you might have missed them without counting them; as if a number of men come to a place every day, you might miss two or three without counting them? - We do not so strictly look over them every day as that.</p>
               <p>Now for instance, a captain of a company who sees all his men every day and knows all their faces, will miss four or five of his men without counting them? - I was not constantly with them every day.</p>
               <p>Were you with them between the 6th and the 13th? - Yes I was, but it was towards the dusk of the evening, a lad that we have to assist was with them, a little lad, so that I did not see them much within that time.</p>
               <p>Do you know either of the prisoners? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Where did you get these sheep that this good man found in your possession? - I bought them at a public fair at Kingston, on the 14th of November, of Layton, I turned them upon the common, I gave eight shillings and sixpence apiece for them, I bought seven, and gave three pounds for the lot, which was six-pence over, he said he brought them from Sunbury Common.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you whose property they were? - No, I did not ask him, I told him where I was going to bring them to; I have no other sheep.</p>
               <p>Did you ever keep any sheep before? - I never kept but two before, and them I lost; I am no great judge of sheep, I dare say a great many people may know them, and many may not.</p>

               <p>Do you know where they brought the sheep from? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see any sheep of Layton's there before? - None but what was my brother's and husband's there were three, I fancy he sold them for my brother, he has sold my husband's several times, he has sold for Mr. Collins, and Mr. Ballinger, the two capital farmers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Isaac is your brother-in-law? - Yes, the sheep were in different pens hurdled off, I saw the sheep at Justice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140015"/> Taylor's, I do not know who took them, I cannot say whether they are the same I saw at the fair, my brother helped to drive them away, I thought I knew them again, I think they were the same by looking at them, as I have been about among them.</p>
               <p>A man who had bred them and tended them would be more likely to know them again than you, would not he? - Very like, Harris asked Layton what the gentleman bid, and he told him nothing, then Layton asked Harris what was the price if he sold them, and he said if he could not get eight shillings apiece he was to go home again.</p>

            . After you had taken him with these stockings, at Mr. Heather's, you carried him to Bow-street, what happened then? - I searched him immediately, in Mr. Heather's shop, and in his pocket I found this letter, directed to Dr. Warren, that led me to suspect he had robbed the Doctor; the other person that was with me took him down to the office, Mr. Heather desired me to go to the Doctor's; on searching him I found this reading glass, this ink-stand, and two keys; the things were in different pockets.</p>
               <p>Doctor Warren. Such a reading glass as this I certainly had, it had no particular mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Do you think it to be your's? - I should suppose it is.</p>
               <p>Had you it frequently in use? - No, it lay in a drawer, it was bought a year or two ago for one of my sons, for some optical experiments; this was an ink-case, made to hold two pens, and very curiously contrived to hold ink; here was a thing went with a hinge, and the bottom part is particularly made; instead of a cork for the ink, here is a piece of metal so contrived that you need not daub your fingers; these are such particulars that I can swear it is mine; I can swear positively to this; this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140017"/> I used to carry about with me continually, but went out of town the Saturday preceding the detection of this robbery a considerable journey from town; and not wanting it I left it at home.</p>
               <p>What is the value of that? - Ten shillings, he sold the gold of it for half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Atkins. Here are two keys.</p>
               <p>Doctor Warren. Mr. Atkins informed me these keys would open my drawers; I thought they would, I applied them to the locks, and found they opened the drawers; one opened the bureau, and the other the library; the stockings were in the bureau.</p>

               <p>Where was this ink-case? - I left it laying upon the table.</p>
               <p>You had not missed this till Mr. Atkins told you? - I had not been come home from this journey above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Atkins. I found three duplicates upon him, which led me to three pawnbrokers, where I found the silk stockings; I first went to Mr. Priestman, in Princes-street; I found two more pawned at Mr. Brown's, all white silk, but numbered differently; I retured to Bow-street, and when I came back to Bow-street the prisoner was crying, I told him the Doctor had missed a gold box, he told me he sold it at a refiner's, in Long-acre, but he did not rightly know the place.</p>
               <p>Did you make him any promises? - Nothing at all, he told me voluntarily; I found out where it was sold, at Mr. Plank's, refiner, in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am guilty of what is laid to my charge, I was very much distressed at the time, and only beg for mercy, I had been out of place a long time.</p>

               <p>I should have thought this would have made you suspect him? - I thought he was in the business; after which he says to me as I was trying the other, says he, I should be glad if you will try this bit also, it looks like gold, I have had it some time by me; I tried that, and I told him that was gold; then I replied to him is this your own property, and did you come honestly by it? he said it was his own property, and he came honestly by it; before I weighed it, I said you are sure you come honestly by it; I was very suspicious from the circumstances of these pieces; I asked him, more than that, what it came from, and he told me it came from an old ivory snuff-box, after which he said to me, pray what may be the value of that which came off the bottom of the ink-stand, I put it into the scale, and told him about five shillings or five and six-pence, it altogether weighed about nineteen pennyweights and eighteen grains, the value of all together was two pound fifteen; after which I told him what it came to, he told me is not it worth any more, I said if you think you can make any more of it try it somewhere else, after which he said, Sir, I suppose you will give me as much as it is worth, and you may have it, and I paid him two pound fifteen for it.</p>

               <p>Court. Were the lamps lighted? - Yes, I called stop thief, and he cried stop thief! I took him opposite to St. Clement's Coffee-house, he run round the church, I was quick after him, I never lost sight of him, I brought him back, and asked my sister if the prisoner was the person that took the things, she said, he was; the neighbours gathered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140019"/> about me, and they knew him, I found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Was your door shut? - It was, I had been in the shop just before that to snuff the candles.</p>
               <p>Did you go to your door at that time? - I did, to see if it was safe.</p>
               <p>What induced you to do that? - We generally make a point of doing that when we are at meals.</p>
               <p>How long was this after? - I suppose, about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Can you say with certainty that from the time you snuffed the candles, and saw the door to the time your sister went into the shop, no person had been out of that door? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Are you shure that no person had been into the shop? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>How did you examine the door at this time? - By seeing that the latch was safe, and the door was fast.</p>
               <p>Did you put your hand on the latch? - Yes, I speak upon certain recollection.</p>
               <p>There was no fastening but the latch? - No; I took out my watch while I had the prisoner in the shop, and it was thirty five minutes past five; then he had been in the house about five minutes.</p>
               <p>When you were out in the street, could you distinguish people at all, except by the light of the lamps? - No, day-light was too far past.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt about the boy's person? - No, the prisoner is the person I brought back.</p>

               <p>I am sister-in-law to Mr. Hazledine, about half past five in the evening, it was thereabouts, I cannot say to five minutes, we were at tea in the back parlour, the candles were lighted, my brother said he heard the door open, and desired me to look into the shop, the door was open, and I saw the prisoner come into the shop, put his hand in the window, and take out two bundles of bedgowns.</p>
               <p>Did he come completely into the shop? - Yes, the bedgowns lay in the corner of the window, I saw them there half an hour before.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of them? - Twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Had they any mark upon them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What mark? - They were marked with the shop mark.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you saw him take them? - Yes, I was rather in the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you say anything to him? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Were there any candles in the shop? - Yes, there were ten candles in all, I saw his face, as soon as he was gone out of the shop, I called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Did you pursue him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your property again? A woman in the alms-house picked them up as they lay in the street, she is not here, I saw him take them up from the window, he put his hands across a wire into the window, and took them up, he was brought back in about five or ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>When he was brought back to the shop, did you see him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the boy that was brought back to the shop, was the boy you saw in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you no doubt? - Not the least doubt, because I saw his face, my brother ran after him immediately, I saw the property about ten minutes after; the woman that brought in the property did not see him drop them, and she is a very elderly woman; I examined the property that was brought in, they are my brother's with the shop mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me open the door? - No, I did not, he was just coming into the shop, he was partly in the shop with the door open.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know who went last out of the shop, before your brother went out? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect your brother going to snuff the candles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had any body been in the shop after he snuffed the candles? - I do not know.</p>

(Produced, and deposed to.) I asked him how he came to tell me they were clothes; then he said he had been to fetch them from the mangler's, I asked him if he had anything else in his pocket, he said no, I searched him, and found two silver tea spoons in his pocket.</p>
               <p>(The spoons deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Had you curiosity at that time to ask him his name? - Not immediately I did not, he then asked me if I had Irish cloth, he said, Sir, I should be very glad to have a piece of Irish cloth of you, you can serve me as well any man in London; I said, I should be sorry I could not, he then wanted some lawn for trimmings, I made him an account for five pounds, one or two shillings, he then presented a draft for fifteen pounds, of Messrs. Pybus's, I looked very earnestly at it, it was in the parlour, he followed me into the shop and said, Sir, you are very right to be careful, there are a great many bad drafts about and swindlers, I asked who Mr. Richards was, he said, that is myself, I live at Fulham, and Mr. Parsons the drawer lives at Fulham also, upon this I took the draft, and gave him the balance in cash, the amount of it was fifteen pounds; it has been in my possession ever since, excepting a few days, I am very clear it is the same, I entered it in my bill book, and took particular notice of the number.</p>
               <p>Did you mark that identical paper? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Who did you part with it to? - To one Mr. Tate.</p>
               <p>Do you think, Sir, you are able to say that is the same note? - I am positive sure.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am clear.</p>
               <p>How much money did you give him in change? - Between nine and ten pounds.</p>
               <p>What conversation continued between you? - He followed me from the parlour to the shop, and I examined the note very minutely, I had many checques from Mr. Pybus's house, he said, I did very right to examine very minutely, that there were a great many bad notes about, but this was a very good one; I observed to him that I was sorry he would not give me leave to send his goods home, I offered to send them home two or three different times, he only said he was going to Fullham, and should return on Monday with the lady to shew her the house.</p>
               <p>Did he say where he was going before he went to Fulham? - No, he said no more than that, but I rather concluded, he was going to the tavern.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not tell us what you concluded; did he say he was going to the tavern? - No, I sent this draft for payment, and it was not paid, I have no doubt but this is the very identical draft that was produced for payment.</p>
               <p>You know it by comparison with your book I suppose? - I took the particulars down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140032"/> Your book is not here? - No.</p>
               <p>Looking at that without comparing it, what is there upon it that enables you to swear it is the same draft that was tendered by the prisoner? - No. 17.</p>
               <p>Did you bear that in your memory, or did you take it from your book? - I bore it in my memory, it is written.</p>
               <p>Any other paper that had seventeen wrote in it might impose itself upon you; if I was to make an accurate copy of that note how would you know one from the other? - Not only the number but the capital letter R struck me.</p>
               <p>What is there peculiar in the capital letter R by which you now recollect it? - Why there is not particular support at the bottom to the return.</p>
               <p>I will thank you for a sight of it? - The last part of the letter.</p>
               <p>This has as much the appearance of a P as an R?</p>
               <p>Court. It is not a common R certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now I take it you are not quite sure it is an R? - It strikes me as an R.</p>
               <p>Now will you venture to swear the name on that draft is not Prichard? - There are not letters enough.</p>
               <p>I say that which you call a capital R, is a capital P? - I cannot venture to swear that it is.</p>
               <p>When did you for the first time, make that observation on the supposed R? - I entered it down as an R in the copy.</p>
               <p>When for the first time did you take any particular notice, or make any particular observation on that letter? - In the course of about five days.</p>
               <p>Then before you had made that observation, it had passed out of your hands? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Yes, you had sent it out for payment, you did not carry it yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you see I was right? - It was in the hands of my nephew and servant

               <p>He brought it back again? - He did, then I entered it.</p>
               <p>Your book is not here? - No, then I put it in my pocket-book, and then I received this letter.</p>
               <p>Put that letter into your pocket-book again; did you communicate your observations on the letter R to any body? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then it rested for some months I think, 'till Mr. Tate came to you? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>When did you again see the prisoner at the bar? - Not before the 23d of November, Mr. Tate had been with me prior to that, and told me that my name was put into the body of a draft to Messrs. Hankey's house, the man was at liberty when he came to ask me if I knew any thing of that draft.</p>
               <p>When you first saw the prisoner you knew he was then in custody upon a charge of forgery? - Yes, I understood to.</p>
               <p>You was called upon to identify the prisoner's person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Other people could not identifie him? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>The prisoner stood there as a party accused, as a prisoner? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Probably with irons on? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>That was the first time you saw him after he came to your house at Kensington? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At the distance of six months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might the person that bought the lawn and the Irish stay with you? - I suppose about twenty minutes or half an hour.</p>
               <p>You have told us the whole conversation that passed between you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was nothing else that passed between you? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Have you any doubt in the world of that being the man that came to your shop? - Not the least doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt in your mind that that is the note? - Not any, I asked him if his name was Richards, and he said it was.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you part with this note out of your hands to Tate? - It was about six weeks ago, he had it about a fort, night or three weeks: he came down to me, to ask me if my name was Stenson,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140033"/> about a draught on Hankey's house, I then compared it, and found it was the ame hand writing.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did you give it to Mr. Tate? - For the purpose of comparing hands.</p>
               <p>Did it never occur to you, that it would be a better method to put some mark of your own hand writing upon it, than to enter it upon your book? - It being a bankers draught I did not.</p>
               <p>Suppose, now, any person had been at the pains after you had parted with this note to take another checque of Pybus and Co. and upon that to make an exact copy and imitation of the note; I do not mean a common copy, but a copy professing to imitate the hand-writing, should you know the one from the other? - Some people are very ingenious in copying to be sure, but Mr. Tate put his mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then let him be called, although the belief of this witness would be evidence certainly to be left to the Jury.</p>

               <p>Was it after that partnership was formed, ever known by the description of Pybus, Call, Dorset, Pybus, and Hayley? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>In 1784, the partners were Pybus, Dorset, Cockell, Pybus the younger, and Haley; in January, 1785, Dorset and Cockell went out, and Call and Grant came in.</p>
               <p>Was the partnership of Pybus, Call, Pybus, Grant and Haley, that partnership firm in 1785, was it ever known by the old firm of Pybus, Dorset, Cockell, Pybus and Haley? - I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Do you know one way or the other, answer the plain question without endeavouring to find out the consequences of it, whether the new partnership was ever know by the old firm? - No, I do not believe it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. If any person was possessed of any of your old checques, and kept cash there, though it was directed to Messrs. Pybus, Dorset, Cockell, Pybus and Haley, yet the new partnership will pay it? - They would.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was not the reason of that draught being so answered, that it was properly addressed to the old firm, being one of the draughts of the old firm, of a remaining balance of Pybus, Dorset, and Co? - It was.</p>

               <p>Have you had one single instance of this; that a customer of the new firm, not a customer of the old house, has drawn a draught upon the old checque, and that it has been paid? - We have not.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you mean the draught of a customer who had come from the old firm?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If by any mistake a new customer had written on a checque in the old firm and drawn? - We have had an instance of that kind: Mr. Cuthbert arrived from the East Indies since January, and drew a draft, on the new house, upon an old checque, and it was honoured; he had no account at all with the old house.</p>

               <p>"The King against Jones otherwise Perrott," he offered him in payment a note resembling in size, and every other respect, a bank of England note, but instead of saying for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, the printed note said for my Governor and Company of my Bank in England; it was in evidence the person offering it said, this was a good note, and I remember Mr. Fielding said that might be let in after the word purporting, assisted by the collateral representation to be a Bank of England note: the case first came in the shape of an indictment of a fraud before Mr. Justice Blackstone, he was of opinion, if it was any thing, it must be a forgery; it was afterwards tried before Lord Mansfield, who reserved the case, it was afterwards argued; the Court said the purporting must be on the face of the instrument itself, that every man that looks at it may be able to say, this purports to be such a draft; here, therefore, they must shew it is not the draft of Mr. Parsons; now how have they attempted to shew that? why by calling Mr.

               <p>Court. The law is not to accommodate itself to particular cases, or to the particular conduct of persons; where you charge a forgery, it is incumbent upon you to give some evidence that it is a forged instrument, be the instrument what it may; if a person takes the draft or note of a stranger, it is not very usual to take it upon a man's saying it is Mr. Such-a-one's, who lives in London or any where else, but people enquire a little more particularly; the party uttering the note is bound down by the description that he gives, and the law will not permit him afterwards to say that there is another man of this name who really wrote the note of another description; but where a man takes a note without any description, or with very little description, he takes it at his risk: In the present case, you are not to convict a man because he cannot prove his innocence, but you must first give reasonable evidence of his guilt; the matter in doubt at present is this, this draft is the draft of

               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, although it is not a very pleasant employ to exert one's-self in aid of a prosecution, where the event of it, if it obtains, will be certain death, yet I must say a word: my learned friend has stated a case out of Douglass, that does not seem to me to apply: if I charge that an instrument purports what it does not, that charge falls to the ground: purport will equally apply to representation, viva voce, that represents matter of evidence from the mouth of a witness, the evidence must altogether arise from the instrument itself, here it does not seem to me that my learned friend took any objection to the instrument, but to the evidence: the purporting is here delivered to the Court, upon which there can be no mistake: the man tells him, that this is a draught drawn by a Mr. Parson's of Fulham, upon Pybus and Co. and that he is Mr. Richards, the very man in whose favour the draught is drawn; now suppose in this case, the evidence had stopped short, and he had not assumed the name of Richards, the evidence would be compleat as to this forgery; but when you have it in evidence, that a man assumes that his name is Richards, which is a manifest falsehood, that would form a subject for a serious deliberation, there would be sufficient to leave it to the Jury, but I do conceive there is something in this, that he being the person in whose favour the draught is made, it is incumbent upon him to know something of the firm of the house, before he receives the draught on the drawer; he therefore takes upon himself to receive the draught, and professes that this man keeps cash at Pybus's, and when the fact comes out that there is no such person as this

            , it is another circumstance of presumption, that the whole is a fabrication from beginning to end: as to the putting it to us to search through Fulham, this seems to be putting upon us the proof of the negative: I agree with your Lordship, that the justice and the humanity of the law of this country is, that no man should be called to defend himself, till some guilt is proved, but there are degrees of proof, it hardly ever in forgery amounts<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140037"/> to demonstration; therefore, as in this case, it depends upon the degrees of probability.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall leave the evidence to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I was told from the Bench a day or two ago, which I own was news to me, that I was entitled to a reply.</p>
               <p>Court. In stating your objection, you are entitled to a reply, I think so, clearly in all cases.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It has not been usually, I believe, the way with us here.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a constant practice in all interlocutory matters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have very often fallen into the error of supposing I had no right to reply, because the objections I have had the honour of stating, have generally been so strong, that they have not stood in need of a reply: the gentlemen on the part of the prosecution have observed pretty strongly, and pretty much at large upon the facts of the case: that certainly is not the province of the Counsel; but that is all that Mr. Fielding has done, and Mr. Silvester supposes that there was something more in this representation, than he is warranted by the evidence to suppose; because as it stands at present, it is a naked representation of this fact, that he was the Mr. Richards to whom it was payable, and that

             living at Fulham, when perhaps to-morrow the very man that drew the bill may stand up.</p>
               <p>Court. I think this case by far the shortest in point of evidence, that I ever remember to have heard of, or to have read of; there are two sorts of forgeries; one is the forgery of known and defined person, in that case it is necessary to prove that the party did define that person, if he is not sufficiently defined on the face of the instrument, which, in the case of an acceptor he may not be; but in the case of a drawer he rarely can: it will be necessary to prove, that the party having the draft, did, by his description, limit it to be the instrument of that person whose it is charged to be; and then you are bound to prove by the best evidence the negative, that is not the hand writing of that person. There is another kind of forgery more difficult of proof; where a draft is drawn in the name of a man who did not exist, or rather in the name of a man not known, for perhaps there cannot be contrived a draft in the name of any person who did not exist; (for draw a draft in any name, there are persons of the same name,) but who do not exist for the purposes of that draft, that case is most difficult of proof; but it does not follow because a case is difficult of proof, that the law does not call for it to be proved; the parties must always use due caution, and due diligence: here is the designation of a place which seemed to be capable of being ascertained with due diligence, now Fulham is not a place of that extent, but it might have been ascertained; if therefore, this case stood merely so, I should not be inclined to leave the evidence to the Jury, but should give them my opinion, that there was not evidence of this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140038"/> being a forged draft, which is a necessary question before they can enquire whether the prisoner forged it; but there is one circumstance that inclines me to leave this evidence to the Jury, which is, that the prisoner professed to be the payee of the draft; now I do not agree with the learned gentleman, that his saying his name was Richards, when it was not, is a circumstance of the guilt imputed to him by the indictment; for tho' that argues a consciousness of guilt of some kind or other, yet it may equally refer to twenty other kinds of guilt, and I think it would have the same effect, as to this question, if his name really had been Richards, and if that part of his representation had been true; it is not therefore because he gave a false representation, that I think that helps the evidence for the prosecution, but because by stating himself to be the payee of the note whether true or not, he takes upon himself the knowledge of who is the drawer; that circumstance weights on my mind, to leave the evidence to the Jury, and tho' a party should not be called on to prove his innocence till his guilt is established, yet a person who takes upon himself the knowledge of the drawer should be called upon to shew who is that person: at the same time, the prosecutor has not used due diligence to lay the best evidence before the Court; they might have called the parish officers and have proved that they knew the parish, and had gone round to collect the rates, and that they knew of no person whatever of the name of

Holmes at the bottom, I said who is G. Holmes, says he, he is a private gentleman that lives at Kensington, and I asked him whereabouts at Kensington, he said, at Stones-end, going to Hammersmith; and he said, yes, says I, then who is Mr Stenson, says he, that is the person who the things are for; now from that moment his having first told me it was an old lady, and I seeing the name created suspicion, for Mr. Stenson could not be an old lady at any rate, I caught at the expression directly, says I, you told me just now, it was an old lady that wanted these things, O says he, I suppose in the hurry of drawing the draught, they omitted the S; I never asked the old lady's name, nor asked the man his name, I went and called my man from dinner and beckoned him to go into the parlour, and told him there was a person in the shop who I did not know, and he came in such a sort of questionable shape, I did not know what to make of it, and I sent him to Messrs. Hankey's; that was the only proof to ascertain whether it was sound or unsound. After my man was gone I went into the shop, and entered into conversation with the person, and he said he had some little business at Mr. Constable's, and I said the man will not be long; so we were talking about the new tea-warehouse, and who were the proprietors and such like: whether the prisoner's situation grew uneasy or not I cannot say; but, says he, as your man is not returned I think I will go to Mr. Constable's, and I will be back in about ten minutes, very well, Sir, says I, if he brings the money I will send him to you; the prisoner never returned, and in about a quarter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140040"/> of an hour or twenty minutes my man and Messrs. Hankey's clerk both returned, the moment I saw a new face I was convinced that my suspicions were well founded, and that I was right: I said to my young man, you know where Mr. Constable lives, go and see whether he is there or no, so I believe they did, they did not come into the shop, they returned and said the prisoner had not been there.</p>
               <p>Have you the note? - No, Mr. Tate has it, and Mr. Tate then said he suspected it was Druitt.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man? - Yes, I am sure it is the same man.</p>
               <p>It was not candle-light? - No, Sir, it was not.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure as to the day? - Yes, I think I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When a man says I think, I apprehend it imports a doubt. - It may, Sir; I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner after? - I never saw him till he was taken, which I believe was three weeks or a month, but I received a letter from Mr. Tate, informing me that Druitt was in custody, at the Rotation-Office, at Hick's-Hall, I found him in custody, charged with the offence.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether you mentioned the day at the Rotation-Office? - Yes, I did, I am perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>He instructs me that he pressed you to fix the time, that he might shew where he was at that time. - I said it was Tuesday the 1st of November, says Mr. Webster it is not material about the day, says this unfortunate young man, I wish the gentleman would be precise as to the day; before that I had consulted my wife and the man altogether.</p>
               <p>You did state it was uncertain, to which Mr. Webster said it was not material, was it so stated in the presence of the prisoner? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>I observe in the whole account you gave to my friend, you very constantly and very properly said, the man, you did not name the prisoner; are you able to say now, with certainty, whether he is the man? - I do think he is the man.</p>
               <p>Is it a matter about which concurring circumstances, and the opinion of other men have induced you to believe that he is the man? - I am not governed by other men at all.</p>
               <p>I am afraid the best men are governed by other men. - If I could have any doubt of it, I should be happy to catch your idea.</p>
               <p>Abstracted from every thing you have heard from others, from all you have seen, from all comparisons of hand-writings, are you able, at the distance of a month, to say that is the man; if you have a particle of a doubt, I am sure you will say so? - I really do think he is the man, but I am not infallible, he very much resembles the man, but never having seen him before, and it was four o'clock in the month of November, and it was rather dark.</p>
               <p>You speak very much to your honour; then you say that you cannot speak to him positively, from the circumstances of never having seen him before, seeing him in the month of November, and seeing him rather in the dark, do not you think you may fairly suspect your own recollection? - Sir, in general I do not.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about him, go up to him? - I think it is the same man.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt, Sir? - When I say I think he is the same man, that does not imply much doubt, but to say with certainty that he is the same man, I cannot.</p>
               <p>In short, you do not swear with the same positiveness that I do that this is Mr. Silvester, I swear this is Mr. Silvester.</p>

               <p>Court. Abstracted from the possibility of being mistaken, which there certainly is to you in common with all mankind, have you at this time any doubt in your own mind that this is the man? - Certainly not, I certainly think he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Court. I will put it to you in a different way, I am sure you will not go any further than the truth; supposing you had never heard any thing about this man from the time he left your shop, and that you had met him a month after in the street, should you have known him to be the same man that offered you the note? - I do not say that I should, I did not take a great deal of notice of the man, I think he is the same man, but to swear positively that he is the same man, I cannot; if I had met the man at a distance of time, I should not have said to a friend, that is the man that offered me the forged draft.</p>
               <p>But now from all the circumstances you strongly believe him to be the same man? - I thought when I saw him at Hick's-Hall he resembled the man very much, he seemed to me much the same sort of man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect a Mr. Ripley of Wapping attending the examination? - Yes, so I found.</p>
               <p>The draft you gave to Mr. Tate was the same draft you received from the prisoner? - I do not recollect whether I saw it at that time.</p>
               <p>Did you mark it? - No, there was no mark upon it, I sent it by my man.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you know the Stones-end? - I know a private gentleman of fortune of the name of J Holmes, about the center of the Town, but at the Stones-end, going out to Hammersmith, there is none of the name of Holmes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Kensington, if I do not mistake, is a place that changes its inhabitants pretty much? - Frequently in regard to lodgers, not with respect to parishoners.</p>
               <p>It is, we all know, a fashionable village, and the boarders and lodgers change their abode frequently; you do not mean to swear that there is no person of the name of Stenson but your wife? - As an old lady I will.</p>
               <p>Will you swear there is no old lady of that name, lodged in Church-row? - Yes, I am very sure I should have been acquainted with it if there had.</p>
               <p>Now I give you a small spot, Church-court, will you venture to swear there was not an old lady who lodged there in November last, of the name of Stenson? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Why can you venture to do that? - I never knew one of my own name except one, I do not know any person of the name except my wife.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Mr. Tate. You know Mr. J. Holmes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does he sign his name with a G? - No, with a J. that is not at all like his hand writing; I have seen him write fifteen years ago, and down to four years, since which time he became a private gentleman.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol, I was present at the fire at Mr. Nelson's, I saw the prisoner stand at the door at Mr. Nelson's, with three others, the adjoining house was then on fire, they went up stairs and I followed them to the fore room up two pair of stairs, I am sure the prisoner was one, it was between ten and eleven at night.</p>
               <p>Was there a candle? - There was a light from the flames, and I plainly perceived the prisoner, and I saw a sailor, that was in company with the prisoner take a poker and attempt to break open a lock, but they did not, the prisoner reached the poker to the sailor, the prisoner then went into the adjoining room, where there was a bed, and there stood a chest upon chest of drawers, and I saw them both, the prisoner and the sailor, break open the drawers, and I saw the prisoner take several things out, and put several things in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Where were the family at this time? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you see any part of the family in that apartment? - I did not, I saw the prisoner put some of the things into his pocket, I could not see what sort of things they were, he took them out of the drawers, soon after I came down there was a great suffocation in the room, I told my partner, and soon after I saw the prisoner hanging out of the two pair of stairs window by his left hand, they are both front rooms, I suppose he might hang five minutes, and waving his right hand as if in distress, which excited the compassion of every one thereabouts, they supposed him to be one of the family.</p>
               <p>How did he come down? - He fell from there on the leads of the one pair of stairs over the private door of the house, and was assisted down from those leads which broke his fall, many people offered to assist him as one of the family, then he went in again at the same door that he first went in at, that was the private door, I did not hear him say any thing, he went up again to the same chamber, me and my partner followed him very close, he then came down stairs directly, we came after him close to his heels, we followed him, he went through the crowd into Surry-street, I followed him there and stopped him, I asked him where he was going to, he said he lived at Charing-cross, I said that was quite the contrary way, he was going from Charing-cross; I asked him what he had upon him, having seen him take the things before,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140045"/> his pockets were pretty well loaded, he said what he had was his own property, I told him I doubted that, he said he was positive it was, I told him he should come down with me if he pleased, and I would take him to the officer of the night, he came very quietly, I delivered him to my partner and the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Have you any sort of doubt that this is the man that you saw go into the apartment? - I have no doubt of it, because he was in my sight, I lost sight of him about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Councel. When this man came down you was not near him I believe? - Yes, I was at the door when the prisoner was taken off the leads.</p>
               <p>What was said at that time? - Nothing that I heard, there were a great many people about.</p>

               <p>Were there not a great many people assisting, and others telling them where to carry the things? - I did not hear any.</p>
               <p>Where did the people belonging to the goods carry them? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was not this man following somebody with goods? - There was not a creature going before him with goods.</p>
               <p>Why did not you take him into custody up stairs? - Because I thought it was better to take him as private as possible.</p>
               <p>How many people were at the door at that time? - I did not number them.</p>
               <p>Were not there a great many? - Yes, there were beyond a doubt, I never saw the prisoner with my eyes before, he went with me immediately, I heard nobody enquire where the goods were carried to; I did not hear whether he was hurt by his fall, some people compassionated him, as he appeared much hurt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did he pretend at all that he was carrying any thing away for the benefit of the sufferers? - He did say so at the watch-house, but in the street he said it was his own property, at the watch-house he could not tell the name of any one person in the house.</p>

               <p>Do you know where that was on the evening of the fire in the Strand? - It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140046"/> next to the drawer where these things were taken out, in the bed room, in the chest upon chest, I have not seen it very lately; these shoes appear to be the property of my mistress, her name is in the black shoes, I have no doubt of their being her property.</p>
               <p>Where were they kept on the night of the fire? - In the top drawer in the same chest, I do not know the stockings, they are not marked, she had some of that sort and some gloves of that sort, her name is not in the gloves, the silk skirt has my own mark on it.</p>
               <p>Court to Holmes. What do you take the value of that skirt to be? - Four shillings.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had no intention to take these things, I went up stairs into the two pair of stairs room certainly, I was coming home with my wife from over the water from my sister's to Charing-cross, and I called at a public-house in Devereux-court, which Mr. Davis, a neighbour, kept, that kept a public-house in St. Martin's-lane, just by where I live, I sent my wife home, and told her I would call in to see this Mr. Davis, I went and spoke to him, I had a pint of beer, he told me to go up stairs, and said there was a society above stairs, and if you go up stairs you may sit more comfortably, I went up stairs and had one pint of beer, and all of a sudden he came running into the room and said, there is a great fire just by, accordingly every body almost ran out of the room, and I unfortunately went among the rest.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is Davis's from the fire? - Davis's house is almost by St. Clement's church, accordingly I went to the fire, I had drank a little more than usual, I saw several people go into this house, and I went into the two pair of stairs, when I came in I saw that gentleman there, and several more people were in this bed room, the drawers were all laying about the floor, and them things, they went out, and there was a large round hat box laying on the ground, I took hold of it and I filled it full of things, when I had so done I went to lift it on my head, so then these things dropped, and one of my pockets was full of lemons, accordingly I stooped and picked them up, what they were I did not know till I saw them in the watch-house, I had rather a loose waistcoat on, and I put some things into my waistcoat bosom, and they dropped out again, and unfortunately I put them into my breeches, I came to the room door with the hat box on my head, I could see nobody and I called out are you all gone, nobody answered, I went to the room door and the door was shut, I pulled it open, as soon as I did so the smoke at that door dashed into my face, and I thought the whole place was in flames, I directly threw the hatbox off my head and ran to the window, and in my fright I did not take the things from about me, I hung with my hand by the window, at last I dropped on the leads, and from there into the street where the people caught hold of me; they asked me if I was hurt, I told them I thanked God, I did not feel myself much hurt, but I had some property about me, which had broke my fall, meaning the things in my breeches; I asked them where the goods were carried, that belonged to the house, and they said they did not know; I went into the house again, as far as the first pair of stairs, I never went up three stairs, there were a parcel of men standing there, I asked them where the goods were carried belonging to the house, some of them said into the next street; then I came out again, and the people gathered round me again, I told them I had some property about me, they told me the goods were gone into the next street; I went directly to the next street, and there were three girls standing at one door, whether the first second or third, I cannot say; and I went up to them, and said, does the goods come here, my girls, and one of them said no, no, they fell a laughing, and said lower down; then I came from that door, and there was a man to the best of my knowledge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140047"/> had something on his head; I was following him, and the patrol caught me, and asked me where I was going, says I, I am going to where the goods is carried, then he said I should go with him, for I had some property about me; I said, I have some property upon me, let me go and deliver that first; and he said, what property you took you shall deliver to me, I said, I would; I went along with him directly to the watch-house, I shewed him where the watch-house was, and when we got there, I told them I had some property about me, I went to give them the things and they took them away from me, then they searched me, the gentleman asked me my name, I told him and where I lived; if he had let me gone to the bottom of the street, he would have been convinced where I was going.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheriff Watson. I attended the fire, and the goods in general were carried into Surry-street; I put a party of the guards there, and after clearing away, I desired an officer to send a party more to keep those goods from being plundered.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a very good character.)</p>

               <p>Did you see what it was they poured into the pail? - I did not, I could not, the prisoner had the frying-pan in her hand, the constable took the metal out of the pail, and has had it ever since; I am sure it was not the prisoner that put it in the pail, the prisoner opened the door to me, I had no suspicion of her.</p>
               <p>You did not know there was any pot missing? - Not till I was told.</p>
               <p>Was she at your house that day? - Frequently.</p>
               <p>Had she a pot at home that day? - I cannot say, she might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. My Lord, it was only two drunken women taking a little gin out of the pot.</p>
               <p>Court. The Jury must be satisfied whether it was taken in a felonious way, or only taken with some liquor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not you think this pot was melted by warming a drop of comfort? - It is possible, we have frequently been served so.</p>

               <p>I am a brewer's servant, I saw the prisoner take the pot out of the tap-room, on Monday the 21st of November.</p>

               <p>What did you think she was going to do with the pot? - She put it under her apron and had some liquor and went away.</p>

               <p>I am constable, the prosecutor came to my house, I went with him to the prisoner's door, and knocked at the door, she would not open the door, I forced open the door, the prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing the pots, and I found the metal very hot, in a pail of water just by the fire.</p>
               <p>What did you see? - I saw the metal that is now here, except what stuck to the frying pan, some is on it now. (The metal produced as picked out of the pail, being part of two pint pots.) The two women interceded for mercy.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses who had known her several years, all of whom gave her a very good character, and said she was not a woman likely to steal pots to melt, but that she was given to drinking.</p>
               <p>Court to Edwards. Did the prisoner appear to be in liquor when she came into the house? - I did not take notice, she might or might not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She was generally intoxicated, I wish lenity to be shewn her, they begged mercy from me when the constable came to the door.</p>

About five minutes after the prisoner was brought out of the Court by the prosecutor on the next indictment, I put my hand in his pocket, and pulled out several handkerchiefs, and among the rest, my own handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Have you seen him since you was in Court? - I saw him close to me in Court, but I did not take the least notice of him; he was brought into Court, and I was bound over to prosecute him, the handkerchief I have here is my handkerchief, I bought it at a sale, it is marked with an E.</p>
               <p>What is the value of that handkerchief? - They have laid the value at 2 s. but I do not think it worth so much.</p>
               <p>How much value do you put upon it? - I do not think it worth above 8 d. or 9 d. the prisoner's wife called at my house with two children, and told me her husband had a good character, I took the trouble, and went to enquire at different places in the neighbourhood, and he had a very good character.</p>

             took the prisoner, the 4th of December, in Holborn, with six fowls; he said, he had some things of his own, and I might go home with him if I liked; he would not let me see them, nor have them at first; after that, he says, d - n your eyes! take them; the fowls lay in the mud a few minutes, they were in a handkerchief not tied; going along I asked him where he got them, and he said, he knew better than to tell me, I gave information at every public-house, and the prosecutor heard of it.</p>

               <p>On Saturday in the afternoon, Oldfield came to the shop, and abused his father very much, who was at work there, in slating; I reprimanded him for so doing, and he came into the loft, and staid sometime, he then went up another ladder to another different part of the loft, and took a survey of the roofs all round, he staid up about a quarter of an hour, and came down, and I saw him no more then.</p>
               <p>Where was the lead laying? - In the loft, right by where I worked; after taking a survey of the premises, and going up to the roof a second time, he came down and went off; he did not take anything away with him then, I am positive; I shut up shop after that, the door was locked by the apprentice; and on the Monday morning, we watched for him, at a muffin maker's, in Barret's-court, his name was Wilmot; when we got a search warrant, we went up stairs, and found the prisoner Oldfield there, and the lead over in a loft; there was a woman the wife of the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140059"/> Hugh Cooper rents the room, here is a piece of the lead.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose lead that is? - I cannot say, it was cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I am confident it was my piece of lead, there have been four pieces originally, each of these pieces was fourteen inches wide, and sixteen feet and a half long, all the four pieces were cut out of one sheet, and all alike, one was put in this place, the other three were taken away.</p>

               <p>I am constable of the parish, and I apprehended Oldfield in Cooper's apartments, and we found the lead hid over a sort of a cockloft; we took it down, and took the prisoner to the Rotation-office; Cooper was out, and he came in before I went away with Oldfield; I took Oldfield, I had no warrant against Cooper, but he went to clear himself, and was committed from the Rotation-office; he and his wife both went, and they proved their marriage, otherwise they would both have been committed.</p>
               <p>What did Cooper say about it? - He said he knew nothing at all about it, I know nothing to the contrary.</p>

               <p>What length did they make amongst them? - They made just two pieces of sixteen feet six inches and a half over, they had not the half-inch originally; the piece that was dropped by the stables was not tried by me or by any witness here.</p>

               <p>Which window was this that you found bursted out? - That in the yard, the back of the house was bursted open, and the pegs were broke off; they were pegged down with wooden pegs, I am sure I left the windows firm and fast; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, I saw them at the Justices's half an hour after; I did not know what I had lost before, some were taken out in my presence; the trunk was mine, there was no mark on it; I have no servant, I had such a trunk as that stood under the window, that was burst open; there was a door between the two rooms, it was not locked, it was thrown open; the lid of the trunk was broke, and the trunk I saw at the Justices's had the lid broke; I can swear to all the things that were taken, my wife was gone to work with me, and my children were with her.</p>

               <p>On Saturday morning last, the 10th of December, I was coming from my house at Kilburn to Paddington, I saw a man on the foot path before me, I saw him stooping down by the side of the ditch, and there was a basket; when I came to him, he was buttoning his breeches, I asked him if that basket belonged to him, he said it did, I asked him what was in it, he said, he dealt in oranges and lemons, and travelled in the country with them, and on his return home he gathered old flints and phials; I said, I will help you up with your load, I found it was very heavy, says I, when you are tired of it, I will ease you with it: I asked a man that I met, to assist me in looking at this; says he, who are you? says I, I live at Kilburn Wells; I and the prisoner lifted down the basket, and then he said he had got lead, and he hoped I would not hurt him; he said, he never stole any in his life, I asked him how he came by it, he said he had bought it of two bricklayers in the Edgware-road, I asked him what he gave for it, he said six shillings and a pot of beer; I took the prisoner into custody; the lead is here.</p>

               <p>I live in Dyot-street, the prisoner lived with me, and when I came home he was at home in my room, I believe it was nigh eleven; I saw this money, it was tied up in parcels, I took it down to Westminster, I never saw what was in it.</p>
               <p>Who tied it up in parcels? - Me and another woman.</p>
               <p>Where was it? - It was loose upon the floor in a corner of the room, I first saw it when I went home at night, it was upon the floor, it was halfpence, but I did not know the quantity; I went with the prisoner to one of his comrade's wife's house with it, and in five minutes after, two serjeants came up and took the money from us; the truck was found on the 19th, in Bambridge-street among a parcel of rags, I saw H. B. on it.</p>

               <p>On the 16th in the morning we had a field-day, and the two prosecutors and this old porter came and challenged the prisoner, and they went to get a warrant for him, I was ordered to confine him, we went and took the prisoner, and we went to a house in Westminster, where one of our men lodged, and there I found three women, two about the money, and they threw their cloaks over it, and I took the money and brought it away, and I searched the two women and found a great many halfpence in their pockets.</p>

               <p>My Lord, this porter hired me to go down to Paddington to carry some liquors, accordingly I did, and the people gave him something to bring away, but what it was I cannot say, the porter said it was ten pounds worth of halfpence, so he put them upon the truck, and away we came across the fields; coming through Tottenham-court-road the porter says to me, I must stop here awhile, and you go forward, I will soon overtake you, and he had not left me very little while, but three men came up to me and knocked me down and took away the truck and what was upon it: and they said if I made any violence or resistance, they would take my life, and I never saw the truck nor what was upon it any more, that night.</p>

The prisoner was apprehended in Long-alley, Moorfields, and upon being searched nothing was found but the two books; Mr. Oldham, a gentleman, who went on my account, and Mr. Armstrong, who took charge of the prisoner, were present.</p>

               <p>I went into the gentleman's house one evening, and I went down stairs, I came up stairs again and came out and shut the street door, as I thought, behind me: after this robbery was committed, Mr. Oldham and two of the runners came where I lodged, and they asked me what money I had, and I said sixpence, and in the confusion I did not recollect the seven guineas.</p>
               <p>How did these two books come into your box? - When I was there in the last summer, I was dusting the books and putting them away, and I got these two books and was reading them, I was teaching myself to read, and in a very great mistake I put them into my box: here is a person here that I lent one of them to, I told him at the same time that the book was General Melville's.</p>

               <p>I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, it was seven weeks next Wednesday since this man robbed me, it was on a Wednesday, between three and four o'clock, on the 10th of November, I was gone out about three quarters of an hour; I went out about a quarter after two, I am a lodger, I left nobody in my apartment at all; when I returned, my door was broke open, and I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; I never found any of the things again; the prisoner was the man that took care of my place, and he always professed to take care of it, and took money for me, and took messages, and I left him at home, I told him I was going out.</p>
               <p>Had he the key of your room? - No, I had it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Then it is for neglect of duty you charge him, for not taking better care? - No, Sir, it is no such thing; when I came back, I asked him if any body was looking for me, and he asked me why I did not stay at home and take care of my place, and he spoke a very wicked barbarous word, I could not tell the meaning of it; I have a little boy, and I says to him, light a fire for me; says my little boy, this Till will pay all the money he owes in Leather-lane; about a quarter after nine I missed my things, I did not miss them when I came home.</p>
               <p>When you found your door was broke open, did not you look? - No, Sir, I did not, he has gone into my place very often before.</p>
               <p>Did he ever break your door open before? - Never to my knowledge, only when my little boy would open it, when I was not at home, sometimes he would push back the lock, the lock was now pushed back.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140069"/>That was a common thing? - The little boy used to do it, and I asked the little boy if he broke the door open, and he said he did not; the reason I have for suspecting the prisoner, is, I have a fox dog, and he makes a great noise, and he barked and barked at a quarter past nine; I went to the loft door with a candle, and I saw this prisoner, and I called to him, and he had a great bundle of cloaths, but I do not know that they were my things; he made no answer then; in half an hour he came, and I told him I was robbed, and he d - ned me, and swore in a most sad manner; I asked him if he knew any thing of my little boy, and he said he had sent him of an errand; I saw nothing, but to the best of my knowledge and opinion, I saw my own yellow gown, I am positive sure that it was my gown.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that you saw your gown in his possession? - To the best of my opinion, it was in that room lapped up in the sheets, there was a sleeve hung out, and I saw a robbin to it, I hallowed to him, but he did not come back, he went on, he was close to me, he was going by the stable door.</p>

               <p>Why did not you lay hold of him? - I was up stairs, and I had no opinion of his robbing me, he was under me, he was on the ground, I was on a flight of stairs; there is a hatch door, and I held down a candle to see who it was, and it was this man, this was four hours after I was robbed, it was nine o'clock, and I was at my own room by four o'clock at the furthest.</p>
               <p>And can you swear, in that situation, that you saw your gown? - To the best of my knowledge it was my gown, I have no other witnesses, I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Council. What is become of your witnesses? - There was a young man that was apprentice to my son-in-law, but they would not let him come; it is seven weeks next Wednesday; I went to Justice Blackborough the day after the robbery, and I did not get a warrant 'till the Friday.</p>
               <p>Was not this man before the Justice on the ninth? - No, Sir, not to my knowledge; it is seven weeks next Wednesday, I am sure it was on a Wednesday in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>When did you go to the Justice's? - On Friday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Is not your name Grey? - No, Sir, my other husband's name was Grey, but he is dead, and I have been married to

             since that; I never was in this court but once, that is above twelve years ago, I have not been lately in this court by the name of Grey, nor as a witness.</p>
               <p>Is Henley alive? - Yes, he does not live with me; I came home a little before four, and from that time I did not go out 'till past nine, then I went into Mr. Wolfe's, the public house, to look for this man, he was there, and sat against the wall.</p>
               <p>Did you charge him then with the robbery? - No, Sir, but I asked him if he knew any thing about it, and he blasphemed most sadly.</p>
               <p>Did you tell this man of the robbery at all, when you went to Wolfe's? - I asked him if he knew what was come of my little boy; I had a suspicion in my conscience that he robbed me, I did not tell him so.</p>
               <p>Why so? - Because I thought he took my things to fetch them back again.</p>
               <p>Then you did not think he robbed you? - Yes, I had a very great suspicion he robbed me.</p>
               <p>When you was in company at the public-house, did you say to him, that you had any suspicion of him? - I asked him why he did not take better care of my things; Mrs. Wolfe was present, and many more people that I do not know; she heard me saying that I had lost all my things.</p>
               <p>When did you see this yellow gown of yours? - On the Wednesday morning I saw it, that I was robbed; I saw it in the possession of this man that same night, I saw him go out with a bundle of clothes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140070"/> and afterwards I saw him at the public-house.</p>
               <p>How came you not to charge him with it then? - I went up to this house in a little space of time after, he was sitting; and I asked him, did you see my little boy; he damned me, I told him, O William, I am robbed of every thing in the world.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did not you charge him with it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How long after did you take out a warrant? - On Friday from Justice Blackborough's, he was taken up on the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Was not the reason that you did not take him up before, because you and your friends,

               <p>Had you any conversation with them about it? - I asked them to go with me before the Justice, I went to no ale-house; I met them in the street.</p>
               <p>Where did you talk together before you went to the Justice? - In the street, going along I told them I was going to the Justice, against a man that robbed me.</p>

               <p>You swear that you was not at Bagster's, that keeps the Sun in Turnmill-street, that morning before you went to the Justice's? - No, I was at the Justice's before, and got a warrant.</p>
               <p>When was you at the Sun in Turnmill-street, with these two people? - The Saturday after I was robbed; the man was taken up long before that, and gone down to the Justice's.</p>

               <p>What age are you? - About eighteen, I live in Mint-street, No. 14, with Mr. Millington; this woman brought me up when I was a child; my master is the son-in-law of this woman, he maried her daughter.</p>
               <p>Who brought you here to-day? - Mr. Russel.</p>
               <p>Who is Mr. Russel? - A coachman in Robinhood yard.</p>
               <p>Who applied to you to come here? - He, himself.</p>
               <p>What connection has he with the prosecutrix or the prisoner? - He came to me, and told me I was to come here and speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Then take care you do? - I know nothing at all about it, she brought down a summons to me at night, on Tuesday night, which Lord Mayor's day was on Wednesday, and told me I must come to her house to breakfast on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>What summons did she bring you? - A summons from Justice Blackborough.</p>
               <p>Did you go? - Yes, I went, then we had a breakfast; then she sent me out for a quartern of gin, I drank a part of it with her, then she got ready to go away; and going down Saffron-hill we had part of another quartern; and when we had done there, we went to Turnmill-street, to Mr. Chambers, and there we had another quartern; and with that she told me I was to take this false oath, to say that I saw this young man take these clothes, in a sheet under his arm.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did she tell you to say so? - Yes, your Worship, she did.</p>
               <p>What else did she tell you to swear? - To swear that I saw him take them out of a white sheet, and take them up to the stable that was in the corner; she said to take that oath before the Justice, and that would commit him to gaol.</p>
               <p>Did she bid you say nothing else? - No, she told me to stand to that.</p>
               <p>Was that all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself again as well as you can, whether she told you any thing else? - No, she told me nothing else that I can remember, but I was very much in liquor when I came away from the Justice's; that I could hardly tell what I said, or did.</p>
               <p>Who was present when this conversation passed? - Nobody, but herself, and me.</p>
               <p>Where was Mr. Chambers? - He was not come into the room at that time.</p>
               <p>How came she to pick you out for this particular business? - Because she thought I was one that she reared up, and she thought I would do, or swear any thing in the world for her; and she took it upon that circumstance, she thought I would swear any thing for her.</p>
               <p>Had you been at her place the day that she lost her things, at all? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath you had not? - Upon my oath I had not.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - I am certain sure of that.</p>
               <p>Did you never tell her that you had, before this time? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>You never told her that you had been there, or had seen any thing about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, young man? - Upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body here from Mr. Blackborough's?</p>
               <p>(Mr. Blackborough's clerk was sent for.)</p>
               <p>Hancock. I really ask the Court's pardon with all my heart for what I have done, and will never do the like again; but it was very wrong in her to take an apprentice, and one that hardly knows a letter in a book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. If there is any doubt about the case, I will call two witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Hancock. Did your master keep you at home? - He could not spare me.</p>
               <p>Court. Is any body here from Mr. Blackborough's, this is a very black business on the one side or on the other, and I am determined to get to the bottom of it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Was Chambers there? - Yes, he was concerned in the business, he was concerned for this, he came with them, and was with them I believe before they came in.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not think the boy was drunk? - I do not think he was, he did not seem drunk, I never saw him till he was brought in by Mr. Chambers and the woman, I never saw the woman before I went with her to serve a warrant on the prisoner, my reason for saying he was instructed is, I thought there was some people with them that might give them a little education, you know as well as I do, I do not like to mention people's names, but I thought so I assure you.</p>
               <p>You thought this woman had got into bad hands in plain English? - I thought she had got into hands that would give her a good lesson; but this I am sure, the place where Hancock said he saw the man, it is impossible he should see the lock broke off, for it is in a hay loft, and you are obliged to look down, he said he had been in sleep in this hay loft or straw loft, but they are obliged to stand and look as if they were looking underneath this desk, it is a place so dark, in my opinion, that it is impossible to see the door without leaning over.</p>
               <p>Could he, in the hay loft, see the door without leaning over? - He could not, I am sure of that, because I was in the hay loft, it is the same as standing at this bench and leaning over to look under it; at the time he was examined I think, to the best of my remembrance, it was said, that it was a thing impossible that a man could see the lock brok open with a knife or any thing of that kind.</p>

               <p>Did he make use of any improper language to her? - None at all, he never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140073"/> spoke to her nor she to him, I know the old woman by living in the yard, it is an open yard, the prisoner is a very good honest man, I never knew any harm of him, he has used my house every day for three years, breakfast, dinner, and supper; the prosecutrix on the evening complained of being robbed, she said nothing to this man nor he to her, she said she had been robbed, somebody had broke open her door, and taken a great quantity of things, she run on with a great deal of it; I am sure that day she came to complain at my house, the prisoner came in at a quarter before two, and did not go out till five.</p>

               <p>Do you remember Hancock's coming to your office to be examined? - Yes, my Lord, it was on Lord-Mayor's day I believe; this information was taken by me from his mouth.</p>
               <p>What situation did he appear to be in, drunk or sober? - The time I examined him he appeared to have a good deal of terror upon him, and sweat very much, and as he signed his name he could scarcely do it, he shook in such a manner.</p>
               <p>Did he appear drunk or sober? - I believe he was perfectly sober, I think so.</p>
               <p>Who was with him when he was examined? - Mrs. Henley and young Mr. Chambers, and I think Mr. Hacking was in the office at the same time.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of paying any attention to him before he was examined? - No, my Lord, I had not.</p>
               <p>You did not observe whether he conversed with her? - No.</p>
               <p>On the first examination of Till, this lad was never mentioned by the woman? - I cannot tell when the first examination was, I believe it might be on Friday the 4th of November, nothing was mentioned of this lad then, the constable brought the prisoner on a warrant, and she seemed to have so good an opinion of him, that she desired he might go; two or three days after he came himself, he was at liberty.</p>
               <p>When was the first mention of this lad? - On the second time that he came.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the prosecutrix withdraw out of court.</p>
               <p>Lavender. The first time that she came, Mr. Blackborough told her that unless she had more evidence than what she had related herself, he could not think of committing him; when she came again she was attended by Mr. Chambers and Hacking, then she said she had this Hancock, who could prove that he saw him take the things and break open the door, and desired Mr. Blackborough to grant a summons, for his master would not let him come without, the summons was granted of course.</p>
               <p>When was that? - I cannot recollect, but I am sure it was a day or two before the second examination.</p>
               <p>Court to Hancock. Where were you, in truth, on the 2d of November, the day this robbery was committed? - I was at home at work, my master was very bad in bed, he could not get out of bed, he is a coach spring maker and tire smith; I was at work that day, on making an axletree; my master has four children, his wife is living; he has another journeyman besides me, his name is Harper, I do not know his other name, but he was not at work with us at that time, we had another man at work with us that day,

             that robbed me, but she said nothing to me that night about my giving evidence at all; she said she suspected Till, and would get a warrant to take him up on suspicion, that was two or three nights before she brought the summons; she came to my master's afterwards, before she brought the summons; she did not speak to me, I was at work, and she did not offer to come into the shop.</p>

               <p>Did you see this lad then? - Yes, and I told my daughter that I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Millington is your son-in-law's name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was Hancock, the boy, present? - Yes, I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Did you say anything to him in particular? - Nothing in particular; but he said, he knew the man that robbed me, a short man that takes care of the cattle, he told me that the day after the robbery, indeed he did.</p>
               <p>Was your daughter present when he told you so? - I cannot tell indeed, I do not know indeed.</p>
               <p>Did you go alone to talk with this lad? - I do not know whether my daughter was within or no.</p>
               <p>Why, you told me this minute, that you told her of the robbery? - I told her of the robbery, and then I think the boy came in out of the shop, and I was crying sadly, he said, what do you cry for, I said, I am robbed of all I have in the world; then says he, I know the man that robbed you.</p>

               <p>He told you who it was then? - Yes, he told me so.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you how he had seen him? - Yes, he did, he told me he was up stairs in the loft.</p>
               <p>Was not your daughter there, or was she gone? - I think she was gone.</p>
               <p>How came she to leave you alone? - I do not know, she had her family to mind.</p>
               <p>Was your son-in-law at home? - No, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>This was before you went to the Justice? - Now, really I do not know, I cannot tell, I do not recollect, I believe it was; I did not go to the Justice till the Friday in the afternoon, this was the Thursday, the day after the robbery; it was the day before I went to the Justice's, and my daughter, Millington's wife, went with me to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Did you tell your daughter what Hancock had said? - I do not know, I was crying, and breaking my heart; I said, I shall be obliged to come to the parish.</p>
               <p>Then do you mean to say that you have any doubt whether you told your daughter, what the boy had said to you? - No, my Lord, I did not, I believe, tell her; I do not think I did, for I had a very great suspicion that he would hide the things, and fetch them back again; I did not tell my daughter what the boy had said that day, I did not mind to tell her of it, I did not indeed think much of it, I was both crying and breaking my heart, I did not think much of it, and I did not know what to tell her, I thought he only took them away to frighten me like, and fetch them back again, I thought all this was a joke.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to be so very uneasy?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140075"/> - Because, I asked him whether he knew anything about my things.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell the Justice of this other witness? - So I did, when I went again.</p>
               <p>Why this was before the first time you went to the Justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not tell him so at first? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>But why not? - I did not think nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Why, the Justice told you he could not commit him without there was more evidence.</p>

               <p>Court. I very much doubt whether this is such an offence as in point of law is called a robbery, therefore my opinion is, that another indictment should be filed against them for a misdemeanor; you might indict them for an assault with intent to rob upon a special count, and another for assaulting and wounding.</p>

               <p>Did they wound you at all? - Yes, across my face, they cut my eye, they cut me across my forehead, and I cut my hand almost off, they cut my throat here, and stabbed me in my breast, then I cried out as hard as I could for assistance, then they made off, and another gentleman came up to me and asked me what was the matter, I was almost killed, bleeding like any thing; they were not pursued and taken immediately, but one of them the week following, and the other the next week.</p>
               <p>They did not take any thing from you at all? - No, they knocked my hat into the dirt, and took my watch almost out, but not quite, they had tried several times at it, the watch was almost drawn out, so that you might see part of the watch, but they did not get it quite away.</p>
               <p>Did they take your hat off? - No, they did not take it away, they were obliged to go away on people coming up.</p>
               <p>Did they take it off your head or knock it off with their blows? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140084"/>Did you know the prisoners before this time at all? - I have seen one of them pass by two or three times, he lives near where I live in Whitecross-street, I cannot say I knew Hooker before, or whether I ever saw him before I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was a fine night, and the lamps were lighted; they took me between two lamps.</p>
               <p>It was not moon-light? - It was quite light, I was with my back just against a lamp, and their faces near a lamp that I could see them very plain, I was within a very few yards of a lamp.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing their faces well? - I had.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing Hooker, who came up the last, distinctly? - Yes, he came up facing the lamp with his face towards me, and gave me a blow on my shoulders.</p>
               <p>In the struggle with Bates had you sufficient possession of yourself to see Hooker so as to know him again? - Yes, I had, and I did know him again, I am very sure these are both the men, I have no doubt of it in the least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, Councel for the Prisoner Bates. The first person that came up to you was the man that you suppose to be Bates? - Yes, it was Bates.</p>
               <p>Before the other man reached you, you had been cut by the cutlass? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You felt at that time the pain in your hand? - No, I felt no pain at all, till I was taken to the surgeon's.</p>
               <p>Before this other man came up, you closed with Bates, and you was struggling with him? - I was in the middle of the street.</p>
               <p>You was struggling with Bates before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When were the two prisoners taken? - Hooker was taken the Saturday following, and to the best of my knowledge, Bates was taken the Wednesday after that.</p>
               <p>Who did you receive the information from, that Hooker was taken? - I gave information against them to the patrols, and after they had taken him, they came and told me, Newman took him; I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>When you gave the information, you did not know the names of these persons? - No, but I gave a description of their persons, and I went to see whether they were the persons I suspected; Hooker was taken on Saturday, and I saw him at Guildhall on Monday, I did not see him before, I knew him directly, before he came near me, he was so perfectly in my knowledge; I first saw Bates at Guildhall the second day after he was taken, I think it was on the Thursday or Friday.</p>
               <p>Did you know him directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you present at Hooker's examination? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did he say anything in his own defence? - I do not recollect, he said, he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Did he say that he could shew where he was that evening? - No, I did not hear, to the best of my knowledge, he said at Guildhall, he could bring somebody to prove where he was that evening.</p>
               <p>He said so, did he? - He said something like it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect that he said where it was that he was? - No, he only said generally, that he would bring somebody to shew where he was.</p>
               <p>Did Bates set up any defence of that kind, when he was examined? - No, he did not; these are the clothes I had on then.</p>

             came into my house, about twenty minutes or a quarter after five, and called for some porter.</p>
               <p>Any body with him? - Not at that time to my recollection, in the course of about half an hour, came in two young men, and a young woman, apparently acquaintances of Hooker's who asked each other how they did when they came in.</p>
               <p>Do you know the name of either of these young men? - I never saw them in my life before.</p>

               <p>How long did Hooker stay in your house? - Till within about five or ten minutes of seven, I am not sure to a few minutes, but I will give you a reason (give me leave to express the matter that happened during this time) after these two young men and the young woman came, they called for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140086"/> some crank, which is gin and water, and not being warm enough, they put it on the bar which belongs to the tap-room grate, where we put a pot or pint of beer to take the chill off; about five minutes after six my wife came into the tap-room, and said she expected her sister, whose name is Foskett, and lives near Covent Garden, to tea, but she said she would go to tea, for it was five minutes past six, and passed the compliment to two or three people that were there, and asked them if they chose to drink a dish of tea; Hooker said, he did not care if he had one, and he went to tea in the parlour with her, and returned in about ten minutes, the parlour joins to the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Did you drink tea with them? - I very seldom drink tea, but I did that afternoon, and saw him in the room.</p>
               <p>Who else drank tea? - No person but my wife and Hooker, I took one dish without sitting down, Hooker and my wife sat down, nobody else, I do not imagine there was any other person in the place; the two young men, and the young woman went out of the tap-room, and came in again in about five minutes, where they were I do not know, that was before Hooker went to tea, that was not when Hooker was at tea; while Hooker was at tea, they were in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Court. What had they with their tea? - Toast, my Lord, that I recollect particularly well, because Mr. Hooker took a piece, and the servant girl that was there was rather jocular with him, and said he would take all the toast.</p>
               <p>Who made the toast? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What had the young men and the young woman while you was drinking this tea? - Nothing but the crank, I saw them have nothing to eat, Hooker was at tea about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What became of him after tea? - He came into the tap-room after he had been in the parlour to tea.</p>
               <p>Did he drink any thing in the tap-room? - He might, I do not remember.</p>
               <p>What time did he go away? - About five minutes before seven, the reckoning was paid, I do not know which paid it.</p>
               <p>Did they go out together? - I do not recollect whether they went out together or not, a neighbour of mine, one Mr. Taylor, a box-maker, was sitting with him, and looked at the clock and said it was almost seven, and he would go home to supper, he sat on the right-hand side of the first box in the tap-room, Hooker sat the right-hand side fronting him.</p>
               <p>You have a dial in the tap-room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he go away first or Hooker and his company? - Our dial was right, it is a good dial, Miller came in about a quarter or twenty minutes after five, Hooker came in before five: Miller had two or three pints of beer, nothing but beer, except some tobacco, I smoaked half a pipe with him and drank with him, nobody else was in that company but Mr. Miller and me, Hooker and these people sat opposite, I do know whether they talked.</p>
               <p>Were there any other companies? - There might be people, but I do not recollect; the box is long, and there is a seat at that end, and a seat by the fire place, Hooker sat at the corner which is at the table: I have known the family of Hooker a great many years, but have only known the prisoner by sight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Your dial was a good going dial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had had no complaints of it that day? - No.</p>
               <p>How far is your house from Well-street? - I suppose it is about a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>From the time that the prisoner Hooker came into your house to the time he went out of it after Mr. Miller, was he absent at all? - He was not absent to my knowledge out of the tap-room, only to go to drink his tea, he might go out for a minute, but nothing more, for I staid in discourse with Miller; Hooker's father is a man of very good character, the son is his <rs id="t17851214-86-deflabel401" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>

II. and Gentlemen, it is a lamentable consideration, that it has been necessary for the legislature of this country, from time to time, to make laws more and more severe, against those persons who openly, and violently resist the laws of their country, and resist them in a manner which calls for resistance again, even to the risque of the lives of the persons employed in collecting his Majesty's revenue: Gentlemen, I am extremely sorry that ever these laws were necessary, I am much more sorry that it has of late been so frequently necessary to call for their execution, it is now come to such a pass, that if the law will not protect the officer, nothing but ill-will, and everlasting battles must ensue, between the officers of the revenue, and those that are concerned in defrauding it: you have heard of many of these affrays, most of them have been attended with bloodshed, and if the laws already enacted are not sufficient, it will become necessary to have recourse to force, and the laws must be put into execution by that which every civilized state would wish to avoid: it is to avoid that horrid alternative, that these prosecutions have been begun against persons acting in this outrageous and tumultuous manner: it is to save the lives of persons of his own description, and hereafter to protect the lives of his Majesty's officers, and to preserve the laws that were originally made, that this prisoner is now brought to the bar: Gentlemen, I do not expect you will convict the prisoner under these laws, unless upon the evidence adduced, he clearly falls within the guilt of breaking those laws: I will state to you very briefly, and very fairly the evidence I have to offer, I will state to you the act of parliament, the meaning and construction of which, in point of law, you will receive from the Bench; you will take this into consideration carefully, together with the facts that will be given in evidence, and coupling the facts with the law, you will decide whether the prisoner falls within it; that is your province; it is mine to state the law, as I humbly conceive it to be: I am instructed that he certainly is guilty of the offence described in the indictment, which is stated as the offence of being tumultuously assembled with others to the number of three or more, armed with offensive weapons for the purpose of rescuing and taking away from the officers of the Excise several goods, the duties of which had not been paid or secured; it is likewise charged not only that he was assembled for that purpose, but that he likewise, with three other persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140093"/> so armed, actually did rescue from the officers of Excise such kind of goods. Gentlemen, the act of parliament of the 19th of the late King, begins with reciting</p>
               <p>"that whereas divers dissolute persons have</p>
               <p>"associated themselves, and entered into</p>
               <p>"confederacies, &amp;c. to the loss of the public</p>
               <p>"revenue, and whereas several several</p>

               <p>"officers of the Excise," &amp;c. for remedy of these evils, it enacts</p>
               <p>"that after the 24th</p>
               <p>"of July, 1746, any persons to the number</p>
               <p>"of three or more, armed with fire arms</p>
               <p>"or other offensive weapons, who shall be</p>
               <p>"aiding or assisting, &amp;c. every such person</p>
               <p>"shall be guilty of felony, without</p>
               <p>"benefit of clergy;" so that you see the offence described in this act of parliament, is that of being assembled to the number of three or more armed with fire arms, and rescuing, or endeavouring to rescue, such goods as are described in the indictment: this being the law, I will now state the facts: it will appear to you, Gentlemen, that on the 24th of April last, one

            , an officer of the Excise, called to his assistance two other officers, named Burdett and Carter, and they planted themselves in an orchard, near to the Roebuck, where the goods were to pass by: Brock remained in the lane, the two others went into the orchard; they had not been long there, before Carter saw two men come out of a cottage that joined the Robuck, and come into the orchard loaded with tubs that were flung in such a manner, as the witnesses will describe, which I understand is the usual way they carry geneva or other liquors, for the convenience of throwing them over horses or over their shoulders; he immediately called out, throw down your tubs; Brock called to them, one of the men run away, and the other attempted to secure them; however, he was more than a match for them, and he escaped, and they secured the two tubs; upon this they went with the two tubs into the lane, and there Carter seeing six or seven men in the lane, he was ordered by Brock, to go and see if they had anything with them; he went, and they had not; he heard a whistle, and coming back from these men he found Brock engaged with eighteen men, of whom the prisoner was at the head, with large sticks, such as the handle of a fork that is used in stables, and hop-poles, and at the head of them, the prisoner, who was at that time levelling a blow at Brock, he did not strike with one hand, but was seen striking at him with both; the prisoner called out, it is Brock and his crew; upon which the officer told them they should not have the tubs, to which the prisoner replied you may be d - d, and swore if they did not leave the tubs, they would murder them; upon this a scuffle ensued, and the officers of Excise found the smugglers were more than a match for them, after considerable struggles, and several blows had been aimed at the officers of Excise by some men, Carter and Brock who had got fire arms with them, told them, that if they did not desist, they must fire, and he said they might fire and be d - d; upon which he gave orders to those men to fire, and that man did fire, which is a strong circumstance to shew how active the prisoner was; the only person wounded by that shot was the prisoner, who will appear to you to have been very much wounded; they at last took the resolution of abandoning the tubs, and only staved one, and tasted it to know what it was, they went away: Gentlemen, this is the evidence; it is necessary first of all, to prove that they were assembled to the number of of three or more; next that they were armed with fire arms, or other offensive weapons; and my Lord will tell you his meaning respecting the words of the act of parliament, concerning offensive weapons, it is impossible to give any definition what should constitute an offensive weapon within this act of parliament; I humbly contend, and, I think, contend with the concurrence of the learned Judges, who have tried these kind of causes, that the meaning is such a kind of instruments as were peculiarly proper for resistance and assault, and such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140094"/> as men engaged in the ordinary business of life, ought not, and would not take along with them, such as they had for the purpose of resistance, such as was proper for it; it seemed to be the unanimous opinion of a learned Judge lately on the Bench, that that was the meaning of this act of parliament; that if a man had but a common walking-stick, or a common whip, such as men ordinarily carry, though he might accidentally, or though they might be made use of to the degree of offence, yet in considering this act of parliament, those were not the kind of weapons, and it was necessary they should be such as were used for the purpose of offence: now, Gentlemen, it will appear that by much the greatest part were armed with what could not be used for any other purpose than offensive weapons, and that the prisoner had himself (though it would have been sufficient if he had been with three other persons at the same time, for I should have thought it would have been carrying it a long way, to have said in such a case, that he himself was not so armed) but he himself had a weapon of the nature which is described; I cannot produce to you the weapon itself, but there will be produced to you, a weapon of the same nature, which the witness had from smugglers, and which is the same sort of weapon used by them: It is not that sort of stick which men usually carry, because the method of using it required two hands to use it: Gentlemen, this will be the evidence that will be laid before you, if the prisoner does fall within the act of parliament, and I prove this case, as I am instructed I shall, it will be your duty to find him guilty: I should be most happy to find these offences were not committed at all, but as they are, I should be happy if the examples made might prevent that dreadful scene which I am affraid will happen, if these laws are not protected: I am sure you will give it that attention you ought to do, I am sure you stand indifferent to both parties, and I am sure to both you will discharge your duty.</p>

             were with me.</p>
               <p>Are they officers too? - One of them was a distiller's assistant at Maidstone, at that time, the other was a person on a visit at my house at the time, an officer's son.</p>
               <p>What happened to you in the course of your duty on that day? - On the 24th of April in the afternoon, they were both at my house, and I requested their assistance to go with me on that day, as I expected some goods would come on the road towards the Roebuck; we arrived in an orchard adjoining the Roebuck about nine at night, Mr. Carter and we were all in the orchard together, Mr. Carter was on that side of the orchard that the Roebuck was on, when he came to the bottom of the orchard he discovered some people, I was at the bottom of the orchard also, and I went to the road, and I heard some people in the road, the orchard was close to the road adjoining, I heard some people in the road, and I thought it was Mr. Carter, which caused me to go into the road, then I heard Mr. Carter say, lay down your tubs, or down with your tubs, at the same time Mr. Carter called out Brock, I was with him as soon as he could speak, and caught a man hold by the collar, who stood near to the tubs.</p>
               <p>How many tubs were there? - Two.</p>
               <p>What are tubs? - They are four gallon casks.</p>
               <p>What sort of appearance have they? - There were sling cords upon them, which is a small cord, a three braided cord to carry these tubs; in the scuffle he broke loose from me, he slipped under the rail,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140095"/> I had hold of his frock, and he being too strong for me, jammed my hand against the rail, and I was obliged to quit my hold; before I heard Carter call out Brock, I heard these people, that I took for Carter.</p>
               <p>Did those persons say or do anything that you mistook for Carter? - Not then, after the man made his escape from me, I took the tubs over into the road, and Mr. Carter immediately followed me; I asked Carter and Burdett to go up the road in search of more goods, and they went up nearer to the Roebuck, and left me with the tubs, and they soon after returned back with some people following them, who swore they should not have the tubs.</p>
               <p>How many people might there be that followed Carter and Burdett when they came down to you, those people that were following them? - Why, there were, I believe, eighteen or twenty, and those persons that were following them at first, there were eight or ten, they increased directly, then I left the tubs ten or a dozen yards off, and joined Carter and Burdett, apprehending that there would be a riot.</p>
               <p>Did you hear anything particular before these people came up to Carter and Burdett? - I heard a noise in a house, it was but a small distance, the Roebuck is by the side of the road.</p>
               <p>Between the time that this man escaped from you, and the coming up of these eighteen or twenty persons, did you hear anything particular that struck you at the time? - I heard somebody say it was Brock and his men.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any further expression, or anything else at the time? - I heard somebody say, it is Brock and his men, d - n their eyes, they shall not have the tubs; when I was in the orchard, I heard somebody make a soft kind of a whistle, and I thought it was Mr. Carter.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after you saw the men, that you heard this whistle? - I had seen nobody when I heard this whistle.</p>
               <p>Then when was it that you heard these expressions? - When they were following Mr. Carter, and coming down the road.</p>
               <p>When these men came up, and you had an opportunity to see them, had they any thing with them? - Great sticks, large sticks.</p>
               <p>What number of them had large sticks? - About five or six, the highest comparison that I can make of the sticks, is I believe, they may be about four or five feet long, and something smaller than a pitchfork shaft.</p>
               <p>What did they then do? - They began to threaten, and swear that we should not have the things, repeating that it was Brock and his men, and d - d their eyes, that we should not have the tubs; and they d - d their eyes, if they cut them, they would murder them.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of these persons? - I know but one, the prisoner 
               <persName id="t17851214-88-person819">
                  Benjamin

            , he had a large stick, which I fended off with a sword that I had in my hand, it was similar to the fork shaft, I verily believe it was four feet and a half; I warded it off.</p>
               <p>How did he use this stick? - He used it with both his hands, it was a stick of that length that he could not use it with one hand.</p>
               <p>In what manner did he use it? - He struck at me, but I kept it off with my sword, and Mr. Carter he fell upon him very rapidly with a short stick, it might be something bigger than this stick I have in my hand, (a common walking stick); the sticks the other persons had were considerably bigger, after Mr. Carter had knocked him rather down on the side of the bank next the Roebuck orchard, I told him them, if they did not desist we would fire upon them.</p>
               <p>What did you and Carter and Burdett do with the tubs after this? - Spice, after he got up, retreated back in amongst the rest that were behind, and they went into the hop-yard after that, and got some hop-poles, I am not able to say how many.</p>
               <p>How many might they amount to before they retreated into the hop-yard? - I believe there might be about eighteen or twenty, they were all assembled.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140096"/>What number of them were prepared with sticks by such time as these went into the hop-yard? - I believe about five or six, and I heard the others break off the poles to provide themselves with sticks, then we returned back to the tubs in the road, which were not above ten or twelve yards off, I took them up, and I advised Carter and Burdett to stave one of the tubs, as I told them I thought it impracticable to carry them off, and I wanted to see what sort of liquor it was.</p>
               <p>Did you so stave the tubs? - Burdett cut the hoops asunder, and I took hold of the tub, and it ran all down my breeches.</p>
               <p>What was this liquor? - Holland geneva.</p>
               <p>You tasted it? - I did.</p>
               <p>What happened after the staving the tub? - They still pursued upon us very rapidly, and I told them the consequence would be, if they did not desist, I would fire upon them.</p>
               <p>How were they armed then? - With these sticks that they got out of the hop-yard, and those they had before, I believe they all had sticks, I cannot particularly speak to every man.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner among those who so came among you the second time? - He was.</p>
               <p>Did they use any expressions this second time? - They cried we might fire and be d - d, we used every effort to get away before we fired, but we found it impracticable.</p>
               <p>Court. How near might they be to you at this time? - Some of them about a dozen or fourteen yards off, some more.</p>
               <p>What passed afterwards? - They still kept threatening us, I ordered Burdett and Carter to fire.</p>
               <p>How did they threaten you? - Swearing they would be d - d if they would not kill us, and that we should not carry the goods off.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner at the bar use any of those expressions that you speak of? - I cannot say whether he did at that time, it appeared to be all in one voice, and they all joined, we could not distinguish one man from another, but the first time Spicer said himself we should not have it, he said he would be d - d if we should take off the goods, that was at the first time; judging it impracticable to get away, I ordered Carter and Burdett to turn about and fire upon them.</p>
               <p>Were they following you at the time you were running in the manner you describe? - Yes; accordingly they both fired at them with pistols.</p>
               <p>What was the consequence of this firing? - They did not seem to stop, they still pursued us, and Carter called out to me why do not you fire? and I immediately fired.</p>
               <p>What was the effect of your firing? - The effect of my firing seemed to stop them, I heard somebody cry out when I fired; I cannot pretend to say who it was; I have heard since that when I fired, I shot Spice, then we all three made our escape, and they kept throwing their sticks at us.</p>
               <p>How soon after this did you see the prisoner? - The next day.</p>

             there? - I cannot speak to him, I only knew the prisoner at the bar, I saw the prisoner the day after at the Roebuck; there were some people in the house and they exclaimed against me for my cruelty for shooting, and Spice himself complained and shewed me his wound.</p>
               <p>Where was that wound? - Somewhere about the lower part of his belly, it appeared to be a side shot.</p>
               <p>What it had slanted along the lower part of the belly? - Yes, he told me he was shot in the foot too, but I did not see that, he was set on a bench easing his foot, and at that time I gave him sixpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. What sort of a night was this? - Rather cloudy, the moon was at full.</p>
               <p>Five or six persons when you firs t saw the body had sticks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of sticks, were not some of them common walking sticks? - I never saw farmers walk with such sticks to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140097"/>Had you an opportunity in the darkness of the night and the violence of the affray to make the distinction? - I do not remember that ever I saw a farmer walk with such sticks.</p>
               <p>Were the whole of the five or or six like the stick that is to be produced? - I think so.</p>
               <p>The retiring into the hop-ground and getting the hop-poles was a conclusion of the same business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was at that time in the service of the revenue? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon after was you discharged? - In July.</p>
               <p>Upon what account pray? - Why I was discharged when the act took place, the act for staving of liquors, there were no goods sold to produce any money for the officers, and those that were at great expences, as I was, were very much distressed, and necessity, which was the mother of all inventions, obliged me to part with some part of the goods, which I ought to have staved, and for that I was discharged.</p>


               <p>Now this is a very moderate way of stating that you had defrauded the Revenue? - I had no orders to stave the goods, although the provision of the act is, that they should be staved, they are not staved.</p>
               <p>It was for bad practices in your duty as an officer.</p>
               <p>Court. He has told you the fact.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards was you restored? - I have not been restored.</p>
               <p>Did you not apply to be restored on convicting this prisoner? - I never did any such thing, nor never made any application, if I can get any employment in the Revenue, I shall be very happy to have it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you hope it? - I cannot foresee.</p>
               <p>I ask you what you expect and hope? - I believe this, whether he is cast or whether he is not, that neither one thing nor the other will be in favour of me.</p>
               <p>Did not you give the information in hopes of being restored to your office? - I gave the information the day after the transaction, before I was discharged; I acquainted my supervisor with it that very night.</p>
               <p>Did you charge the prisoner by name on that very day? - I did not, I did not know the prisoner's name although I knew his person, I only knew him by living with a miller.</p>
               <p>How soon did you acquire the pleasure of knowing his name? - The day but one after, it might be two days, I told the supervisor about two or three days after, I told him I knew he was a servant to a miller.</p>
               <p>You had learned his name then? - As soon as ever I had learned his name I acquainted the supervisor, when I first told my story I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>These men were engaged in battle with you who had a superior force? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any of these people attempt to lay hold of the goods? - I did not see them.</p>
               <p>They were beating you, but not attempting to lay hold of the goods? - I did not see them at all lay hold of the goods themselves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you describe this man to your supervisor the next day as well as you could, that is, that he was a miller's servant? - I gave all the information that lay in my power.</p>
               <p>Then as soon as you learned his name, you communicated that also? - Yes, the board was acquainted with it in the course of three or four days.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to fear you should be dismissed at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. There is an act of parliament that gave to the officers an half of all that was seized, and last session but one an act passed, that all the spirits which the officers were entitled to, should be staved after condemnation, the act has not been hitherto executed, but the officers have hitherto been kept out of any reward at all.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of having them staved? - To prevent the introduction of foreign spirits, and to encourage real ones; not one seizing officer has got any thing this year and a half.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140098"/>Mr. Garrow. I wish the jury to recollect that this man, for offending an act of parliament, and a very modern one, was turned out of his office.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was on a visit to Mr. Brock in April last, at his house, I am an officer's son, not an officer; on the 24th of April last, we went to the bottom of the orchard, and when we came to the cottage house I heard Carter say, down with your tubs, I directly retreated to the bottom of the orchard, I saw Carter and Brock have hold of a man, and Brock came back and said, there are some more men in the road, Carter and me went up to the Roebuck and turned back, and a man followed Carter and us, some blows passed between Carter and Brock and the man got away into the road, I did not rightly see him, then we went into the road, and Carter and I directly went up towards the Roebuck, thinking to meet more as we saw some men up the road, I cannot tell the number that were there then, more gathered together after to the amount of eighteen or twenty, a man followed Mr. Carter and I down, he swore we should not have the tubs, I cannot tell who he was, there were more men behind him that were up the road, some blows passed between Carter and the foremost man, and then they directly cried out, it is only Brock and his men, and they directly jumped into a hop-garden and broke down the poles, and came over into the road again.</p>
               <p>Had these people you saw when you first went up, or had they not any sticks before they went into the orchard? - They had sticks, very large sticks, such as the footpads walk with.</p>
               <p>What size might they be? - About the bigness of a fork stave.</p>
               <p>Do you know how many people you saw at first? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Were there more than three? - Yes, six or seven.</p>
               <p>How many of these six or seven were armed with sticks? - I cannot tell, more than three or four had sticks, one man came rather before the rest, swearing we should not have the tubs; and he struck with a stick at Mr. Carter, and Mr. Brock; and Mr. Carter knocked that man down, whoever he was, on the bank; I did not know any of the men, I was quite a stranger to the country; after that they said it was only Brock with his men.</p>
               <p>What did they do then? - They went into the hop-yard for the poles, then they came into the road again, and cried d - n their eyes murder them; and then Brock said he would fire on them, and they said, fire on, and be d - d; directly Mr. Brock ordered to fire, and we did fire; my pistols were loaded with slugs, and the others with balls, and they cried fire on, and be d - d; after that Mr. Brock turned and fired his pistol, then we were forced to retreat, and they threw their sticks at us, and one of them hit me on the arm and leg.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There had been a scuffle between the officers and men, who were carrying the casks? - Yes, when I came down, that was in the orchard of the Roebuck.</p>
               <p>How many yards off the house? - About ten or twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Did you make a great deal of bustle in that scuffle? - No, not much, I was not down at first; I heard Carter say, down with your tubs.</p>

               <p>(Produces a stick five feet in length, and about four inches round, with a spike at the end.)</p>
               <p>Were the sticks of this size? - Yes, similar to that.</p>
               <p>You will not swear they had spikes? - I cannot possibly swear to the spikes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140099"/>In what manner was he striking? - With both hands, when I closed in upon him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was the man? - Yes, I know the man perfectly well, he was by himself at that present time, but there were some more coming down the road, they swore at us pretty roundly, they d - d my eyes and limbs, and said I should not have the goods.</p>
               <p>What were the goods? - Tubs, one with Hollands geneva.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is my duty to submit to your Lordship, that the prisoner ought not to be called on for any defence. The first Count in the indictment states, that the prisoners, together with other persons, to the number of three or more, did assemble themselves together, with intent to rescue the goods, and that being assembled, they did rescue; now every other assembling, except that with intent to rescue the goods, I take to be clearly bad; the first objection I would make to your Lordship is, that there is no proof in this case, of that which is a necessary ingredient in it, namely, assembling with intent to rescue; I state the authority of Mr. Baron Eyre, who laid down this law, that though it appeared that the parties did assemble, if they came together without a preconcerted design, that would not satisfy that indictment; now here it is manifest that these men, of whom the prisoner is taken to be one, were drawn out of some place at which they were not assembled with any such preconcerted design or intent: in the two other counts, they have not charged any assembling with such intention: I have another objection still less capable of answer; this charge is not for assaulting revenue officers in the discharge of their duty, this is a charge of assembling with an intent to be assisting in the rescuing of goods, and assisting in that rescue, and in every count of it, it goes on to state this, which the act of parliament renders indispensably necessary</p>
               <p>"uncustomed goods liable</p>
               <p>"to pay duties, &amp;c." I ask with great deference, what proof there is of this fact? it is not because some liquors are carrying, upon which perhaps the duties were paid, and carrying without permit; that will not satisfy this act of parliament; but the Crown must prove to the satisfaction of the Jury, that these goods neither had paid the duties, nor have the duties been paid: in all the cases hitherto, there has been a sentence of the condemnation from the Exchequer, wherever we have been called upon for a defence: you must be satisfied plainly and indisputably; it is clear from the nature of the thing, the defendant is supposed not to be one of the persons carrying the goods, but he is supposed to be one of the persons coming in for the purpose of the rescue; perhaps it may be said, you are calling for what is impossible; to this I answer, that if the officers had acted with that firmness, which the law presumes he will act, backed by that force which the law calls into his aid, these goods might have been stopped and condemned, and the proof of that condemnation ready; but standing as this case does, the act of parliament requiring, and the indictment alledging, that they must be uncustomed goods, I submit it is impossible that the indictment should be supported: in the other two counts, it is not laid to be with intent to rescue.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. I submit this is a case to be left to the Jury, on the first point, the first part of the act is, if any person shall be aiding or assisting, in the rescuing and taking goods, or in case any person so armed as aforesaid, shall be aiding and assisting, therefore it is first charged that they assembled in order to be so aiding and assisting; then the second count is, that being so armed, they assembled for so doing; then the third count is, that they did so; now Mr. Garrow says, these persons were not assembled with that view, but that accidentally they did it; it is to be sure a matter of fact for the Jury, whether two men with these goods, which afterwards proved to be Hollands geneva, which goods are afterwards taken from them by the officers of Excise, there being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140100"/> some whistle immediately afterwards, and more people made their appearance, six or seven men with the prisoner at their head, and crying out it is Brock and his men; and swearing by God, they would have the goods; if that is not evidence to be left to the Jury, I profess I do not know what is; I think it is very strong evidence; then with respect to the other point, it is astonishing it should be said, that in all cases, we must prove the condemnation: why, if the goods are rescued, you cannot prove the condemnation, wherever they can be condemned we would recur to it: the evidence is, here were two tubs, that they found it not in their power to rescue from the Excise officers, and that they destroyed one in order to taste it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. Mr. Garrow has taken two objections to the first count of this indictment, and a general objection to the second and third count; first he says, it will be necessary in order to convict the prisoner, that this assembling together must appear to be with intent or in order to rescue the goods; he thinks there is not sufficient evidence of intention; I admit his law that there must be sufficient evidence, but it is to be left to the jury whether there is such intention: now it does not appear to me to be casual meeting, but it must now be left to the consideration of the jury, whether under all the circumstances of the case, they should or should not be of opinion that this was for the purpose of rescuing the goods: now from the number of people, the arms they made use of, their threats, their execrations on the subject, that is a matter to be left to the jury, whether they did assemble to rescue these goods, agreeing with his law, that there must be proof of assembling to rescue these goods; again he says, there is no proof of their being uncustomed goods, there could be no condemnation, you cannot be put upon that cannot be given: as to the other point, I think that is to be left to the Jury, how far these appear to be uncustomed goods, for which no duties were to be paid; for you see these are the sort of tubs used by smugglers; therefore I leave it to the Jury.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Have you been in Court all the time? - No, just now called in: I live at Maidstone, I keep the Roebuck, which is almost a quarter of a mile from the town, I remember Spice being at my house on the 24th of April, between the hours of seven and eleven.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In what condition was he as to dress? - I do not remember particularly, he was in a riding frock.</p>
               <p>What was he doing in the house before he went out? - Nothing, Sir, he was sitting by the fire.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the time that he went out? - Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>What took him out? - Hearing a noise.</p>
               <p>Did you hear a noise? - Yes, he went out, I saw him go out.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing in his hands? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Had he such a stick as this in his hand? - No, Sir, he had nothing at all, I saw him get out of the chair, and go out.</p>
               <p>Had he boots on? - He had half boots on, I saw him sit by the fire before he went out, with his boots unlaced, he lodged at our house almost twelve months.</p>
               <p>What time does he usually go to bed? - About ten.</p>
               <p>Was there anything particular that kept him up later than usual? - I had been up at the town, and I had carried away the key of the wicket, which led to his room, he seemed when I came back, as if he was rather sleepy, I came home near ten, we heard a noise, and went out after it, we went as far as the door, and we heard the report of a pistol, that very much alarmed me indeed, and in less than five minutes

               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Martin, and was so on the day that Spice was shot; in the course of that evening, he came in very early, and enquired for the key of the wicket to go to bed, I went to look for it, but my mistress was gone to town, and she took it with her, he continued till my mistress came home, and went into the bar-room with some other company; I was alarmed at some noise in the road, and I went out, and he went after me, it was some time after my mistress came in, and I was met by Mr.

            , the prisoner had unlaced his half boots, and pulled his garters off; when Brock came to the door, he shoved me on the left shoulder with one hand, and hit me on the left shoulder with a sword, and said, d - n your eyes come out, he then took his hand off my shoulder, and forced open the door, he set one one foot in, and said, d - n your eyes come out; Spice was in the passage at the time; then Brock run out and Spice followed him, I was sitting on the steps at the same time.</p>

               <p>Had Spice any stick in his hand when he went out? - He had no weapon when he went out, nor yet when he came in; he went out with his garters in his hand and his boots unlaced, and in less then three minutes, I saw the flash of three pistols, and in three minutes after I heard no noise.</p>
               <p>Did any number of people go out with them? - None went out with them, but the gentlemen that were there were going out, but returned back at the hearing of pistols; he said, he fancied he was done, and I asked him what was the matter, and he said he was shot, when he pulled up his shirt, I saw a piece shot off his belly, he said that was not of much consequence, then he took off his shoe, and took out the ball.</p>
               <p>If this man had been able to have got to his bed, do you upon your oath, believe he would have been in his bed before this time? - I do.</p>
               <p>Could he get over the wicket? - He could not if he had tried, the next morning I saw Mr. Brock and two more, they gave him some liquor, and gave me some, somebody in the room said, there is a poor young fellow, Mr. Brock, are not you sorry, to which the words he made use of were, d - n my eyes, people would never have broils, if they did not buy them.</p>
               <p>Court. How comes this man not to be tried before, when the matter happened so long ago as April last.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. These are always reported to the Board of Excise, they report a case, and they state it, and these are indictments that I should be very sorry to bring, without they are very well considered, and it is not always determined to prosecute capitally.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When was the prisoner taken into custody? - In September.</p>
               <p>Did he continue to lodge in the same place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. You see we are in a case where a man's life is at stake, and wounded in the belly and in the foot, and what this man has already suffered, all circumstances considered, I own I should recommend<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140104"/> it to the crown to consent to his acquittal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Then I am sure I shall, if your Lordship thinks that public justice will be answered, and that the circumstances of this case, considering what he has suffered, and the behaviour of the officer after, will prevent a repetition of this offence, I had much rather than by the execution of the man; I have brought him here only for the sake of putting a stop to these practices for the future, I am sure I shall be much better satisfied if it may be only understood, let it be well understood before this is given up, that the law is not such a law as never can or will be executed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Hotham. There is nobody, Mr. Attorney General, who has heard any thing of these trials, but must feel for your situation; I think you have given every satisfaction and every honourable answer to the delay that arises in these cases, but the fact is, that it is of the utmost necessity that these crimes should be punished where a proper subject should be found, so it is for the honour of the crown that when it turns out that the prisoner is not a fit subject of severity, that the prosecution should be given up.</p>
               <p>Court. It is consented, under all the circumstances of this case, not to throw it out to the world that these are not proper prosecutions, but the Attorney General, on the part of the crown, has consented to his acquittal.</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice WILLES.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You are acquitted, not because you are not guilty of the offence charged, but the crown out of that lenity and moderation, which has always honoured them, have consented to your acquittal; but at the same time you ought to return to your country, and follow your honest trade with industry and attention, and endeavour to avoid these practices yourself for the future, and also endeavour to persuade your fellow countrymen to avoid the same by your example, as it will not only bring yourself but them into ruin and disgrace.</p>

               <p>I am a clerk to Mr. Le Mesurier, coming to the compting-house at my usual time, about four o'clock, I saw a man in the passage taking down the lamp, I had no suspicion he was a thief, I did not take particular notice of him, I passed by and went to the compting-house about my business, I did not ask any questions, I know nothing further.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man again? - No, it was rather dark and I could not distinguish the man, I thought it was somebody taking it down to mend or clean it, there was another clerk in the house, and the maid.</p>
               <p>How did the man get in? - The street door which goes to the compting-house is always open.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday evening, about half past three or four, I was coming from Shoreditch, I had been to see an old shopmate of mine, and coming through a passage near Wood-street, a man was running in a white coat, on his seeing me a man laid down the lamp upon some dirt, it is true that I suspected it to be stolen, and that gentleman, the clerk, he declared before the Alderman that it was a man in a white coat genteely dressed that he saw take the lamp, and he said I was not the person.</p>
               <p>Court to Lewis. What time did the prisoner bring the lamp to your house? - At a little after four.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Rouviere the question.</p>
               <p>Rouviere. The man that I saw taking down the lamp had on a light-coloured coat, and appeared to me rather taller than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to Lewis. What cloaths had the prisoner on when he came to you? - The same he has on now, a dark-coloured cloth coat.</p>
               <p>Court to Rouviere. Can you say with any degree of certainty whether the man you saw was or was not the prisoner? - He was not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have one more thing to say, with your permission, when Mr. Lewis sent his servant to Mrs. Philips, I followed the servant two or three minutes after, and I left the servant at Mrs. Philips's, and returned to Mr. Lewis, to desire I might have the property since there was no owner to it, and I had not stole it.</p>
               <p>Court to Lewis. If I understand you, your servant and him went together? - He followed my servant, and came back by himself directly, when he came back, he said the lamp was his property, and if I did not pay him the seven shillings and sixpence, he would take it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. How came you to contrive this false story? - I beg your pardon, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Rouviere. You did not see any other person, but the one that was taking down the lamp in the passage? - I did not.</p>
               <p>And you rather think that the person that was taking down the lamp, was not the prisoner? - I do.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the prisoner tells these different stories, none of which are supported by evidence, and they seem to leave little or no doubt whether he came honestly by it, but the question is, whether he has committed the fact mentioned in the indictment, he is charged with stealing it, but yet if he stole it, he must be actually present at the time; for if he received it from the person that stole it afterwards, though guilty, he is not guilty of the crime charged in this indictment; now Mr. Rouviere saw the person take down the lamp, whoever that person was, that was the person that stole it; I am affraid therefore, that you have no evidence that he was the man that committed the fact, though he came dishonestly by this lamp.</p>

               <p>Did he say any thing to you about your own money? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the attempt to rob you seemed to be over before he asked you that; did he do any thing with the cutlass before he rifled your pockets? - No.</p>
               <p>After he struck you with the cutlass he made no more attempts to rob you, but asked you about Mr. Bethell's house? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did he come up to you with the cutlass drawn? - I never saw it till he struck me.</p>

               <p>Did they come up to you afterwards when the other man knocked you down? - The one knocked me down and the other came up to me directly.</p>
               <p>Were they pretty close together? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did they appear to be of the same company and of the same design? - Yes, this man came up immediately to rifle my pockets after the other had knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Did this man say any thing to you about your money before he struck you? - No, they both of them asked me for my money before I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say about your money? - He said d - n you, you rascal, I want your money, that was before he struck me, I said I was a poor labouring man, he made no answer but searched my pockets immediately, he struck me before ever he talked of stabbing me.</p>
               <p>Court. After he struck you the first time with the cutlass was there any thing said by either of them about having any money from you? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman of Clerkenwell parish, about six o'clock in the morning, after crying the hour in White-lion-row, going to the back road, Islington, where I likewise cry the hour, in crossing the fields near the sheep-pens, I picked up two parcels, one of which upon examination, contained<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140114"/> a quantity of callico, the other a quantity of linen and cotton, but the quantity of either I do not know; unacquainted with the strict duty of my office, I took them to my lodging, instead of, as I since learned I should have done, carrying them to the watch-house; they remained about three weeks in the custody of the other prisoner Murphy, we both lodged together; unfortunately not being able to read, I had no possibility of seeing by the newspapers, if they were advertized, but I did all that was in my power, that was making known the circumstance of my having found them, and requested several of my acquaintance to learn if they could, who had lost such property, and if I could find to whom they belonged, upon due proof of the property, I would deliver them up: three weeks hav- elapsed, and no claimant, I was persuaded and thought myself warranted to dispose of them, which I did from no idea of guilt whatever; when the constables came to me, enquiring if I had found such property, I readily told them I did, and that what remained undisposed of I would give up to them, with the duplicates and pawnbrokers directions for such parts as were pledged: I have always supported a good character as a labouring man.</p>
               <p>PRISONER MURPHY'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This prisoner lodged in my place, I have three fatherless children, he was recommended to me as an honest man, I was not able to pay the rent myself, but how he came by the things I do not know; what things they were, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Tring. I found the duplicates in her pocket.</p>

               <p>Oh, then you have been tried here besides? - I was tried without doubt in this place, and was acquitted; the person that prosecuted me about that was the boy's father.</p>

               <p>No, I mean then. - I believe that was four or five years ago.</p>

               <p>What else was taken from him? - I could not see any thing else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long might they be there? - A very short time.</p>
               <p>Did you see them do any thing besides take the watch? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Had they time to take any thing but the watch? - Yes, they had, we were both together, I saw them have their hands in his pocket, but I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Can you describe the time at all? - No, I cannot, it was in the Park.</p>
               <p>Could you see the face of Smith? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him before? - Never, I never saw him before, I could not distinguish the colour of his dress.</p>
               <p>Had he a hat on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A round hat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might they be there altogether? - I cannot tell how long.</p>
               <p>Can you make a guess? - I cannot.</p>

               <p>Were they there a minute? - I suppose they were, I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>Now, can you safely venture to swear to the man's face by star light, no lamp nor other light, and with a round hat on, who was not with you above a minute? - When I went to Sir Sampson's, I said, Smith was the man.</p>
               <p>Was it a metal watch? - I take it to be silver, it was light enough to see it was silver.</p>
               <p>O, I forgot, how long have you been acquainted with Mr. Atwell? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>So you are a young gentleman living upon your personal fortune? - I must live by what I work for.</p>
               <p>That comes to the same thing in your way of trade; you was taking an airing in the Park in the evening? - I was going through the Park, I was going to St. James's.</p>
               <p>You visit at the palace perhaps? - I visit a sister that lives there.</p>
               <p>You was by the pond? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There are some seats there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What they call cooing places, I believe? - I never heard them called so.</p>
               <p>Was it a lady you was going to at the palace? - A young woman a servant.</p>
               <p>Does she paint her face? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140120"/>You had the misfortune to lose a box of paint this night? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that now? - I had a box of lip salve for my sister.</p>
               <p>You are a single man, I think, Mr. Brown? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>How long may you have lodged in Butcher-row? - Not long, I lodged in Oxford-street, at Mr. Ward's, a druggist, before.</p>
               <p>You was coming in from Piccadilly into the Park? - I was, I had been into Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>With whom? - At a public house, I had been drinking tea.</p>


               <p>You never take any more vulgar liquors than tea? - Sometimes.</p>
               <p>What age may you be? - Seventeen last May.</p>
               <p>Is that the way you usually dress? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So Mr. Atwell asked you if you had a key of the park? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So then you entered into a little confab.? - We had no discourse at all only that he wanted the key.</p>
               <p>Are there not lamps at the gates of the park? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>No, why you know the gates of the park, as well as any body knows the pump at Aldgate? - I do not know that there are lamps.</p>
               <p>So you trusted you pretty person in the dark, and made this happy acquaintance? - No happy acquaintance at all.</p>
               <p>Have you enquired at all who he is? - No, Sir, he is nothing to me.</p>
               <p>When did you spend the evening with him last? - I have not spent the evening with him at all, I have not been in the Park since.</p>
               <p>The Park is a good pleasant place in the evenings? - It was not so pleasant to me.</p>
               <p>It was quite light enough to see a man's face? - I was immediately by the man, Smith was robbing me, I do not know that he touched Atwell, I have a letter in my pocket now that came from my uncle, which was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Pray may I ask you, as you have but small wages, though I tell you before hand, you have a right to refuse answering me, how you have supported yourself, what way of living have you had? - I had my money that I took in Bond-street, I lived there near seven months, my wages were small for the place to find every thing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Bottlebold you come here about something called red wood, you know that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was charged also with receiving it, knowing it to be stolen, you know that too; nay, tell us, why you are an honest Jew; what, have you lost your voice? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>You was charged with receiving it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why speak out, it has happened to many of your tribe before? - It never happened to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My objection is, that Mr. Bottlebold being applied to, is to transfer that which is prima facie evidence against him as the thief, and put himself into a less disagreeable situation.</p>
               <p>Court. Having called the two witnesses, they have proved enough of this man's evidence to go to the Jury, for there is no objection to the competency of the accomplice, he is at all times liable to be examined, but the objection is to his credit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There is no evidence at all against Power, for whom I am concerned, therefore your Lordship will not let him say any thing against Power.</p>
               <p>Court. I must hear what he says, but I shall direct the Jury, that what he says against Power alone, is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Where do you live? - I did live in Narrow-street, Ratcliffe.</p>
               <p>On the 17th of September last, did you receive any thing? - Yes, on the 17th day of September, between two and three in the morning,

               <p>Mr. Garrow.

               <p>I am another watchman of this ward; on the 18th of October, between two and three, Commander gave me a signal, and when I came up there were two more of our watchmen and him and me, and we went down to Paul's wharf stairs, and there was some wood laid on shore, and there was a good deal of wood in a boat, and the two prisoners were trying to shove the boat on shore, and we asked them what they were about, they said what was it to us, we were watchmen on land and not by water; and I left them there and went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140129"/> fetch the patrol, and when he came he was as ignorant of the affair as ourselves, he sent for the constable; Young was one of the men, and he said the wood belonged to one Mr. Harrison, of Spittalfields, who was coming there with his cart for it; there was a cart drove along Thames-street to the end of Paul's wharf, and some men came down, and Young asked them if Mr. Harrison was coming, and one man said he was, and another man said, what Mr. Harrison? then he said he was coming; that man not knowing the name of Harrison gave us a suspicion, then Young said we will go and get something to drink, and Power came back and followed them, and Young said they may keep the wood and be d - d, it will not fetch them above three shillings, they will not let a man get a shilling, I know both the prisoners, they were both the men that were there; Young took up one of his sculls and said he knew him very well, and he would take the number of his head wherever he met him, and he said, d - n you, I wish this was a pistol, I would blow your brains out, they pushed off their boat, and away they went, and we took the wood to the watch-house, here is some of the wood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wisset. This is sapen-wood, which is worth fifty-eight shillings per hundred, a very small quantity was sold at the sale, being a new article.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long might all this conversation take up? - About an hour.</p>
               <p>What all you watchmen left your stands to hold this conversation, which has been told here in two minutes, and it took up an hour; was you acquainted with Power before? - No, Sir, I was not.</p>
               <p>This was the 18th of October, when did you see Power again? - I think the 11th of last month, it was three weeks and a few days.</p>
               <p>When did you see him the next time? - At the Justice's, at Shadwell, at the bar with Young.</p>
               <p>They told you that he was one of the parties that had been robbing on the Thames? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not Nicholls tell you so? - I do not know Nicholls.</p>
               <p>How happened it, that you are so much more able to swear to this man, than any body else that was there? - I am here to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>What cause of knowledge have you superior to all the rest of your fellows that were there? - I stood and looked at some wood all the time.</p>
               <p>Do you know that this man's life is at stake? - He was dressed in a brown jacket, and a round hat, it did not flap down much, it was up on the sides, it did not hide his ears nor his eyes; I swear to him by taking notice of him, and when I saw him again, I knew him.</p>
               <p>Had you given any description of him to any body? - No, do not you think I could swear to him as well as I could to Young.</p>
               <p>What reward do the East India Company give upon the conviction of these persons, that are suspected of robbing them? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know what reward is to be got, if these men are cast? - I am not a thief catcher.</p>
               <p>You seem to be a better trade, a thief fixer? - I am sure he is the man, I am quite sure and positive of it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe they were a little angry with you, before the Justice, that you would not be positive to the other? - Who was?</p>
               <p>Was not there a little misunderstanding; - A person asked me whether I did not know him, I said I had not so much conversation with him as with the other.</p>

               <p>He was a little displeased? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Before we read that confession, was any thing said to him, to induce him to confess? - Nothing in the world, from any body living.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know whether Mr. Clark's apprentice had said any thing to him before? - No.</p>
               <p>What is the value of these trees? - They are fan yews, and sold at six shilling or seven shillings a piece, but they are worth three shillings a piece of an average, I think the value about six pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There were several of these trees cut? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the age of the trees? - Some of them are twenty years old.</p>
               <p>Does yew ever grow to timber? - It grows a very large tree.</p>
               <p>Is it a timber tree? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140131"/>Upon your oath, is it not a shrub? - It certainly is, I will answer for it to be a shrub.</p>
               <p>I believe it is a yew tree, do you call a yew tree that is twenty years old, a yew shrub? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Would you call an oak of twenty years growth, if it was put in a shrubbery, a shrub? - No.</p>
               <p>You would however call a yew tree if it found its way into a shrubbery, a shrub? - Yes, if it found its way into a shrubbery.</p>
               <p>Court. I will tell you my idea, I rather think I am correct, I conceive that the description of the act of parliament is meant to comprehend all possible cases; first it discribes the particular species of trees that are usually denominated timber trees, and lest that denomination should not be likely to be compleat, it says, any timber tree, or tree likely to become timber; by the word shrub, I understand that which is of a nature that never would grow to a timber tree; by the word plant, I understand that which is in its infancy, as an oak plant, a beech plant, an elm plant; if they ever would grow up to trees, they are plants; if they would not they are shrubs.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Were these trees spoiled by these sticks being cut out? - They were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They were fan yews? - They were.</p>
               <p>You say yew is not timber? - I do not know that it is.</p>
               <p>If you had found a fan yew, in a church yard, you would call it a tree; if you found it in a shrubbery, you would call it a shrub; now, suppose by accident, you had found a yew tree upon a waste or common, what would you call it there? - There, it might by called a plant.</p>
               <p>Have you any fourth name for it? - I do not know but they may, they certainly are described under all these names, a yew tree, a yew plant, a yew shrub.</p>
               <p>But not at the age of twenty years? - They are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. A shrub is what I understand, to be a tree cut down for gardening.</p>

               <p>I lost a horse in the night between the 3d and 4th of November, a black horse, I had it, I believe, between four and five months, I knew the horse as soon as I saw him, I lost him from my stable, which is distant from my house about twenty or thirty yards, in consequence of being informed the horse was gone, I had two advertisements made out, and sent one to Oxford, and the other to Reading, on the Saturday I had it cried by the common crier, at Wallingford; on Monday following I went to London on private business, not on account of the horse, I had given it over for lost; I went to Bow-street and requested to see the horse, as soon as I saw it, I knew it directly, it was shewn me at a stable near to Bow-street, one of the men belonging to the office shewed it me, I know nothing of the prisoner of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did not you know one of the prisoners before? - I understand there is one of them lived in the town of Wallingford, that is Simmonds, but I did dot know him.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the first examination in Bow-street? - Yes, Sir, he said, he was on Friday, and Saturday, and Sunday, at Wallingford, and he referred us to several persons whom he was shaving, I went down to several persons, and enquired of them, and they said, they had been shaved by him on those days.</p>
               <p>Did you lose a saddle and bridle? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you find the horse with a bridle and a saddle? - The people that took the the horse up, said, there was a saddle and bridle.</p>
               <p>Frewen told you he found the horse on Clapham-common? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That he had found it with a bridle and saddle, and suspected it had thrown its rider, and brought it to town to be owned? - I believe he did, I lost the horse the 4th of November, the next time I saw him was in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court to Carpmeal. What stable was the horse at, it was at one Froome's stable, in Hart-street, I brought the horse there on the 8th of November, on a Tuesday, I brought him from a stable of one Mr. West in White-cross-street.</p>
               <p>Is the horse that Mr. Felwell saw the horse that you brought from West's? - Yes.</p>

               <p>When did he bring him there? - On the 4th day of November, about three in the afternoon; he asked me if I could take care of him, and I said, yes, he begged I would give him a mash, I told him I was very busy and begged he would assist, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140133"/> he staid and assisted to give him a mash, he left him there, and I was admiring the good shape of the horse, and I told him I should like to buy him, if he was for sale.</p>
               <p>What answer did he make to that? - He said, he was not for sale, I more than once told him, I should like to give thirteen guineas for him, which I thought was his full value, he refused it.</p>
               <p>Do you think that was his value? - That was more than the gentleman himself gave for him, as I found since; Frewen came there every morning.</p>
               <p>Where was Frewen when the officer from Bow-street came? - I believe they had got him in custody then.</p>
               <p>Did he at any time say how he came by the horse? - I was under some apprehensions that there was something of a note or money mentioned, as I told the Justice, but I do not distinctly recollect.</p>

               <p>That was when you was convicted, was not it? - Yes, I was convicted, and burnt the hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there is an end of your objection.</p>
               <p>Walmslay. On the 17th of last month I saw Frewen up in Aldersgate-street, he told me he had got a nice horse, I asked him where he had him, he told me he stole him out of a gentleman's stable in the country, I desired him to let me look at him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Short-hand Writer. Did you observe this witness when he was sworn? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg your Lordship will direct this witness to be re-sworn, in order that Mr. Hodgson may see him sworn, that he may be able to prove it on a future day.</p>
               <p>(The witness was re-sworn)</p>

               <p>You asked him if he would let you look at him? - Yes, and he told me if I would come in the morning I should see him, he told me to come up to Simmons's Inn, in Aldersgate-street, which is a china shop, where he lodges, I went there, but he was gone out, and I went down Beech-lane, and at the corner of Beech-lane, I met him and the prisoner

             together, to the best of my remembrance it was the Tuesday after, I first met him on the Monday, I asked him to let me look at him, he told me he durst not let me look at him, for Simmons was come up to give the gentleman information, or to put him in the papers; he told me Simmons had put him up where to get him, and he durst not let me look at him.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by put him up where to get him? - To the stable where he was, I understood him he told him where he was, and he was to take him out of it.</p>
               <p>What that Simmons had told him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was what he told you, was it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then Frewen did not know where he was himself? - He told me not, but the other had told him, he did not know himself, he said, 'till Simmons told him, and he told me; he went and undid the stable door, and took him out.</p>
               <p>When did he say this had happened? - He told me he got him a night or two before, but justly, I cannot say; that Simmons had told him where he was in the country to steal him, and he had gone and undone the stable door, and taken him out, as he told me; I asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140134"/> where the horse was, and he told me, the horse was down in West's stables; we went and had something to drink together, and he told me after that, he and Simmons were going down to the Pitt's Head in the Old Bailey, and I went and told Mr. Carpmeal and Jealous of it; I went to Bow-street, and gave information.</p>
               <p>Then, though this man was afraid to shew you the horse, he was not afraid to tell you he had stole him? - He said that Simmons was come up to sell him; that the gentleman was come to town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you an intimate acquaintance of Frewen's? - Not much acquainted, only drinking with him several times; he told me in Beech-lane, that Simmons was come up, to let him know, that the gentleman was come to town.</p>
               <p>Look towards the Jury, and tell them who you are? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where have you been, since you was convicted here, what have you been doing since? - I have been hard at work, I suppose.</p>
               <p>What sort of work? - Several sorts.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Frewen called two witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

He also takes Trials and Arguments with the utmost Care, which are copied so expeditiously as to be sent home the same Evening, if required.</p>
               <p>Mr. HODGSON (without the smallest Imputation on the Systems of his Cotemporaries, whose Merits he chearfully acknowledges) pledges himself to take nothing for his Transcripts, if any Gentleman who solicits a Cause, or the Council whose Arguments he professes to take, are not compleatly satisfied with his Performances.</p>
