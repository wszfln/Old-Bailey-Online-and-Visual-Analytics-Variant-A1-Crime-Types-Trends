In consequence of information from Wren, I searched round the premises, but found nothing—as I came out I saw Lilley go by in a direction from a field adjoining the premises—I knew him before—I went into the field, and there found some veal secreted in a hole in the grass—I then directed the constable on the beat to watch, and left—I returned about nine o'clock, and he had just appre<lb/>hended Stewart and Lilley; Stewart ran away—I afterwards apprehended him—I took the veal the next day to Mr. White's, the butcher.</p>

I was called by Hitchcock to watch the veal—in about half an hour Lilley and Stewart came into the field, went up to the veal, looked at it, and said it was all right—there was a gas lamp close by—after staying there a few minutes they went away—I remained there watching till a few minutes before nine, when Stewart and Head, and a fourth lad came—they said to each other that they should pick up a b good stone or two, as there might be somebody watching them—I think it was Lilley said that, I am not certain; but when they started to run away, Lilley threw some stones down—Stewart went up to the veal, and as he was in the act of picking it up he caught sight of me—they said something, and all ran off—I pursued them, and overtook Head and Lilley—they said they had not come there to steal it—I took the veal to the station.</p>

               <p>years of age, came to my office in a cab with a little boy—it was a wet morning—the door was open; he was led in by the boy—he appeared to be blind—he was about five feet six inches high—he had a brown coat on, and was rather stout, and had grey hairs—he said he wanted me to apply for 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., money lent to a person named Armstrong, who had been a tenant of his, and his tenancy expired at Michaelmas-day, and a day or two before he had asked him whether he might stay a day or two over, and he had given him permission so to do, and instead of that he had stopped a month or five weeks, and he wished to know whether he could recover rent for that time—I said I would see what I could do for him—I asked him the address—he gave me "Joseph Armstrong, Nine Elms, Wandsworth-road"—I asked his own address, and he pulled a letter out of his pocket, having a post-mark, with the address "Mr. Charles Rowe, 3, Warwick-street, Vauxhall-bridge-road"—I knew that the Mr. Rowe that I had transactions with, had removed—I concluded it was him, and that he had gone there—he also said he had let his house again, and the tenant wanted a lease—he wanted to know what the expense of a lease would be—I told him about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the same day I wrote to Armstrong, making an application for the 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also for the rent—I directed it, "Joseph Armstrong, Nine Elms, Wandsworth-bridge-road"—Rowe had left with the little boy in the cab—on Wednesday, 20th Nov., the prisoner called on me about ten in the morning—he said he came in answer to my letter, and he was very much surprised that Mr. Rowe had consulted a solicitor-about the matter—he said he never disputed owing the 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for money lent, but he objected to pay anything for rent—I insisted on having something for rent, and we had a long discussion—he ultimately agreed to pay half a quarter's rent, which was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that with the 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. made 74<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when he had agreed to that, he said he had deposited some deeds relating to his wife's property with Mr. Rowe, as security for the 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lent, and he should expect those deeds to be given up—I said of course they must, but I could not send down that day for them—he said his wife was on the eve of her confinement, and it would be a great relief to her mind, and to his own, if the matter could be settled that day—I said if he would pay for a messenger, I would send for them—he said he would—I agreed to send a messenger, and he agreed to come at four o'clock, and pay the 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and take the deeds—he went away, and in about half an hour Rowe came in a cab with the same little boy—he still appeared to be blind; he could not find a chair to sit down—I said to him, "I was just going to send to you; I have written a letter to you," and I read it to him—this is it—"Dear Sir, Mr. Armstrong has called on me, and after some conversation, he has agreed to pay the 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and half a quarter's rent; he wishes to have the deeds back that you hold; he has appointed to call at four o'clock and settle; I shall feel obliged if you will call on me at that time with them"—Rowe said he was much pleased that I had got the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the rent; it was more than he expected, and he would give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I would not accept it—I asked him about the deeds—he said, "Yes, there are deeds; I had forgotten them; I have deposited them with a friend of mine for the money; will you give me the money to get them, and I will be with you at three o'clock"—I said, "I don't mind letting you have the money if you will bring the deeds to me at that time"—he said he would do so, and at the same time he said he had</p>

               <p>arranged with his new tenant, and he had agreed to take a lease of the house that Armstrong had left if I would prepare a lease for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I would—he said, "You had better deduct that 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the amount you will have to give me"—I did so, and gave him this check for 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I received it from my bankers as paid—after that I did not see either of the men again—Rowe has not been found—the prisoner was taken, in conse<lb/>quence of a bill that I circulated—I found the next morning that the check had been paid—I believed every word of the statements that Rowe and Armstrong made to me; I could not for some days believe they were false—it was in consequence of believing the statements that I parted with my check.</p>

I was called by a little boy, about ten years old, from Kennington stand—he got into my cab, and ordered me to go towards Camberwell—he said, "There are two gentlemen who want you"—I went and met the prisoner, and an elderly gentleman, shorter than him, who appeared blind—I should say he was upwards of sixty years of age, his hair was grey, and he had grey whiskers—he was a short stoutish man—the prisoner and the old man got into the cab, and ordered me to drive to the Foundling Hospital—I pulled up there, from about half-past ten to eleven o'clock—the little boy had gone with me from Kennington—when I got to the Foundling, a young man came across the road; he said to them in the cab, "What a time you have been!"—some<lb/>thing else passed between them, but I did not understand what the words were—the prisoner then went in the direction of Russell-square—the young man got into the cab, and they ordered me to drive on to the first turning—I drove on to a public-house at the corner of Grenville-street—the old man and the little boy got out and went into the public-house—the young man had left before, but he came back to the public-house—I was paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I remained standing there, and the prisoner came back along Grenville-street—he said to me, "Where is he?"—I said, "They are in the public-house"—I asked him if he would want me again; he said he did not know—he went into the public-house; he did-not remain there many minutes—he came out with the blind gentleman and the boy—the old gentleman then ordered me to go to 6, Berners-street, Russell-square—I said to the prisoner, "What does he say?"—he said, "Go to 6, Berners-street"—the old gentleman and the boy got into the, cab and I drove there—it was about eleven—the blind man and the boy got out and went into the house; they remained there not many minutes—they came out</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Presidents of the Lon<lb/>don district of the Post-office. The prisoner has been employed there about seven years—he was a letter-carrier in the Paddington district—on 22nd Jan. last, I made up three catch letters, addressed "Mr. C. Snewing, 3, Alpha<lb/>place, Regent's-park, London"—I enclosed in one of them a half-crown and two fourpenny-pieces, which I marked—I sealed it, and gave it to Mr. Cole, with instructions to post it with the other two—soon after that, I went to the interior of the Post-office, where I could see letters put into the box</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185102030019"/>
               <p>from outside—I found this letter in the box—I took it out, and kept it till the next morning about seven o'clock, when I tied it up in a bundle of letters addressed to Paddington, the Portland-town district, in which Alpha-place is—the letters are conveyed there from the General Office by a mail-cart to Crawford-street—I saw the bundle placed in the bag, which was tied, sealed, and conveyed to the driver—it was despatched from the office about a quarter-past seven, and would be taken to Craw<lb/>ford-street, from whence it would be carried by a messenger, to the Portland office, Edgware-road—it would be the duty of the prisoner and the other letter-carriers of that district to sort the letters into walks for delivery—this letter ought to have been delivered in Alpha-place before half-past nine, at which time I called at Mr. Snewing's, and did not find it—I found the other two I had sent—I went on to the Paddington office with Mr. Cole, and Peak, the officer—the prisoner was not there—the other letter-carriers came in while I was there; about nine of them were searched without finding the letter—I did not allow any of them to leave, and the prisoner came there about a quarter to eleven—I said to him that there was a money-letter missing, that the others had been searched, and I must see the contents of his pockets—Peak began to search him, and I said, "The letter was addressed 'Mr. Snewing, 3, Alpha-place,' have you seen such a letter?"—he said, "No, I have not"—Peak took off his hat, lifted up the lining, and said, "Here is the letter, Sir"—I took it, and said, "This is my letter"—the prisoner said, "I took it out by mistake, and put it there that I might not forget it"—the seal was not broken then; it has been since, and I found in it the coins I placed there—Alpha<lb/>place was not in the prisoner's delivery—the carriers arrange their letters in streets before they leave the office—if a man found a letter not belong<lb/>ing to his walk, he should hand it over to the other—each man starts as soon as he has arranged his own letters—if the man in whose bundle a letter ought to be, was gone when it was found in another bundle, it would be handed over to the superior charge-taker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am charge-taker at Paddington; it was the prisoner's duty to deliver letters in Park-road, and Avenue-road, Regent's Park. On 23rd Jan. I received the Paddington mail-bag from the mail-driver—I conveyed it to Paddington myself—it was opened there—three bags were taken out of it, which contained letters for the Lira-road, Maida-hill, and Portland-town districts—the letter-carriers then sorted</p>

               <p>them—a letter addressed,"Mr. Snewing, Alpha-place," ought to have been sorted to Frederick Willis, who should have delivered it about nine o'clock, or a few minutes past—this letter may have passed into the prisoner's hands in sorting; if so, he should have handed it to Frederick Willis, and if Willis had gone, to put it on the desk for me—I imagine that he knew that to be his duty—it was against his duty to have taken that letter out of the office, if it had come to his hands—after the letters had been sorted to the carriers, they arrange them in streets, in order for delivery, before they leave the office—Alpha-place is about 250 yards from the prisoner's beat; and as it was so near, it would be his duty, if he had found this letter among his, to have delivered it on his return, and apologized for the delay—it would have been only about five yards out of his way.</p>

I am cashier to Mr. Charles Fox and Mr. Henderson, they are contractors for the Crystal Palace at Hyde Park—they have about 2,400 persons employed there—the prisoner was in their service, but had absented himself from some indisposition—he was time-keeper in the department of the carpenters, under a foreman, named Lovell—the men are paid at the end of the week—the time-keeper makes a sheet, called the time sheet, of the time each person is employed—that is given to me—it shows what each person is entitled to—I deposit the money each person is entitled to, and it is put in a box—the time-keeper makes the sheet for the foreman, and the foreman conveys it to my office—he makes the sheet from the report of the time-keeper—the sheets are sent in on Friday, and the next day the money is allotted—if a man leaves short of a week he is paid for his time immediately—a note is sent for it—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was brought to my office by the prisoner on 2nd Jan. (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Jan. 2, 1851.

                  </hi>. I am a tailor and draper, at 44, Tottenham-court-road, in the parish of St. Pancras; it is my dwelling-house. On Friday, 17th Jan., I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock—I was the last person up, and I secured the house myself—I double-locked the street-door, and left the key in the lock, put up a chain across, and bolted the bottom bolt—in the passage there is a door leading into the shop—I locked it, and had the key upstairs with me—I went into the shop; the goods were all safe on the shelves, and this coat was on the block—I was disturbed between three and four o'clock in the morning, came down, found the street-door shut to, but unlocked; the chain was down, and the bolt drawn back; the door was latched—the door leading from the passage to the shop had been broken open—I saw a quantity of cloth in the passage, packed up, apparently ready to take away; and in my presence a jemmy was found in the kitchen under the water-butt—the cloth had been on the shelves the night before—on looking up the kitchen-chimney, Moran was found with my coat on.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Colonial Training-school, Great Ann-street, Westminster; the prisoners lived there. On 27th Dec, between six and seven in the evening, I was lying down ill in the bed-room, and saw Townley, and Moore who has not been taken, come into the room; they spoke together, but I did not hear what they said—they could have seen me, but they did not look towards me—Moore opened a box belonging to the Institution, in which the clothes are kept, and took out some trowsers, coats, a piece of velvet, a piece of cloth, a waistcoat, and several other articles, and tied them up in a bundle—Townley was talking to him at the time; they then both went out together, Moore carrying the bundle-about five minutes after Timmins came in bringing the same bundle apparently, it was tied in the same handkerchief—he put it down while he opened the window, took it up, and attempted to throw it out, but the noise of the boys running up and down-stairs prevented him—Edes then came in and asked Timmins what he was doing—Timmins said, "Oh, nothing, in</p>

               <p>a minute I will tell you"—Bonifacio, another inmate, then came in and asked them where Townley and Moore were—they said they believed they were in the school-room—that is down-stairs—Bonifacio went down and Edes followed him—Timmins took up the bundle, put it in the cupboard, and followed them—I got up and followed also—I saw the bundle opened in the Governor's parlour, it contained the articles I have mentioned—Timmins and Edes both tried to throw it out of the bed-room window.</p>

I was lying down in the same room as Barham, and saw Townley and Moore come in; they whispered together, went to the box, and Moore took out some property and wrapped it up in a handkerchief—they both left the room, Moore carrying the bundle—a few minutes after that Tim<lb/>mins came in carrying the same handkerchief—it appeared to be the same size and appearance—he put the bundle on the floor, opened the window, took the bundle up again and tried to throw it out, and the boys just outside running up and down prevented him—Edes then came in and spoke to him, but I could not hear what was said—they both looked out of the window together, with the bundle in their hands—they tried to throw it out, and a lad coming up-stairs prevented them, and asked them where Townley and Moore were—Edes then went down-stairs—Timmins had dropped the bundle when the lad came in, and he took it up again and put it into the cupboard at the further end of the room—I afterwards looked out at the window and saw Townley and Moore standing against a wall opposite, and whistling—some one hearing the whistle, ran there; Townley was taken, but Moore escaped—I have no doubt about the prisoners being the persons; plenty of light comes in from the Queen's Stores, opposite.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Islington. I was called to the house by Constable, about half-past five o'clock in the morning—I knew the deceased; I had been attending her professionally, for asthma and difficulty of breathing—her name was Sarah Johnson—she was about sixty-three years old—I had seen her about two o'clock on the day before—she was in feeble health; she suffered principally from debility and cough—I found her dead body in the back-parlour on the ground-floor—that was where the prisoner worked at his trade of a shoemaker—I believe they had a sleeping-room over it—I examined the body; it was warm, but the legs, arms, and face, were cold—I should think she had been dead at least two or three hours; I cannot say exactly—the face was very much swollen and contused; the eyelids swollen and blackened; the whole of the scalp was very much swollen, and the hair, which was long, was matted with blood, so as to prevent my making a minute search—there was a lacerated wound on the angle of the right side of the mouth—the skin was rubbed off the left elbow and both knees—the body laid on the right side, with the legs drawn up—the whole of her face was smeared with blood, and there were splashes of blood on her hands—her left shoe and stocking were off—with that exception, she was perfectly dressed, as for the day—her cap was off, and lying under her head; it was a day-cap—there was a smell of liquor; but whether it arose from the body, or had been spilt on the ground, I do not know—there was a stocking near the fire-place, with a needle in it, as if she had been at work; and a cloak near the head, saturated with blood, as if it had been used to wipe blood up with—I asked the prisoner how it happened—he said she had had a fit; that he heard a noise, as if she was falling about—I told him it was a very suspicious case—he said he was sure he did not do it—I think he said at that time that he had lived with his wife for forty-one years—I had been attending her about ten or twelve days—I had not known her before that—she had not complained to me of liability to fits, nor had I observed any</p>

               <p>tendency to it—I made a post mortem examination of the body next evening, and found a wound on the left; side of the head, two or three inches above the ear—it wounded a branch of the temporal artery—there was great extravasation of blood between the scalp and the skull—there were two ounces of blood under the dura mater, pressing on the brain—that was underneath the wound, which had penetrated completely through the scalp to the bone, and stopped there—the extravasation of blood and the internal congestion were not caused by that wound—the blood effused on the brain came from a rupture of the middle menengeal artery, which was caused by external violence, blows, falls, or kicks, and not, I should say, by the violence attending that wound—I attribute the death to com<lb/>pression of the brain, occasioned by the congestion of blood on it—inde<lb/>pendently of that, I do not think the wound itself would be likely to hare caused death; it might have done so in her weak state, from the hemorrhage—there was a great deal of blood about her, quite a pool—I examined the other organs, but found nothing to throw a light upon this inquiry—I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under the table, about a yard and a half from the body, covered with human hair, of a greyish colour, very much more than is on it now, and some on the handle—I compared it with the wound; it corresponded with it exactly—I think it is a shoe<lb/>maker's knife.</p>

On the Saturday night before Mrs. Johnson's death, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in my parlour, and heard the prisoner speaking very angrily in his parlour, apparently to his wife—I heard no other voice—I heard him say, "I will do for you, you b——y b——r"—I heard no answer made to that—I heard a noise in their room, as of things being thrown about—that continued about half an hour—I could distinguish the prisoner's voice and his words, repeatedly saying the same—I thought from his voice that he was dreadfully intoxicated—I had not seen him that evening—I have seen him drunk before—the things seemed to break as they fell—I heard something heavy fall, and then all was silent—the room became quiet a little after twelve—I can distinctly hear, persons moving from one room to another, and going up<lb/>stairs—I heard no person go up-stairs from the lower to the upper room after the disturbance ceased—I went to bed about a quarter-past twelve—I did not remain awake very long, but I awake at the least noise, and should have heard any person coming up-stairs—between six and seven, or it might be before, I heard somebody in the next room on the ground-floor—I was disturbed by the police.</p>

               <p>in his room using bad language to his wife—I know she was in the room, because I heard her hard breathing from asthma—I heard the prisoner swearing at her and abusing her; but did not hear him say he would do for her—I heard him throwing things about; they appeared to be his tools—I staid there about a quarter of an hour; this was going on all the time—after that I heard a heavy fall; but no cry or noise as if any one was hurt—we all went away then—I sat up till about half-past two—I heard no one go up-stairs—I sleep up-stairs—there is a room between mine and that where the prisoner sleeps—I had not seen him that day, or the deceased—my mother was out.</p>

I was in the office of the "D" warehouse, about half-past ten o'clock—I saw the prisoner—he asked if the officer had got an order for canes for Bacon's cart—he said no, and he had better go and see Davis, the foreman—the prisoner left as if to go there—be had a cart at the back of the warehouse—I can see through loop-holes in the ware-house all over the yard—I was looking through a loop-hole, and I saw the prisoner in the area several times between ten and twelve—the labourers go to lunch at twelve o'clock—I was then looking through a loop-hole—it is part of my duty to see that no men take their lunch in the warehouse—I saw the prisoner's cart backed towards the loop-hole door, which leads from the first-floor into the yard—I had seen the cart further up the yard a few minutes before—the tail of the cart was about four feet from the entrance to the copper vault—there was a ladder from the vault to the level of the area—the door' of the copper vault was locked—if any person wanted copper they had to go to the warehouse-keeper for the key of the vault—I saw the prisoner come in a direction from the area on one side of the cart—he went round to the other side, got into the cart, went to the back-part of it, and trod the straw down—he then got out and drew the horse and cart away—I informed the warehouse-keeper—I had seen the prisoner in the Dock before—to the best of my belief I saw him on 10th Dec, and I saw him on 24th Dec.—he was about the yard with his horse and cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouse-keeper of the "D" warehouse. I was in the office on 31st Dec, Elsam pointed out the pri<lb/>soner to me—I went to him and asked what he was in for—he said he was in for canes—he was then at the back of the "D" warehouse, within about ten yards of his cart—I asked him if he had anything in his cart, he said, "No"—I placed my foot on the step of his cart, and asked him to remove the straw in front of his cart, which he did with his feet; he kicked it backwards and forwards—I then requested him to remove the straw which was towards the back-part—he said there was a tail-board to the cart, and he would let that down that I might see—he did so, and I discovered eight ingots of copper, this is one of them—it is part of the cargo of the Bull<lb/>finch—they were placed endways in the cart in a row—I am the keeper of the warehouse—they had been in that warehouse—they were imported in July, 1849—we have subsequently examined the vault, and sixty-six ingots are deficient—I have no doubt these are the same as those in the vault—they have the same marks on them, the same brand—there was a greater thickness of straw where the copper was, than in other parts of the cart.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the mark on these ingots? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a foreign brand, 1848, and "H. T.

S." stands for the shipper's name, or those who took it from the mine—the weight of this one ingot is about 40 lbs., the weight of the eight ingots would be about 300 cwt.—the vault is kept locked—it is only opened by persons who have to go there—the key is kept in my office—I have not the papers of the original assignment of this copper—the loop-holes are about ten or twelve feet high.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an optician, of Newgate-street. I have two partners—on 26th Dec. the prisoner came, about seven o'clock in the evening; he wanted some electrical machines; I showed him several; he selected one, the price of which was fifteen guineas; he selected some other articles, to the amount of between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he gave his name as Mr. Winterbottom, 8, Bryanston-square; he ordered them to be sent on Saturday morning, to that address; he then said he wanted some spectacles, and pointed to some in the window—he selected a pair of gold folding spectacles, at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I will not say whether he</p>

               <p>asked to take them, or whether I asked if he would take them; he did take them—if he had not represented that his name was Winterbottom, and that be lived in Bryanstone-square, I would not have let him take them—he said he had a friend residing with him, who wanted a pair of spectacles, and was unable to come out; and he would be glad if we would send a pair or two for his friend to select from—he desired a separate bill to be sent with them, as his friend would pay for them at once; and he said, "I will send you back a check for the amount of the things I have ordered for myself"—he came again on Friday evening, and said the things were not to be sent on Saturday, as he should not be at home; but they were to be sent on Monday; and he requested. to be shown the spectacles which we had looked out for his friend; they were shown to him, and he said he should like to take them to his friend; there was some little hesitation about it, from his saying at that time Mecklenburg-square; but he immediately corrected himself, and said Bryanstone-square—he was allowed to take them—they were worth three guineas—I went next day to 8, Bryanstone-square, but did not find him.</p>

I saw the prisoner, and seized him—he said, "Oh never mind, Mr. Story, I shall not run away, I came to deliver myself up"—he was passing the door of a house where I was looking out for him—I took him to the station, and on the way he inquired if I had found the watch—I said, "Yes, who pledged it?"—he said, "I did"—while he was with me, I noticed a strangeness in his manners, and I have had a paper sent me from a lunatic asylum.</p>

On the night of 13th Jan., at 1 o'clock, I was watching with Stent in Park Wood, belonging to Mr. Clark, in the parish of Hillingdon—I saw four men in the wood at the far-end of it—the prisoners are three of them—they were about ten yards from us, coming up at the end of the wood—we were coming up the side—they saw us and set off to run; we ran after them—when they got out of the wood we were close to them—there was a gate at the border of the wood, Randall and Sims fell as they got over it—when I got over, I ran right in amongst them—Randall was the first nan I got to—he hallooed, "Hold hard!"and then struck me a blow on the head with the stock of a gun; he had hold of the barrel—Sims then came up, and struck me several times over the face with a small stick—while I was scuffling with them, one of the others hit me over the head with the butt of another gun—I do not know who that was—the gun broke short in two; I picked up the stock, and called out for Stent—he came up, Randall ran to him and threw him down, and Stent threw him down—the blows I received did not knock me down, but I was wounded in the head, and the ear, and forehead—Randall was struggling with Stent, and I was struggling with Sims—Stent hallooed to me, and I ran away and left Sims—I went to Stent's assistance, and when I got within about a yard or two of him, Randall and the other one whom we do not know, got up and ran away—when I got up to Stent he had got Pizzey down, we kept him—there is game on that land, which is there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to George Hopwood. On 2nd Dec, the day Mrs. Hopwood was taken up, I was at home in the morning, and I went to the City between two and three o'clock, and returned between five and six—I looked at the clock when I came in—while I was at home Mr. and Mrs. Hopwood were both at home at work in the back shop—Mr. and Mrs. Field, and Mr. Hop wood's brother, were there.</p>

Q.</hi> When did you first say it was between two and three o'clock when you went to the City? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told Mr. Hopwood the time just before I went out, because he told me to make haste back—there was a clock there—he asked me what was the time, and I told him; I am sure of that—I stated that when I was examined last Session—I looked at the clock when I came home; I always do so—Mr. Hopwood asked me the time, and I told him—he was at work—I am in the habit of working in the shop with Mr. and Mrs. Hopwood—it is quite common for them to work there all day—they frequently have their meals there several days in the week—I have lived with them nearly six months—during that time I have seen them working together for several days, and Mr. Hopwood never leaving the shop, except for a short time.</p>

                  </hi>. I and my husband occupy the house 18, Ramsay-street; Mrs. Dearn is a lodger of ours; she occupies the front parlour. On 2nd Dec. I was in my room up-stairs—some one called me, and I went down—the street-door was open—I looked out, but saw no one—I locked the door, and was going up-stairs again, but heard Mrs. Dearn unlock her door—I stopped—she opened it, and asked me to come in—I hesitated, knowing that a woman frequently came there in liquor—she said, "Do come in; it is not the woman you think it is"—I went in, and saw the prisoner lying on the floor, leaning her head against a bed-stead—Mrs. Dearn said some one had cut her throat—she appeared insensible—I asked her who did it—Mrs. Dearn said, "Mrs. Parnell can say"—she said, "I struggled hard"—Mrs. Dearn asked me if I would stop while she went and fetched some one—I said, "Yes"—I looked at her throat, and saw three or four scratches, and a little blood smeared over them—I asked her to tell me who did it, but she made no answer—she appeared quite insensible—just after that, two men came into the room, and Mrs. Parnell fell from the bedstead, where she was leaning, under the table, and said, "George Hopwood, I never did you any harm"—George Hopwood was not one of the men that came in—it was men<lb/>tioned in her hearing that a policeman was coming—she appeared insen<lb/>sible, but I do not think she was, because she kept speaking between</p>

Q.</hi> Were you alarmed when you went into the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I felt rather alarmed; I examined her throat, because Mrs. Dearn told me it was cut—I do not know how long Mrs. Dearn had been in the Toom—I saw no blood about the prisoner till I lifted up her chin, and looked at her throat—I had never seen Mr. and Mrs. Hopwood before they were let out on bail—I gave evidence for them last Session—I did not count the scratches on Mrs. Parnell's throat, but there must have been four or five—the blood that was smeared over them had come from them, but there was no blood running at the time—she remained at the house till the next night, lying on the bed, with her clothes on—I do not know whether any one sat up with her; I did not—I heard no screams in the street that night, or any noise.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I examined the prisoner's throat on 2nd Dec., and found three parallel incisions on it, as near as possible equidistant—they were slight, skin deep—there was a redness of the skin on the anterior portion of the front of the throat like a band, by pressure on the part; it was not blood—I consider it was done by a guarded instru<lb/>ment—I suggested it might be a scarificator, something like a cupping instrument—(here had been an instrument equally as sharp as this used; it could not have been made with the hand—it might decidedly have been caused by this <hi rend="italic">trebat,</hi> but then it must have been passed across the throat three times, which would account for the redness—one bad gone a little over the other—it appeared to me to be done with a fork, it was an incised wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a chimney-sweep, of Granby-row, White-street, Bethnal-green. I have lived there going on for two years—on 2nd Dec. I was at the corner of White-street talking to a corn-chandler's man named Kitchen—the prisoner came up about six o'clock, and we all three stood there talking about twenty minutes or half-an-hour—the prisoner Went away a little way—I lost sight of him hardly an instant—he went towards the Church on the green—that is in a Contrary direction to Ramsay-street—he came back directly, and said, "Here is a case on"—I said, "Where"—he said, "Here, here are two policemen fetched"—no policemen had passed at that time, not till after he told us, and then one came from towards Bethnal-green, and the other from Church-street way—We all three followed the policemen down to Ramsay-street—that is a Very short distance—when we got there we heard that a woman had her throat cut—We could not see or hear any One that had done it—Kitchen said to me, "Are you coming home?"—I said, "Yes; it is no use stopping here, we can't hear or see anything"—he said he must go, in case he should be wanted—he went up to the Cornwallis and was telling two or three people there sit<lb/>ting at their stalls what had happened, and the prisoner and the policeman came up again—I asked the prisoner where he was going—he said, "To Ann's-place, Hackney-road"—I said, "What for"—he said, "To see if we can get the people"—he went away with the policeman—they brought Mrs. Hopwood into the Cornwallis, and gave her something to drink, and then we followed tar into Ramsay-street again, and the prisoner went and listened at the window—I said, "Why don't you come here; you can't hear anything more than we do, and you don't know anything' more than we do"—he said, "Yes; I do"—I said, "How do you know more about it than met you were standing at the top of White-street when the policeman was fetched"—he said, "Well; I tell you, I get my living <hi rend="italic">gonnofing</hi>"—as far as I can learn, that means thieving—that he was following an old <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi> up Abbey-street to <hi rend="italic">nail</hi> him of his handkerchief, and he saw the two people (the Hopwoods) at the corner of Abbey-street, that he thought were <hi rend="italic">tankin for him, and crabbed</hi> him of his job—I asked him if that was the same lady that came along with the policeman—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You must be a pretty sort of a fellow to try to put yourself into a mess like that"—he said, "They would not take my evidence if I were to go up against them, for I have been convicted so many times that they all know</p>

               <p>me"—I took particular notice of the time when the prisoner went away—we bad not been there a quarter of an hour when the prisoner came up; it was then six o'clock; I know that, because when I looked at the clock at the Cornwall it was twenty minutes past—it was about a quarter past six when he left—we had been some time talking together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Moorcroft, a corn-chandler, who lives at the corner of White-street I was standing oppo<lb/>site the Cornwallis, which is near there, on 2nd Dec, talking to Pedrick; we began to talk about six o'clock—the prisoner came up about ten minutes or a quarter-past, and began to talk to us—I knew him before—we talked nearly half an hour; the conversation was with Pedrick, as well as me—the prisoner said, "Good night," took four or five steps, then turned, and said, "Here is a case"—I said, "Where?"he said, "There is something up; can't you see that policeman, he can't do it by himself"—we all went to see what was the matter—one policeman joined the other, and then they went down White-street—the prisoner went on first—he asked me if I knew Ramsay-street; I said, "No"—I asked Pedrick if he knew it, he said he knew nothing about such a street—nothing had occurred which made it necessary for him to ask where it was—we followed the policemen, and heard there was something wrong—the prisoner said, "It is in Ramsay-street; I have been and asked"—I followed the policemen into Ramsay-street—the prisoner went and, listened at the window where they said the woman had had her throat cut—Pedrick said he ought to know better—he came forward and said, "There is a woman has got her throat cut by some man and woman with a mask on"—we said we knew all about it, for we had heard people talk about it, (we bad heard some children say so)—I and Pedrick left, and went to the Cornwallis—I went to my shop, and after I had been there a <hi rend="italic">bit,</hi> I saw the policemen come up with Hogan—the policemen went into the Cornwallis, and fetched a glass of liquid out, and gave it to the female prisoner, who drank it—he took the glass back, and we all went down to the corner to see what was the matter, and when we got there Hogan said he knew all about it—I am sure he did not, any more than I did—he said, "That is the female pri<lb/>soner, and I could have had the man taken if I had bad a mind"—we went as far as the Cornwallis, and I said to him, "How can you know more than we do?"—he said he was going down Abbey-street, following an old <hi rend="italic">bloke,</hi> to pick his pocket of a handkerchief—Pedrick said, "You ought to be ashamed to go up and say you know all about it"—he said "They won't take my word, I have been convicted scores of times"—he then left us, and said, "I am going now to look after my living"—I am sure he could not have been in Ramsay-street from the time I saw him till the policemen came—he did not take above four or five steps, and they were in quite the reverse way—he could not see down Ramsay-street—I know the time, because I had had to carry some coals out about half-past five.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at the Model Lodging-house. I remember the night of this robbery, but am not positive about the date—I sleep in the bed adjoining White, and Trumbell sleeps on the other side of him—I came home on this night between ten and eleven o'clock, and saw White and Trumbell getting supper ready—I went to bed between eleven and twelve—I had heard that Curling intended to play a joke upon White by making what is called an <hi rend="italic">apple-pie bed,</hi> and in con<lb/>sequence of that I was awake—Trumbell came up first, and White came after, not long after, because the light was not out—when White got into bed he found this trick had been played upon him—he had a difficulty in getting down, and had to get out of bed again and remake it—Curling came in and laughed at it, and White began to <hi rend="italic">pummell</hi> him with the pillow, and</p>

I went with Roberts to the Prince of Wales, and saw the prisoner in the parlour—I had some altercation with him—he got up and said he would fetch a gang—I thought he was going to fetch some ruffians to get up a row—he let the parlour—I followed him, and said, "What will you fetch a gang for?"and caught him by the collar, and pushed him down in the passage—about twenty minutes afterwards, Roberts and I left the house, and saw the prisoner over at the brick-stack gathering something up—he came straight up to the path we were on, six or seven yards from us, and threw a brick, which struck Roberts—I turned round to look, and he heaved another, which caught me and knocked my bat off—he ran away—I went after him, and met him coming up with a crowd, and gave him in custody—he said he would have his revenge if he lived, to rip my guts open, mentioning my name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Waters and Son, silk manufacturers. On 12th Dec. I gave some silk to Isaac Chamberlain, sen.—it was interested to him for his son to work—it was to be woven—there was enough to make about 100 yards—I gave it out myself, and knew the son was going to work on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Isaac Chamberlain; I live with him at 22, Pelham-street. I remember a quantity of silk coming from Mr. Waters—I don't remember the day of the month—it was to be woven—I was at work on it on the morning of 17th Jan—I remember my father going out at eleven o'clock—I left my work about twelve, and went round to the prisoner's house, which is about five minutes walk—I told him I bad left my home—he said, "You will get three months for leaving your work"—I said, "No, I shan't"—we stood talking a good while, and he said, "If you will cut the work off, I will sell it for you, you will only get three months then"—I said I would not cut the work to injure my father—we then went to take a walk, and he kept saying, if I would cut the work off he would sell it fur me—we returned home to my place together, between three and four—I went to the Ben Jonson, to my father, to get the key to go up-stairs—the prisoner went home with me—he went about half the way up the stairs, and told me to leave the door open, and take the key back to my father, which I did—when I returned, the prisoner was standing at the corner of Spital-street—I went up-stairs a second time, cut the work off, wrapped it in a coarse towel and my jacket, and took that and eleven bobbins of shute down to the street—I saw the prisoner at the corner, on the other side—I joined him, and we went to his house—I carried the bundle, and he carried the shute—he then took the silk out of what I bad it wrapped in and put it in a bed-quilt—he took the shute and the silk under his arm, and we went out together to Brick-lane—he then told me to meet him at Shoreditch Church—he came to me there, and told me he had not got the money for the silk, he had to call at six o'clock—he had eleven bobbins of shute in his pocket—he said he was going to sell the shute—I walked with him—he went into a place, and when he came out he said he had got 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the shute, and he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when the silk was sold, he told me he got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he gave me a sovereign, and I kept it—he said he sold the silk at Monk's—we went and took a walk—I bought a pair of shoes, and got change for the sovereign, and he was measured for a pair.</p>

I left a parcel, con<lb/>taining money, at Hitchcock's—on the night of 1st Feb., about eight o'clock, Burge came to the shop and asked Caulfield for half a pound of sugar; he served her; she put down a shilling—I am sure of that—Brannan immediately came in, caught hold of Burge's arm, and asked her to let him see what change she had—I saw her turn her pocket inside out, but did not see what it contained—I believe no one had come to the shop between the time of my master leaving it and Burge coining—I did not see any one pay a half-crown during that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. John Tucker, silk printer, of the Abbey Mills, West Ham. In Oct., in consequence of information, I missed some silk handkerchiefs—this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Tucker's—it is not in a state in which it is allowed to go out of the pre<lb/>mises—we never sell handkerchiefs in this state—the prisoner was em<lb/>ployed on the premises to the time of his being taken up—in June last his work would take him to the drying-room where the handkerchiefs were kept when in this state—he had no business to take any of them—after being dried they are glazed—this has not been glazed.</p>

               <p>Hart—I was standing behind a tree—another officer pasted it—I put my light out, and they could not see me—I am not on duty there in the afternoon or evening—Watson told me, on the way to the station, that it was a little bit of victuals be bad left there in the morning for the horses to have in the evening when they came back—I believe I told the Magistrate that Saxby said, "It is only a little bit of chaff, don't say anything about it"—(<hi rend="italic">the witness's deposition being read did not contain the statement, or that Watson took a handfull into his hands to see if it was chaff</hi>)—I believe I mentioned it—I did not think of mentioning it to the clerk when my deposition was read over—the sack was in the same state before the Magistrate which bad the chaff in it—it was tied round the mouth with a string—it was untied when I went in, and I took it from behind the door and tied it up—the string was lying on one side of it—I should say there were about four bushels in it—when I had taken Watson I came back and fetched Saxby—he went with me willingly—the Magi<lb/>strate let him out on his own recognizances—he was afterwards admitted to bail, and has surrendered this morning—I did not go into Saxby's house—I believe his son was present—I know Burchwell by name—he assists Saxby in his business—I do not recollect seeing him there—Saxby has a wife and children—it is a well-conducted house, as far as I know.</p>

On Friday, 10th Jan., at half-past five o'clock in the morning I was on duty at Hatcham-park, heard an alarm, and saw the prisoner and two others in Mr. Walters' garden, who was prosecutor in the last case—the prisoner was coming through the garden fence—I took him into custody, and asked him what he was there for—he said he had been sleeping over the bridge—there is a bridge about fifty yards off, but there is no shelter there—he had his stockings on, but no shoes or cap—I took him to the station, searched him, and found this skeleton-key, this <hi rend="italic">pick-lock,</hi> 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a quantity of lucifers, and a tobacco-box: and these two keys I found at Mr. Walters' house (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw some shoes found by White tried on the prisoner, and they fitted very well—a cap also was tried and fitted him, he went to the police-court in it—he did not own them—his stockings were quite dean when I took him—Mr. Walters' house had apparently been broken open.</p>

My house is about 100 yards from Mr. Walters'—a person coming through the fence would have access to the front of my house, and the back of Mr. Walters, on this Friday morning, I got up at half-past seven o'clock—I was the first person up, and found the area railing torn up, and lying on a bed in the garden, and a saucepan, bason, and cullender which had been removed from under the inside of the kitchen window—the kitchen window under the railing was wide open—I missed from a cupboard up-stairs a loaf, a table-cloth, a jar of mince meat, a set of blacking brushes, and a rolling-pin—these brushes and rolling<lb/>pin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—they were safe at one the previous evening, and I then saw the windows safe—my house is in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell.</p>

I was on duty—I heard a rattle about half-past three o'clock, went to the new building, and found Simpson in custody—I went to the front, and listened—I heard a noise in the lower part, like a person crawling over some shavings—I stayed there about twenty minutes; I then searched, and found Kerrison under the coal-cellar, on some wet mud—I told him he must go with roe to the station—he said, "It is very hard I cannot sleep here"—the stuff was not fit for any one to sleep on, it was quite wet—I took him to the station, and about ten o'clock in the morning I heard a conversation between the two prisoners, who were in separate cells—I was standing with my back towards the wall, close to No. 3—Kerrison said to Simpson," Have they got</p>

About half-past three o'clock, that morning, I heard a rattle—I went to the gateway, and met Mr. Flaxman—I went with him to the back of Mr. Brooks' house—I saw Simpson at the top of a workshop, at an aperture where there is to be a window—after the prisoners were taken, I found this dark-lantern, twelve or fourteen yards from Mr. Brooks' house, and inside the coal-cellar where Kerrison was, I found these lucifers.</p>

               <p>I have seen them since, and do not suppose there is one ton—I miss between two and three tons—at that time the retail price in the market was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bushel—the sample produced by Mittell corresponds with mine—I never authorized the prisoner to sell any potatoes to Wheeler, and he had not paid me for any sold to him—the prisoner has about eighteen rods of garden—about Sept. or Oct. I went there once or twice, and saw his potatoes—he told me he had not a very good crop, and I saw some on the table, of a different description to mine—he had about ten rods planted with potatoes—after he had been examined before the Magistrate, he called on me, and told me this was the first offence, and he hoped I would forgive him, he hoped I should have mercy on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cutler, at Sheffield. On 29th Jan., 1850, in consequence of a written order I had received, I sent four dozen table<lb/>knives, two dozen small dinner-knives, and four pairs of carvers to Mr. Portal—the knives were like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and had a crest of a portal on them—I packed them in a box in brown papers of one dozen, and then tied them together in two dozens; they were worth 12l—the box was directed "W. S. Portal, Esq., Belshanger House, Basingstoke, Hants"—I saw the porter of the Midland Railway Company take it away—on 18th Feb., I received another communication from Mr. Portal, in conse<lb/>quence of which I sent him another set of knives—I have received the value of the knives from the South-Western Railway Company.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Mint-street, Southwark. On 6th Jan., about half-past one o'clock in the night, I went to the King's Arms, in Mint-street, with my brother-in-law, Joseph Evans, who is not here, to get my supper—I went in front of the' bar—I saw the prisoner, and three more young men—they called one another <hi rend="italic">Walley, Buffer.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Goosey</hi>—the prisoner was with them—he had nothing in his hand then—I called for half a quartern of rum for me and my brother-in-law—I heard one of the men, I do not know which, say, "<hi rend="italic">Buz;</hi>" and instantly the prisoner seized me, and struck me three times on the head with a pint-pot, which caused me to fall to the ground—we had not spoken a word to either of them—I found the prisoner's hand in my pocket, and screamed out, "Murder!" but nobody came—I held his arm—we struggled on the ground—one of his accomplices caught bold of my throat, so that I could not scream, while the prisoner escaped—I had never seen him before—I bad six half<lb/>crowns, fourteen shillings, and four sixpences in my right trowsers pocket—it was all gone—I got up, ran out, and screamed, "Police!"—I met the police—as I ran out I met Ellen Moor, my servant, but I did not stop to bear what she had to say—I went to surgeon Downes—my head was bleeding most violently—I went before a Magistrate next day—my brother-in-law was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mr. Squibb's service. I went to the public-house to fetch him home on this morning, between one and two o'clock—I heard no words, but just as I got inside I saw the prisoner strike Mr. Squibb with a pint pot, as he stood at the bar with his brother-in-law—I saw three other men there—my master instantly fell to the ground; a mob surrounded him—the prisoner had a pint pot in one hand, covered with blood—my master held him by the band, and screamed out, "Police"—one of the mob caught hold of him by the throat, and the prisoner got away—they then let my matter loose; he got up, ran out,</p>

               <p>and called for the police—his head was pouring in blood—the other men fled—I saw the prisoner next morning at Stone's-end police-station—I saw the prisoner throw the pot into the street; a boy picked it up; there was blood on it.</p>

On 6th Jan., between one and two o'clock in the night, Squibb came to the house with three females and a male—the females called for rum, and paid me for it, and then afterwards he called for a quartern of rum—I drew it—he did not pay—I asked him to do so, and he said he had no money in his pocket, but he had plenty at home<lb/>he requested Mrs. Evans, who was there, to pay for it—she refused—Squibb's wife was there, I took a pint pot out of her hand, because I saw her strike some person on the head—they were all very tipsy—they were in front of the bar, and I was behind it—I could see everything that went on, and can say positively that the prisoner did not strike any one—no one went away before this affray—they all left direetly the policeman came—he turned them all out together, but the prisoner left by himself—I heard some party say he had lost his money and his watch—I think it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but another person said 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was only one complaint of money being lost—I heard no other observations made by anybody.</p>

                  </hi>. I know Squibb; between one and two o'clock on this morning, I was standing in front of the bar of the King's Arms—I was there all day; I was in the bar-parlour—Squibb came in after one, or between one and two; there were some women with him—I cannot say whether he had a jug in his hand; I believe he had not—they were stand<lb/>ing at the bar, drinking when a man named Evans, who I believe is a rela<lb/>tion of Squibb's, came in and stood conversing with Squibb and the women some short time—he said, "I have got a little account, or a little business to settle," or some words to that effect; and immediately took off his hat, gave it to a person to hold, and knocked a man down who was standing by the side of the beer-engine—an altercation took place immediately, and Squibb and these women immediately commenced an attack on him while he was on the ground—the landlord came immediately from behind the bar, and I with his assistance parted them—an altercation occurred again immediately; the prisoner came in at that time, and seeing the man down, lent him assistance so as he should not be ill-used—the prisoner did not strike him, he was immediately knocked down himself—Squibb and the women who were with him ill-used him as much as they possibly could, till the landlord was obliged to call in the police to quell the disturbance, and a general fight took place; they were all fighting then—Squibb said nothing then about his loosing his watch and money; not in my hearing—</p>

On 1st Feb., between one and two o'clock, I was going home, and just at the commencement of the Dover-road I met the prisoners—they both asked me to treat them—I walked with them down Swan-street to the corner of Swan-court—two men came past, stopped, and repassed, and then went round the corner of the court—I felt Scott's hand in my pocket—the men stood round me—I got alarmed, and at that moment was struck across the head with some iron instrument like a can<lb/>dlestick—I fell on my back, the men were then close by, and the women too—I believe it was Scott who struck me—I became insensible directly—I had had something to drink, but was not drunk—when I came to myself Scott's hand was in my pocket—I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there, five gold keys, and a gold seal, in a leather bag—I missed them, and called for assistance—they all left me—the things were worth about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was struck from behind; it was so instantaneous I could not see who struck me—my wife was at the door waiting for my coming home—I did not see her before I was struck; but she heard my voice and came to me.</p>

               <p>on Friday the 27th of Dec, about ten in the morning—the prisoner told me of it in the Infirmary ward—I told him to strip Barnes, and I found his arm fractured close up at the shoulder joint, and the arm was very much swollen, inflamed, and bruised down as far as the hand, more espe<lb/>cially about the shoulder joint—at the lower part of the upper arm there was a bruise presenting a striking appearance, as if produced by a grasp—the bruises were all round the shoulder joint extending to the upper part of the chest, which was very much swollen—I should attribute the appearances to violence; to a fall, the consequence of violence, not an accidental fall, but a fall some other person had occasioned—I ordered him to bed, and sent for Mr. Fidler the visiting surgeon—while I was making the examination, I said to the prisoner, "This must have occurred some days ago"—he replied that Barnes had been complaining two or three days of having boards in his shoulder, but that he was always talking nonsense of that sort, and he took no notice of it—I then said it must have been caused by violence—he replied that he knew nothing about it—from the state in which he was when I examined him on the 27th, he could neither have dressed himself nor have assisted in dressing himself on the previous day nor from the time it happened—from the appearance I think it must have been quite of three days' standing, and in the state in which it was, I do not think that the person dressing him could have failed to have observed it—he could not have raised his arm after receiving this injury without assistance; it was quite useless—it was the prisoner's duty to dress him, or to be present while he was dressed—I had never been told or heard of his complaining of boards in his shoulder before this morning—I had only been superintendent for a week, but it was the prisoner's duty to report accidents to me—I was in attendance daily up to the 27th, and had gone into the Infirmary every day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you occasion to examine the deceased before the 26th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had looked at his head on the 26th, but saw no<lb/>thing the matter with his shoulder then—he had on his coat and waistcoat, with short sleeves—he was completely dressed—his delusion was that he imagined his belly was as big as a but—I have never had any reason to complain of the prisoner's conduct before—Barnes did not complain to me on the 27th; the prisoner gave me the information himself, he appeared anxious about it—Barnes was capable of giving a correct answer to a question, but his memory was affected: not a great deal—he was a lunatic in the ordinary sense of the term—he was of a sullen disposition, and silent—I am acquainted with the condition of Donnelly, Attwood, and Taylor—they were in the habit of assisting the prisoner in taking care of the patients—I do not know of my own knowledge that Attwood has sometimes dressed the patients—I have seen him arranging their dress when they have been slovenly—I do not remember seeing him feeding them—they are allowed to assist him in the general duties of the ward—Donnelly labours under a delusion that he has various spirits about him—I do not know what particular delusion Attwood and Taylor labour under—Donnelly has never been free from that delusion that I am aware of—Attwood is incapable of carrying on a connected conversation, and at limes is excessively abusive—he is of an irritable temper, and in my judg<lb/>ment is a fit subject for a lunatic asylum—Taylor is a man of weak in<lb/>tellect</p>

               <p>—he is incapable of taking care of himself—I consider Donelly to be a lunatic—I should not hesitate to sign a certificate to that effect, by reason of the delusion of spirits in his head—Barnes was capable of giving an account of an ordinary transaction, and if anything extraordinary had happened, such as violence to himself, or having been the witness of violence to another, I think he would be capable of giving a rational account of it—I believe Donelly to be quite capable of giving an account of any transaction that happened before his eyes—I have always found him so—it is solely with reference to the delusion about the spirits that I attribute to him being a lunatic—when I have had conversation with him on ordinary subjects I have found him perfectly rational, but for his delu<lb/>sion—I have seen nothing in his conduct or demeanour in answering ques<lb/>tions otherwise than the demeanour of a sane man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine. I was formerly district<lb/>surgeon, at Mr. Armstrong's asylum—I ceased to be so on the 22nd of Dec., and was succeeded by Mr. Burton—I was there on the 27th of Dec., and my attention was called to the deceased—I found him suffering from a severe injury of the arm, which was fractured, and there was a great deal of swelling and inflammation—I examined him—my opinion is that he had received a severe fall on the back part of the shoulder—the injuries I saw could certainly not have resulted from a man falling of his own ordinary weight, unless he fell from a very great height; certainly not in that room—he was rather a tall man; a little above the ordinary height, and of spare habit—he was not a strong man by any means—I noticed three or four stripes across the top of his arm, as if it had been tightly grasped by another person's hand—I asked him several questions, but the prisoner was not present at the commencement of them—he told me how he had received the injury, and by whom he had received the injury—the prisoner then came into the room, and I said, looking at him and then at the deceased, "This is a sad occurrence; the man's arm is broken"—the prisoner replied, "I assure you I know nothing of it"—I said, looking at the deceased, "And be says that you did it, and Donelly here says he saw you do it"—Donelly was close by—the prisoner replied, "That is quite false, I never injured him, I never lifted my hand to him"—Don<lb/>elly said, "Yes, you know you did; you took hold of him by the arm" taking hold of the prisoner's arm at the time and showing me "in this way" (<hi rend="italic">with both hands</hi>), "and tripped him up, and threw him heavily on the floor" placing his foot against the prisoner to show me how it was done—the prisoner replied, "That is quite false"—I said I was sorry to hear him accused of such a thing, as I had no reason to suppose him guilty of hav<lb/>ing done so—I remarked again that the injury must have been done several days—he replied, "I assure you I knew nothing of it, till this morning"—I did not ask him any more questions—the deceased was pre<lb/>sent—we were standing at the foot of his bedstead—his countenance was directed towards the prisoner and me alternately—he had answered my questions quite rationally, and appeared perfectly to understand what was said and done—I had seen Barnes on the 24th of Dec, between eleven and twelve o'clock—he was then fully dressed, and sitting on a form—I saw him again on the 26th fully dressed, in the same position—he was of a sullen temper, and did not usually speak to anybody unless they first addressed him, and generally then he was by no means communicative—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185102030164"/>
               <p>he did not speak to me on either of those days—from what I saw on the 27th he could not have been able to put on or take off his clothes, or wash himself for two or three days before—I have had my attention directed to the insane for nine years—the result of my experience is that in many cases persons of unsound mind bear personal injury and pain without complaining.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have been asked about your general know<lb/>ledge of the insane; if a man is insane, is his memory necessarily affected? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not always, not necessarily—it frequently is, but frequently is not—I have seen Dr. Haslar's work—I do not agree in all cases with his remark that "Memory appears to be perfectly defective in cases of insanity"—certainly not—it may probably be so in the generality of cases—madness is commonly accompanied by a great deal of excitability of the brain, but in some cases it is not—it is very often accompanied by physical irritation of the brain—it is one of the most common causes of madness, either primarily or secondarily—in certain cases of acute madness, the ideas in the mind of a madman succeed each other more rapidly than in the mind of a sane man, and in a more confused manner; that is, where there is actual irritation of the brain—it is quite possible for a man to entertain a delusion on one subject without its affecting his mind generally on other subjects—in most cases where a delusion prevails and the man is mad, the rest of his mind is affected to some extent—I agree with Dr. Pritchard in his observation that" In monomania the mind is unsound, but unsound in one point only"—there is no doubt, however, that all the mental facul<lb/>ties are more or less affected, but the affection is more strongly manifested in some than in others—I have had opportunities of seeing Barnes pretty often—the only delusion he laboured under was, that his stomach was always full, as full as a butt, and that it could not contain more—that was the great reason why he objected to take food—it is difficult to ascer<lb/>tain, without strict inquiry, the extent of a madman's delusions—they have some times the power of concealing their delusions even from their medical attendants, especially after having been conversed with frequently about the delusions, and knowing that they are the cause of their detention, but it is infrequent—it is a doubtful point whether what they say is not for a particular purpose; for instance, to obtain liberty—if a madman has an object to answer, he is sometimes capable of concealing his delusions—I have known it, but not as a general rule—they are probably capable of a good deal of dissimulation; many are, I know, but many do not exhibit that tendency—it is common for a certain class of madmen to exhibit a great deal of cunning—Barnes had been very weak ever since his admis<lb/>sion—his mind was weak also—he bad refused food, and during the whole of his residence he required to be fed—he frequently refused food—I agree with Dr. Burton that his memory was impaired—Donelly laboured under a delusion with respect to spirits—he is, in the strict sense of the word, a lunatic, inasmuch as helabours under a delusion—he is not excitable by any means—Attwood is an excitable person—during the four years I have been there, I have questioned Donelly as to the extent of his delusion—he has always laboured under that notion about spirits—when I saw Barnes on the 24th and 26th of December, I saw nothing unusual in his appearance—I know that the patients sometimes assisted Hill in the discharge of his duties inperforming offices about the persons of the others,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185102030165"/>
               <p>and making themselves generally useful in the presence of Hill—occa<lb/>sionally in washing and dressing the other patients, but not as a general rule—the prisoner has been generally kind, humane, and attentive towards those under his care—I have not known Barnes quarrelsome and irritable with the other patients—I have known that he has been sullen; he would probably not speak to them unless addressed—he was sullen, obstinate, and disinclined to do what might be required of Him—I have seen the other patients feeding him—after the deceased told me that the injury was done to him by a keeper, I asked if he could tell me his name—he said, "I don't recollect his name; I don't know his name"—I said, "Was it Muncaster?" "No;" "Was it Stevens?" "No;" "Was it Hill?"and he said, "Yes, that is him"—Donelly was not present then—I had not seen him—I saw him a few minutes afterwards—the deceased took no part in the conversa<lb/>tion, but from his manner he evidently understood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon afterwards did Donelly come into the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five or ten minutes after I went in, and the prisoner about five minutes after—I had given no account to Donelly of what Barnes had told me before he came in—from seven to ten minutes, at most, elapsed between Barnes giving me the account and my repeating it in the presence of the prisoner—I certainly believe the deceased to have heard and under<lb/>stood all that was said—Barnes was a patient troublesome to a keeper—I have found monomaniacs perfectly rational on all subjects unconnected with the delusion under which they are labouring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Speaking as a man of experience in these unhappy delusions, can you, in your judgment, trace any connection between the statements made by the deceased and the delusion under which he was labouring? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever—I have known instances of lunatics concealing their delusions, but in all these cases there has been an apparent and evident motive—I have known decided lunatics, not monomaniacs, in what are called lucid intervals, capable of going about and managing their own affairs—in ordinary cases there is no particular difference between a mono<lb/>maniac, apart from his particular delusion, and an insane person in a lucid interval—during the lucid interval of the insane person he is well, but a monomaniac is a monomaniac all the time—in the instance of a mono<lb/>maniac you produce the insanity the moment you touch the particular chord—it is possible that you might revive insanity in a madman during a lucid interval, by touching on the same subject, if it is but recent—I always found Donelly perfectly rational, except on the subject of his particular delusion—I have heard him examined as to his knowledge of a future state, and of the obligation of an oath.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-surgeon at Guy's Hospital, and have been for the last five years their demonstrator. On 3rd Jan. I made a post-mortem examination of the body of the deceased—it was emaciated, but not very much decomposed—there were severe bruises over the front and back part of the left-shoulder, and down the inner side of the left arm, as far as the wrist; bruises down the left-side, as far as the loin; and bruises upon the right-side, about the middle of the sixth or seventh ribs; and a slight bruise on the left-side of the head—there was extravasation of blood underneath the skin, among the muscles and tissues—there was a splintered fracture of the bone of the left-arm immediately below the shoulder, which was very oblique—the upper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185102030166"/>
               <p>portion of the bone was in its situation, and the joint was not injured, but the lower portion was driven right up into the arm-pit, pressing on the nerves in that situation—there were also fractures of the sixth and seventh ribs, on the right side, about their centre, and also of the eleventh and twelfth, on the same side, which had penetrated the lining membranes of the chest, and produced evident signs of inflammation—the lungs were diseased by consumption of long standing—the substance of the brain was thickened, and bore the ordinary appearance of the brain of a lunatic—its substance was a little soft—I cannot state the exact time that this injury must have been inflicted, but from four to ten days—the injuries had been sustained for some time—I say that from the appearance of the bruises—they all bad the same amount of discoloration—I should attri<lb/>bute the injuries to great and inordinate violence, I have no doubt about it—they could not have been from a simple fall, nor could they have been occasioned by the man himself—I think if the party had been tripped up on the ground, that would not have caused it, without some additional weight falling on him—if the person who tripped him up had fallen on him, that would account for it—the injury could not have been occasioned by a person falling from a great height to the ground—if a person of con<lb/>siderable power had taken him by the arm, and thrown him on the ground with violence, that would account for it, but then it would be difficult to account for the fractured ribs without additional weight—I should say exhaustion was the immediate cause of death—that would naturally follow such injuries, and within the time I have mentioned—I have had some experience of lunatics, and have found that they suffer severe pain without complaint.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>held up, and the series of <hi rend="italic">pummellings</hi> made on it—there were a great many different bruises—there was one on the left side of the head—that might have been caused by a blow with the fist—there were also bruises on the breast; they did not necessarily result from the arm being broken; they were separate from those on the arm—there were also bruises on the left side; those might be the result of a severe beating with the fist, or with some blunt instrument—it is my opinion that whoever injured the man must have exercised a great deal of violence—I do not think it could occur in an ordinary struggle—it is very unusual for such injuries to result from wrestling, unless the deceased fell on some very hard substance, or on the floor—if a very heavy man fell upon him in that way, the fracture of the ribs might have arisen—the broken ribs were a very short distance from each other; my impression is that the knees did it—the sixth and seventh, and eleventh and twelfth ribs are about the same distance at if a man had fallen with both his knees upon him, and they were driven in, much as though such an occurrence had really taken place—it might have been caused by the man falling on a form—it must have been very violent wrestling to have caused it—the bruises might have been produced by the bands, from blows—it is possible that the bruises might have been caused by a fall on the floor, considering the sympathy with the muscles, and between the parts—I examined the bones, but did not find them more brittle than ordinarily—I tried to break the ribs on the same side as those that were fractured, but could not do so with ordinary force.</p>

               <p>said, "I will mark you for this"—(she had the key of the street-door in the course of the afternoon, and he wanted to get it away from her)—in a few minutes I heard him call "Murder!" three times, in the parlour; and she said, "Mrs. Charman bring up a light"—I took up a light, and found them both in the parlour; he was bleeding from the temple—he said, "For God's sake, fetch somebody"—I went out for a doctor—there was a great crowd, and a female named Dyer, who was then a stranger to me, got into the house; she opened the door to me on my return—the doctor came directly, and I did not go into the parlour, but went down to my work—I did not hear the deceased say who had done it—the prisoner was perfectly sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a musician, and live at Spencer-place, Brixton-road. On 16th Jan., at a few minutes past twelve o'clock at night, I was in Newington-place, going home, and saw a woman coming in a contrary direction—it was Collis—she was about twenty or thirty yards from me when I first saw her—I saw no one with her—the pavement is rather broad—there was plenty of room for her to pass me—I did not alter my course, but she must have altered hers, for she came and pushed against me, and I immediately received a thrust in the mouth with an umbrella from a man who was behind her, which was followed by a violent blow with his fist on the lower part of the face—he must have been walking behind the woman for the purpose of concealment—he said, "That woman is my wife; you have insulted her"—I think I said I had not—he followed up the attack directly, and I closed with him, and to threw him—he got up, give the umbrella to Collis, and commenced a very violent attack with his fists, hitting right and left—we closed, and I threw him, and fell on him—I fancy Collis struck me with the umbrella while I was down—I called "Police!"—Bond came up, and I gave them into custody—when I met them my hands were in my pockets in front, and my coat collar turned up—it was a sort of drizzling rain, and I was walking rather fast.</p>
