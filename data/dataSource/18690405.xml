                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, at 13, King Street, Cheapside—I was acting as solicitor for Mr. Cohen and the defendant in the matter of their partnership—I saw the defendant and Cohen execute this deed (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they both called upon me and gave me instructions to prepare it, on the terms stated in it—before its execution Benjamin required some little time to see as to the connexion of Cohen, and he subsequently called and expressed his satisfaction; the deed was then executed in duplicate—some short time after, Benjamin called upon me alone and represented that the connexion of Cohen was perfectly satisfactory to him and that they were doing very well indeed, that, in fact, they had scarcely touched the capital, having been enabled by the discounting of Cohen's customer's bills to con<lb/>tinue their trading—by the sixth paragraph of the deed a capital of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be provided—Benjamin was to bring in 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the stock-in-rade, fixtures, and good-will, contained in a statement marked A, was to be esti<lb/>mated as the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be brought in by Cohen—I did not see the statement marked A—I asked for it at the time of the execution of the deed, and I was told by both that it had been left at their warehouse.</p>

               <p>his debts would amount to about the same as his assets, and that Benjamin was investing his money on the one hand and Cohen his connexion and good-will on the other—Benjamin represented that he could not trade in his own name and that Cohen's business was the business he wanted, he finding the capital and Cohen the connexion—I did not understand that the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be procured by Benjamin from his friends—I undertook that he had the money in hand—I do not know that a member of my family introduced them to each other—I think Mr. High, sen., was known to Mr. Cohen for the same period as myself—he is not here—I should say Cohen was not indebted to him for some considerable amount—my father was simply an agent, Cohen was indebted to his principals, some Yorkshire people.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at 22, Union Street, Spitalfields, at the time in question; I do not now—I carried on business as a woollen ware-houseman since October, 1867, not in Union Street, but at the West End—I have been in the trade twelve years—I think I went to Union Street, about August, 1868—I had been bankrupt about two years before that, I then handed over 950<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property for 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and got my discharge—I never paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—six years ago, I was in partnership in Regent Street, and we paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound; that was through my putting my hand to accommodation paper for other persons—I had got quite out of my difficulties, and was carrying on this business with success—I entered into this partnership in September, 1863, with Benjamin, he was introduced to me by his brother-in-law—a statement was prepared before the deed was executed, it was written by me, and checked off by the prisoner, and handed over to him—we went through the stock and books; that paper contained a true statement of my affairs at that time—this is a copy of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) here are two papers, one is the statement checked off at the time; and the other was made at the time we went through the stock and marked it down—(<hi rend="italic">William Henry Randoll proved the service of a notice on the defendant and his attorney, to produce this and certain other documents in his possession.</hi>)—This is a copy of the summary which he had—the stock and fixtures amount to 425<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and debts 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., total 595<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; then there is rent and taxes paid in advance, making a total of 607<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. assets, and on the other side, there is a list of creditors amounting to 672<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., there is 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be deducted, making 652<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the prisoner returned the paper, it had this memo<lb/>random on it, "The above is the statement mentioned in the partnership deed, clause 6; the difference between this amount of 562<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>constable asked me what I charged him with, and I said "Felony"—he did not say that he charged me likewise with obtaining his money by fraudu<lb/>lently pretending I was solvent; I swear that—he did not say to me, before I went out of town, that it was a scandal for me to drag a man into difficulties and that I was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. behindhand instead of having a surplus—he never said a single word of it—I accused him of trying to sacrifice a lot of goods, and he denied it before Mr. Alford, the creditor—I never heard that the bank refused to discount any more of our paper, until the manager told me at the police-station—the prisoner never told me so, nor did Brown—I have not brought Brown here to-day—there was no discussion between me and the prisoner as to the expediency of changing to some other bank in order that we might get discounts—I doubt that the prisoner ever paid in his other 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because he never told me of it—I can't tell you whether a sum of 545<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in on 9th October—if it was, I can't tell when it came from; I should say it was from shipping—I know he drew a cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and another for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about that time—there is a sum of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd entered in the bank book—he had a pass book in his possession—the National Bank in Old Broad Street was our last bank—I don't know whether a sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in there on 6th November—he had the books in his possession and always kept his desk locked—I stated in the Bankruptcy Court that the stock that was given up amounted to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some goods came in afterwards.</p>

"24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. interest," showing that that is the same amount—on 31st September the balance at the Union Bank is 681<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that there is just sufficient to cover that 665<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over—the next rest is 1623<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—here is his own report, showing the three accounts to which the 665<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ought to have been paid, the general account, the Southwark and Westminster and the Metropolitan Main Drainage account—that 665<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not paid to either of those accounts, nor has it been paid to the treasurer of the Board in any way—I find an entry in the same banking account, the Union Bank of London, of 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 19th April, 1865—on 17th April, 312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid in to the prisoner's account—this is the ticket with which the money was paid in, the banker's slip, and this is the cheque endorsed by the prisoner, "Pay the accountant, Metropolitan Board of Works, for new sewer in Turk's Head Yard, or order"—that ought to have gone to the Board's own bankers—the prisoner had no right to pay it into the Union Bank, that I am aware of—he had a right to endorse it, as an officer of the Board, in order to pass it to their own banking account—it has not been paid to the Board's account at all, and it has not been into account with the Board—when I invegtigated these matters, and the Board directed the prisoner to be prosecuted, there was a box of his in the strong room connected with his office—I saw it opened, ultimately—I cannot tell you what was found in it, but there were several counterfoils, which are here—they seem to be all of the Bank of London—I found them, with some cheques, in a small tin biscuit box inside the iron box—they are counterfoils cut from the book—I have found the cheques to which they correspond; they are private cheques, not the Board's—the counterfoils are cut away at intervals—some were cut out of a book which contained three or four cheques, and one would be left out—here is the book—those which are left in are the Board's cheques—they are all in his writing—they are for private matters—I found in that tin, I think, all that were cut from the counterfoil book—the pri<lb/>soner kept the key of the box—no person in the office had access to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have not you found in those bankers' books, with the exception, in round numbers, of 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., two cheques not traced, every farthing accounted for which he has received from the Board of Works? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—this is not his writing at all—I have his writing on the backs of the cheques—every fathing he received is not accounted for in these books with the exception of the 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here is 261<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 13th May, 1864, and 245<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 27th May, 1864—I believe that is all—these two cheques have not been made the subject of a criminal charge against him—with the exception of these two cheques I believe every sum of money is accounted for in his bankers' pass-books, which he has received from the Board of Works—I do not expect to be appointed accountant, they have already appointed one—those two cheques were cashed the day afterwards, over the counter, on the 14th, and the other on the 28th—they are the Board cheques, payable to Mr. Hughes—cheques were drawn to his name by the Board, and in that way the money came into his hands rightly and lawfully—I do not know under what circumstances these two cheques were paid over the counter, that was scarcely a month after his appointment—this 665<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was not on deposit during Mr. Hatton's acting as accountant, it was handed over to Mr. Hughes as a satisfaction of the claim against Mr. Hatton, and deposited by Mr. Hughes in the name of Sir John Thwaites, then Mr. Thwaites, and himself—it was drawn out of the Bank of London, and paid into the Union Bank—Sir John Thwaites knew of one account—I don't know whether Sir John Thwaites was aware that this money was going into the Union Bank, and I never knew that it was drawn out—I do not know how it happened that it was paid into the Union Bank on August 5th, 1865—by the Union Bank pass-books he drew out, "Self; 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he paid that into the new account, and balanced up the old one—the new and the old accounts were concurrent for a time—I do not know how that was 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid into the National Bank, I made a mistake—he—the secured his balance from the Bank of London, and paid it into the Union Bank—he suggests by this report that the bank should furnish him with cheques to the amount of 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, that would complete the sum of 694<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these four small cheques, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., make altogether 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

               <p>whole of it was agreed—the accounts of the Board were audited each year by the government auditor, but the prisoner's pass-books were not audited—it was never ascertained, I believe, by anybody, what balance he had in hand; but I am only speaking of my own knowledge—I do not know whether I should have known if any examination of his balance had been made—we had three rooms, and I was in one of them—I do not know that it has been complained of that no audit was made—I know of no such audit—besides myself, no outsider or professional accountant was employed to examine the accounts.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it that the prisoner was always kept amply in funds, all these sums were for fractional amounts, therefore there were the exact amount of vouchers before the finance committee? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the finance committee orders the payment of the sums, and a cheque was drawn for the exact amount—in the first instance he recommended that 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be paid to him to draw upon, and subsequently that was increased very largely</p>

               <p>as the works of the Board increased—this audit showed the exact state of the account every year—the only thing they failed to do was to test the amount that ought to have been in the prisoner's hands—these cheques ought not to have been passed to the accounts they were passed to.</p>

On the afternoon of 16th March, from information I received, I went to Mr. Hughes, a wire worker, at 39, Drury Lane—I found four bundles of wire concealed behind an earthen-ware pan, and I concealed myself in the cellar—about 12.55 Skinner came to the place and took some of the wire away—he came three times, and took some away each time—I was about five yards from the place, behind the door of the coal cellar—at 1 o'clock the whistle blew for the men to leave the works to go to dinner—I left the cellar and went out of the front entrance, into Drury Lane—I then went to Wilson Street, to the workman's entrance, and saw Skinner leave—I followed him to 18, Paradise Street, Lambeth Walk—he went into a marine store dealer's shop, kept by Hubbard—I saw him take three bundles of wire from his coat, and put them into the scale—he took one bundle from his right-hand tail pocket—Hubbard put the weights in the scale, weighed it, and gave Skinner some coppers and a piece of silver, which I believed to be a shilling—he came out of the shop—I stopped him and asked what he had taken there—he said, "Nothing, only a bit of lead"—I said, "What money have you got?"—he</p>

               <p>said, "I don't know, you had better see"—I took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from his hand—I then took him back to the shop, and said to Hubbard "What have you bought of this man?"—he said, "Nothing, only a piece of lead," and lifted this piece of lead off the counter—I said, "I want that copper wire that you bought of him"—he said, "I have bought none"—I said, You have, and you had better give it to me, for I am a police officer, and I shall search your place—I was in plain clothes—he said, "You will not search my place without a search warrant"—I said I should—I asked him again to give me the wire, and he said he had not got it—I then gave him into the custody of two uniform men I had called in—I searched the place and found, under the back of the counter, these four bundles of wire (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) amongst a lot of old rubbish—I said, "How do you account for these?"—he said "My wife bought them"—I asked his wife if she bought the wire, and she said she knew nothing about it—I found these two pieces of wire in a drawer in the counter—I then told Skinner I should take him for stealing the wire from his master, and I told Hubbard I should take him for receiving it, knowing it to be stolen—I asked him if he made any entries of what metal he bought—he said, "No, not such trifles as these"—his wife handed me a book, but I found no entries of copper wire—I asked him what name and address Skinner gave him—he said he did not take any name or address, he did not trouble about it—I then took them to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">WILLIAM HUGHES</hi>. I am a wire worker, at 37, Drury Lane—Skinner was in my employment as a labourer, to clean the wire—he had free across to my workshops—I have missed wire for some time, and I gave information to the police—this wire is my property—there is about 4lbs. of it—it is worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—the two other pieces of wire found at Hubbard's shop I identify as my property—I saw it in this folded state before I com<lb/>municated with the police—I saw part of this wire safe at 10 o'clock on the 10th, the same day that Skinner was arrested—he worked in a small cellar, where the material was kept—the value of this bit of lead is about 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I manufacture my own wire.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">JOHN DICKINSON</hi>. I am a workman in the prosecutor's employment—on 16th March I went into the cellar where Skinner worked—I missed a tool that I was using in my business, and I discovered two bundles of wire concealed behind a vitriol pan—I went and told Mr. Hughes—I went down an hour afterwards and found there were three pieces—I was with the constable part of the time, and saw Skinner go away—I went to the place and found the wire was gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hubbard's Defence.</hi> I did not buy the quantity stated by the constable.

I asked him what we had done; he made no answer, but took we to the station. They said that the lady had lost a parcel of linen, and accused me of stealing it, and I said I did not know anything about it. It was 6.30 when we were taken to the station.</p>

"No"—"Accommodation bills?"No"—"Have you any books of account?" "No"—he states that he attributes his insolvency to the loss of the action against his detaining creditor, and being detained for costs—he was asked, "What money have you had since your arrest?"and his answer was, "None"—he was arrested a few days before the petition was filed—he was committed to prison on the 18th, and he has been brought here by <hi rend="italic">habeas</hi>—on 22nd February I examined the bankrupt and his mother—I examined the bankrupt first—this is his examination.

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the silk trade, carry<lb/>ing on business with Mr. Richard Chandler, 18, Bread Street—the signature to the partition is the prisoner's handwriting—prior to September, 1867, I was in business on my own account, at Lyons, as a commission agent in the silk trade—I had very extensive dealings with the prisoner, who was, prior to that time, carrying on business as a silk merchant, at 139, Cheapside—prior to September, 1867, I had known him eighteen months—my first knowledge of him in business was in January, 1866, and from that time, up to July, 1867, I had very extensive transactions with him—he from time to time paid me very large sums of money—his business, as far as I could judge, appeared to be a flourishing and good one—I dealt with him upon my own responsibility—his transactions were with me—I bought goods from the manufacturers specifically for him—I was responsible to them and he to me—he, from time to time, came over to me—he came in 1866 with a letter of introduction from a highly respectable house in the City of London, Bradbury, Greater, &amp; Beale—the letter was written by Mr. Edward Beale, giving him a very high character—he continued to carry on business in that way until August, 1867—in the latter end of July, 1867, he came over to me—he also came over in the early part of June, when he bought largely on the market, and left orders—I believe he purchased over 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods in June, 1867—at that time I had heavy claims against him, for which I held his acceptances to the amount of between 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and</p>

               <p>6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that sum had been gradually increasing—when he came over in June, he ordered the goods to be delivered in August and September for his autumn trade—after that he came over the last week in July—he went round the market with me to see what novelties he could find—we want round to the manufacturers, and saw the styles which were being matter made for the autumn—he then bought goods to the amount of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he was going for a short journey to the North of England, and should like to anticipate the autumn trade by having a few novelties; what he wanted were the newest things, to be delivered immediately, to carry out the object he had in view—the 27th, 28th, and 29th July were the days he was in Lyons; his bought ready—made goods; that was the last time I saw him over there—at the July interview I reminded him that our account was very heavy, too much so for a small man like me—I said, "Simpson, I hope things are right"—"Perfectly right, Grove, make your mind easy;"—"What do you require these goods for?"—"For an immediate sale, to go round the North of Eng<lb/>land to anticipate the large wholesale houses"—he accompanied me to the manufacturers, and I agreed to limit our operations to 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he required a small quantity of goods, but what he required must be the newest, best, and most <hi rend="italic">recherch'e</hi> things—my mind was operated upon by what he said about going to the North, and anticipating the wholesale house—in sending those goods, I believed that the goods were intended for fair and legitimate business—I sent them on the 30th of July—it is possible I may have sent some goods on 1st July, but that would have been a small affair—(<hi rend="italic">the prisoner's Day Book was produced, and invoice from the various merchants which he received with the goods</hi>)—here is an invoice of 6th July for some silk and satin goods to the amount of 440 francs 50 centime—there is also a second invoice of that date to the amount of 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I look at the prisoner's book of sales, and find an entry there of those goods to Messrs.

should you require assistance, name it"—he replied, "If I require it, I should have asked for it"—I said, "I am very happy to hear you don't require any"—he again assured me he did not require any assistance—in another interview he admitted it was possible he might—he said, "I might require assistance; there are not any of your acceptances due; but let us have a chat together"—we had a chat—I advised him not to carry on the conversation in his warehouse, but to meet me at my solictor's, Mr. Potter, of King Street, cheapside—he met me there in the afternoon of the same day—he then named what assistance he should require—he said if I would get him three bills renewed for a short</p>

               <p>period, it would be a great assistance to him—he named seven days, where-upon Mr. Potter remarked, "Seven days soon fly away; are you sure that is long enough?"—he assured us it would be—I replied, "It is as easy for me to obtain the renewal for ten or fourteen days as it would be for seven; let me understand your position, is it a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> one; do not trifle with me, I am a poor man, and if you fail you ruin me"—he then made a solemn assertion or affirmation, he said, "I am perfectly solvent, my expenses in my business are nothing, do not be alarmed; I am tightly pressed for money, I admit, but you are the last man I should think of ruining; you have been a good friend, I would not ruin you"—I then consented to have the bills renewed—I said I would return to Lyons, place the matter before the parties who took the bills, the different manu<lb/>facturers to whom I parted with the bills—a further conversation ensued between Simpson, myself, and Potter, more directly with Mr. Potter and Simpson, Simpson assuring us that he was a solvent man—upon his representation I returned to France and obtained the renewal of the bills—the interview took place about 17th August—he did not then tell me of any of these transactions with Mr. Meeking, nor was I informed by him that he had pledged my goods—he did not meet his engagement, and the bills were all dishonoured about a fortnight afterwards—I then came over to England, and called on my solictor, and, accompanied by Mr. Lovering, the accountant, went to Simpson's warehouse—that was the first or second week in September—I said, "Simpson, you have not behaved like a man, you have not kept your word, you have ruined me; you have but one alternamtive, surrender like a man, and let us know the state of your affairs"—he declined to do so, and said he would do nothing of the kind—he said he would give no preference—I said, "No preference is wanted; I will have nothing more to say to you, but I leave the affair in the hands of Mr. Potter"—Mr. Potter served him with a notice of bankruptcy, and on the 24th he filed his petition—the consequence of the bills being returned was that I had to suspend payment, and was driven into the Bankruptcy Court—I called my creditors together, in the usual way, according to the law of France, and obtained my <hi rend="italic">concords</hi>

               <p>from the manufacturers and invoiced the goods to Simpson in my name—as a rule I added nothing to the prices from the manufacturers, although these were exceptions, namely when I submitted goods to him, I have added 1 per cent, or it might be 2 per cent. besides my commission—I frequently offered him goods at a certain price, and if he thought them cheap he bought them, if not he declined—in June he ordered 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, for the autumn market, and on the 27th, 28th and 29th, he was at Lyons—what he bought in July was a distinct transaction from what he bought in June—in June he ordered a quantity of goods to be delivered in the months of August and September, but they never were delivered—the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods which he purchased in July were never delivered—he purchased them of me—he selected the goods, but they went through me, the manu<lb/>facturers getting my security only—at the original interview he had with me he told me he only had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. capital—he repeatedly told me, both by verbal communication and by letter, that he had wealthy relatives, whom he belived he could get support from—when I saw him in August, I have no recollection that he said anything about hoping to get money from his relatives when the crisis came—after the crisis had arrived he did say he had applied to them and failed—at this conversation, when I was urging him to trust to me, I did not exactly say to him, "Simpson, put yourself in my hands, I can get any amount of credit at Lyons"—I said, "Give me your confidence, and you shall have mine"—I said, "My capital is like yours, very small, but my credit and my reputation on the market is good; any reasonable amount, provided it is fair and honest, I can obtain"—I never told him in August that if he put himself in my hands, I could get plenty of credit at Lyons—you are mixing the two occasions together—that was at the commencement of our transactions—I failed for 160,000 francs—in round numbers 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner failed for a little more than that—I do not remember that at the time he failed there were outstanding bills which were afterwards met—in June, when he gave me an order, his indebtedness to me was rather more than 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was between 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the time he failed he owed me 4540<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—during the three months that elapsed before the bankruptcy, he paid me about 3380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that if he had failed in June I should have been worse off than I was when he did fail, by a couple of thousand pounds—he might have rendered me liable for another 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I had delivered the goods, and had I continued in business, I must have accepted those goods because I was liable and they were ordered in my name—from time to time, without having any direct order from him, I sent goods to him, acting according to the best of my judgment—if I had a lot of goods which I thought he could sell, I sent them to him—I never sent him goods without acting on my own judgment, except in carry<lb/>ing out previous orders that had not been executed—during the three months previous to his bankruptcy, I never sent him goods of my own accord—at the Mansion House the solictor for the defence asked me if I had not sent him some black taffeta that he had not ordered—I said I had not—I can make that perfectly clear by the prisoner's own handwriting—he ordered ten pieces, the order could not be executed on the market at the time; I sent him patterns—he wrote back saying they were very dear, and not suitable for him—some week, or ten day afterwards, I wrote to him saying, that I had found a few packets, but that was what I considered a portion of his previous order—at that time I never bought him any robe; that was in July—he sent me in July an indefinite order, saying that he re<lb/>quired</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186904050052"/>
               <p>some very handsome stylish brocaded robe, with black ground with rose buds, just suitable to the season—I went through the market and found an assortment of eleven robes—the result of that was that he came to Lyons on the strength of that, and expressed his satisfaction, saying that he should like to buy thirty or forty of that same sort—I never bought any robe with<lb/>out his <hi rend="italic">bonacircfide</hi> order—I could not pledge my oath that I never, during the three months previous to his bankruptcy, sent him any goods which I selected without a previous order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi> Monday, 12th August, was the earliest date at which I had any notion of the prisoner's difficulties—that induced me to come over to see him on the 14th, when he re-assured me—about a fortnight afterwards the bills were returned—I should add 3 per cent. to the invoice price, and that would make the cost price to him—a man engaged in a business of that kind ought to make from 7 1/2 to 10 per cent profit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solictor, practising in King Street, cheaspide—in the summer of 1867, in consequence of some imformation I obtained, I communicated with Mr. Grove, at Lyons—I telegraphed to him on the 12th August—he afterwards came to England—I saw him nearly every day between the 14th and the 17th—Mr. Simpson came to my office, accom<lb/>panied by his clerk, Mr. Nash, on the 17th August, in order to give me certain explanations—I was acting as Mr. Grove's solictor, and was not satisfied—those explanations referred to Mr. Simpson's position—a bill had been returned, and as some other bills were failing due within the next few days, it was a subject of great anxiety to Mr. Grove to know what his posi<lb/>tion, was to be with the manufacturers in Lyons who made these silk goods—I could not advise Mr. Grove on his own position without satisfying my<lb/>self of what was Simpson's position, so Mr. Simpson and Mr. Nash came to me—at that interview I asked Mr. Simpson to tell me candidly what his position was—I pointed out to him that Mr. Grove was a very young man in business, with a wife and family depending on him, and that it was of the greatest importance for him to know the position of affairs—Simpson assured me that he was perfectly solvent—I then made some inquiries about what bills, were falling due within the next few days—there were some acceptances, I belive, and some bills of other people falling due, and Mr. Nash, who was present, referring to a memorandum-books, told me what those bills were—I then said to Mr. Simpson, "What is to be done? I suppose you want to be able to meet these bills?"and he said, if time could be obtained from the manufacturers in Lyons he could meet everything—I said to him, "Tell us truly what your position is?"—those bills amounted to several hundreds of pounds—there was one for 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some con<lb/>siderably larger ones—I said to him, "if Mr. Grove is to go and ask a favour of these manufacturers it would be better he should ask a longer time"—I said, "You will find a week run away very quickly, and it is just as easy to ask for ten or twelve days as a week"—he seemed to agree with me, and it was agreed that Mr. Grove should ask indulgence until the 1st or 2nd September—I am not quite certain which—I then asked Mr. Simpson how he had got into such a position, and he said he had over-bought himself,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186904050053"/>
               <p>and that trade was excessively bad—I then questioned him with reference to himself and his own personal expenses; I said, "Where do you reside?"—he told me, I think, that it was in the Fentiman Road, Clapham Road—he said, "I am an exceedingly frugal man, I do not cost more than a police<lb/>man's wages; 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week would cover all my expenditure"—he said when he first went into business he used to sleep under the counter to save the expense of a lodging—on that occasion he assured me of his perfect solvency—on the 2nd September I again communicated with Mr. Grove, and he again came over to England—I again saw Simpson in company with Mr. Grove, but we could get nothing satisfactory from him—I asked him to place his books in the hands of Mr. Levering, the accountant, in order that we might be satisfied about his real position—he refused, and I afterwards took out a warrant against him, whereupon he filed a partition of bankruptcy.</p>

I live at 9, Brewer's Buildings, Fetter Lane, and am a light porter—on Saturday, 6th March, about 12.30 in the morning, I was with two friends, named Alfred Davis and John Marshall, at Pentonville Road, in an ice-cream shop—the prisoner came in with a female—he began quarrelling with the shopman and wanted some brandy and water—he was walking backwards out and he stumbled against me—I put my hand up, and he turned round and put his two fists in my face, and said, "Me fight, me fight"—I merely kept him from tumbling against me—I did not do anything more to him—I said I did not wish to fight, and be again put his fist in my face, and said, "Me fight"—he went outside, and I followed him—I did not do anything—I was going home with my two friends, and he took and struck me in the head, and I became in<lb/>sensible—a mob collected round directly after—there was nobody there when I was struck—I was put in a cab and taken to the hospital, and attended by Dr. Forder.</p>

Spreckley's—all I saw occurred before I went to prison—I went to Mr. Spreckley on 27th February—no one was present but the prisoner and myself on these occasions when Palmer brought the cloth—I never told Johnson I had my suspicious about what was going on—I did not ask him at any time for direct information—on the 20th February, after I came out of prison, I went to Bridport Place and found Johnson had left there—I was thinking of giving information at that time—I remained on good terms with him all the time—it was on the 23rd he told me not to let anyone know where he had removed to—he had told me there was an action threatened against him—I supposed he wished me to think it was in reference to the action.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner</hi>). Previous to December, 1867, I resided at 35, Old Windsor Street, Islington—I was acquainted with Spriggs—I am a carpenter, and Spraggs is a maker of marble-chimney-pieces—I have known him nine or ten years—the rent of my house in Windsor Street, was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—I occupied but a portion of it—one room, in fact, and 1st the rest to lodgers, unfurnished—I removed to Lefevre Road about the middle of December, 1867—in May of that year I effected a policy in the Phenix Insurance Company for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had never been insured before: Spraggs asked me to insure—he wanted to insure me—I had a property case on hand, and could not get the money to go to law, and he said in<lb/>suring would be the way to get it—he said he would insure me, and carry out the law suit—I sanctioned it about three weeks afterwards—he said that my house was to be burnt, that I was to remove from Windsor Street to another house, so as not to have the fire in the one for which I had insured—he said that the Phoenix was a good office to go to—he afterwards told me that he had booked my name, that it was all right, and that I was to go and pay the money—I know his brother-in-law, a man named White, and when he spoke of effecting his insurance in the Phoenix he said that White had had a fire, that he arranged it, and that he (<hi rend="italic">Spraggs</hi>) had given White's wife 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the money, to get her a home—I do not exactly know when that fire occurred—Spraggs said that I should have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy another home, and the rest was to be expended in carrying out the law suit for me—when he made the proposal to me I told him that I did not like to do it, and asked how I was to manage it so that my wife would not know—he said "Move from Windsor Street to another house"—he gave me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the policy, and I returned him the change—he seemed surprised that it did not cost more—he told me what amount to insure for—I had nothing like the household furniture and stock-in-trade that was claimed for—there were two bedsteads, a chest of drawers, one or two oil paintings, two or three pictures, and it was nearly all in one room—I went with Spraggs early in December to look after a house—he said he had spoken to Mr. Scudder, of Old Ford, about a job for me, and he told me to take a house, and remove over there—we went together to the Lefevre Road, and took the job of Mr. Scudder, and I worked there for about a fortnight when Spraggs came to me, and we sought a house—we took No. 7, and Spraggs wrote to the landlord—I can neither read nor write—I removed from Windsor Place early one morning, in a one-horse van—I took five or six pieces of wood, some doors and other things with me—myself, wife, and son-in-law, occupied the house—I continued as the landlord of the house in Windsor Street—the fire occurred on the 20th February—I cut the wood</p>

               <p>into pieces, and took it into the house—I had no more property in Lefevre Road than what I had in Windsor Street—I saw Spragge nearly every day before the fire—we went to a sale in Brick Lane, about three weeks pre<lb/>viously, and Spragge bought some bedsteads, and all kinds of things, a stove or two, and a bath, they came to about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether, and Spraggs gave me the money to pay for them—the next week we bought a lot more, a foot-bath, an old fiddle, and other things, amounting to about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—then they were taken to Spraggs' house, and afterwards removed to mine—the day before the fire Spraggs came and helped me to put my things into the room over the kitchen, so that they might not be destroyed—he said it would show there had been good things in the fire—Spragge brought some of the metal produced, the casters and bed-screws, to me, about the week before the fire—he said they could not tell at the office, and he could charge well for those sort of things; they would not know, when they were found after the fire, but that they had belonged to my furniture—they seemed to be in nearly the same condition then as now—he said they came out of <hi rend="italic">Tom White's</hi> fire, and that he had a whole lot of them, a man named Parrymore made a fuss about the fire, and most of them were sold—Spraggs placed these things in my house the night before the fire—my wife and lodger were at his house then, and Spraggs and I got everything ready, and when it was all right we went to his house and had supper—it was late, because the public-houses were closed—after supper I and my wife and lodger went home—the furniture which was not to be burnt, was placed in the lodger's room over the kitchen—the wood I had chopped up was taken into the back room—Spraggs said that we were to go to bed as usual, be<lb/>cause if the fire did not burn well, and the firemen came in, they could tell whether the bed was warm—he brought something in a paper parcel when he came the night before, and he said it would burn a church down—he told me about this after the fire—he said that by lighting a candle, and stand<lb/>ing it in the stuff it would burn down, and when it did so, the stuff would ditch, and then the fire would commence—the parcel was placed against the chopped-up pieces of wood—my wife and I went to bed about 1 o'clock—we undressed ourselves about 1.45—we smelt the fire, and I pulled my wife out of bed, and we went into the yard—I only had my frowners on—we did not make an alarm until the fire was well ablaze—Spraggs told us not to do so—I had the policy in my pocket—Spraggs said that he would manage the money—he gave me a book, sealed up, and said he had made a claim for 293<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and by his directions I posted it—he did not read over the articles for which he claimed—I asked him if he thought they would pay it, and he replied that they must—after the letter was received from Mr. Loveday, he told me that I should be questioned about my goods—he told me to say that they were purchased at a sale at Cambridge Heath—Mr. Loveday asked me if I could bring anybody to speak about my goods, and Spraggs went with me for the purpose—when he found that the company would not pay, he wrote a letter to Mr. Wood, solicitor, and the result was that we brought an action against the Phoenix Company—I never paid Mr. Wood a shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a marble mason, of College Street, Homerton—I have known Spraggs many years, and have worked for him—I have occasionally met Sharman there—previously to May, 1867, Spraggs told me that he had insured Sharman in the Phoenix Fire Office, and that Sharman owed him a sum of money—he said that Sharman was going to work for Mr. Scudder, at Old Ford—he had told me long before this about <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> White's fire—after Sharman's fire, he said that it had come off, and that he was in a fair way of getting the money that Sharman owed him, and he would take particular notice that he had it—I asked him where the fire was—he said a long way off—I saw the casters and bed-screws pro<lb/>duced, before Sharman's fire—I saw them at Spraggs' house, in Old Ford Street—he used to be in the habit of showing them to me, and speaking of the various fires he had had, and the success which had attended them—he used to keep these in a cupboard, in his bed-room; he said they had been through three fires, the last one being <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> White's, at Hackney Wick—before that <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> White was very badly off, and when I saw him the next time, was astonished to see how well he was dressed—Spraggs said that I was an old fool for not doing the same as <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> White did—I replied that perhaps I would—after Sharman's fire, I communicated with the fire-brigads men who were in charge of the premises, and then I saw the casters and things produced—when I next saw Spragge and Sharman, Spraggs called me bad names, and threatened to knock my head off for giving information; he called me an old villain and a scoundrel, and I told him I had done nothing more than my duty—Sharman said it was a pity there should be so much squabbling about it—I said if I saw a policeman I would give them both into custody.</p>

I was in the service of Mr. Stacey Ward, at Ipswich, while he was a draper there—when the prisoner took his business I was to act as shopman to him—I was in the shop when some cases came—I do not know where they came from—on 24th December I went away for a holiday, with the prisoner's permission—he had sold a few things in the shop pre<lb/>vious to that—I sold one or two of them—my greatest taking in the shop while he was there was about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not think he cared about selling anything; one or two customers came in, and he told them he had not opened for business yet, but what he had got he did not mind selling—there was not much in the shop at that time—this was prior to the 26th, but not a week before—I went for my holiday on Christmas Eve, and did not come back till Sunday week, 3rd January—I found the prisoner there when I returned—boxes came in before the 24th, and were unpacked, and goods were put on the counter, flowers, and skirts, and silks; such things.</p>

               <p>as these; and they laid behind, on a recess—the things were not marked, the window was not dressed, and the shop was not got ready for business—I arrived on Saturday evening at my master's, about 8.0 or 8.30—there were no cases of goods in the hall or in the shop—on Monday morning the prisoner went away, saying that he wanted to run up to London, and if I got on as well as I did before, it would be all right, and if anybody inquired where he was gone I was to tell them that I did not know, but he would be back in a few days—he left some goods there, unpacked; I left them there—I stayed there till the following Tuesday—I did not see him again till to-day—Mr. Ward came on the Friday and locked up the house, and I left—goods were left in the house then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Did you open the shop every morning? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes; between 8 and 9 o'clock—I believe one or two mornings were skipped—you dressed the window; there were shirts in one window and flowers in the other—it was not dressed in the usual way—there were not many customers—you kept open till 10 o'clock on Saturday night, and on Monday, 21st, and Tuesday, the 22nd, we opened in the regular way—on Wednesday, 23rd, you went to London, but I opened the shop—it was open every day in the week—on Monday, January 4th, when you went away, I opened the shop—I did not see the errand lad come to open it—the bell was not rung while I was there—you told me, if I opened at 10 o'clock that morning, that would do—I slept in the house—I opened at the same time on Tuesday, and kept open till Mr. Ward came.</p>

On Friday, 12th March, in conse<lb/>quence of directions, and on the 13th, I went to Mr. Turner's shop, in St Martin's-le-Grand—I saw a person named Leachman go in there—I did not see him take anything in—he came out with a bag and a parcel—I followed him into Gresham Street, and stopped him, took him to the station, and found these scarfs in some boxes—I went with him and Mr. Westwood that morning to London Wall, to the Weaver's Arms and Swan public-houses, to try and find Cross, but did not see anything of him that morning—on Monday morning, the 15th, I went again, with Leachman and another officer—a stranger spoke to Leachman in the street—after that I went with Leachman to Cox's public-house, in Carthusian Street, where I found Cross in the back parlour, by himself—Cross opened the door a little way and saw Leachman, and then Leachman went in, and I followed—Leachman said, "That is Cross"—I said to him, "Leachman is in custody for the unlawful possession of a quantity of scarfs, which he says you gave to him, is that so?"—he said, "Yes"—Leachman said to Cross, "Yes, and you knew they were wrong when you gave them to me, and I told you that Hellaby's people were making a noise about their things being sold at the shops under cost price"—Cross said, "Yes"—Leachman said, "And did not you say, 'If there is anything wrong about them, never you mind about that, I will put up with that'"—Cross said, "No"—I then told him that I should take him into custody—Leachman said, "With your permis<lb/>sion, I should like to ask Mr. Crow this; did I, at the time when you gave</p>

Hellaby's, during the? time you were in their employ—I want you to tell me the truth; I understand you were discharged because two (or some) scarfs were found in your pocket, is that so?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I know you have had a great many more than those two, you have had a great many from there"—his father begged him to tell the truth—I then asked him if he had taken away a many as a 100 dozen—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you take fifty?"—he said, "No"—he thought he had taken thirty dozen—I said, "What did you do with them?'—he said, "I sold them to a boy named Green"—I said, "How did you come to know Green?"—he said, "I met him one day, at the corner of Aldermanbury, and I was showing him a band, and he bought it, and asked me if I could get him some more things, and I did, scarfs"—I asked him how many at a time he had taken out, or how he took them out—he said, "I took, sometimes, three or four at a time, in my pocket, and I have taken as many as nine, twice a-day"—I asked if he knew where Green lived—he said, "Yes, I can take you to his house"—I then went with Butler to 24, Lamb Street, Spitalfields, and there saw Green—I said, "I am a police officer, and I have come to see you about some scarfs that you have bought of this boy, Butler"—he said, "Scarfs, sir! I only had three or four"—Butler said, "Yes, you did, you had twenty dozen and more"—I then took them both to the station—I showed Butler, in Green's presence, the boxes of scarfs taken from Leachman, and asked if he knew them—Butler said, "Yes"—I said, "How do you know them?"—he said, "They are the ones that I stole from my master, Mr. Hellaby, and gave to Green"—Green said, "I did not have all these, I had that one, and that one," putting his finger upon two; these are the two—he said, "I had some of these, altogether about a dozen"—Butler said he had had more, and Green denied it—Butler said, "I used to meet you, and you once gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for eight, and sometimes you gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each; when I used to give them to you, I have been several times with you to a public-house, in London Wall, and you used to go in and meet a man there, and sell them while I waited outside"—Green said, "You only went once with me to the public-house in London Wall"—I asked Butler if he knew the sign of the home he said he thought it was the White Horse, but he was not certain</p>

               <p>—there was a mm with me at these conversations, not an officer, he took no part in it—on 29th March, the day of the committal, Butler called me to him in the cell, and said "I wish to speak to you, sir; this morning, as we were coming away from Newgate, Green said to me, 'Did you tell then anything about the bands?' and I said, Yes, I told them the truth; he said, 'How did they come to find it out?;' I said, 'Through the one you had on'"—he also said "Green said, 'What made you tell them I had so many scarfs?' and he told me, sir, before we were taken, that if ever we were taken, to say that he only had a few"—I gave that evidence at the Mansion House shortly afterwards, and Green interrupted me, and said something which was taken down—I don't remember what it was—I have, in the course of this case, received parcels of Windsor scarfs, from different persons, which I produce; here are eight from Mr. Davey, four dozen from Simpson &amp; Co., three down from Mr. Williams, five from Mr. Rees, and eight from Mr. Tarrant—I do not produce any from Swan &amp; Edgar's.</p>

               <p>London—I am a commercial traveller, principally town traveller, for dif<lb/>ferent houses—in March last I was not in any occupation except by com<lb/>mission, one or two commissions—my last regular employment was with Mr. Mayhew, of Wood Street; that was up to Christmas last—since then I have been doing something for myself on commission—I know Cross—I first became acquainted with him some few years ago—he used to work for Mr. Mayhew—about the beginning of March I saw him at the Sun, in London Wall, and he asked if I thought I could do anything with some scarfs—I said, "You had better let me see what they are, I can soon tell whether they are suitable for me"—he said he would bring them next day—I met him by appointment next day at the same house, and he then produced about two dozen of these scarfs—I said I did not think I could do anything with them, but I would try—I took them out and showed them round—i sold a few at two or three prices, the lowest, I think, was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as far as I can recollect—I think the principal I sold to Mr. Turner—I don't know what quantity he bought—he paid me for the first, not the last—I gave the money to Cross the next day at the Sun—he occasionally brought some more scarfs to put with the others, altogether, I should think, about six or seven dozen, perhaps eight dozen—I did not sell them all, only a few, here and there—I showed them wherever I thought persons might buy them—I was found with seven or eight dozen in my possession when the officer took me into custody—I sold some to Mr. Foster, of Wandsworth Road, and some to Mr. Lewis, of Pimlico—altogether, I sold, I think, about three or four dozen at the same prices—I had seen Cross four or five times at the Sun during March—when the officer took me into custody he first took me to the station—then we went to the Sun, and waited there a good half hour, and then walked to the corner of Basing hall Street—altogether we were about an hour and a half or two hours seeking for Cross that day, but did not see him—on the Monday I went again with the officer to London Wall—I was still in custody—a boy spoke to me, and I afterwards went with the officer to Cox's public house in Carthusian Street, and found Cross in the parlour there—I said to the officer, "This is Mr. Cross," and said to Cross, "Here is a gentleman wants to speak to you"—the officer began to ask about some scarfs, and I said to Cross, "Mr. Cross, before this gentlemen has anything to say to you, I have a plain, straightforward question to ask you, and I want yes or no, did I know anything about the goods you gave me to sell, whose they were, or anything about them?"—he turned round to the officer and said, "He knew nothing at all about them"—I did not say anything about Hellaby's or the shop people, not a word, nothing of the kind; I am positive of it—that was all that transpired between me and Cross and the officer—the officer was talking to Cross about having me in custody, and said he must take him likewise—we were not there a minute after I had spoken to Cross; not two minutes at the outside—I was not to receive anything from Cross for selling the goods—he merely gave me a list of prices, and what I could get beyond those prices I was to have for my trouble, nothing else.</p>

               <p>unfurnished apartments at 119, Cornwall Road, Netting Hill—my furniture came up from the country on the 22nd—I saw the prisoner that day—he gave in his card, and said that he was a carpenter, and wished to unpack my things and settle me in the rooms, if I would employ him—I did not know him before—I authorized him to assist me, and he did so on the Tuesday night, Wednesday, and Thursday—he had three men the first day and five the next, besides himself—the rooms were not large enough to hold all my furniture, and some was put in a lower room belonging to the land<lb/>lord till 9th January, when the prisoner took it away to warehouse it—the value of what he took away was about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were two washing stands, a table, a wooden waiter, three basins, three sets of washstand fittings, and a lamp—he offered to warehouse them for me, and give me the key, and I authorized him to do so—on 26th December he asked me to give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, and I did so—he asked me for some more the following week, and I asked him to bring me the account, for I should like to settle with him—he brought this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it amounts to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid him altogether 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that bill—about ten days before (25th January) I received a cheque from the country, but there was some informality about it, and I was about ten days before I could get it cashed—the prisoner cashed it for me on the 25th—I gave him a letter to go with it to Messrs. Coutt's, my banker, and he brought me back 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the cheque was for 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I said, "That is not the amount of the cheque"—he said that he had kept 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back for himself for work done for me—I told him I had paid off all but 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I did not know what the other 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for, that it was an illegal way of doing the thing, and I demanded the whole of my cheque—he said that if I employed a respectable solicitor he would tell me that it was all right, and the way that business was done in London—I pressed him for a long time for his account, and at last he drew this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his waistcoat pocket, and gave it to me—it makes a balance due to him on the last account of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am sure I paid him all but 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the first bill—he had done some fresh work since, he had made a new linen press—when he handed me the bill he said, "I think we will close the account now"—after that he asked me if I would take the things out of pawn—he had pawned a great many articles of jewellery for me to raise money to pay him his bill, but no furni<lb/>ture—I never authorized him to part with any of my furniture; indeed, he never mentioned the word pawning to me at all; he offered to borrow some money on the things—I did not understand he was pawning, or else I should not have allowed him to keep the tickets, which I am told I should have kept myself—I afterwards communicated with Mr. McMullen, my solicitor, but before that, on the Monday, I sent for a police-inspector, as the prisoner did not bring me back the pawn tickets as he promised—on 20th February I saw some of my furniture in the shop of Mr. Alexander, which I had authorized the prisoner to warehouse for me—I had told him at one time that if he liked he might sell some of the furniture to get some more money, but I afterwards told him on no account to do so, as I should have to more into larger rooms and should want it—that was on 20th January—I sent for him on that oc<lb/>casion, and asked him if he had sold any, and he said "No."</p>

Q.</hi> How long have you known him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only since 22nd December; I had never seen him before—he pledged clothes and plate for me, but no furniture—they are still in pledge, because I could not get my tickets till he was arrested—I found no fault with him—at the time he stopped the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I only owed him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I thought his charges high,</p>

               <p>but I did not complain about that—I did not allow him to keep back the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I did not know what to do, and sent for the inspector, on the following Wednesday, to advise me—the prisoner kept me on with promises to return my tickets for nearly a fortnight, and then I could not find him—I asked him if he knew of anyone who would lend me money, and he introduced me to Mr. Inman—I did not ask the prisoner to borrow money for me—I am married—I was married at Salisbury twenty-six years ago—my eldest son is twenty-five years of age; he is with me here—I am not separated from my husband, but I cannot live where he lives—I have my dividends, arising from my own money, from property settled on myself and children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mining engineer and timber mer<lb/>chant, of 4, Allhallows Chambers, Lombard Street—on 12th January last I sent in a tender to the Admiralty for the supply of the timber for certain of the dockyards—on Friday, the 15th, the prisoner Rumble called at my office—I had never seen him before—I can tell you a portion of what took place between us, but not the whole; I made notes of what appeared to me to be material, after he had left the office—(<hi rend="italic">The witness referred to his notes</hi>)—On his entering the office I said, "What can I do for you?"—he said, "That depends upon yourself"—I said, "How so?"—he said, "You have tendered for elm timber, but you won't get your contract unless you use influence at the office"—I said it was a matter that must rest on its own merits, and that if my own brother had to decide I would not ask him to do so—he said, "Well, you won't get the contract unless you give a small consideration; it is at present between you and another person who has tendered, and unless you make terms with me you will certainly lose the contract; even should you get it, you will find ft great portion of your goods will be rejected, as in the case of a new contractor for coals, who found great difficulty in carrying out his contract, which might have been avoided if he had given me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get the matter through for him"—I replied, "I cannot help that; I shall not use or pay for any influence; I am not sufficiently anxious to get the contract to induce me to give a bribe to anyone to use their influence"—he made other observations which I cannot recollect—on leaving, he said, "Very well, I'll do the best I can for you, and after you have got the contract you will, perhaps, do some<lb/>thing for me"—he then left, and I went and saw Mr. Brady, the Registrar of Contracts, at Somerset House—on the following day I received this note from Rumble—(<hi rend="italic">Read: "Friday afternoon</hi>, 4 <hi rend="italic">p.m., postmark on envelope</hi>, 15<hi rend="italic">th Jan<lb/>uary</hi>, 1869.

A note addressed to William Rumble, 361, Old Kent Road, will be sure to find me. Tours truly, William Rumble.")—On Monday the 18th, he called again, about 12 o'clock—(I had written to him appointing the 18th)—I said, "Well, I received your note, but your prophecy was not correct, I have as yet received no letter from the Admiralty"—he said "But you will in a day or two"—I said "How do you know that?"—he said "I find out through my friend"—I said "He must be pretty high up, who is he?"—he said "I cannot mention names"—I said "It is not Mr. Childers, I presume"—he said "Not very far from him, though; he is pretty high up"—I said "In the event of your receiving 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, would you keep the whole of it, or would you have to share it with any other person?"—he said "I should have to divide it with my friend"—I said "Well, as I have no official information as yet, I am not certain that your information is correct"—he said "You will see I have great in<lb/>fluence, and when you want your accounts passed, I shall be able to show you how to do so quickly; however, I will call again in a day or so, and let you know how things are getting on"—he called again on the 22nd—he then told me that the contract was smashed up—I had offered for all</p>

All the other tenders received have been declined. R. Duodas, Storekeeper-General of the Navy. The Registrar of Contracts")—I asked if that letter was obtained through his influence—he said "Most certainly," and that if he had not used his influence I would not hare got it—I had also tendered for the Woolwich, Chatham, Sheerness, and Devonport contracts—I asked him how it was I had not got that—he said I was much better without it; that they were great humbugs down there, and there was great difficulty in getting stuff in—he said he would let me know when I would he publicly called on to deliver any of the wood—I asked him to call on Monday—he said he was going to Staffordshire, and could not call again until Monday week—I made an appointment with him for the Monday week—on that day he came, but I 'did not see him, and he called the next day, which was the 2nd of February—I had then received three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, in a letter from inspector Clark, from Mr. Brady, the Registrar of Contracts to the Admiralty—Rumble called on the 2nd, and said I should have the papers that night—I asked if he would introduce me to his friend—he said he could not do that, but he would invite me to dinner, and I could meet him casually, in the same way as was arranged with some Birmingham firm—I asked if he would have to divide anything with another—he said, "Yes, two"—I said, "Two besides yourself?"—"No," he replied; "one besides my<lb/>self"—I then handed him the three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, saying he could look at them when he got out of the office—on Wednesday, the 3rd, I saw him again, and he said I could go up and sign the contract, and send in the wood as soon as I liked, and that I would get my money in four days afterwards—he added, "He was much pleased, and will give you some larger things when he knows what line you would like."</p>

                  </hi>. I am Registrar of Contracts and Public Securities to the Admiralty—my office was at Somerset House; it has been removed now—up to 17th February the prisoner Gambier was a first-class clerk in the Storekeeper-General's Department, and occupied room No. 15—when a tender is made by a person who is desirous of contracting with the Admiralty for a naval contract, it is put into a box, which is opened in the board-room, at the time appointed, in the presence of the Storekeeper-General of the Navy and a Lord of the Admiralty—in the usual course, the lowest tender is accepted on the spot—a formal contract is then made—we call the man, or his agent, into the Board Room, and tell him his tender is accepted, and he signs a memorandum in the Board-books—I read the tender, and it is taken down as what is termed a treaty paper, end a minute is made to accept, under* the proper column—the tender is taken down on the treaty paper by one of the Lords of the Admiralty, and on a duplicate by the Storekeeper-General—I have here the treaty paper of this particular contract—that is the same kind of paper tempt to generally used for the purpose—there is a column indicating the prices at which the various persons have tendered; their lordships then consider which tender should be accepted, and when they have determined that, a minute is made under the man's name, "Accept this tender"—one twisty paper is initialed by the Lord of the Admiralty present, and the other by the Storekeeper-General—this was a special case, this was not accepted at the time—in oases where it is not practicable to accept on the spot, as for in<lb/>stance in this case, where the prices have to be calculated, to see which is the lowest tender, the parties are told they will be written to—when the contract is accepted, a minute goes to the Storekeeper-General, who instructs his clerk to write to the contractor, telling him of the acceptance of his tender—the minute is on this paper—the whole of the papers go to<lb/>gether, tender and all—those papers, in the ordinary course, would find their way into room No. 15, where Gambier was; if they weft to White-hall to be decided, they would come back to the Storekeeper-General; the register clerk would open them, and he would then take the direction of the Storekeeper-General, or his chief clerk, what to do; but Mr. Girdlestone can tell you better than I can the detail of his own of tee; it to not in my department—in this instance the various tenders were taken up to the Contract Office, for the prices to be calculated, to see which was the lowest—I have here the different tenders which were sent in—I took them up to the Contract Office; they were opened on 12th January—Mr. Maxwell's</p>

I am a clerk in the Storekeeper-General's office, Somerset House—Mr. Gambler was, in January last, a clerk in the first class, second section, of the Storekeeper-General's office—there was one clerk above him, Mr. Girdlestone—when a tender is opened a minute is made and sent out to be acted upon—I do not know anything about the tender; I have nothing to do with it, I simply act upon the minute made—Gambier was in the first class, second department, and the tender would go to him for distribution in the first instance, in the course of busi<lb/>ness; he got as early information as anybody—it would go to him at once when it was accepted, and he would have to act upon it; to write a letter to the contractor—it would come to him, and he would send it to the proper clerk, a gentleman at the correspondence desk—Mr. Dixon and I were it the correspondence desk in January—this R. D. indicates that the tender is accepted; it is what we call an acquaint—this is the result of the minute, not the minute itself—the minute would go to Mr. Gambier'a office for dis<lb/>tribution—there are several branches of the office, and paper go to one or the other according to the nature of the business—Gambier would simply send it on to be acted upon; that is, writing a letter to the contractor—before that document there would be a minute, which would go to him; he sends the minute to the correspondence clerk, who writes the acceptance, I which is sent to the Storekeeper-General for signature; after he has signed it, it goes to the Record office, to be copied and dispatched—it ought, in the course of business, to go to Mr. Gambier again after it is signed, and he sends it on to the Record office—it is usually dispatched by post—envelopes are kept in the office, with the Admiralty stamps on them, everyone em<lb/>ployed in the office has them—I should not let anybody who called in carry off an envelope—I have no recollection whether this particular contract was accepted on the 27th.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 2, Priory Terrace, Starch Green Road, Hammersmith—I am out of business now—I have been in business for twenty-five years—I have not retired, I shall go into business again when I get an opportunity—I have known Goaling about twenty-five or twenty-six years—I have known a man named Hadrill or Harvey a short time—it was some time last summer that I was introduced to him—he carried on business in Newman Street, Oxford Street—I have done business with him to a small extent only—I remember going to him somewhere about 11th July—he owed me a small amount—I called at his office in Newman Street—I saw this cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there—I believe Hadrill tendered it to me, and asked me for the change—I could not give it him—he gave it to a man who was acting as his clerk—I have heard his name, if is Flirt or Flateau, or some such name—I don't know what became of the cheque eventually—Hadrill sent Flateau to get change for it somewhere else—he was to meet me at a public-house at the back of the County Fire Office—I suggested that—he came to me there—the cheque was not cashed then, and I went to try and get it cashed at Mr. Taylor's, at Hadrill's request—if I got it cashed he was to give me what he owed me—I did not get it cashed—it was drawn by Gray, and endorsed by Hadrill or Harvey, in my presence—Flateau took it away from the public-house to go over the water, somewhere at Camberwell, to get it cashed—there was a name mentioned, but I did</p>
