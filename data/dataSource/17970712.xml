               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing? - A. Yes; one of them got his hand in my pocket, and took out two keys; one of them was the key of Buckinghamgate, the other was the key of my own watch-box, and about five-pennyworth of halfpence, which were in the same pocket.</p>

Yes; as I was down upon my side, one of them said, d-n him, here is a watch, we will have that; I told them for God's sake, to save my life, and they should have it; they snatched at the chain, and broke it; they took the chain, but left the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any stick with you when you went into the Park? - A. Yes; they got that from me; the serjeant brought it to me afterwards, his name is Hemblin; when he came up, he said, d-n you, what are you about, is this you Mr. Keough, what are you robbing or murdering the man; says he, I know you very well, you will know me another time.</p>

He said, by the Holy Ghost, or some such thing, he did not know any thing of him; then there came up two of the patrols, and the soldiers all three ran away; I lost my hat and my stick; I got up as soon as I could, and ran after them; one of the patrols caught Ives, and had him away to St. James's watch-house; I was high enough to them to hear the patrol say, what is that you have dropped, he said, nothing; I saw him stoop and pick up something, but I did not see what it was; I went with them to the watch-house.</p>

             sworn. - I am a serjeant in the Coldstream regiment; I served in the same company on the continent, with Keough; I know him very well, and I have done duty with Ives, in Knightsbridge barracks: On the 14th of May, I was returning to my home near Tothil-fields, about twenty minutes past twelve; just as I entered the Park, at the stable yard gate, I heard something of a noise, which induced me to stop, when I heard a man begging very hard for mercy, but it was at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120004"/>distance of eighty or one hundred paces, that I could not perfectly understand; I waited a few minutes, and I heard a man say, that he was only a poor watchman, he had no money; and after that, I heard him say, for God's sake, spare my life, and take my watch; I then went to the spot immediately, and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground, and two soldiers on the top of him; then Keough lifted his head up, and the moment he held up his head, I knew his face; I said to him,"Oh master Keough, are you here?" upon that he got-up, and made use of an expression, by the mortal Saviour, says he, you are mistaken in the man; after that, he was coming up nearer to me, and I was afraid he was going to attack me,and I immediately struck him on the side of the head with this stick; the stick, with the violence of the blow, broke in the middle, so that I was left totally disarmed; after that, Ives got up, and I knew his face.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How near were you to Ives? - A. About three paces; when he got up, he had this stick in his hand, (produces it, the prosecutor's); I told him, it was of no use to resist, as I knew them very well, I was sure to have them, and they both held up their sticks to strike me; I was in plain cloaths at the time, and I told them I was a serjeant in the guards, and I should be sure to have them, and then Ives turned his back, and ran away from me, I pursued them, and then he turned about, and held up the stick again to strike me, and I alarmed the centinals in the park, but no one would come to my assistance, and I threatened one of them, that I saw, that if he did not come, he should be severely punished; upon my threatening the sentinel, he was induced to come; I told the sentinel, that if he attempted to pass, to run his bayonet through him, and then I seized him, and at that moment, two of the patrols came up, and he was secured; I took this stick from him.</p>

            Not at all; I never was farther from him than five or six paces: in the morning, I was going after Keough to his quarters, between six and seven, or somewhere about six o'clock, and there I met one of the officers, Patrick, and we went together to the house, where we had information that he was; when we got half way up stairs, I desired Patrick to go forward, which he did; I heard something pass up stairs, and I went up, and he had him in custody.</p>

I apprehended Keough the same morning that Ives had been brought in about half past twelve; I went out of the watch-house between four and five, to the place where I was informed they were, in King's-head-yard, Broadway, Westminster; I found Keough sitting upon the bed, and a woman in bed; he said, before I spoke to him, I will go along with you; I said, you had better come with me, as there is an accusation against you for a robbery in the Park last night, along with Ives, and if you are innocent, come along and clear yourself up; he then said, who put me up, or who acquainted me where I was to come after him, or something to that effect; I told him it was very immaterial, and I tied him and one Dempsey together, that was discharged, and they came along very willingly.</p>

On the night stated in the indictment I had been drinking at the Greenman, in New-street, Covent-garden, till near two o'clock, and on my departure from the house, not being able to get into my quarters, and being for guard the next day, I went to Westminster, with an intention to sleep with a comrade, where I kept my best clothes, that I might sooner get dressed; and, in Tothill-street, I met with a girl of the town; being rather intoxicated, I went home with her to her lodgings in the Broad-way; while I was getting ready, I was apprehended by serjeant Hemblin, and others; I can only solemnly declare I am innocent of what is laid to my charge, and throw myself upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

            (To Pevering.) Did you observe any marks upon Keough's face? - A.

               <p>The prisoner Ives put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>
               <p>On the night on which the prosecutor says he was robbed, I had been drinking in Paved-alley, St. James's-street, till twelve o'clock, and in crossing St. James's-park, in the way to my lodgings, I heard a noise as of men sighting, or struggling; being unwilling to be seen in the Park at that time of night, I made haste to get away, and stumbled over something, which I found was a walking-stick; I heard a cry of stop thief, and was stopped by the sentinel, when serjeant Hemblin, and the prosecutor, came up, and owned the walking-stick; I am entirely innocent of it. With respect to Keough, I had not seen him for twenty-four hours before.</p>

            About two yards; and directly as he knocked him down, he snatched his hat from under his head, and ran away; Mr. Sherborne called out, watch; I followed him across Holborn, there was a watchman came out of a court, and the prisoner turned back, I was not three yards from him all the time; I thought, by his returning back, that it was only a bit of a frolic, I went a little further and met Mr. Sherborne, and he said, it was very odd, that neither watchman nor patrol were to be seen; why, says I, I saw you knocked down, and your hat taken away; I sent the watchman home with Mr. Sherborne, and went down Holborn myself; I had not got above forty yards, before I saw the prisoner whistling, I let him go past two lamps, that I might be positive to the man; I laid hold of him by the collar, and told him I wanted him; he said, what for, I said, the hat that he had taken from the man in Dean-street; he said, he had no hat but his own, I put my hand up to his hat, and found this hat upon his own, (produces it); I then took him to the watch-house with this hat in my hand.</p>
               <p>Sherborne. This is my hat, I have had it ever since the latter end of last summer, I know it by this greasy part at the back of it, and the stamp I cut myself, it is neither round, nor square, nor oval.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been drinking, and I was coming down Holborn, I saw two or three men; Mr. Sherborne ran up against me, and two other men hustled him against me, and we both fell together into the mud; after I had gone away from them, I found I had got a wrong hat, and I was going back to see if I could find Mr. Sherborne to change it again, when the watchman took me, and said, he had seen me knock down Mr. Sherborne.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I am a watchman in St. James's parish: On the 20th of May, in the morning, I joined in the pursuit after three men, they passed my box; I saw Barfoot in pursuit of them, and he held up his hand, and said, three robbers, and I sprung my rattle, and ran down Sackville-street, and there the prisoner made a sort of a seint, as much as to say he was not in company; Mr. Barfoot said he was one of them; I said, I would take him if he would swear that he was one of them; he said he would swear to him, he was the last of the three; he had a small spaniel dog that followed him as far as Vigo-lane, and there we left him; the other two made their escape.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming from St. James's church to the Green-man and Still in Oxford-road, to go out of town to Uxbridge; I heard a noise in the street, I walked up Sackville-street, and saw a watchman and some people talking together; I asked what was the matter, and they said there were thieves, and asked me if I had met any men; I told them I had, and described them; I asked them what it was o'clock, and then the young man came, and said I was one of the robbers; I told him he was taking my character away; he said, if he was doing wrong his master would stand by him; I told him to take care of what he said; they searched me and found nothing but my watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sober or drunk? - A. I was sober enough.</p>

            About ten o'clock, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her again? - A. I went home very uneasy, and I got up early the next morning, and caught her standing at the very table where we drank the beer; says I, you robbed me last night, now I have you, you shall pay me my money back again; there were two women there, and they shoved me out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure, when you got change for the forty shilling note, that the five pound was in the pocket-book? - A. Yes; it might then be about nine o'clock, and I am sure it was there about two minutes before she took the book, I saw it there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This man desired me to sit between him and another woman, and then he asked me if I would have a glass of gin, and I said, I did not care, if he would give it me, and we went into the parlour, and had two quarterns of gin, and we went away to another public-house, to get change, and then we came to the Blach-horse, there he had some rum, and he wanted to quarrel with an acquaintance of mine that was in my company, I never saw the note in all my life.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutrix of this indictment knew there was property left in her house of six hundred pounds; this six hundred pounds has been appropriated to her use, which I have appropriated to the creditors and other persons, for flour, and bills contracted from the 15th of October to the 19th of February last; for flour brought in from sundry people, but most particularly from Mr. Cooper, near Abridge, one hundred and twenty pounds worth; the consequence was, I found the money was not prepared from the trade for the payment there of; Mr. Cooper was solicited by Mrs. Bennison to arrest me; of all which I can bring forward proof from the person who did arrest me, in consequence there of; there were also sums of money appropriated to her use.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. All this is no answer to the charge against you - you are charged with having married Mrs. Bennison, your former wife being alive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was not consistent with my knowledge that she was existing; I had not seen her for near five years; I had been credibly informed that she was not existing; all which she was apprized of before she married me.</p>

             sworn. - I am apprentice to Messrs. Bowley, the prisoner was in the capacity of carman: On Monday, the 5th of June, he was sent to the water-side for a load of salt, about five o'clock in the afternoon, to Billinsgate-dock, I was there to take an account of what was delivered out of the vessel; having a suspicion of his honesty I followed him home, till we got to the London-tavern, he there stopped the cart, and put a lump of salt into an empty sack, he drove the cart on till he came to the Green-dragon Inn, he there took out the lump of salt and carried it up the gate-way; he then went on, and his wife went over from the other side of the way, and took it, she was with him during the whole transaction, she waited while he put it in the sack at the London-tavern; I apprehended her with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had a good character with this man, I believe? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. The apprentice ordered me to deliver a ton of salt in Bishopsgate-street, and this was a piece that I thought belonged to that ton; the lumps were in danger of falling over, and I took out that one lump, and was securing it in the sack; I desired my wife to take care of it while I went after the horses, as they were gone on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - On the 7th of July, about half past ten at night, I met the prisoner facing Pear-tree-court, Shoreditch; she asked me, if I would give her a glass of gin, I was not disagreeable to it; I went down the court with her to her apartment, there was some discourse passed about sleeping together that night, the price that was asked, I gave, and she asked if we should have any thing to drink, I said, with all my heart, and we had some porter, then we pulled our cloaths off, and went to bed; I had just come home from sea, and had been receiving my money at Somerset-house; I awoke about half past three o'clock, and found no person in bed, and my breeches that had laid under that part of the pillow, that the prisoner said upon, were lying upon the pillow; I examined them, and found that I had lost my discharge from the navy, it was in a tin box made on purpose, a five pound note, three guineas, and my watch; I had observed my five pound note not a quarter of an hour before I met her; I searched the bedclothes, and every thing in the room, but did not find any thing, this was on the Friday evening; I saw her again the Monday after, at Worship-street, and there I saw my watch and my discharge box.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HARPER sworn. - I am an officer of Worship-street; Armstrong, and I apprehended the prisoner last Sunday morning; we found upon her two guineas, two half-guineas, two one pound notes, and twelve shillings and six-pence in silver, also a duplicate of a watch.

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular that had happened when he came to make his survey? - A. He had a basket and trowel in his hand, he said he would leave it in our cellar; I had very strong suspicion that he robbed Mr. Smith, and determined to watch him; he surveyed and signed the specimen, and was coming up stairs and I drew back; he came up into the passage, and looked round him, upon that he muttered something to himself about the specimen, and went down into the cellar again, I followed him, and saw him stoop and pick up the sat which was spread about the floor in the cellar, he took it up and put it to his nose to smell it, and then put it in his pocket.</p>

            Did you, at any time, leave any of your cloaths in the hands of this servant? - A. Yes, several times; I left my cloaths there, about the latter end of May; I left a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of kerseymere breeches, two pair of silk stockings, and a night shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose immediate care did you leave them? - A. I cannot say that I had left them in the immediate care of anybody; I have generally left them in the prisoner's care, and have always found them safe.</p>

             sworn. - I was servant at Mr. Danton's, the prisoner was my fellow-servant; I left Mr. Danton's on the 8th of June; I never saw Mr. Sharman till he was sent for on this occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being desired to brush any coat? - A. Yes; the prisoner at the bar desired me to brush a coat, two days before I left; it was a blue coat; she said she had a coat belonging to a gentleman that came to town once a month, and left his things in her care, and she asked me to brush it for her, as I was brushing a coat of my own, and I did brush it, and returned it to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you ever recollect, during the time you lived there, having had a coat to brush before? - A. I was only there a week, and I believe I brushed another in the course of that week besides.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that a much frequented house? - A. Yes; by Frenchmen.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many lodgers have they? - A. Only four when I was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How came you to leave the service on the 8th of June? - A. Mr. Danton told me he had missed two table spoons, and should insist upon their being found, it was about half past twelve, and I told him if I had left them any where, it must have been in the lady's bed room that I had waited upon, and it was not then a proper time to go into a lady's bed-room, but I would look the next morning for them, but they could not be found.</p>
               <p>Mrs. DANTON sworn. - The prisoner lived with me between five and six months, and lately I missed many things, and I suspected her, and sent her away on the 8th of June, on account of these two spoons; I delivered Mr. Sharman's coat to the prisoner, to put to the remainder of his things; after the cloaths were missed, I found her out, and asked her if she knew any thing of the cloaths, and she said she had left them in the drawers, in the room Mr. Sharman had slept in.</p>

               <p>On Friday, the 23d of June, my sister-in-law came to me, and told me a man was taken up for stealing something out of the garden; I have lived four years in the neighbourhood, and never changed a word with Mrs. George; when my sister had told me this, I went to them, I said, I would advise you to get an officer, there is no sufficient evidence to prove that any body saw it, by all means get an officer; accordingly they got an officer; Barker and I were standing at the door, I said to him, how was it; why, says he, I went up to the door, and Mrs. George laid hold of him, and said, this is the man; says he, I laid hold of him too; let me go, says the prisoner; no, says he, I will be d-d if I let you go before the husband comes; then an officer was got, and they were soliciting him to own it; how it terminated after that I cannot presume to tell; I said, I should like to see how it was, for he seemed to be very innocent; says Mrs. George, he was on this board getting over into the other yard; it was so low, that she might have laid hold of his coat and pulled him back again; he might have gone four different ways, one towards the Bird-cage, at Hackney, with more case than he could have come round to the front of the house.</p>

             sworn. - I saw two men walking about the door a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them go up to Gibbon's house? - A. I saw one man go into the house in a blue coat, that was not the prisoner, the prisoner was left standing by the posts, they had been talking to my mother under the window.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the two men talking to your mother first? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the men that went into the house, was one of the two that was talking with your mother at the same time that the prisoner was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that man come out again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You do not mean to say, that the other man spoke to your mother? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said, they were both speaking to your mother? - A. No; they were talking together, and the prisoner spoke to my mother, not the other man.</p>

             sworn. - I saw three men come out of Gibbon's house on the 10th of June, about eight o'clock at night, as near as I can guess; I was standing at my own door, I really believe this gentleman is one of them, they had each a silk handkerchief tied up in bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him again? - A. I really believe he is the man, but he has changed his dress, the shortest man of the three shut the door after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You do not mean to swear he was one of the men? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>

               <p>-PAUL sworn - I went with one of the officers who apprehended the prisoner, on the 6th of July, while he was in custody, to his lodgings, his wife was at home, she declared that she had nothing belonging to the manufactory in the house; upon searching a box by the bed-side, under several other articles were these pilasters, and several pieces of paint, which Bowyer has in Court, and which the prisoner afterwards confessed he had taken from the manufactory.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to induce him to confess? - A. I might say it would be better for him to say whether he had or not.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a petition, stating, that she had been early seduced from the paths of virtue, deserted by her seducer and her friends; that she was under the necessity of seeking a precarious subsistence; that on the 9th of June, she met the prosecutor; that he asked her to take a glass; that she accepted his polite offer; that he asked leave to see her home; that he took no liberty whatever with her; that suddenly rising, he said, you b-h,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120029"/>I gave you a guinea and one shilling instead of two shillings that I meant to give you; that she then received a violent blow from him, begged he would not murder her, and said, if he had lost such a sum it must be upon the ground; that during her cries the watchman interfered, that she readily went with him, and that, during her walk, though she was under the protection of the watchman, he kicked and beat her violently; that he searched her and found nothing; that she was, notwithstanding, committed, and, however innocent, was now an humble suppliant at the bar of that honourable Court, for a crime that she never was, or could be, guilty of; that she was innocent of the charge as well as of seeing any man in a smock-frock; that she solemnly afferrs, that no man entered the room, except the watchman, during her stay; further, that the prosecutor begged her to give him a guinea to shew his wife, and a week should not go over her head without its being madeup; that she throws herself upon the mercy of the Court, whose mercy and benevolent compassion she humbly implores; and, as the only atonement for a life-ill-spent, she means to throw herself at the feet of her deserted friends for pardon and protection.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any body with it to take care of it? - A. Nobody to take care of it; the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120032"/>returned, and came to the door to thank me for taking care of the trunk; I told him I did not know that I had any trunk under my care; I then went to the door, and asked him who that trunk belonged to, he said it belonged to him; I asked him where he brought it from, he told me from the New Inn, in the Borough; I then told him I did not think he was the person that brought it, and therefore I should not deliver it up till the right owner came to claim it, he then said his master lived a great way off, and he wished the trunk to be carried to where he was going to take it to; he then lifted the trunk into the shop, and there it remained till half past eight, when the prisoner came, with another man dressed like a ticket porter, to demand the trunk; a friend of mine, of the name of Jones, was at that time standing in the shop, and he asked him from whence he brought it; the prisoner told him he brought it from the Nag's head in the Borough; Mr. Jones asked him where he was going to carry it, he said, to a Mr. Jones's, a hosier in Fleet-street; I then told him I should not deliver up the trunk till Mr. Jones came to claim it as his property; he then said, I might send any body with him to Mr. Jones's, in Fleet-street, and then I should be satisfied; my friend, Mr. Jones, said he would go with him, and accordingly they opened the door and went away together.</p>
               <p>- JONES sworn. - I am a coal-merchant: I called at Mr. Hill's, where this man was with the trunk; as my name was Jones, and lived in Fleet-street, and not knowing any thing of Jones, a hosier, in Fleet-street, I said I would go with him, which I did, and with the other man, who said he was a ticket-porter; as I was going through St. Paul's Church-yard, they whispered something about Pater-noster-row, and turned up Pater-noster-row, which I conceived to be the wrong way to Fleet-street; I then beckoned to a stranger to follow me, I suspected they meant to run away; and when they got into Pater-noster-row, they did run away; the prisoner pulled a knife out of his pocket, with which he cut a butcher's lad, who came out to see what was the matter; I attempted to stop him, he ran on to the corner of Creed-lane, towards Thames-street, a number of people were passing, which rather checked him, and then he was stopped, and I charged Johnson, the constable, with him, whom I saw in the crowd; I did not see the knife at first, but I suspected it was something of that kind, as I had seen several people who attempted to stop him, draw back again; the box remained in Mr. Hill's custody at his door, the prisoner had not the box with him. (The trunk produced).</p>
               <p>Mr. Topham. I am sure this is my trunk, I know it by the mark on the outside; it was going on board a ship the next morning; it was put in the passage ready to take off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. It has been in my possession ever since.</p>

            Fifteen: On Saturday, the 17th of June, the prisoner came to our house between twelve and one, and wanted a copper of about sixty gallons, he then wanted the particulars; while I was in the accompting-house, writing them, I saw him put something into his apron, he then went to the shop door, I followed him, and asked him what he had got there, he said, nothing of your's, and that he would show me, he opened his apron, and there was a brass cock, (produces it); I have had it in my desk ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not offer to run away? - A. No, he was upon crutches; he waited till I got Tipper, the beadle, he begged for mercy, cried, and wished he had been dead before he came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to ask for a copper, with a large cock, and this cock was lying upon the copper; I took it up in my hand, as I might any thing else, and in a few minutes he turned about, and said, that is what you are about, is it? he said he would send for a constable, and he had me insulted by the people, till I could searce stand upon my legs.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price of the copper he asked for? - A. About five pounds; it was a second-hand one that I shewed him, the cock was tied round by the top in his apron.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he appear then as he does now? - A. Yes, and I think he had an apron on; after I was informed that he had taken the ribbon, I went out into Mitre-court after him, and told him, Mr. Fisher wanted him, and he immediately pulled out the ribbon, and said, he supposed that was what he wanted, and then he went down upon his knees, and begged for mercy.</p>

               <p>JAMES FINCH sworn. - I am a shoe-maker at Hounslow: On Monday the 12th of June, the prisoner, Shillie, offered me a pair of shoes for sale, for four shillings and sixpence; I did not chuse to buy them, I told him they were regimentals; afterwards he offered me sixpennyworth if I would sell them for him; I told him I would not have any concern with them, because they were regimentals; he said, he had three pair forced upon him on the account of a guinea due to him from the regiment; he offered me again a pot, or sixpennyworth, if I would sell them for him, but I refused.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a serjeant in the North Middlesex Supplementary Militia: Shillie made a confession to me, and positively said, that he took thirty-two pair of shoes; I never saw the man in my life before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What had you said to him to make him confess this? - A. I asked him plain, did he take these shoes; he said, yes, thirty-two pair.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did not you say it would be better for him? - A. I did not indeed, I know better than that; thirty-two pair was his reply.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you make use of any threats? - A. No; I asked him where he got these shoes from; he said, he took them out of the chest, thirty-two pair; I will repeat it fifty-thousand times if your Worship pleases; thirty two pair; I speak very plain, Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say what chest? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Lord Almighty, Sir, it is the biggest lie that ever was told; he never was there any more than you were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Heaton.) Had you any conversation at any time with the prisoner, Finch? - A. Yes; on Tuesday the 4th of July, I went up, and said, did you buy any shoes; he said, I did; how many pair? twelve; what did you give for them? one guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of those shoes? - A. About three shillings and sixpence a pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any property upon Finch? - A. No; I asked him if he could know the man if he saw him again; he said, if he could see him again, and it was the man, he would swear to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he swear to any man? - A. No; when he saw Shillie, he said, he could not positively swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these shoes; where were they found? - A. In Mr. Saxton's back yard, under the wood. I took them from there after he was taken; I had the care of the shoes, they were of this sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your Quarter-master? - A. Lieutenant Ormiston; he is answerable for the shoes.</p>
               <p>Shillie's defence. These shoes have been in a very large barn in Hounslow, this chest of shoes lies open to coachmen, hackney-coachmen, and post-boys, and anybody, to get to it; Mr. Saxton said, before the Justice, that he had found twenty pair of shoes; and that man that says I confessed before the Justice, knows very well that he was not there at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Saxton.) Q. Was Wilcox at the Justice's? - A. I was not there the second day myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Goutly.) Q. Did you see Wilcox at the Justice's at all? - A. I believe the man was in the yard, but I do not recollect the Justice asking him any thing. Both <rs id="t17970712-49-verdict271" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am one of the officers belonging to Lambeth-street, Whitechapel: In consequence of an information received on Thursday the 22d of June last, I went with my brother officers to No. 7, in <placeName id="t17970712-51-crimeloc279">Baillie's-place</placeName>

               <p>Q. In what state was the press? - A. In a proper state for working, it must have been then at work.</p>
               <p>

            Describe now what you found in the cellar? - A. By the side of the press we found these halfpence (producing a large quantity), just as they sell from the dies, unfit for circulation, they were not coloured; on the other side of the press, a vast quantity of blanks ready for seeding the dies; those which are struck, we tried with the dies, and they correspond exactly; I found two pair more of dies, in the same cellar where the stamping-press was, they are what is called the Irish-harp (produces them); I found a vast quantity of halfpence corresponding with them, in the rounsing-sack; produces another die for a halfpenny), this is a George the Second's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any finished halfpence? - A. Yes; there are a vast quantity of harps, Mr. Knowland will produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and the prisoners? - A. The three men, except Rimes and his wife, all acknowledged being there, and begged for mercy; they said we had caught them there, and hoped we would use them well; Mr. Rimes afterwards came in, and helped us to take the press to pieces; he said, I have been more used to it than you, I will help you to carry it up stairs, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any habitable part of the house besides? - A. The whole house was occupied by Mr. Rimes and his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the person of any of the prisoners? - A. I did one of them, but found nothing upon them.</p>
               <p>JOHN KNOWLAND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am another officer of the same office: On Thursday the 22d of June, I went, in company with the other officers, to No. 7, Baillie's-place, Aldgate; I went to the back door with Mr. Coomes, and the back door was opened for us by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120036"/>the officers that went in in the front; I and Smith went into the back cellar, where we saw a candle lighted in the collar of the press; I looked round in the cellar, and saw Broome and Barrett standing close by the press, stripped in their shirt-sleeves, and both their hands black and greasy; I saw Smith in the other cellar concealed under the stairs, his hands were black; I asked Barrett what he was doing there, and he said, he was out of employ and was very glad to get any thing to do; I then searched his pocket, and found, some halfpence that correspond with all these dies. (Produces them)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time of the day was this? - A. About one o'clock? - A. I then secured him, and examined the press; the dyes in the press were quite warm. After we had secured all the prisoners, I went up stairs with Mr. Coomes, and in the one pair of stairs, there was a turn-up bed tead, I searched the bed, and I found these harp halfpence, which are unfit for circulation, they exactly correspond with the Irish-harp dyes; we found an edging-tool, which is to make the edges of the halfpence smooth; and a sieve in the one pair of stairs, which is for sifting the halfpence after they are taken out of the rounsing-sack, to clean the saw-dust from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is master of the house? - A. Mr. Rimes; I asked him, and he told me so himself; he said he had lived there four or five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the woman his wife do you know? - A. I do not know, she may be for ought I know. (Produces the sieve and the press).</p>
               <p>Q. From your knowledge of these things, are there a complete set of implements for coining, from the cutting out to the finishing state, fit for circulation? - A. There are.</p>
               <p>ROBERT COOMES sworn. - I am an officer: the first thing I found was the rounsing sack, in the cellar, fixed to the ceiling; we found these halfpence, (producing them), mixed with saw-dust in it as it is now, they correspond with the harp dies; after they were secured, I went up stairs and found this rounding tool fixed. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Rimes's defence. My hands were clean; I shewed the officers my hands, they were quite clean, I had been shelling peas, and they saw the pea shells lying about.</p>

               <p>The other prisoners did not say any thing in their defence.</p>

Gentlemen, the facts I have to state to you, as committed by the prisoner, happened on the 8th of the same month; the offence therefore follows very speedly after the act of Parliament, and in fact may form a circumstance that may entitle the prisoner to mercy; the Constitution of this country has provided that mercy may be applied for, and you perhaps may conceive with me, that it will not be applied for in vain.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the circumstances, however, which form the subject of the present indictment, if I do not mistake the effect of them, constitute a crime in the law of England of so high a nature, that independent of this Act of Parliament would subject the prisoner to an indictment for a capital offence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the indictment charges. in the words of the Act of Parliament, that the prisoner at the bar, after the passing of this Act, feloniously did, maliciously, and advisedly, endeavour to seduce

               <p>Gentlemen, with these observations, I proceed to state to you the circumstances of the case. On the 8th of June, a person, who will be called to you as a witness of the name of

After this had passed, the prisoner at the bar desired him to go into a public-house, and he would there treat him with some liquor; when they had retired to this place, the Pack-horse on Turnham-green, the prisoner at the bar produced a paper, which I shall take the liberty to read to you, as I have it now in my hand, as it was delivered by the prisoner to Lowe.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, your attention will probably be called to the circumstance, that the printed paper thus delivered by the prisoner is passed upon a thicker paper, for the purpose of preservation; what use was to be made of it, when it was so carefully preserved, will be for you to judge.</p>
               <p>(Here Mr. Attorney-General read to the Jury the bill above alluded to: also another bill which was delivered by the prisoner to Lowe).</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the person to whom these papers were shewn, for the purposes that it will be your duty to collect from the whole of the evidence, felt that loyal indignation, which, to the honour of the British soldiery, has been unquestionably their characteristic; in consequence of this, without stating the indignation that he felt at the moment, he will inform you that he thought it his duty to secure this man for punishment; they accordingly went from this Pack-horse, on Turnhamgreen, till they came to Kew-green, where he produced these papers again to other soldiers; they will tell you the observations that were made upon them by the prisoner, and you will attend to the evidence that they will give.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if the evidence, on the part of this prosecution, should be such as shall satify you that the charge is founded in truth, it will then be incumbent upon the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120038"/>prisoner to answer it; and I have no hesitation in requesting that you will listen to all that is stated on the part of the prisoner, with a view to explain his intention, with the most humane wishes that can be consistent with public justice; on the other hand, when you have heard the case, I am sure you will recollect that the verdict you are to give, is that verdict, which the law that you are here assisting in the administration of, calls for at your hands; and it is the great blessing of a British constitution, that it has provided that, even after the decision of a Jury has been given upon the case of any individual, a temperate, a wise, and a humane attention is secured to every individual in the county, with respect to any particular favourable circumstances that may form a part of his case.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, when the Legislature passed this Act, they imposed a duty upon me, which I am bound to perform, to lay cases that are thus circumstanced before the justice of Juries of the country; when I have executed that duty, I repose the safety of the prisoner, and the safety of the public, in those hands which, as long as we are happy enough to be permitted to preserve them, will continue to preserve every one of us that portion of practical liberty, which perhaps does not belong to the nature of other human institutions.</p>

               <p>Lowe.

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner see you give it over to Leach? - A. Yes; we were all three close together, he was reading it in the presence of the prisoner when serjeant Calder came in; upon which the prisoner said, how do you do serjeant, will you drink, for I am a comrade; upon which serjeant Calder drank, and then he asked what I had got there; I said, it was a paper I had got from that man, pointing to Fuller; then serjeant Calder read it distinctly aloud, and while he was reading it, he made use of the same words that I mentioned before, that it was a true copy of every man's heart that wished well to his country.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after Calder had got to the conclusion, or during the reading of it? - A. During the reading of it, several times; I said to him, be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120039"/>so good as let the serjeant look at the other bills; upon that, I took that bill from serjeant Calder into my own hand, and he had the others from Fuller; serjeant Calder read them all through aloud, and then asked him if he had got any more; he said, no; serjeant Calder then said, you must consider yourself as a prisoner, and he took him prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding Q. You are a private in the Coldstream Regiment of Guards? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Lowe? - A. Yes, he is in the same regiment; On the 8th of June last, Lowe came with another man to a public-house at Kew-bridge, the prisoner is the man; they came into the tap-room and called for a pint of beer, Lowe saw me there, and came and sat down by me; Lowe asked me, is all well at Kew; I said it was; Lowe then called for another pint, the prisoner called for the first pint; Lowe asked him if he would take a walk over the bridge, which he consented to; he went over the bridge, and Lowe asked me to step to serjeant Calder.</p>

            Before you went for Calder, had you said any thing to Fuller, or he to you? - A. Nothing at all concerning the bills; we went to the Rose-and crown the other side of the bridge, Fuller and Lowe went into a little room, and when I came in they had a pot of beer before them, I joined them before Calder came; I told Lowe there was one wanted to speak with him; upon that he went out into the passage to serjeant Calder, and I remained with Fuller, but he did not say any thing to me.</p>

            How long was Lowe absent before he returned to Fuller? - A. He might be about two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return by himself? - A. Yes; and Lowe asked him if he had got any of these bills about him in his pocket; Fuller asked me if I could read; and I told him I could; with that he pulled the bill out with the word "Soldiery" at the top of it; the serjeant then came in, and Fuller said, serjeant, how do you do, will you drink, I am a comrade of your's; I was reading the bill at the same time, and the serjeant said, what have you got there; I said I did not know particularly, and gave it to him; the serjeant began to read it loud, and Fuller said, what do you think of that serjeant, I think it is a true copy of every man's heart that wishes well to his King and country, he repeated that about twice while he was reading it; he then asked him if he had any more, and he said, yes; but he did not think so much of it as he did of the other; and when the serjeant had read it, he asked him if he had any more; he said, no; and then he told him he must consider himself as a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you know that an Act of Parliament had passed two days before this happened, making it death? - A. I do not know that it made it death, every man had signed his name to it.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a bill offering a reward? - A. It was something concerning the army, and I thought it was very proper that I should assist in detecting him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Gentlemen of the Jury. I have the honour of attending you upon the present occasion, as Counsel for a very respectable and honest Baronet, who has felt it his duty to institute this prosecution against the prisoner:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120041"/>You have collected from the statement of the indictment that has been read to you by the Clerk of the Arraigns, that it imputes to the prisoner the offence of highway-robbery. Gentlemen, ordinarily speaking, I might content myself with staring, that that was the nature of the offence, and proceed to call the witnesses who are to substantiate the guilt of the descendant; but if nothing else had suggested to me the necessity of taking another course, the manner in which this prosecution is ushered in to your notice, upon the part of the prisoner, has rendered it indispensibly necessary, that I should state to you the circumstances rather more in detail. Gentleman, you have observed, that those of the other sex, who, from business, or curiosity, have been brought into this place, have, by the decorum of the learned Gentlemen, who is intrusted with the defence of the prisoner, been recommended to withdraw, and I understand, that before I came into the Court, an application had been made, that certain persons in the custody of the Sheriffs of the County, should be forth coming as witnesses on the part of the defendant; it therefore becomes my duty, a painful, but a necessary one, to state this case more at large than I should have been disposed to do, and I do it principally in mercy to the descendant, who now stands at the bar, that he may be apprized of the perils into which, by possibility, he may be about to place himself in, and that I may not be, at least a means of aggravation to his defence. Gentlemen, I shall present to you, in the character of the prosecutor, on this occasion, as honourable, as respectable, in one word, upon the subject of this prosecution, a man of as manly virtue as any in any part of the united kingdoms; I invite the most ample and scruinous inquiry into his character and conduct; I solicit, I intreat, I implore an opportunity of calling those, who unsolicited by him, persons of the highest rank in society have come to speak to his virtues and his character; I implore an opportunity which this prosecution, conducted in one way may furnish, of examining those persons, with respect to the character of the prosecutor. Gentlemen, unexplained, this may seem odd in a case of highway robbery, but I shall explain it satisfactorily. The prosecutor is a young Baronet of a family, of the highest distinction, as I have already told you: He, on the 19th of June, was going to see the state of the illuminations, as they were expected at Lord Malden's house, and it grieves me to have to address you, who had in the last discharge of your duty to witness an example of the loyalty, decorum, and the manly and soldier-like spirit of the Guards; it grieves me to be obliged so immediately to furnish you with a contrast of the depravity of a certain portion of that class; I hope to God, and I believe, that though the majority of them are of the description you have to day seen, and if they are of that character, we who value the constitution, have nothing to apprehend; I have to present you with the melancholy contrast; I am not instructed to conceal any thing that is indiscreet on the part of the prosecutor, the most honourable, the most sensible man may do a simple thing, and Sir

             must excuse me, if I say in the introduction to this business, that he has done a silly thing, beyond that, I defy the tongue of stander itself. Gentlemen, when he had got rear a place, called the Laundry, Sir John Riddell saw some women at a window, he, as a young man, and though he is a man of rank and fashion, he condescended certainly to joke and say some silly things to these women; the prisoner was a sentinel near the spes, it was his duty to protect the King's sabjects, whether in the course of this investigation you shall be obliged to arrive at the conclusion irresistible, that some of those upon whom that duty is cast are employed in those situations, only for the purpose of pillaging such of the King's subjects as may fall into their hands, to attack that, which, to a man of feeling, is of more importance than any property that he carries about him, his feelings and his character, it must remain for the final result of this enquiry for you to determine.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, having overheard this silly conversation with these girls, the prisoner at the bar put himself in the way of Sir John, who, in passing the sentinel, said,"soldier, I suppose you would have no objection to do something to these girls;" there was some silly conversation of that sort; upon which the prisoner at the bar instantly, and you will judge whether it was by preconcert from the facts that immediately followed, he immediately asked how he dared to propose such a thing to him; I should not quarrel with it if it ended there; he immediately stated, that he would not suffer the prosecutor to depart, unless he gave him a present, presenting, at the same time, his musket and his bayonet; Providence enabled him to do that which does not happen to us all to do; Providence writes a legible character now and then, you will see the prosecutor, and seeing him you will judge for yourselves, whether the most scandalous, indecent, and infamous imputation cast upon him by this man, falls in with your notions of such a legible character; I think, what happened upon the occation, is a pretty strong mark of it; he knocked down this armed soldier who had presented his musket, upon which some persons, who are proposed to be called to you, came up, I hope, in mercy to the prisoner, they will not be subjected to my cross-examination. Gentlemen, upon his presenting his bayonet, he took out two or three shillings, and gave to him, saying, he did not chuse to be detained; he then charged him with having put his hand into his breeches, and felt his p-e p-s; Sir John then insisted upon his being taken with him to the guard-house, a guard came up, and he was conducted to the guard-house, where a very satisfactory investigation took place.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, in this case, I am not called upon to enter into any nice disquisitions on the subject of highway robbery, the law upon that subject is clear and wise, whatever doubts may have been suggested they are all now done away; but I am not put to any nice disquisitions upon constructive highway robbery, the true construction of highway robbery is obtaining goods, or money, by any the smallest degree of terror calculated to export it from a person without his consent; need I then before discreet sensible men, argue upon the propriety of presenting a musket, and telling him he should be detained there till he made him a present; need I ask you, if such conduct was not sufficient to make a man of ordinary firmness feel some degree of terror? Under such terror Sir John parted with his property. But now we come to that which I consider, viewing it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120042"/>not as the question of the prosecutor, this honourable Baronet, but as that which I tender, much more the question of the public security.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, speaking always subject to the correction of his Lordship, I take it, that even if the facts were true, that the prosecutor had unfortunately, in a wretched moment of his existence, so lost fight of the character of his ancestry, so totally forgotten all that is due to himself, and to his own honour, had been so totally berest of all that belongs to man in society, as to commit the indecencies that this apparatus leads me to suppose may this day be imputed to him, it is no answer to this prosecution in point of law; but I have no difficulty in saying, if you believe that he conducted himself in the manner in which I am obliged to offend the chaste car of a Court of Justice, by, stating what the prisoner imputed to him, though, in point of law, it is no justification of that which was done, by opposing force to him, and taking his goods from him; if you believe the prosecutor to have been capable of the guilty act imputed to him, I take him to he a man not to be believed, and I do not ask you to believe him, upon his credit, or upon his character; upon his conduct stands the life of the prisoner; try him by the rules by which you yourselves would wish to be tried, or to try others, and there seems to me to be no difficulty in the case.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there were other persons committed for the share they had in this transaction; and I am not sure that I have not some blame imputable to me, and to my learned Friend, that they are not now at the bar; because, I think, in the course of this inquiry, it is not quite impossible that the learned Judges may think they ought to have been submitted to the consideration of a Grand Jury of the country; I confess, judging as I do upon this subject, with the able assistance that I have, I thought, perhaps, it was difficult, upon this particular species of prosecution, to convict them; and I thought, perhaps mistakenly, that it would be more decorus, and might lead to a more satisfactory investigation of truth, not to prosecute those persons with the present prisoner for a capital offence, but to leave him with an opportunity, if it should be thought discreet and proper to avail himself of it, of resorting to that charge against the prosecutor, of which it might have been said we had deprived him of his proof, by indicting the witnesses to the fact; but I think, Gentlemen, that standing here, charged with a very solemn and important duty as I am, I should ill discharge that duty if I sat down without stating, and God Almighty forbid I should state it from menace, but I do it from the true spirit, I hope, of gentlemanly candour; God forbid it should be supposed to be a menace, that if it should be thought good to revive this charge, it will be my duty to lay before you, a Jury of the country, such evidence as must make it impossible, for a single moment, to doubt, that the charge made, or insinuated against the prosecutor, is unfounded, and infamous in the last degree.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall call the prosecutor to prove the circumstances of this case; I will not insult him, or offend this chaste Court, by asking him, as a question from me, put by my able and learned friend to him, whether that charge is true or not; I shall wait till the season arrives, in which, if indiscretion should accumulate upon the aggravated case of this defendant, the question shall be asked on his part.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I hope the prisoner will well weigh, before he embarks in a mode of defence, that may be, by possibility, extremely dangerous; the prosecutor comes here, because he believes it to be his duty; and I am perfectly satisfied, under the advice you will receive from the Court, that you will weigh this case in the scale of mercy, and having done so, if you feel the necessity of this prosecution, you will meet your situation with the fortitude of men, and will pronounce him guilty, because your duty to yourselves, to the prisoner, to the prosecutor, and to the public, all concur in requiring it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. On the 19th of June, I went to Astley's, over Westminster-bridge, in order to meet two ladies, whom I expected to see there, I did not find them there, and therefore left Astley's soon after ten o'clock; I relide in Bruton-street: I was going to an assembly at Lord Malden's, and when I got to the end of the street, I recolected that my coachman and footman were both at Astley's, I thought it would be of no use to go home, knowing I should not have the assistance of any of my people; I had been told in the morning, that Lord Malden's assembly was to begin very early, that it was to be held in the garden, and my Lord's house was to be lighted up on the outside next to the Green Park; I went towards the Green Park, when I got to the further end of the place, I looked towards St. James's Park, I then noticed a woman crossing from the place, of whom I thought I had some knowledge; I followed that woman across the stable yard, and lost sight of her in that corner of it which leads into the Park; when I got into the Park, I noticed an old woman standing close to a window, and I observed that she was in close conversation with two women who were within the house, the sentinel was then standing near the window, but not quite close to it -</p>
               <p>Q. When you speak of the sentinel, do you mean the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes. I passed on, and went up the Park as far as Lord Grenville's garden; when I had got there, I recollected that possibly one of the women at the window might be the woman I had seen cross the stable-yard; I therefore returned to the window to lee whether it was so or not, and saw the old woman standing at the place at which I had first seen her, but the soldier had left the place where I had at first seen him; the old woman was in the Park, talking to two women, who were within the house; the prisoner was then standing behind the old woman.</p>

            About a quarter after ten o'clock, either the old woman or the soldier had a mug in their hand; in order to see whether it was the woman or not, I entered into some foolish conversation with the women in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120043"/>house; there was likewise a man servant, I believe, belonging to the house, standing in conversation with them; during the conversation I had with these women, both the old woman and the soldier left the window. and went out of my sight.</p>

            Three or four minutes; I noticed that when he was talking with the old woman, he had not his firelock upon his shoulder; as soon as I had done speaking to them, I went towards Lord Malden's garden a second time; when I had got as far as the steps of the Queen's Library, I noticed, as I passed him, that he looked in my face, and thinking that he was, perhaps, diverted at my speaking to the same woman that he had been speaking to, I said to him, as I was walking along, my friend, I suppose you would like to have something to do with those women; he answered, yes, that he should; on which, I said, then you had better go and ask them to come out to you, or do you wish me to go and ask them to come out to you; I am not certain which of the two phrases I made use of; while this conversation took place, he had followed me from the side of the steps where he was when I first saw him, to the other side of the steps, and the instant that I had said that, he seized me by the coat, and said, how dare you propose such a thing to me; I instantly struck him, so violently, that he very nearly fell to the ground, and dropped his firelock, his hat fell off his head; he at that time called for help, but in a very low tone of voice.</p>

            At the time this conversation was passing, had you seen whether there was any person within any reasonable distance? - A. I am very certain that their was no person near; immediately a man ran past Lord Grenvill's garden, and laid hold of me by the right arm; that man. I believe, was Sharman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know positively whether it was Sharman? - A. I have reason to believe it was him from his heighth; he called again for help, and a third man then came to his assistance, I think, of the name of Beeder, and he laid hold of my right arm also.</p>

            Whether the tone of voice was at all raised in which the help was called for the second time? - A. I think it was, a good deal; the first that came to his assistance was a tall and a thin man, I may have made a mistake, and confounded the names; the second man was a shorter man; upon the second man coming up to the assistance of the soldier, the sentinel, Davis, said to him, take up my firelock; one of them answered, which I am not certain, you had better take it up yourself, but first load it; the firelock was taken up by somebody and given into Davis's hands, and when he had it in his hands, finding I still struggled with all three, one of them said, why do not you put your bayonet to his breast, or words to that effect; he accordingly did press his bayonet very strongly against my breast, so that I found a very strong pressure against my chest; he then said, God d-n you, I will not let you go unless you make me a present; I immediately put my left hand into my waistcoat-pocket and took out some shillings, I turned some out of my hand into his right hand, I believe three or four fell into his hand; he looked at them, and said, what is this, this is not enough; I immediately emptied the remainder that was in my hand into his, and was proceeding to give him some more; I was at that time so very much alarmed, that had I had a very large sum in my pocket I should certainly have given it all; I said to him, I had rather give all I have in my pocket than be detained; upon that a fourth man came up, dressed in coloured cloaths; I said to him, come here, and the soldier immediately called to him for help likewise; this fourth man walked up rather slowly, and as he walked it struck me he might possibly be a constable that I had seen sitting, in the day time, at the gate of St. James's Park; I said, is that a constable; two voices, from the four people then surrounding me, answered, yes, it is, but which of them it was I do not know; upon his coming up, he said, what is the matter; the prisoner said, that gentleman, or that rascal, or some such expression, that the person then in his custody, meaning me, had asked him if he wished to know a girl, and if his p-e p-s stood, and had put his hands into his breeches to feel, and grosser expressions than that; while he said that, my hand was in my pocket upon my money, I withdrew my hand from my pocket the instant that I heard that beastial accusation, and said to the constable, constable, instantly conduct me, with this man, to the Colonel of the Guard; the two men who first laid hold of me left me, and the man that I took for a constable took hold of my coat; I directed him to take me to the window where the girls were; he took me to the window, and they told the constable all the conversation that had passed, and the prisoner likewise told his story; I desired a second time to go to the guard; he said, that he would take me to the guard with a file of men, or, that a serjeant and a file of men should be sent for; I could not conceive why this constable had not authority to take me to the guard-house without waiting for a serjeant and a file of men; however, a serjeant and a file of men did come, he keeping me there; very soon after several serjeants came into the Park, and one of them desired to know what was the matter, serjeant Olive, to the best of my knowledge, came up first; upon his hearing the prisoner's account, I desired him to go to the window, and learn from the servants.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120044"/>Q. How many people continued there? - A. The prisoner, the pretended constable, and the tall man, all surrounded me; the other was gone at my particular desire to fetch a serjeant and a file of men, they all staid in the Park; I went to the Mess-room, and asked for the Colonel of the Guard; some serjeants staid with Davis till they relieved guard, and then they brought him in, and two of the other persons concerned, the other had run away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. I understand that you went that night to Astley's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In returning home you went to see Lord Malden's house lighted up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was entirely accidental your being in the Park? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the Park any time previous to that? - A. Never in my life at that time of night.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had spoke to these women you went away? - A. Yes; the prisoner went away before me.</p>
               <p>Q. The conversation with the prisoner took place in the Green-Park? - A. Yes, in consequence of his looking me earnestly in the face.</p>

            This conversation did not take place till after you had given him the money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give him that money to get away, in consequence of having knocked him down? - A. No; but because I was in great fear in consequence of the assault, that assault might be an intent to commit murder, for any thing I knew; I was afraid of my life, I was afraid of my liberty, and I was afraid of my honour, because I thought, being seen in company with such persons in the Park, if any person had passed who knew me, it would have been a very disagreeable thing, and therefore I would have given him, upon that account, a great deal more money.</p>

            Was it not, after you had knocked him down, that you gave him the money, and then a scuffle took place? - A. The scuffle was at an end before that, I was completely imprisoned.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made the first accusation when the other man came up? - A. The prisoner; the constable asked what was the matter, and he said, I had asked him if his p-s stood, and had put my hand into his breeches.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I have a great many more witnesses, but I will not insult the prosecutor, by supposing that his evidence wants any aid.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the crime that is laid to my charge; I was posted at the King's guard at nine o'clock; about ten, there came an old woman that washed for the people in the house, she knocked at the window once or twice, the window was opened, that was about six yards from my post; about half past ten, this gentleman came through the gate, into the Green-Park, he looked at me very hard, he turned up towards the Bason in the Green Park, he turned back, and looked at me again, I did not know what he meant; I was very dry, and I went up and asked the women if they would give me some clean water, or table beer; they gave me some, and that gentleman came up to the window, what conversation they had I do not know; I did not think it prudent for me to stop there; I went to my sentry-box, and laid down my firelock behind my box, and soon after that, the gentleman came up to me, and said, "soldier, should not you like to have connections with these girls?" I said, I should not mind it in the least, if I had one of them here, and he made no more to do than to take hold of my breeches, "sentinel," says he, "do your p-s stand?" no, says I, if I had them here, I don't know but they might; he opened the slap of my breeches, and took hold of my t-s in his hand, I had my firelock in my hand, I immediately seized hold of his coat, and said, what did he mean by that; I called out for assistance, and then Sharman came up; I said, I insist upon your taking charge of this man, he accordingly took hold of him, he made a scusstle to get away; I called out again for assistance, and then there came up another man, and then Sir John was still, he put some money into my hand, and said, I will give you any thing before I will be detained; no, says I, I will take you a prisoner to the Guard-room, and I sent Sharman to the Guard-room for a serjeant, and a file of men; accordingly they came, and I laid my charge, that this gentleman did so and so with me; I shewed the Colonel the money he gave me, and I was confined all night.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, and James Skirving, a publican, who gave him a good character for morality.</p>

            Look at that note, and tell us if you have any correspondence with any house of that name? - A. This is a bill that was tendered to me by Ortman, on the 27th of May; I told him it was a forged note, and that we knew none of the parties; we had no correspondence at Yarmouth, nor did we know any of the parties.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not any correspondence at Yarmouth, nor are you acquainted with any such names? - A. No, we are not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I suppose all you mean to say is, that you have no correspondence with any such person at Yarmouth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is there any body here that has been at Yarmouth? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I am in the presence of God, these witnesses are mistaken with regard to my person, as I hope to prove by upright and just witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended that it was essentially necessary to prove the non-existence of such a person at Yarmouth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. We are now upon a question of evidence, and it must go to the Jury-let us see how the case stands:-here is a bill drawn by a person at Yarmouth, who prosesses himself to be a correspondent of Pybus, Call, and Company; a witness is called, who is a clerk in their house, and he swears that they had no such correspondent; then it is not a genuine bill, and what it imports to be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Taking it that the instrument is a false instrument, then the prosecutors are to prove the averment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. They prove that there is no man of the name of Cavendish corresponding with that house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. it is not the best evidence that the nature of the case will admit of, because they might have brought a person here from Yarmouth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. The witness has proved that no such man corresponds with their house, that is a fact positively sworn to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Ortman). I think you said before the Magistrate, that the person who called at your house, had his hair well dressed and powdered? - A. I did not.</p>

            About a quarter before four, the boy always takes some beer to a shop in the neighbourhood, I asked him where he was going with that beer, and he said Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Hindes; and I am sure he was there before that, because I had spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he was there till six? - A. I was writing a letter to my brother at Egham, and I heard the bell go, it goes a quarter before six; I sent my boy after the bell-man with a penny, and instead of giving it to the bell-man he had put it in the Penny post-office; I asked him why he was gone so long; and he said the Post-office was half way up Bond-street; I sent him to get it back again, he got it, and I gave it to the bell-man; it was then past six, and while he was gone, Mr. Hindes and Mr. Lee, and Lord Macdonald's servant, were conversing about the letter, and offered to lay a wager it would go just as safe being put into the Penny-post, as if it had been given to the bell-man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you all this time? - A. I had never been out of the house, I was no where but in the bar, and in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the time of sending out the beer to this neighbour, and sending out the letter, had you seen the prisoner frequently? - A. Yes; he sat down directly under the dial, facing the bar-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that during that time, he never went out? - A. I never missed him all that time, to the best of my knowledge; I do not think he could have gone out without my seeing him.</p>

               <p>PATRICK DONOVAN sworn. - Mrs. Sudbury called me, and I went with her, and saw that tall man with the bed in his arms; he said he had bought it for a shilling, and was going to take it away; I said, do you think Mrs. Sudbury would sell that feather-bed for a shilling; she must be a fool; he said she did, and he would have it; I desired her to call another watchman, and we took them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Timms's defence. We had been drinking together, and we lit of two girls, and this man went up stairs with one of the girls, and I followed them up; and we were to give them a shilling a piece; and the girls wanted more money to lay with us all night than we were willing to give them; and they went again and knocked with their shoe-heels as they went down; he came into my room, and said he would not lay there; I told him not to make such a noise, and he said he bought the bed for a shilling, and he would have it; and he went down stairs with it; there was no candlestick, and I held the candle till I burnt my fingers with it.</p>
               <p>Robertson's defence. Two girls took us to this house; the girls rapped at the window, and they let us in; we agreed for a bed for a shilling, and I gave her the money; the girls wanted more money than two poor men like we could give them, and they went away.</p>

Yes; I ran after her down the alley, and was crying out about my pocket-book, and I met with the prisoner M'Glue's wife; she said, what is the matter with you; and I told her I had been robbed of my pocket-book; and she asked what it contained; I told her ninety-six pounds; she told me to go over to another public-house opposite, that she pointed out to me, and call for a pint of beer, and I should get my pocket-book again, and then I should go down to their house to dinner.</p>

             sworn. - The prosecutor on the 30th of May came up to the Police Office in Hatton-garden, about five o'clock, and said he had been robbed; I went down to the Three-tuns, in Turnmill-street, with the prosecutor and another officer, there we saw Edward M'Glue in the taproom, we took him in custody into the parlour, and searched him, upon him I found a dollar, four shillings, two sixpences, and three-pence three farthings in copper; I then went in search of his wife, and Elizabeth Allen, and I believe it was about half past six, coming up the same street again, just at the end of Peter-street, I heard a voice say, Ford, do you want me? I turned round and saw the prisoner Allen, I said, yes, I do, Bett, you must go with me; says she, I heard you wanted me; before we came up to the Three-tuns door, I met with Mrs. M'Glue, I told her, she likewise must go with me, she refused, but I told her she must, and then she went, I took them both into the Three-tuns, and in the kitchen I searched

             M'Glue, and on her I found a huswife, with some duplicates in it, an old pocket-book, with some duplicates, and a bad shilling, but nothing else on her; by that time, one of my brother officers, Rose, had come down to the Three-tuns, we found some silver upon her, but no notes; I went the next day to enquire about the notes to the broker that had sold out for him, and got the number of the notes, since that, there has been two of the notes come in, but we have not been able to trace them any further than one of the notes had got wrote upon the back, No. 20, but we cannot tell where, we had been about a great deal, but have not been able to trace any one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe, in fact, you had enquired in the neighbourhood after Allen? - A. No; I had been in quest of her.</p>

            It was known at the public-house, that she had been charged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>M'Glue. Q. Was not I very much in liquor when you took me? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>M'Glue. Q. Was not Morson drunk? - A. Yes, more so than you were; Allen, before the Magistrate, charged you with picking his pocket of a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>M'Glue's defence. The prosecutor never produced any pocket-book in the public-house at all, I never saw any such thing; after he had got it changed, he said, I will go; I went to another box, and played at shove halfpenny with a great many people while he was gone; Mrs. Baker does not say she saw any pocket-book, and I could not form any idea of robbing a man that I never knew had any property.</p>
               <p>Mrs. M'Glue's defence. I saw Morson and M'Glue smoaking their pipes together, and I begged of him to come home, and he gave me a punch in the face; sometime afterwards, I saw this man a crying, I asked him what was the matter, and he said, he had lost all his property, knowing he had been in company with M'Glue, I desired him to go back, and try if he could hear any thing of it; I never saw Bett Allen at all, and he would not have known the public-house again if I had not taken him there.</p>
               <p>Allen's defence. I went into the house for a pint of beer, and the prosecutor asked me to have some ale, and I said, I had rather not, and that man, the watchman, said, if it was gin, I could drink it; the prosecutor was very much in liquor, and he asked me if I could accomodate him with a place to sleep in, he was reeling about the street very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120053"/>drunk; I left him, and some time after, I was coming up the street, and I was told that Mr. Ford wanted me, that a man had been robbed of 500l. and I went to Mr. Ford, and tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him, and he said, yes, he did want me, and I was taken into custody; he was so intoxicated that he would have sworn to any woman.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Upon what ground did you deliver him these nutmegs, in consequence of what he said, or in consequence of the note? - A. In consequence of both; when he first came into me, he said he was sent from the warehouse, to have a bill of parcels of them; I then asked him, why should Beachcroft and Company send for three pounds of nutmegs; he said, because they wanted some large ones for shipping; I then asked him what his name was, and he told me it was John Brown, upon which the bill of parcels was given him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your partnership? - A. No other person has any interest in the business but Mr. Abraham Newman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. If this man had come without this written paper, you would not have delivered them? - A. No</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was only in consequence of his bringing that paper, that you delivered the goods? - A. I should not without asking a great many questions.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. It was both together that induced you to deliver them? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Gentlemen, I am sure I should but insult you and the Court, by saying that there has not been an attempt to commit a fraud in this case; I will content myself with calling the witnesses to the character of the prisoner, and that, I am sure, will be the best way of appealing to the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
