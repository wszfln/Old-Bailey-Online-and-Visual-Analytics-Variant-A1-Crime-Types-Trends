White's house is 50, I think—I may have said 52 before the Magistrate; I made a mistake about that—the front door of the house was on the jar, so that anybody could walk in, just as I did—the first time that I found the woman sleeping in the left hand room the door was pulled to; anyone could walk in from the stair case—White's room was locked when I first went—on the second occasion she was in bed with her husband—when I said I should charge her with unlawful possession, she said, "I know nothing of it; I only hung my clothes in the room during the last fortnight"—when I told her I should take her to the station for receiving the hamper and these pieces of muslin, she said, "I know nothing of them; the door is always open, and some person may have brought them there"—she also told me people were in the habit of sleeping on the staircase.</p>

I have been shown the muslin which was found at White's—there were nine pieces in the hamper when it went away—I have been shown and have identified four pieces, and afterwards I was shown four other pieces among the things found at Lawson's—they were exactly the same in every way; part of the same bulk—the value of the things found was worth about £1, I think.</p>

I have seen a pair of sheets and two table-cloths and towels and pillow slips, but not all the things—this is good book muslin; you would not buy the four pieces for 2s.—there is a good deal of muslin of this kind, but this is made up into short window curtains in the same size and way as mine was, and it is the same quality of muslin.</p>

On 17th December, about 4 p. m., I was with Eagle at the top of Snow Hill—a statement was made to me, and I saw McClean standing against the pillar-box at the Holborn corner of the Old Bailey—he stood there for a minute or two, and then walked on towards Holborn, and just opposite Spiers and Pond's, Jones joined him, and they walked over the Viaduct together as far as the Circus on the left—they then crossed to the right side in conversation, and stopped at Gamage's, a hosier's, at the corner of Leather Lane, and while they looked in at the window we passed them and walked as far as Furnival's Inn, and turned round, went back and met them—Eagle stopped McClean, and I attempted to stop Jones, but before I could get properly hold of him we got to the other side of the street—we had a tussle, and the street being slippery, we both fell—he was stopped by somebody—I got hold of him and said, "I am a Police-officer; I take you in custody on a charge of uttering counterfeit coin"—he did not speak—I took him to Snow Hill Station, and he was charged with being concerned with McClean, who was brought in by Eagle, in uttering counterfeit coin—he made no reply—I searched Jones, and found in his trousers pocket a bad half-crown of the same date as the one which was broken, and in good money four sovereigns, fifteen shillings, six sixpences, a threepenny-piece, and 2s. 5 1/2 d. in bronze, and in his coat pocket two collars, two new pocket-books, four shillings' worth of postage stamps, a penny, two cakes of scented soap in these wrappers, and some memos on pieces of paper—he said he had no fixed address—I found an envelope on him relating to Frederick Smith, 50, Brampton Street, Walworth—I</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 18, Park Road, Regent's Park, and am proprietor of Allen's Riding School—on 28th November, just before 4.30 a. m., I was disturbed and got out of bed, opened the door and heard someone—I returned and put on my trousers and waistcoat to go downstairs when I heard the basement door open—I went back, threw up the bedroom window and saw the prisoner and another man go from the house and rush to the front gate—my wife was pulling the bell in our bedroom—the men turned to the right, and the gas lamp was full on their faces—I ran down and out at the front gate—they got over the wall, which would bring them into Lawn Gardens; mine is a corner house—I spoke to a cabman, who turned his horse round and drove on, and a constable brought the prisoner back in from 7 to 15 minutes—I found on my basement floor two great coats and a hat which had evidently been put over a candle, as it was burnt—the basement door had been unbolted top and bottom from the inside—I found a piece of candle, a pair of boots, and a pair of socks or stockings which did not belong to me—the men had had some chicken and two bottles of stout in the kitchen, and had opened the drawing-room door and taken a satchel from the table and put it on the hall chair—this corkscrew, knives, hat and coat are mine—the coal cellar door was quite safe overnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Lloyd, Lowe, and Co., shipbrokers, of 7, East India Avenue, Leadenhall Street—we had to deliver the cargo of the ship <hi rend="italic">Avon</hi>, and issued a release to the clerk on board, who had to deliver by delivery order—we employ professional clerks, who have a knowledge of the details of the work, and we employed Johnson and Rolfe; they had the sole possession of the cargo, among which was 5,300 bags of linseed, consigned to Ashton, Erridge and Co., marked with a diamond and certain letters—this is the delivery order—Johnson and Rolfe went on board the day after the ship arrived at the end of November—they had to deliver into certain craft specified in the release—I received a communication from the police, and on December 11 I was taken to the barge <hi rend="italic">John</hi>, lying in the River Lea, by Stevens's Wharf—that is a long way from the Mill wall Docks—I went on board, uncovered the tarpaulin, took off the hatches, and found about 600 bags of linseed with the mark in question, and the linseed corresponded in quality and quantity with what we lost—the barge <hi rend="italic">John</hi> was not mentioned in any of our delivery orders.</p>

We received the information about the 9th or 11th from Finch and Judge, of the Bow Police—Johnson is employed by Mr. Albert, and we pay Mr. Albert—there were five different consignments of linseed, but four had been delivered, one of which was to Game, Bowes—when any barge is loaded it is John son's duty to give a pass in the same form as he gave the pass for the <hi rend="italic">John</hi>—there was nothing irregular in it, except the number of the barge; there is no such number in existence—a great number of barges had been loaded in the course of the day, the vessel had been unloading some days, and Johnson and Rolfe had been employed during that time—they kept separate tally-books—in this tally-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) here are two entries in Johnson's writing, one to Game, Bowes and Co., and one to Ashton, Erridge—half the entry is by Rolfe, and the other by Johnson—they make together 600 bags, and the whole is signed by Johnson.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> These 600 bags formed part of the last parcel delivered—Johnson's tally-book shows that he took over from Rolfe 310 bags, and delivered 290 himself, making 600, "into Ashton's hired craft <hi rend="italic">John"</hi>—that is signed by Johnson—the barge is always specified in the delivery order—none of the above orders mentioned the <hi rend="italic">John</hi>—when the barge leaves the dock it is his duty to give a pass.</p>

               <p>Green, about 100 yards from 31, Walham Avenue—on the night of the 26th of December, at 11. 56, I was called by the prisoner to Walham Avenue—I went with Hinson and the fire escape and engine to the Avenue—I there saw the prisoner—I asked her whereabouts the fire was, and she said it was upstairs in the first floor landing—I went up there—I found a small mat alight lying on the floor between two doors, and the flooring underneath the mat alight; the bottom corner of the doors were alight—I got a bucket of water, and put it out—the prisoner was then downstairs—I asked her if she could account for the fire—she said she could not, but the old man had been running in and out two or three times during the day—I asked her his name, and she said Hong—I searched the rooms on the first floor to see if there was any fire or any person inside—I found no one—the rooms were perfectly safe when I went away—I found no fire except that on the mat and the doors—I then went away, leaving Hinson there—he returned to the station at 12.40 a. m.—I ordered him to go back—soon after that I was again called to 31 by a man, a stranger; I then found the things well alight in the front room first floor—the bed was on an iron bedstead—at that time the prisoner was outside the door, and I had to get one of my men to keep her outside from interfering with me in the execution of my duty—in turning over the bed to extinguish the fire, I found what appeared to be the remains of half a pound of butter; it was in paper, but partly melted—there was a paraffin lamp on the washhand-stand; it was empty, no oil or wick—two females tried to come up the stairs, but I ordered them down again—I asked the prisoner how she could account for the second fire, but I could get nothing from her definitely—it is hard to say whether she was sober or drunk; she was very excited, but whether caused through drink or not I was not able to say—a constable was sent for to remove her out of my way, which he did.</p>

I live at 14, St. Pancras Road, and am a cook at a coffee and dining room—on 27th December, about twenty minutes to 1 a. m., I was coming down Pentonville Road, when the prisoner and another man said, "Will you have a cup of coffee?"—I said, "All right"—I did not have it—he tried to steal my watch and chain; when I saw what he was at I buttoned up my coat; we walked on, and he tried to pull me round Cammon Street—I would not go round there; I walked a little way down, and crossed the road there—then the prisoner put his leg in front of me and threw me down—I got up; he threw me down again, the side of my face getting grazed on the ground—he made another attempt to get at my watch and chain—I managed to get up—I said, "I will give you half-a-crown if</p>

I live at Salisbury Terrace, Finchley—in 1884 I was appointed deputy-superintendent of the cemetery—I never had an appointment—I began to be paid from 25th March, 1884—I was paid quarterly, and received my first money about the midsummer quarter—the prisoner was the superintendent—he took the Green Dragon public-house in August, 1885; previous to that he paid the labourers' wages usually—after my appointment it was my duty to check the men's time, and if they lost time or were absent from sickness, I reported to the prisoner—up to the time of his taking the public-house the labour book was wholly in his writing—I paid the labourers, whenever he was away, at the office next to the entrance of the Board's lodge—when the wages were to be paid the book was handed to me with the names of the persons, and the amounts against them entered in it—the column was not cast up—I had nothing to do with these entries—the prisoner gave me the money—I only attended before the Burial Board once with regard to this book, that was when the prisoner was ill—the whole of the book is in the</p>

               <p>prisoner's writing with the exception of pages 119, 150, 151, 162, 163, and 172—the names of Benjamin Peat on page 119, Peat and Cooper on page 162, Batchelor and Cooper on page 163, are in the prisoner's writing—the only figures of mine are these on the pages I filled in—the castings on these pages are the prisoner's; there is not a single casting in that book by myself—I have often paid the wages since August, 1885—the prisoner was not there on Saturdays very often—when he took the public-house he came to me after a Board meeting and said he had permission from the Board to take a public-house on consideration that he paid me 10s. a week extra for the extra work I had to do—he paid me the 10s. a week—sometimes he would bring the book to me on a Friday, and the money—sometimes I received a telegram from the prisoner to send for the book and money—the book was under his control—if he did not bring it on Friday, the book would be sent to me, made up except as to the castings, and money corresponding with the amount put down—occasion ally the prisoner has omitted the man's name and I could not pay the man, but the money has tallied with the book—the book was sent back to the prisoner on the Saturday or Monday—when Bonnor was there he took the book back on Saturday afternoon as a rule, but since Bonnor, who lived near the prisoner's public-house, was discharged at the latter part of August or beginning of September, I have often had it from Saturday to Monday—when I had the book it was left in the office—when I have paid the wages, I have paid one man at a time—on one or two occasions I have paid without the book—that was when the prisoner has brought the money over and left the book at home or somewhere, then I had a list of the men, and the prisoner made the book up afterwards—I mustered the men every morning, and checked their times—I knew of my own knowledge what men they were, and the written list I had I made myself, then next week when the men were paid they would sign in the took for two weeks instead of one—I could not say at what dates I had not got the book; I don't think it exceeded three times—the prisoner brought me the money himself—he entered the names—the next week I found the names and amounts entered in the book—on the roads, as a rule, there were two men, one from each cemetery, and St. Pancras always paid the men the first week when they were put on, and Islington the last—when it was St. Pancras' time to pay, the columns were filled in against the men's names; when it was Islington's turn to pay, either the words "joint" or "Mr. Lewis" were written in pencil in the columns where the money ought to be; no money was written in—I had no money then to pay—that memorandum, "joint" or "Mr. Lewis," was made by the prisoner—for the week ending 11th October, 1884,. I find the names by. Eaton and Walter Valentine as being paid £1 4s. each in the prisoner's writing—the prisoner paid that week, and on 8th November, 1885—on 13th March, 20th March, June 4th, June 11th, June 18th, June 26th, July 31st, August 6th, and August 31st, 1886,1 paid George Bolding £1 1s., the amount then entered—the amount now standing against his name on these dates is £1 4s.—I had nothing to do with altering the figures from one to four—the signature was taken from me for the £1 1s.—I know nothing of these alterations into £1 4s.—about the last fortnight the men were on this drainage work the prisoner allowed them two pints of beer each a day—the beer was fetched from Prior's should not think that</p>

               <p>had anything to do with lessening or increasing the men's wages because Prior's name appears in this book as receiving some money—I don't know if he charged the Vestry; he sells nothing but beer, he is a publican—his name appears as receiving £1 and £1 4s.—that is one, and two weeks after Bolding was discharged—Prior never did any work in the cemetery—on June 26th, July 3rd, September 25th, December 11th, 1886, February 19th, and February 26th, 1887, there is the entry, George Dodd £1 4s., in the prisoner's writing—I paid the wages on these dates and did not pay Dodd, and his name was not there when I paid the other men; George Dodd was not working there then—his name is on the very last line before the casting up, except on February 26th, when Benjamin Peat's name comes after it, Peat's name was not there when I paid; it is in the prisoner's writing—Peat was not working for the company at the time—these initials, "Paid F. D.," for a receipt are not in my writing, they stand for Frederick Dunsford—in this other case it is "G. D."—on July 27th, 1888, my wife started to pay the men, and then the prisoner came over before she finished—on January 8th, 1887, Roberts was paid £1 0s. 1 1/2 d.—the next week, January 15th, I paid him £1 1s., his full wage—this is his mark, "His mark" is written against it according to practice—on January 22nd and 29th and 5th and 12th February I did not pay Roberts; he was not at work then—his name appears on four successive weeks when he was not at work—on January 22nd his name is last but one on the list; Peat is below him, he was not there then—I paid the men on January 22nd and 29th—on 29th January and 5th and 12th February his name is last on the list—on 5th and 12th February the prisoner paid—Roberts was not paid on these dates—I know of the alternate payments, Islington one week and St. Pancras the other—there was only one occasion when money was put against the name of the joint workmen when I paid; that was when Lewis did not supply a man, and Eaton received 12s. from Lewis that week and 12s. from St. Pancras—I think £1 4s. was credited in this book—that is a solitary case—except that I never had the wages book carried out with work for Islington; I am not aware of their being put in after wards.</p>

               <p>—he took no notice of it that I know of—I spoke to no other member about it at any time—I did not to Mr. Vere—Mr. Husk has had tea and different conversations at my house, and has asked me how I got on with Mr. Dunsford; he was a clerk in the Lighting Department of the Vestry then—I don't know if they knew all about it—I told him one or two little things that had happened at the time I was there—I never went over the books with Husk, nor with any member of the Burial Board—I did not know till a long while afterwards of Husk having any dispute with the prisoner—while this was going on I was continually seeing the prisoner, up to the present time—I did not think I could get his place—I remember Skeets and Rogers, detectives, coming to the cemetery to make some inquiry, about two years ago; to the best of my belief, they said they would bring me a note from Mr. Dunsford to say they were to make use of the Board-room—I did not say I was super intendent, that I did all the work, and that he did nothing, and that I meant to get the place; nothing of the kind—I swear I did not, in the presence of either of them, say that, by hook or crook, I would get the prisoner out of his place; nothing of the kind; or that I wanted the place—I saw Rogers here, and outside the Police-court—I have seen Skeets here—nothing of that kind took place between us—I did not speak about the prisoner—I never used a threat to him, to them, or to Mills, to my knowledge, that I would get him out of the place—I sent letters, with regard to the wages, to the prisoner by Mills, Bonnor, Pieman, Siever, and Wise—the book passed through a good many different hands—the prisoner told me some time ago that he laid out St. Pancras gardens and the Almshouse gardens, or something of that kind—the Strawberry Vale ground was joint work—he employed men there that did not come under my notice at all, and were not superintended by me—I don't know who paid them—I was only allowed the books once during that 13 weeks—I don't know how long that work lasted—the prisoner has been engaged in the removal of bodies from London cemeteries to this cemetery; that took about three months—he employed men on that that I knew nothing of—I know men have been sent to the private houses of members of the Burial Board to do work there in connection with gardens and so on, away from the cemetery, during 1884, 1885, 1886, not much lately—the Special Committee discussed that subject; they asked me if I knew it—Barratt did that, and sometimes one man, sometimes another—the Special Committee on the matter began in 1886; it was then talked about between five and six members—it was a Special Committee appointed to inquire into the working of the cemetery—I was not examined before them—questions were asked, not only about work done at their houses, but about shrubs and plants, and grapes being got from the cemetery—there was one house and two vines to grow grapes at the cemetery—I did not offer to go before the Special Committee, and I did not give evidence—some times the men at the cemetery would be fully employed, and it would be inconvenient to take men from there—I don't know of any men being employed when men were wanted for work of that sort—after the assault committed on the prisoner he was ill for some time afterwards—I should say he felt the effects of it for a fortnight or three weeks; he was totally disabled—I do not know that he has had to go about with crutches for the past year and more—he has been laid up for the last four</p>

You mind your own business"—I pointed out what it and to do with me, and I would not allow him to have the labour book till the figures were corrected; and re erased the figures and wrote in red ink, "suspended"—I had put my own name as responsible for the 5s. payment for each man, which was all I had and all I paid—there is the mark of the erasure there, and in the totals in the book—when I wrote the figures, the totals were not there—the totals were cast up as if £1 had preceded each 5s.—I knew nothing about the Special Committee Inquiry of 1886—I know Mr. Miall, the accountant; he was called in by the Board last September—I was suspended two or three days after the prisoner was—about a week after</p>

                  </hi>. I have been an expert in handwriting since 1882; I carry on business at 8, Red Lion Square—I have had consider able experience in examining handwriting, and I have on many occasions been called in Courts of Justice—I have examined this labour book, and I have formed the opinion that the initials H. E., and the name of Eaton on folios 5, 36, 41, 51, 60, 62, 64, 68, 87, 89, 92, and 134 are in the prisoner's writing; I can give my reasons; they are specified in this sheet—the initials "G. D." on folios 85, 87, 89, and 91, opposite the name of George Dodd, are in my opinion in the prisoner's writing—on folios 92, 94, 97 a cross appears against that name, and no initials—I cannot exactly say in whose writing the initials "W. W." opposite W. Valen tine are in, but it is a coincidence that later in the same book the name is written by the prisoner as Walter Walentine—the initials "W. V." on page 87, 92, 98, 108, I consider to be the prisoner's—I cannot say whose writing the initials "H. A." are; I have compared them with Henry Akers' signature in other parts of the book; the initials on page 104 are the prisoner's writing—"F. D." is in the prisoner's writing—on folios 36 and 41 I find "Lewis" has been written in pencil first and then erased, and a most excellent copy of "H. E." inserted above the pencilling, which is still apparent; the "H. E." bears a strong resemblance to the prisoner's writing, none to Eaton's—the word "joint" occurs in pencil—on pages 76 and 79, and each occasion where such alteration is alleged, the £1 4s. against George Bolding was originally £1 1s., I believe, and a down and bottom strokes have been added, making the 1 into 4—in some instances the colour of ink used in the alteration and that used in the casting-up of the pages agree—on pages 85, 89, 91, 92, 96, 97, and 120 George Dodd is the last name in the list of men; and on pages 85, 89, 91, and 96 it is in a different ink to the previous names, but appears to be the same ink as the casting-up—Roberts, on 15th January, 1887, at page 125, is the third name from the bottom; it was written at a different time to the previous names—on 22nd January, and on pages 127,128, and 129, the names George Roberts and Benjamin Peat have been added afterwards, with the figures and "his X mark"—on folio 109 I find the initials "H. D." opposite George Dodd, and elsewhere there is a mark, so that if it was the same person, he put his mark in one place and his initials in another.</p>

On 15th October I kept observation on the Globe Workmen's Club, dressed as a butcher—37 men entered between 12 and 7 p.m., and on the 16th 32 men between 12 and 7—on the 16th I gave Withers 1s. to put on Rosy Morn at 3.30, the Shirley Plate, and 3d. to enter the club; he went in and came out and made a statement to me—I went again on the 17th, and again on the 18th, with Russell and Withers, when 37 men went in between 12 and 5 o'clock—I gave Withers 1s. to back Mont d'Or and 3d. to enter—on the 19th I saw White at the club door, gave him 1s., told him to put it on Alexander II., and went to the beershop next door; White came there and told Russell, who had backed Equanimity, that his horse had lost—I afterwards saw White out side the club door, who told me that my horse had lost—forty-two men entered on the 19th between two o'clock and five—on October 29 we went again, and I saw White on the threshold; he said to Withers, "Where are you going?"—Withers said, "I am going to do a bet; put a bet on"—White said, "Take your b—shilling somewhere else, we do not want any b—y spies here"—we went outside and kept observation till five or six o'clock—on 28th December I took Jones in custody on this warrant—he said, "I shall make no fuss about this, I shall plead guilty to the bets; Mr. Lyman gave me £5 for the tape machine, and took the club from Mr. Lewis, the landlord, and put Mr. Stenning in as manager."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor representing Messrs. Wontner and Sons for the prosecution—I was present at the Police-court when Stenning, Hardy, Guiles, and White were charged, and on 24th November the Magistrate addressed them as to their election where to be tried; Mr. Besley claimed on the part of Stenning that the case should be sent for trial, and the Magistrate said that he could not separate the cases—White was not there on the first occasion—they were committed for trial at the last session on the gaming-house summonses; there were summonses and warrants that related to White—on Friday last these defendants were brought up on the betting-house summonses; nothing was said then about election; it was considered part of the other case—fresh depositions were taken, and the Magistrate committed the four men for trial—Jones was arrested on 28th December.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Besley only represented Stenning, the other three were unrepresented, but White was not there—it is necessary for a prisoner to elect to be tried by a Magistrate, or by a jury, before evidence is taken—Jones was committed for offences under the Betting House Act—leave has been obtained from this Court to add counts; the prisoners were not present then—these two men were not given their option before the Magistrate—the committal was under the Betting House Act, under which the penalty is £100 or six months' imprisonment if dealt with summarily.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Demanding an apology for the witness's letter, upon the tenour of which would depend the course he should take against him and his mouth piece the "British Journal of Commerce</hi>")—I saw him on the 18th, and asked him if he had Mr. Calder's cheque with him—he said, "No, an intimate friend called on me who was hard up, and I lent it to him"—I told him it was a ticklish business, and repeated the question—he said, "No"—I also mentioned the £3 15s. to him, but he said nothing about it—I think I stopped payment of the £5 cheque on the 17th—I did not receive it from the bank; I have never had it—I have the bank book here—I enter in it the names of persons from whom I receive money, and I required my clerk to do the same when he paid money in—here are two slips on December 13th in the prisoner's writing—there is an entry of £5 paid by another person, but no entry of payment by Calder, or Ely Brothers, or of £3 15s.—there is no such entry between the 8th and the 18th—the endorsement "Bascombe" on this cheque is the prisoner's writing; I knew him by the name of Ward—(<hi rend="italic">This was for</hi> £5 <hi rend="italic">from Peter Calder, marled "Cancelled in error"; orders not to pay.</hi>)—he has not accounted to me for that—I received this letter from him on December 22nd, dated December 21—it is in his writing.

                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of the theatre which is called by my name, "Terry's Theatre—I have been connected with the theatrical profession something like twenty-five years—the name I have made my own is "Edward Terry"—I knew nothing of the prisoner Terry before these proceedings were commenced, he is no connection of mine—about fifteen months ago I finished a tour in the country with a company of my own, known as "Edward Terry's Company"—I had not known Charles Ward personally, I had heard of him—I do not know of the existence of any genuine company of Terry and Ward's Dramatic Company—I never heard Charles Ward described as a celebrated tragedian—the plays of the <hi rend="italic">Merchant of Venice, Othello, Richelieu, The Corsican Brothers, Louis XI.</hi>, &amp;c., all require special costumes; they may be called costume pieces, and would require considerable preparation and expense to present them to the public—they are pieces with a large number of characters; they are not plays which, in a legitimate manner, could be wholly represented by amateurs—the part of Roderigo in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> is one of the principal parts, it is not one to be given to an amateur—the parts of Portia and Nerissa are very important, and would generally be given to the second lady—scenery, costumes, bills and posters would be considerable if intended to be genuine—twenty would be a very small company for such a play as <hi rend="italic">Richelieu</hi>—I am familiar with the practice of touring companies—they would require rehearsals together before starting on the tour—the cost of starting such a tour would be considerable—the manager would pay the travelling expenses to the starting-place, and also the travelling expenses generally on the tour, and provide the dresses for all costume pieces; modern dresses only would be found by the actors—in the ordinary course the agent would go down, the theatre having been secured beforehand—in consequence of a number of letters that reached me, since these proceedings I have made inquiries, amongst other places at Cardiff, and have received information from Cardiff—I have a great many of the letters now—I have never authorised either of the prisoners to use the name of Terry, or to use such a card as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with the word's "E. Terry's Dramatic Company"—the company I had fifteen months ago was "E. Terry's Comedy Company"—my manager carries a card like this, I have not got one here—these cards with "Mr. E. Terry, Acting-manager," and "Mr. E. Terry's Dramatic Company," and "Messrs. E. Terry and Ward's Company," were not in circulation with my sanction—these advertisements which appeared in the theatrical newspapers, "Apply to Mr. E. Terry, 13, Station Road, Leyton," were not authorised by me, nor was the advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, purporting to come from Mr. E. Terry, in "The Stage.—Mr. Chas. Ward, leading tragedian from Sadler's Wells, the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. VINCENT</hi>. There is a considerable difference between touring companies—the same cast would not probably be got for small places as for large ones—I have never played in South Wales, except at Cardiff and Swansea—I do not profess to know the names of all the touring companies, I know the major portion—in very small places parts are doubled—it would not be impossible for fifteen people to per form <hi rend="italic">Richelieu</hi>, even in such a theatre as Sadler's Wells—it might be the practice in small companies for actors to pay their own travelling expenses—in my earlier days I met with some very queer touring companies—costumes can be hired—in small places, of course, the costumes would not be as rich as these at the Lyceum—on my cards the manager's name appears, not my own name in the middle of the card—Terry is my real name, and the name I have always borne—I have dropped one initial—the fares of my company are paid by my treasurer—I can't tell you what the fare is to Exeter; it would be third class for each person.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MADDEN</hi>. I have been a touring manager fourteen or fifteen years—long ago I replied to many advertisements—I always went through rehearsals before going on tour—I was only on one tour in my early days—they were stock companies, resident in each town—in touring companies they do not always take down the whole company—they do not pick up an actor, only in an emergency—our profession is particularly liable to emergencies—I think the majority of actors go by their own names—if a lady has an ugly name and is playing pretty parts it might militate against her—I do not think it is the case that a great number of persons in recent years have got into very prominent positions after very little rehearsal—I have had to plod my way up—a great number of actors have been amateurs first—I never saw Mr. Ward—the late Mr. Creswick was a highly respected member of the profession—a pro gram me was produced to me at the Police-court, in which the name of Ward appeared as playing the character of the King of France in <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>—the cast was a very fair cast—these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) resemble Mr. Creswick's writing—he died in 1880—I can't say that Ward played for him at Drury Lane; I did not see him—I played for Mr. Creswick's benefit there—there were selections from different pieces, and other actors gave their services.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Many aspirants for the stage would be pleased to pay for an introduction without being paid a salary, to belong to a good company, in the way of apprenticeship—Cardiff is not a place that would put up with a mean company, it is a most important place; I do not think they would stand doubling; there are two theatres there.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Kendall, who is the landlord of 4, Adelaide Street, Strand—John Ward took the second floor of that house about March, 1885, at a rent of £32 10s.; he remained there about eighteen months—I believe the rent was paid up to the last quarter, we distrained for that—during the time we distrained twice; the first time it was paid out, the second time we took the goods, that was on the 27th July, 1886—he carried on a dramatic and literary business—I saw Charles Ward there, I should think daily—after they left several ladies and gentlemen came to inquire for them, theatrical sort of people—we used to say they had gone away, and we knew nothing further; they had left no address.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. VINCENT</hi>. The advertisement that he wanted ladies and gentlemen to go on tour was in a different part of the paper—it is apparently the advertisement of a company on tour, and managers who have vacant dates can send them to fill up the dates—it is not calculated to deceive actors or actresses as it stands, as it does not ask them to do anything—the only advertisement which asks them to do anything conveys the impression that Charles Ward is on tour—fit-up theatres are rooms not intended essentially for theatrical purposes, which are made up with temporary stage and proscenium, and so on—if a company was going round to halls in small provincial towns they would carry a fit-up.</p>

I should think the two advertisements were contradictory—I might consider, as the address was a London address, and among the "wanted" advertisements, that he was not on tour—Barry Sullivan's son is advertising a forthcoming tour—it is the universal practice for actors and actresses to represent themselves in the most favourable light they can—in some instances it may be called in the nature of a puff—I have known Ward to play leading parts, Othello and Richelieu, in a London theatre—I remember his playing some of these parts at Sadler's Wells—I have no recollection of his playing at a benefit given to Mr. Creswick in 1887, at Drury Lane; I remember no one who performed there—I remember his performance of Claude Rollo at Sadler's Wells, a leading part—we had a criticism in our paper; it was a favourable notice generally—I don't remember if it was a favour able criticism in reference to Ward—that was three and a half years ago, I think.</p>

I am a man-servant—in March, 1888, I saw an advertisement in one of the daily papers which induced me on the 5th May to call at 8, Catherine Street, Strand—there was a plate on the left hand side of the door with "Dramatic offices" on it—on entering the office I saw Charles Ward—I told him I was a man-servant, that I had seen an advertisement in the evening paper, and I had called in answer—at this interview he said I was suited for light comedy, and I should require a course of tuition, for which he could arrange at three guineas—he asked me as to my experience, I told him I had not the least experience of the stage—he said he would enter me in a play for the 4th of June at St. George's Hall, Regent Street, Langham Place; the play was to be <hi rend="italic">Withered leaves</hi>—I was to take one of the principal parts—I told him I would do it, and he arranged two days a week on which I should call for instruction—I paid a deposit of 10s. on account of the three guineas—he told me to go to Lacy's and buy a book of the play, and I was to learn, and afterwards play, the part of Arthur Middleton—Tuesday and Friday each week from four to five were settled for me to come—I went on the next Tuesday—he asked me if I had come for the purpose of settling the contract—I said I had not, but I would send £2 13s. the following week to make up the three guineas—I read to him a short portion of my part in the play, that did not take more than a quarter of an hour;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188901070065"/>
               <p>that was the whole of the tuition that day—I was then told to call on the following Friday—in the meantime I sent a postal order for £2 13s., and on 5th May received this receipt, "Received of Mr. Arthur J. Hurst three guineas for course of tuition in elocution and stage business, J. Ward. Engagements are for successful pupils only"—I called again next Friday—very much the same thing was done; there was a lesson of about the game length; I again read part of it to him—I continued to do that till 4th June, which was the date fixed for the performance—on one day three and on another day four persons attended a rehearsal at Ward's office at the same time—<hi rend="italic">Withered Leaves</hi> has six characters in it—a rehearsal was to take place on the stage at twelve on the 4th June, and the per formance was to be at two that afternoon—I was very punctual, I got there at twelve; Mr. Ward was not there till after one; the rehearsal commenced before he came; the people were all there to rehearse, but the rehearsal did not fully go through—the curtain was late in rising—a week before the rehearsal Mr. Ward asked me to sell as many tickets as I could; if I could he would put me in for many other things—I disposed of ten tickets at 2s. each, and gave the money to Mr. Ward—the audience consisted of between 150 and 200, I should think; it was a one act comedy—I could not say how it might have gone, the audience was not very enthusiastic—after <hi rend="italic">Withered Leaves, Macbeth</hi> was played by Mr. Charles Ward; I did not take any part in that, I saw part of it—on 7th June I received this letter from Charles Ward:—"Dear Sir,—Allow me to congratulate you on your first appearance, I was most agreeably surprised. Call on me on Friday afternoon and make an arrangement."I called on the Saturday and saw him—he asked me if I still thought I should like the stage as a profession—I said I should—he asked if I should like to go on a tour, or in town—I said "on tour"—he said he could take me on tour, but he should require a premium for that—I asked what premium—he said from £50 down to £10, but on no account could he take less than £10—I said I would pay £15—he said that was very little for a profession—I asked how long he thought his tour would last—he said he hoped a good time—I told him I would consider and let him know in the course of a few days—he said the salary would be 30s. a week, that was to commence on 31st July, the day the company were to meet—it was not said where we were to meet; I was to hear about that—he said the tour was to start on the 31st, but not to begin acting till Bank Holiday, 1st August—I wrote a letter to him asking him again how long he expected his tour would last, and on 14th June I received this letter:—"Please call here at 5 p. m., and I will answer particulars you require and have the agreement ready"—he knew I was in service at the time—I wrote, saying I would call on the Tuesday fol lowing—in the meantime I, received this letter, dated 18th:—"Dear Sir,—The agreement will be ready on Tuesday, please come prepared to, settle the business"—on the 19th I called and saw Charles Ward, and John Ward was with him—he had introduced me to John previous to that—I asked Charles, in John's hearing, how long he expected the engagement would last, also what the agreement would be, and what plays he was taking—he said, when I paid the £15 I should have the agreement—he would not give a direct answer—he left the room for a short time—John remained and continued the conversation—all I remember of it was that I asked him how long he thought his tour</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188901070066"/>
               <p>would last—he said when they travelled before they stayed a good time, months; and he hoped this would last longer. Charles then came back; he asked me if I had decided to go on tour—I said I had—he asked if I had come prepared to settle the agreement—I said I had not, but I should be by the 7th July—he asked if I could not pay a deposit—I asked if a note of hand would not do, to say it would be paid by 7th July—he said he preferred a deposit, and asked if I had anyone who I could borrow the money from till then—I said I had not—I again asked him as to the contents of the agreement—he said when I paid the £15 I should have it—he accompanied me to the door, and as I left he said, "Send some money as soon as you can"—I considered the matter and declined to complete it—the course of tuition for which the three guineas was paid was simply reading through the play—Mr. Ward took the play, and took the last part of the sentence before mine; he gave me the cues.</p>

I now live at 66, Denbeigh Street—I am the wife of Mr. William Herbert Wilmot—in September, 1888, I was living at Blackpool, Lancashire—I was not married then—my maiden name was Sheridan—some time before 7th September I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, in consequence of which I wrote this letter, offering myself as a candidate, and received this reply: "September 7th—Your letter just received. I have much pleasure in giving the particulars you,. ask, and shall be pleased to come to an arrangement if possible. Our tour starts in three weeks' time. We have only one vacant place; this would doubtless suit you, as you will have small parts to take—salary, 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; premium, £20, either paid down, or, if more convenient, part, and the rest according to arrangement; if the latter, say about the amount convenient.

               <p>thought half, but I could not decide then, I would let him know—he said it was a first-class touring company—I said, "What about expenses?"—he said "all travelling expenses to be paid"—he said he was the proprietor of the company, and Mr. Charles Ward the principal actor and instructor, that they were going to North and South Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and then to America—the English tour was to last about nine months, and they were to start in about three weeks—he said if I would write to him and let him know what I felt disposed to do about the premium the matter could be further discussed; he would keep the vacancy open till he heard from me, that there was only one vacancy for a lady amateur, that they were only going to take one lady—on 17th September I wrote this letter.

"Isaid, "Church of England "; he said, "I ask you this because all my company when on tour attend church once or twice a day, "I suppose he meant on Sunday—I noticed a coat of arms in the first of Terry's letters with a motto, "<hi rend="italic">Sub cruce salus</hi>"; I was not able to translate it; I was not influenced at all by that—he promised to write to me, but I think I had to write to him on the 27th September, desiring to hear when we should start—on 2nd October he wrote this: "Dear Madam,—I will write to you in a day or two, making appointment to see you; have been away, or should have done so before. Don't write here again, as I leave for good to-day"—he did not write after that, and on 10th October I went to 13, Station Road, Leyton—I found no one in the house, it was still furnished—I inquired next door, and they told me that</p>

Terry"—I paid that, although we were to have been on tour on November 5th, when it became due, because Terry said unless I did so my agreement would be of no account—about that time he made an appointment to go with me and get some tights and a wig—before that appointment was kept I had this letter of 9th November. (<hi rend="italic">This appointed the meeting for Monday, November</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th, when Ward would be there and would go through the piece, adding that he had better pay the balance on Monday</hi>)—I told Terry that I had heard that a Ward had been prosecuted for swindling somebody with regard to the same kind of thing as this, and I asked him if Charles Ward had any thing to do with it—he said, "I can assure you that this Ward has nothing to do with it"—I met Terry according to the appointment it Charing Cross Station, and paid him £3, taking this receipt; an arrangement was come to that the balance of £2 was to be deducted" from</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Asking him to call</hi>)—I wrote, making an appointment, and then called at Sussex Street, where I saw Terry and a lady, who, he informed me, was his wife—I asked what his terms were; he said he would give me all necessary stage instruction on payment of a premium of £15—I asked him several questions regarding his company, and where he had been playing lately—I understood that he was proprietor of the company, and that Ward was the instructor in elocution—he said he was going on a tour with his company at Christmas-time, through "Wales, Scotland and Ireland—by paying £15 I could have instruction and become a member of the company, at 30s. or 35s. a week, I think he said—I had acted in one or two amateur performances before—I did not see Ward—I made an appointment to see Terry again next day, but I thought better of it; I did not see him again; I did not part with any money; I did not like the appearance of the place.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective D</hi>). On 17th November I received from the Westminster Police-court a warrant for the arrest of Terry, granted on the joint information of Miss Beach and O'Reilly—I went to Sussex Street; I remained for some time in the street—I saw Ward go into, the house a little before four; then Terry went in—afterwards they came out together—I went up, and said, "Mr. Terry, I hold a warrant for your apprehension; will you please come inside No. 6, and I will read it to you"—we went upstairs into the front room—Ward went away; I would not say that he heard what I said to Terry—I read the warrant to Terry; he said, "I am innocent; I will make O'Reilly pay for this. Where is Mr. Ward? Fetch Mr. Ward; I want to see him"—at this point Ward came in, and said, "Terry, what is the matter?"—Terry said, "I am arrested through O'Reilly"—Ward said, "Oh," and left—I began searching the room—Terry said, "Where is Ward? You see he has not come back. Ward is a scoundrel; I wish I had never known the Wards"—he kept muttering that to himself, and appeared very much upset—I took possession of a number of letters, photographs, and printed, playbills—there were a large quantity of play-bills; I left a large quantity behind—there was only one red bill—the play-bills were in the form of a letter, note paper and envelopes printed with advertisements—among other things I found thirty-four pawn-tickets, including two of 18th September and 11th October with reference to the pawning of a quilt and pair of carvers—I took Terry to the station; on the way he said, "You see Ward has not come back. Ward has let me into this"</p>

               <p>—at the station he was charged—he said, "I am innocent, that is all I will say"—he gave his name as Thomas Everson Terry—I found a card case on him containing these three cards, "T. E. Terry, Acting Manager"; "Terry's Dramatic Company"; and "Terry and Ward's Dramatic Company"—a purse was found on him with a small coin in it; and a 2s. piece, which was handed to him by a lady in the house, and given back by him to her at the station—£29 had been realised by the pawning, the last thing was an overcoat—afterwards I returned to 6, Sussex Street, where I found this cash-book—under date of 22nd August, I find entered what purports to be the monetary account of the partner ship accounts of Thomas E. Terry and Charles Ward, in Terry's writing—I have seen Terry write, and I have gone through the correspondence which purports to be signed by him; it is his writing—I find in the cash book entries of several sums for advertisements in the <hi rend="italic">Stage</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph;</hi> of sums given to Charles Ward for his private use, amounting to £23 3s. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; to Terry for his private use £8—I find entered £5 from Miss Marie Sheridan; £5 from Miss Emily Seymour; from O'Reilly £13 on various dates—I find on October 16 Miss Davis £15 premium, and on the same date Miss Tookey £3—I have found the draft agreement of October 18th, between Terry and Ward and Miss Davis, and some letters in connection with it. (<hi rend="italic">By the agreement they agreed to take her on tour at a salary of</hi> £2 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">in consideration of which she had paid them</hi> £15 <hi rend="italic">as premium for introduction to the stage, and retention of her services during the run of the tour, and for further engagements; letters were read from her asking the cause of the protracted delay in not leaving London, and from B. T. S. Davis, of Chester, asking on behalf of his daughter when they intended to start on tour</hi>)—I saw Miss Davis at 6, Sussex Street—she made a complaint and showed me three receipts—I found two draft agreements in Terry's writing, prepared in blank—I found two letters purporting to be signed by Charles Ward; one autherising him to remove goods from Russell Chambers, and the other with autherity to remove goods from Henrietta Street—I found this letter of 6th November from Ward to Terry—"Having waited for your letter all day, allow me to state I think your conduct anything than that of a gentleman, and all business matters arranged between us has come to an end"—I found several unpaid bills—I found this letter from John Ward, of September 8th, 1888 (<hi rend="italic">agreeing to pay monthly instalments on a loan</hi>)—I found a ticket for St. George's Hall, Wandsworth, and this receipt for £10 from Miss Allen of 9th October in Terry's writing—this is in Charles Ward's writing, I should say, and a receipt for £2 2s. from T. E. Thomas, for lessons in elocution and general stage business—they were furnished apartments at 6, Sussex Street—there was nothing there to show preparation for a theatrical tour, no bills beyond the one large bill—among Terry's papers I found a number of letters from Champion relating to an engagement; a draft letter in Terry's writing fixing the premium at £30; similar correspondence as to the engagement of Mr. Dixon and his wife, premium £20; and as to Mr. Byles, Miss Clifton, Miss Newhall, Mr. Watson, Miss Blazer, and Miss Comber, with premiums—I served Ward with a summons on Tuesday, 20th, at 133, Harrison Street, Gray's Inn Road—he said, "I expected this. Shall I have to appear on Monday?"—I said, "No, that is a summons returnable forthwith. You will have to appear to-morrow"—he said, "I am busy getting up the case for my friend</p>

               <p>Terry"—I said, "I cannot help that"—Ward appeared on the Wednesday—he was occupying one room, with a bed in the centre; bed and sitting-room in one—on the remand of Terry he was further charged; he made no answer—he was remanded from time to time and committed for trial—a summons was applied for against John Ward on December 3rd, and issued against him—I was not able to find him, and a warrant was issued for his apprehension, but I have been unable to execute it—I can not find him.</p>

Green's case found—he never paid any money—all the draft receipts that have been produced do not necessarily indicate any actual transaction—when I found the cash-book the front part was gummed down, and there was a written notice that from the beginning up to that page the contents of each page were private accounts, in no way connected with Ward and Terry's partnership; that after the note the accounts were partnership matters, and that sums Terry had paid out of his own pocket were marked with a cross—if that note is correct £4 9s. 10 1/2 d, on the first page, has been paid by Terry out of his own pocket—there is no entry on the receipt side beyond the pasted down pages of what can be called a private entry—I found a great abundance of correspondence there in all parts of the room, and a great part of it and the pawn-tickets in a medicine-chest in the front room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Jones Brothers, of Neath—our business consists partly in contracting to take touring companies round to halls in South Wales—there are only four regular theatres in Wales; two in Cardiff, one at Swansea, and one at Merthyr; but theatrical companies go round to halls of public entertainment in the various tours, bringing their own "fit-up," that is, the proscenium and the necessary apparatus for the stage—on 26th September we entered into this agreement; it is my father's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was an agreement between Jones Brothers and Charles Ward, by which Jones Brothers were to provide the hall, fittings, gas, bill-posting, etc., for a tour commencing</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th October</hi>, 1888; <hi rend="italic">Ward to find an efficient company of actors and actresses, Jones to have</hi> 40 <hi rend="italic">per cent, of the gross receipts</hi>)—I sent that agreement to Ward and received this telegram, and in consequence of that I wrote this other letter, of 30th September, requesting specimens of printing other telegrams passed between us, the result being to commence on 29th October—on 20th October I wrote:" 1 fully expected to receive all printing from you—it is no use any company coming to Wales at short notice, as it means smashing the business and ruin of manager and company; it has been a great loss to us and doing great injury, as other companies wrote at same date"—these red bills are my own, got out specially for myself, nothing to do with Mr. Ward—I had 50 printed for my own tour, but I divided them to send to some of the other towns—I had made arrangements with Neath, Swansea, Aberdare, Tredegar, Blaenau, and Monmouth—two of these towns were for six nights, announcing performances by the prisoners' company—I received a letter from Terry, stating that he would send some lithegraphs, which I received about 21st October; there were three parcels—I have brought here all the printing I received—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this represents one of the pieces to be played; that was part of the second parcel I received; it is supposed to represent <hi rend="italic">The Royal Pardon</hi>—this other represents Mr. Ward as Richelieu—I received the first parcel on the 21st or 22nd October—on the 30th I telegraphed,</p>

On 15th December, about 10. 5 p. m., I was on duty in Gower Street with Hopkins—No. 92 was unoccupied, next door to that is 94, and the prosecutor lives at 98—while I was examining the door of No. 92 something fell from the roof; I looked up</p>

               <p>and saw something like a man's head looking over the parapet—I spoke to Hopkins, and we went to No. 94; the owner gave us permission to go on the roof, and we made towards No. 98, where I saw the prisoner crouching against the buttress of the adjoining house—an attic window was open just above the parapet; it opens in the middle, like a French window—a ridge on the roof divides one house from the other—I said to the prisoner, "What are you doing?"—he said, "It's all right, governor; it's only me"—I took him back to No. 98, the attic window was open, and said, "Now we must get through here"—he said, "I will get in first," making a rush at the window—we held him back, and he said, "I will do for you"—I got in first, leaving him and Hopkins on the roof—the parapet is eighteen inches high and the gutter ten inches wide—I assisted him in, and turned my lantern on, and saw a lot of things tied up in this bundle, and in another corner of the room were some bags which Miss Greener has identified—I took him to the front hall, and saw Miss Greener and her maid, and kept him there till help arrived, then took him to the station—an entrance had been made by getting down the area of No. 92, which was under repair, by sliding down the scaffolding, and breaking a pane of glass, and unlatching the kitchen window—from there it would be easy to get to the attic—the hole in the window was large enough for a man to get through without opening the latch—I saw no second man on the roof.</p>

Atkins and Nisbet, seven pieces in one case and four in the other—I did not pack it; I handed it over to the packer—I did not see the cases in which they were packed—these two invoices refer to the goods—the case marked "C. A. S. 2,370" contained the four pieces, and the one marked "C. A. S. 2,373" contained the seven pieces—the total value of the seven pieces was £37 14s. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that of the four, £22 1s. 10d.—this piece of dark brown plush (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), value £5 10s, was in case 2,370, and this brown plush, value £6, and this blue velvet, £6 17s. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., were in 2,373.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Crook Road, Deptford, and was a carman to Messrs. Clayton and Murray, of Deptford—I have left them now through slackness—I knew Fife—on Sunday morning, 25th November, about 11. 30, I was with my father in a coffee-shop in the New Road, Commercial Road—after I came out I saw Fife on the opposite side of the road—he beckoned to me, and I crossed the road to him, with my father—Fife asked me if I had heard anything about the <hi rend="italic">squeeze</hi>, meaning silk—I said, yes; I had seen it in the paper, but I had not read it; and I said, "My father has just been talking to me about it"—I said it was £5,000 I had seen in the paper, but I had not read the case—he said, "It was; it was rather a hard job, wasn't it?"—he said it was taken away by a carman, and the two carmen belonging to the van were given £100 apiece before they went to the coffee-shop—he asked if I would go and see it—I said, "No, I will not go and see it this morning; I am with my father; I do not want to leave him"—nothing was said about how the silk was packed or wrapped up, or how much</p>

               <p>there was—a gentleman was with Fife; I cannot see him here to-day; it was not one of the prisoners—I saw him one or two days afterwards—I do not know his name—I left Fife and went with my father along Whitechapel Road—between twelve and two on the Sunday I went with my friend Leyton to Mr. Evans—I saw Mr. Walter Evans the first time I called—I told him I would see him next day, as I had to go to work, and I left him then—I and Leyton went to Leyton's house, and then between 5 and 6 p. m., as far as I can guess, we went to Fife's coffee-shop—I saw Fife—he asked me who my friend was; I said he was a friend who worked at Carter, Paterson's, and he asked me what was the matter, and I told him my friend had two rolls of cloth for sale—he asked what sort of cloth it was—I told him it was dark Melton—he asked me how much there was—I said from 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cwt, about 150 yards in each piece—he asked us to bring it down; we said we would take a sample of it in the morning, and he could see it—that would be Monday morning—I and Leyton then left—before we left Fife said to Leyton, "You ought to get good things there," meaning Carter, Paterson's—Leyton replied, "Yes, we do get good things there sometimes"—he said if he got good things there he could do with it, and could pay him upwards of £5,000 for it—then we left—next day (Monday), at dinner-time, I saw Mr. Walter Evans again; no one was with him—I and Leyton went afterwards with Mr. Evans and made a statement to Reed and White—after we saw Mr. Evans on the Monday we saw Fife at the Grasshopper public-house, Baker's Row; he was alone—he asked me if we had got the samples of the cloth—Leyton gave him a sample—he asked how much we wanted for it—I told him we had sold one roll for £7, and wanted £7 for the other—he looked at the cloth, and said he would come down and take it away in a cart to-night, meaning Monday night, and if it measured the amount, he said he would pay the £7 for it—Leyton gave him the name and address where he lived, 107, Hertford Street, Stepney—Fife took it down on a bit of paper—Fife had a gold watch in his hand—I believe the master of the house was behind the bar, serving—Fife said he had sold the governor a watch for £25, and he would sell me the other one for £5—I told him I had not money enough—he said he would come down and take the stuff away, and an arrangement was made to see him again in Hertford Street when he came for the stuff—I next saw him at 12. 30, in the middle of the night, outside the Grasshopper, with a man, I believe the same man that I saw on Monday morning; it was not one of the three prisoners; I don't know his name—I was alone—he said he had been down in a trap to 107, Hertford Street, after the roll of cloth, and they were all policemen that lived in the house—I said, "You ain't been there; me and Leyton have been waiting there since half-past eight"—he then called the man who was with him, and asked him whether he had not been down there—the man said he had been there—nothing more took place; we left—while I was speaking to Fife, I saw"Reed on the opposite side of the way in Baker's Row—on Tuesday, at dinner-time, I saw Fife at his coffee-house—I asked him if he could do with a load of stuff—he said he could, and that he could get the same man to drive it away that drove the silk away—he took me over to the New Road, Whitechapel, and said he was going to get the man to drive it away—he left me alone in the Whitechapel Road—he came back and told me the man was out, that he had gone to Hoxton—he asked me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188901070094"/>
               <p>where Leyton was—I said, "Round "Wood Street; he is loading at Lloyd and Attree's, Wood Street, and at Bennett's, Cheapside, and he is going to the London and North-Western Railway, which he will reach at six o'clock"—I then left him—between five and six on that Tuesday I went to Fife's coffee-shop with a diamond ring—I saw his wife, and afterwards I met Fife in the public-house in the Whitechapel Road—I showed him the ring, and told him I had sampled the load that Leyton had, that this was a sample out of Bennett's stuff, and that there were things out of Lloyd and Attree's—I did not give him the ring, only showed it to him—I saw Fife again that evening at the corner of Commercial Street, coming across from Leman Street, getting on the tram—I rode with him as far as Paul Street, Finsbury—he said he was going to Hoxton to see the man that took the load away—I cannot recollect if Leyton's name was mentioned—I saw Leyton, after the ride on the tram, at Paul Street, Finsbury, and spoke to him; I met him by arrangement at eight o'clock—I had told Fife I was going to meet Leyton and send him on to the railway to deliver his load—Fife then said he would see about having a load to-morrow—he said he would be at home from nine to twelve next day—the next morning was wet—I went to Fife's shop, and into the parlour at the back; a piece of silk wrapped up in brown paper was there shown me—Fife said, "That is all right, isn't it? This is some of the stuff out of the load"—I said, "Yes; it is all right"—it was rolled up in brown paper and put on the shelf—I went across to a public-house by Whitechapel Churcn, not the Grasshopper, with Fife and another man—that was not the same man I have mentioned previously, and not one of the prisoners; I don't know who he was—Fife said he would see about having a load that same night—it was to be Carter, Paterson's load—he asked me where Leyton was; I said, "At Paul Street, Finsbury"—I left him there and told him I was going up to see Leyton—I saw Leyton in the morning—I saw Fife again that evening about six o'clock, I think, at his coffee-house—he told me he would send me the man next morning to take the load away, and he would have it on Thursday—I made arrangements to meet him on the Thursday morning at the coffee-house at nine o'clock—I left him then, and did not see him again on that Wednesday night—I met him on Thursday morning at five o'clock, and told him Leyton had gone to collect the load sent from Silber and Fleming and Lloyd and Attree's, and asked him to send me to the man—he told me to go to the Market House public house, Nile Street, and ask for the name of Saunders—I wont there and saw the prisoner Saunders in a private compartment; I told him Mr. Fife had sent me to him, and said my mate Leyton had got a load, ho wanted to get rid of it—I said that Leyton was a carman to Carter, Paterson—he said, "Meet me at two o'clock at the Market House, and bring Leyton with you"—I did so; we saw Saunders there and Cook—Saunders said, "Is it the carman?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "What does the load contain?"—I said, "Mantles and jewellery"—he said, "Is it a straightforward job?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Mind you, if this is wrong, off comes your head"—I told him it was as straight a job as ever he had—Cook heard that—Saunders and I arranged to meet at 4. 15 outside the Madhouse, City Road—I told him the load would be at Paul Street, Finsbury, and I would take him there—after we came out Cook asked Saunders if he could have a few words with him—he called</p>

               <p>him on one side, and I did not hear what they said—Saunders asked me if we wanted money—I said, "A few shillings," and he gave me and Leyton a half-crown each, and I saw gold, silver, and copper in his hand—I saw them kissing hands both inside and outside the public-house—I went with Leyton to Carter, Paterson's to see the load, and then went to the Police-station and spoke to Mr. Reed—I then went to the City Road, outside the Madhouse, and saw Saunders there; he beckoned to Cook, who joined us from the opposite side; we went to a public-house and had a drink, and then walked to Paul Street, where Saunders told Cook to keep his eye up, and left him there—Saunders and I went to Paul Street, waited half an hour, and Leyton came up with one of Carter, Paterson's loaded vans; we spoke to him, and he told the boy to look after the van, and we went into the public-house and had a drink, and asked him to show us the way-bills; he did so—Saunders looked at them and said they were right—we came out, and Saunders said to Leyton, "You take the boy away and I will take the load"—Leyton took the boy away, Saunders got on the van, and I got up behind—Leyton said to Saunders, "What am I going to have for letting the load go?"—Saunders said, "I would rather you would have no money at all—Leyton objected to letting the van go without money, and I told Saunders to give him a few shillings; Saunders gave him half-a-crown, and said that after the van was un loaded I was to take the money and settle up with him afterwards—we drove through several streets and stopped at a stable—Saunders went across the road, got a key, opened the door, and told me to back the van in—I did so, and we started unloading—we put the cases in one of the stalls, and while we were doing so Inspector Reed and Mr. White came, and I ran away.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. I was at Clayton and Murray's, meat carriers, about a month—before that I was in prison—I had eighteen months at the Surrey Sessions for stealing flour from a van—there was no van boy—there were two of us, and we agreed that the man should be enticed into a public-house while we drove off with the Van—I drove this van to Fife's house—he did not buy it, but he bought a pot of butter out of it—Fife declined to buy the flour, but he asked the man next door to buy it—there was a detective in Fife's house at the time—I asked Fife to buy it at eight p. m., and I was arrested at nine next morning—the policemen were not in Fife's house when he refused to buy, but a detective was—I know there was only one, as I had tea with him—if Fife had not given information I should not have been arrested, and I bear enmity against him—I was not put away innocent—I had four months, it was for 174 lbs. of wool out of the Albert Dock; I pleaded guilty; another man was with me—I did not <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on him; it was Fardell's van, I was the carman—I had had three months before I went to Fardell's, for stealing a set of bagatelle balls; these convictions were proved against me when I had the eighteen months—I was discharged from Mr. Evans' for letting a man take a sack of corn, but I did not know he was stealing it—I did not know whether it was one of our men or not—it was not Fife—I saw this robbery of the silk on the 25th in <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Paper</hi>—I had not spoken to the police when Leyton spoke to me at 12. 15 on Sunday morning—I went to Mr. Evans between one and two—Leyton did not mention the loss of the silk—I think he asked me if I knew a place where he could get rid of some stuff, and I took him to</p>

               <p>Fife—I did not then think that Leyton was a dishonest servant; I thought he was pumping me—I left Clayton and Murray's on the Satur day after Christmas—I have done one or two days' work since—I made a statement to Mr. Reed, and a fuller one to the Solicitor to the Treasury—Mr. Walter Evans gave me the piece of cloth which was shown as a sample, and I bought the diamond ring in a tobacconist's shop for six pence—I told Fife it was a sample of the jewellery from one of the cases going in a van through London—a man named Byart has been in my company at Fife's, but not while this matter was going on; the landlord of the Grasshopper has seen me drinking there three or four times—Taylor is the man all through who tempted me to do it—when Taylor came down and saw Fife, I did not say, "Have you been to see the <hi rend="italic">squeeze</hi> this morning?" he said he could get Leyton some stuff at 2s. a yard—Leyton and I did not promise to buy the cloth—Fife asked me what was the matter, and I said that my friend and I had come by two rolls of silk, and asked Fife to buy them; that was my device and Leyton's—I did not hear that any person who gave information by which the silk was recovered would be £50 the better—I saw the police daily; they did not mention £50, or say that that reward was offered, but I thought I might get a little, I mean a little work; I would rather have work than money—I thought I might get some reward and work too—I had a week's notice to leave Clayton and Murray, and was looking out—that was partly the reason why I gave information to the police to ingratiate myself with them and Mr. Evans, and get a job—I told Mr. Evans and he told the police, that was the reason I gave information about Fife—when I was out of work I was at Fife's daily, but only three or four times in the two months since I have been out of prison—I spoke to Fife in a friendly way, and said, "Fife, you ought not to have put me away," although I had a grudge against him.</p>

Saunders was Fife's carman; Fife sent me there to get him to take a van away—he asked me, first, if it was a straightforward job—he was most anxious to find out whether it was an honest job; I suppose he thought it was a straight job done by thieving—a straight job is not a plant—Leyton and I spoke together in the bar of the Market House, but not loud—I only went outside once, and did not return—Leyton left with me after he had undertaken to drive this van—I gave information to Mr. Evans on the Sunday morning, me and Leyton suggested it together, we told him what we should do to try and fetch him the stuff which was lost; we told him about Saunders afterwards—I was not afraid of being arrested; I ran away so that they should not get hold of me, I was only afraid of being locked up all night—after I ran away, Mr. Reed and Mr. White saw me at Leman Street Station; we went there with a van-load of stuff, because I told Mr. Reed I would go—Leyton and I did not arrange what story we should tell to the police; but, of course, we mentioned what we had seen and done—I told the police I had been instrumental in getting a van from Carter, Paterson's; they did not put me under arrest, I had nothing to be arrested for—I asked for the way-bill to see what the van contained, and where it was consigned—I told Saunders it was a straight job—he said, "If it is not I will have your head off."</p>

I am stationed at Leman Street—on Saturday, November 24th, I received information about 11. 30 a. m. from Mr. Walter Evans and his father, and on Sunday at 9. 10 I saw Leyton and gave him instructions, and on Monday morning I met Leyton and Avis at Mr. Evans's office, and gave them further in structions—next day I met them at different times, and on Wednesday, about eleven, I saw Avis speaking to Fife in Baker Street, Whitechapel—on Thursday I saw Saunders in Paul Street, Finsbury—he seemed to be with other people, who went away, and he spoke to Leyton—I saw one of Carter, Paterson's vans outside the public-house, and a boy with it—Saunders and Leyton came, the boy got off; Saunders got in front and Avis at the back, and Saunders drove away—I was with White and Dalbin and Mr. Walter Evans in another van—we followed the van through several streets till it stopped in Hoxton—I got out and passed Saunders and Avis, and heard one say to the other, "Don't be long"—Saunders got on the van again; Avis got on the back, and they drove on—I followed them to a stable, my van drove by; I stopped and got into some gardens of the Board school, and saw Saunders commencing to unload the van, and a goat ran out—I got back to my van, called the officers, ran to the stable, and seized Saunders, who had his coat and hat off—I told Sergeant White to arrest him—two or three packages had been taken from the van and deposited in the first stall—I searched the stable, and found six packs of wood turnery, two lodgers (printed in Russian), and one bottle of preserves—</p>

I let part of my stable to a scamp, and I know nothing of this property;"I said, "Never mind about this property, this is not stolen, it is only lent"—I handed him over to two constables, and went round the comer to Cook's shop in Crocker Street, and found in the passage one seal dolman, one seal jacket, two pieces of plush, three pieces of velvet, one roll of silk, eleven boys' suits, one portmanteau, one leather trunk, two carriage lamps, and twenty-five brushes; they appeared to have been just thrown in—I went into the workshop and saw Dodd; I spoke to him, and he gave me this purse, containing £36 in gold, and a £10 note—he told me something, and I directed him to be taken to the station—this watch and chain and two keys were taken from Dodd, and 204 skins of leather from his workshop—I searched Cook's house, No. 8, opposite, and in the top room back, the door of which I forced, I found twenty-four boxes of velvet and plush, which are identified as stolen from the van, seven boxes of lace and embroidery, one box of satin, one box of mantle trimmings, two pieces of silk, 81 rolls of silk, 380 parcel carriers, and one curtain—in the back kitchen I found fourteen butts of leather, and four bundles of leather; and in the shop I found two merino boots, some shoes, four ladies' dresses, five sacks of harness, three pairs of carriage lamps, one pair of scales, six weights, three cards of lace, three pairs of boots, and a dress; and in a bedroom on the first floor two ladies' jackets, three dolmans, two pairs of trousers, one vest, two boys' suits, four pieces of baize, one muff, two coats, a dressing-gown, seventy-two cashmere uppers, and a silk skirt—I found in the pocket of one of the skirts £2 12s. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two rolls of canvas lining—in the shop I found two horsewhips—I took the property in a van to Kings land Road Police-station, and found Cook, Dodd, and Saunders in custody—I said to Cook, "I have searched your house and found what I have been looking for, a quantity of silk and velvet stolen from Mr. Evans last Friday night"—he said, "My God! that is a nice thing, I let these two top rooms to a man some weeks ago, and I had no idea what he had got there"—I said, "That you will have to prove"—these three pieces of velvet have been, identified; I found them in Dodd's shop thrown into the passage behind the door; Mr. Nalland has identified them—the property and the prisoners were conveyed to Leman Street station—I went to Fife's house, Baker's Row, about one a.m on Friday; I knocked at the door twice, a voice said, "Who is there? "Isaid, "All right, Harry, open the door, quick"—Fife opened the door, and I said, "Police,' and desired Dalbin to take him in custody—I searched the place and found three new carpet mats, a sealskin bag, a leather bag, and a piece of plush which has not been identified—he was taken to the station, and they were all four charged—I received this watch from Mr. Keppel.</p>

death—she is said to have paid rent for No. 8; that is Cook's shop—there were no new things, they were all second-hand—I asked her whether she was Mrs. Cook; she said, "Yes"—I sent Cook on to the station, and said, "I am going to search your place"—she said, "You will find nothing down here; I am very glad it has come to this, for I am tired of it; you had better go upstairs, you will find something there"—she rendered me every assistance in searching the house—she did not mention anybody but Cook—she went all over the house with me—I asked her for the key of the back room, which was looked; she said she had not got it—I forced it open, and with that she went downstairs—all the silk was found in that room; we had a van-load of silk and satin, and two-van loads of stolen property altogether, value about £2,000.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police Sergeant</hi> 53). On 20th December, about 11. 30, I was with Duke in Tower Street, and saw the prisoner and another man, with a drunken sailor—the sailor and the other man were sparring at each other, and the prisoner said to the sailor, "Take your coat off. Jack, and <hi rend="italic">go for him"</hi>—the sailor took his coat off and the prisoner took it—the other man ran away and the sailor ran after him—I then saw the prisoner put his hand in the outside pocket of the sailor's coat and withdraw it—I caught hold of him and said, "What have you got in your right hand?"—I heard money fall as if from his right hand—he then said, "Nothing"—I held him, and 2s. 1 1/2 d. was picked up off the pavement—I took him to the station—going there he said, "You know his coat was upside down"—Graham was also taken there and charged with being drunk and incapable—the prisoner had the overcoat on his arm, pockets downwards—the sailor gave his name Matthew Graham; he has gone to sea—the Magistrate discharged him next morning—the constable and a soldier took him to the station, not because he was so drunk, but he was obstreperous, and did not want to come—he could not walk straight, and he spoke thick—he said he remembered nothing of what took place—Duke was on the prisoner's right, and could hear what he said—he never said at any time, "I never touched the money"—this is my signature to my deposition—(<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>, "He said, 'I have not touched his money; you know his coat was turned upside down'")—I evidently said that at the Police-court—I cannot remember him saying, "I have not touched his money"—it was a Chesterfield long coat, not a pea jacket; the prisoner had it slung under his left arm—I do not know whether there were inside pockets, but there were two outside pockets; this is how he had it, folded, but not in half, and he took it out of this outside pockets, the side pocket nearest to him—this happened outside the Czar's Head—I was in plain clothes, Duke was with me the whole time; we were watching three or four minutes before we-interfered—</p>

               <p>I did not suspect the prisoner from the beginning—I have known him six years as a respectable man; he has worked for Mr. Joseph Hunt—I did not see the sailor's coat flung on the pavement, but one was picked up—the soldier picked one of the shillings up, another soldier was with him—he had not such a good opportunity of seeing the money drop as I had, he was on the left—the sailor was not searched at the station; we don't search drunken men.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">DUKE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 804). I was with Murphy outside the Czar's Head, and saw the prisoner and another man with a drunken sailor—the prisoner and the other man got up a quarrel, and the prisoner said, "Pull off your coat, Jack, and go <hi rend="italic">for</hi> him"—the prisoner took his coat from the sailor's hand, and as soon as he got it the other man ran away—the prisoner put his hand in the coat outside pocket, and Murphy took hold of his forearm and he dropped some money; I picked up two sixpences and three halfpence—at the station the prisoner said, "Don't you know the coat was turned upside down?"—I said, "No, the pockets were down."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Tower Street is fifteen or twenty yards wide there—we were on the same side as the public-house, outside it; we had crossed to that side—I think the fight was a got-up business—we were not a minute outside the public-house before this began—I said to Murphy, "Come on, quick"—he said, "All right, there is a job over there"—two privates in the Grenadier Guards were there, going to the Tower—they had not arrived when the sparring began—I saw the money drop out of the prisoner's right hand, the coat was then on his arm—I had seen the prisoner before, but did not know his name—the public-house had a broad glare of light, and any person looking across the street could see us—he works in the docks, I believe—I never knew him in any trouble or knew anything wrong of him—I did not hear him say, "I did not touch his money"—the sailor was drunk and could not walk, and I had to get the assistance of two soldiers; he staggered all over the place, reeling like a corkscrew—he ran after the other man about ten yards in a zigzag way and fell down—I should say he did not know anything about this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master carman, of 1, Albert Terrace, Silvertown—early on Friday morning, 21st December, I was in the Henley Arms, North Woolwich, with Lewis—the prisoner was in another compartment—he and Lewis had some conversation—I left the house; Lewis followed me—I saw the prisoner with two other men outside—the prisoner and another man came up, and the prisoner stabbed me on the forehead above the left eye—I afterwards found I had four other wounds, on my back, on the top of my head, at the back of my ear, and in the muscle of my arm—I was knocked down—I saw the prisoner, while he was holding me, stab Lewis, who came to my assistance, over the eye—he left go of me and stabbed him—this is the coat I was wearing—there are a good many holes in it, which were not there before; most of them are clean cuts—there is blood on the coat and on the waistcoat; there is one stab through the waistcoat, I think—Phillips came to my assistance and assisted me to the doctor, who dressed my wounds—I have been laid up at home for a fortnight—I am not under the doctor's treatment now; I keep the bandage on to keep the cold away—the prisoner was a stranger to me.</p>

'—I said, "No, she is not dead; but she is very dangerously ill in the hospital, and she says you did it with a penknife that you took from your pocket; have you got one about you?"—he put his hand in his pocket and produced this knife, and said, "This is the only one I have"—I took him to the station, left him there,' and went to Guy's Hospital, where I saw the girl—she made a statement to me—I returned to the station and again saw the prisoner—I said, "I</p>

               <p>have just come from Guy's Hospital, where I have seen the little girl Pembroke, and I asked her if she could tell me who the man was that cut her throat, and she said it was Bill Atkins; he lives at 21, Limerson Street, Bermondsey; they call him "Silly Billy"—I said, "Are you sure it is him?"—she said, "Yes, I know him quite well; he has done a little whitewashing and papering in our house about a fortnight ago"—he then said, "Yes, I did do the whitewashing and paperhanging there"—he was subsequently charged, and when it was read over to him he made no reply—I examined the knife; there were no marks of blood on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Marsh, of Redhill—the prisoner entered our service, as housekeeper, on 14th December last—she had a good character when she came to us—on the 19th December fol lowing, about half-past seven in the evening, I heard an alarm—I was inside the house at the time—the alarm came from the inside; someone inside the house told me that the nursery was on fire—that was not the prisoner's bedroom; hers was the room beyond, a small ante-room, through which I had to pass—at the time I first heard the alarm of fire, I think my husband was outside, to the best of my recollection—the only servant we had besides the prisoner was a nurse-girl, Annie Killick, aged about fifteen, or not quite fifteen; she had been with me nearly five months—as far as I know, there was no one else in the house but my three children, no other servant or anybody else employed in the house—on getting the alarm of fire, I rushed upstairs into the nursery; I found that it was full of smoke—passing that, I went into the prisoner's bed room; there I saw the blind had fallen, having been burnt, and the valens and fringe round the window was smouldering, and the bottom part of the bedclothes was on fire; they were smouldering, and there was dense smoke in the room—my husband was called, and he and I succeeded in putting the fire out—I advised the prisoner to sleep in another room that night—next evening, the 20th, about eight o'clock, I was again told that the nursery, was on fire—I proceeded there and found smoke proceed ing from the same room where I had been the night before, and the palliasse which I had left on the little iron bedstead, free from fire, was smouldering—I believe the prisoner was there, she had got up there before me—I broke the palliasse to pieces, and with the help of water I put the fire out—it was smouldering from the upper part—I think the</p>

               <p>prisoner was in the room when I went in, to the best of my recollection, out I should not like to be quite positive of that—it was not the prisoner who gave me the alarm on the second occasion, I believe she gave me the alarm the previous evening—about half-past eight on the 20th I received an alarm that there was fire in another room in the same part of the building—I really can't be quite sure who told me; that came from an opposite direction—I think that was about an hour after we had put out the other fire—that alarm was given from inside the house, it came from outside and then reached me—there is a street alarm outside the house—it was somebody in the street that gave the alarm, it was not given to me direct—on hearing it I rushed up the staircase the same as bei fore, and passing through a very large sitting-room to a large bedroom beyond, I found a petticoat and the curtains on fire, and the window blind and valens smouldering—with the help of some man who came up the side staircase with water we put it out—about half-past nine the next day, the 21st, I discovered some more fire—I went up to my bedroom, where I had seen the previous fire; I smelt smoke again, and found fire—I thought at first it must be fancy, but I opened a little side door, and saw volumes of smoke pouring along another landing, a different portion of the house—I rushed downstairs and called Mr. Marsh—I could not find him on one side of the building, I found him on the other—he went upstairs with me, and we ran from room to room, and eventually opened a door where the prisoner had slept the night before, and there in the middle of the bed I found the whole of the bedclothes were smouldering—the room was full of smoke, and the gas was alight over this smouldering—I and my husband succeeded in putting it out—the whole of the bedclothes were burnt; it had not touched the bed, but the whole of the bedclothes were in a mass of smouldering—about half-past seven that evening Mr. Marsh and I were in the office together—I went into the kitchen, where the nurse-girl and the prisoner were, and I said to the girl, "I want certain garments aired for the baby this evening; be sure you don't forget them"—I mentioned what I wanted—the prisoner was standing on one side of the kitchen-table, and on the other, facing her, was the little girl, with me, on my left-hand side—the prisoner immediately said to me, "Shall I go and fetch them? I know exactly where they are—in the long box"—I said, "Yes, if you like"—there is a staircase running parallel with the side of the kitchen—you have to go up some stairs from the kitchen to the room where the box was—there is a short landing and one flight of stairs—the box was in the sitting-room on that landing, the box was close to the door of that room—when I said to the prisoner, "Yes, if you like,"I passed back into the office, leaving them in the kitchen—I did not see the prisoner go—I was in the office two or three minutes when I heard the street door bell opposite the office door, and opposite the kitchen door from which I had just passed—I heard the nurse-girl run to answer the bell; I had left her in the kitchen—it was the street door bell that rang—I did not see the prisoner go out of the kitchen—I left her and the girl there together; it was the girl that went to answer the bell—she went towards the door, and I followed her, because I did not know whether she would be able to attend to the door, I saw her—I am sure it was her, I actually saw her, and know it was her—she had just opened the door; there is no doubt about it—a gentleman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188901070134"/>
               <p>was at the door—I opened the office door and showed him in—the girl was standing by my left side—as I was in the act of letting him pass me into the office I looked round on my left-hand side up the staircase, and saw smoke pouring along the landing—I said to the nurse-girl, "What, is this smoke again?" and I rushed upstairs—she followed me—I saw the box, and under the lid of it I saw smoke oozing out in all directions—I opened the box, and the clothes were really alight; a good many linen garments, children's pinafores were on fire, actually flaming—the prisoner was not in the room then; I found nobody in the room; the room door was not shut—I told the girl to get some water; she got some, and I poured it over the flames, and put the flames out; I pressed the whole mass together till I felt it was out, and then I closed the door and went downstairs, and called Mr. Marsh—he was in the office—I did not see the prisoner at all between my leaving the street door and finding the box on fire; I did not know where she was; I am not quite sure whether she was sent for or whether I went down and called her myself; she was downstairs, I am not quite sure where; she must have been downstairs—when I next saw her she came into the sitting-room where I was, where the fire had just been; I mean the last fire—the clothes were in an ottoman box—it was after my husband and I had put out the fire I saw the prisoner; I believe she came from downstairs, to the best of my recollection—as far as I remember I called her myself; she came into the room where I was—I said to her, "Will you explain this fire? you have just been here, not five minutes ago; was there a fire here when you came?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Then you ought to know; if you don't know how the fire got there you ought to know; I don't accuse you of lighting the fire, but I don't trust you any longer in my house, you must pack up your box and go; Mr. Marsh will see you to the station"—she said, "I know nothing whatever about it; it certainly looks very suspicious against me, but I have not lighted the fire"—I had asked her if she had been to the box—she said "Yes"—"Was there any fire when you went there?"—she said, "No"—she said she had got the things from the box—that was so; the things were taken out and were on the kitchen table—Mr. Marsh said he was not satisfied with her leaving the house under the circumstances, and he must have this investigated—he sent for the police, and an officer came—on the evening of 21st December a dressmaker was employed in the house; she only came to fit on a dress; she was in the bedroom where the second fire was, not the room where the prisoner slept, but my bedroom; she was only waiting there to try my dress on for me—I was there with her, having my dress fitted on—that was before I went down to the kitchen there was no needlework going on—her name is Miss Carr—she was not in the house at the time of the last fire—she had not been there the day before when the other fires occurred; only on the 21st, not on the 19tn or 20th—the second fire was is the billiard-room, on the 20th; that would be the fourth—the billiard-room is a very large room; it is not used as a billiard-room, it is called the south bedroom—it used to be a billiard room, that is how it got that name—the box with the clothes in it was not in that room—the prisoner told me that she had to go into the bar to serve a customer after I left the kitchen—I don't know that of my own knowledge—I can't say whether or not there would have been time for</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was part of her duty to serve in the bar—I had a written character with her—I have found out since that she had been four months before coming to us at Brighton with a relation—the first fire that occurred was in her bedroom, that I discovered in the evening—there was gas in that room—I cannot remember whether the gas was alight when I went there—it was a gas arm about one-quarter of a yard long, a single moveable bracket, that you can twist backwards and for wards; you can twist it towards the blind—when I went up the first time I believe the prisoner was in the room; to the best of my recollection she did not go up with me—I went up by myself, the nurse-girl following—the prisoner never attempted any assistance in putting out the blind, or made any remark; the blind had fallen—Mr. Marsh came up just behind me in some few seconds, and he put it out—my eldest child is four years old in February—one child was in bed—the second fire occurred next evening in the same room; that was the palliasse of the bed—the bed was lying under the window against the wall, that would be close to the blind and near the gas bracket; the prisoner was in the room then—I said to her, "How is this?" she said, "I am sure I don't know"—I said, "How strange!"—I think she went in just before me, to the best of my recollection—the third fire was in my room the same evening—I was standing between the doors at the bottom of the staircase when someone exclaimed that our bedroom was on fire—the prisoner did not go up with me, I found her behind me afterwards—that fire was very quickly put out; it took longer than the others—the fourth fire was in the billiard room; that room was very rarely used, the gas would very rarely be alight—I told the prisoner to go and sleep in that room, we conveyed the bed there—when I went to bed about half-past eleven I looked and she had a candle—she had no need to light the gas—at the time when she volunteered to go up and get the clothes I don't know whether she went at once, I went immediately into the office; I was there I think about three minutes before I went to the side door to answer the bell, it might have been a little more—it was then I saw the nurse-girl—as far as I knew the prisoner was thoroughly content with her place with us—she made no complaint, not the least—the servant-girl had made no complaint to me, the prisoner had made complaints of her; she complained that she behaved rudely to her—I told the girl of it; we called her in, and Mr. Marsh told her she had behaved rudely to the prisoner—the complaint the prisoner made was that as she and the char woman were having their tea together the girl stood still looking at them; she fold her to go upstairs to the nursery, and she did not go as quickly as she liked, and she immediately came into the office and told us of the girl standing looking rudely at them, and we called her in and told her that she ought not to do that sort of thing—I told her that the prisoner had made that complaint of her—she did not answer in any way—she did not say she was sorry, or make any answer, or excuse herself—she was not at all pleased—she did not at all like being called to account—we mildly scolded her—that was not the only time I had cause to do so—she was a young child, very inexperienced, and she had my little children, and I wished her to go in my way—when I told the prisoner to go for the things I did not</p>

I am a livery stable-keeper at Redhill—I was in the stable on the evening of 19th December last—that is on the same side of the house as the bedroom, which was then occupied by the prisoner—I was seeing the stables shut up for the night—while I was doing that the nurse-girl came running out calling me, and saying that the nursery was on fire—I went into the house and upstairs—I found the room adjoining the nursery on fire; that was the room occupied by the prisoner; I could see the flame, that was all I could see for the smoke—the flame was at the window; the room was full of smoke—I could not see who was there till I got to the window, I then found my wife and the prisoner, they were both trying to extinguish the fire; I assisted, and at last put it out—next day I was away from home and know nothing of what then occurred—the next day, the 21st, I was at home in the morning; about nine o'clock, just after I had had breakfast, I went into the yard to give orders; I had scarcely got out there before the nurse-girl came running out again, "Mrs. Marsh wants you directly upstairs;"I went in and ran upstairs—my wife said, "The place is full of smoke again"—we both commenced searching for the fire, she went one way and I the other; last of all I went to the room that the prisoner had slept in, called the billiard-room; I opened the door and found the room full of smoke; I went straight in and saw the bedclothes smouldering red hot—I immediately ran and pulled them and rolled them all up together, and carried them out in the passage, and one of my men brought a pail of water which I threw on the remnants, trampled on them, and put the fire out—about half-past seven the same evening I was in my office writing, when I heard someone call out, "Come upstairs directly, there is more smoke in the house"—I won't be positive whose voice it was—I ran up, and there found my wife by the side of the box, and the girl by the side of her—she said that she had found the box all ablaze, and had thrown one jug of water on it—I said, "Fetch another," and I poured it out and put my hands and pressed the things together, and made sure the fire was quite out—the prisoner was downstairs all this time; I found her in the kitchen; my wife went down and called her, and she came upstairs, as if from the kitchen—I did not see her come out of the kitchen—I asked her if she could in any way account for these fires, it was a very mysterious thing that I should have had five fires break out in forty-eight hours in different parts of the house, and wherever she went the fires followed soon after—she said, "Yes, it certainly looks very suspicious, but I know nothing about it"—I said,</p>

I am nearly fifteen years old—in December last I was in Mrs. Marsh's service; I have now left—I had been there for some five months—on 21st December, in the evening, I was in the kitchen with Mrs. Marsh and the prisoner—Mrs. Marsh said I had better go and get some things for the baby to change to-night—she did not tell me where to go for them; I knew they were kept in the long box up stairs, in a different place to where they used to be, but I knew where they were—the prisoner said, "I will go and get them," because she knew where they were—I did not answer when Mrs. Marsh spoke to me; I was going, when the prisoner said she would go—she went up and got them, and brought them down and put them on the kitchen table, or put them round the guard to air—she was upstairs about a minute—I then heard the door bell ring; I ran to the door and let the gentleman in—Mrs. Marsh ran to the door and spoke to him, and the gentleman walked into the parlour—Mrs. Marsh saw some smoke coming down the stairs; I was with her then; I saw the smoke—Mrs. Marsh ran upstairs, and I went up behind her—she went into the sitting-room; I did not follow her—she went in and shut the door, and told me to get some water, and I got a basinful from the tap upstairs and took it to her—I knew that there had been four fires in the house before—I had not set fire to them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). I saw this letter handed in to the Court before the Magistrates on Monday, that was in the presence of the prisoner—she referred to it in her deposition—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was read as follows</hi>)—"To Mr. Pearson, Superintendent of Police. Dear Sir,—I am perfectly sure that the nurse-girl, Annie Killick, is guilty of trying to set fire to Mrs. Marsh's house. When the first fire took place, she it was who turned the gas up and drew it in front of the blind, of which I cautioned her at the time, when she, of course, denied having been there. The second fire, which occurred in Mrs. Marsh's bedroom some few minutes after Annie Killick had been, it is supposed, up in the nursery, where she ran when the dressmaker and Mrs. Marsh left the latter's bedroom. The third fire was in the billiard-room, where I did not know that the gas would light. The two nights that I slept there I took my candle with me, and brought it down with me in the morning to light the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188901070139"/>
               <p>fire. The gas was lighted there on the morning of the fire for breakfast, when Annie was supposed to be up in the nursery; so you see, Sir, suspicion points to her. The last, in the box, of which I am accused, occurred soon after I had been unfortunate enough to fetch the child's clothes from it, which I brought down and placed on the kitchen table, beside which Annie was sitting. I then had to go to the bar to serve several customers, and when I returned Annie was upstairs; soon after that the box was on fire. I have quite forgotten to mention that when Mrs. Marsh's curtains were burning, Annie burst out laughing, saying at the same time, 'There is no danger with so many men on the building'; all this seems to me to be quite sufficient, even if it was not for her con fession to me, that she hated Mrs. Marsh since I have been there more than ever before—to use her own words, 'She had been nasty to her. 'I have nothing more to say, Sir. You will judge which is the guilty; obtain my release, I beseech you; for after two such dreadful nights as I have had, my very soul is weary of my life. I feel almost too ill to speak. See that they set me free, Sir, I beg, or I shall die before long. As God is my witness my statement is true. Heaven bless you for your kindness to me."</p>

Up to the time Ikeson walked down Globe Street he had not struck me; I thought he was going away quietly—I should say he was not more than two or three yards from me when he turned to come back, because I had run towards him running after Reed—he had got about twenty yards from me before I started to run after Reed, far enough to give me the idea that I had done with him—after I seized Reed the cry was not raised by Ikeson, but he came back on hearing it, and then the eight or nine set on me—I was struck and pushed on all sides; they all seemed determined to rescue Reed—very probably I struck Ikeson with my staff; I won't swear I did—I was attacked by eight or nine people all the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor, and am a seaman in H. M. Navy—I was stationed at Sheerness—I was paid off my ship on 19th July, 1887, but they had granted me eight days' leave, and on 18th July I was in Hampton Wick, and saw the prisoner there, and I saw a woman named Sarah Waller in a public-house, but did not see the prisoner there—I left the public-house with the woman, and met the prisoner at the corner of a street, which I do not know the name of—I asked him to show me the way to where the girl lived—the girl was not with me then—I missed her on the way down, before I met the prisoner—I was not drunk, but I had been drinking—when I asked him to show me the way, he took me up a dark lane and knocked me down—the only words I had said to him were, "Will you show me where the girl lives?—he knew what girl I meant, because it was the girl I was with—she was not with me then—when I asked him to show me where she lived he said, "Come along, I will show you"—I do not know how he knew anything about the girl, but he appeared to know, because he said that he would show me—he had not to my recollection seen me with her—I went with him; he took me up a dark lane, knocked me down, and robbed me of my watch and 8s.—I never saw him after that till I had to come up to identify him three or four weeks ago—he was put with four or five others at the Police station, and I identified him—I did not prefer the charge against the prisoner before, because I have been away—I was in the West Indies some months, and then I went mobilising for some months.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The reason I made that statement was that Mr. Wilkinson got up and said, "You must not expect any favour, or be afraid of any threats," and I said, "No, I expect no favour, and fear no threats; what I say I will say where I am going to be tried."I could not get half a chance of speaking. I go away in the summertime. My occupation is wherever I can get occupation. I do not live at Kingston; I was dismissed the Army for striking a sergeant, and I made that my home. I am not guilty of this charge. I could get plenty of witnesses up to speak for me, twenty or thirty, only I am a poor man and have not got the money. There is not a publican in Kingston who can give me a bad name.</p>
