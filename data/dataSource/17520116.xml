I was with the prisoner and the deceased a fortnight ago to night, in the house of Mr. Baker, called the Three Tippling Philosophers in St. Alban's-street ; there were words passed in anger between the prisoner and landlady ; she accused him with having called her old bawd; he said, it was not him, but the deceased that had called her so; at which time Stockbourne the deceased came in, and opposed the prisoner in what he had said; he called him names, and challenged him to fight in <placeName id="t17520116-1-crimeloc3">Hyde-Park</placeName>

               <p>Q. What did they mean by that?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. Their meaning was, that there should not be law taken on either side.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that mentioned ?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. It was, my Lord; the deceased fix'd upon fighting the next morning by eight o'clock, in the ring in Hyde Park, and he that was not there at the time appointed, his money was to be forfeited, fight or not fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they meet at the time?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. They did; I saw them both in the ring when I was about a hundred yards distance; I saw them tying their garters below knee, making themselves ready, I hallow'd out, Cod speed your labour.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it by any blow, or by missing the prisoner, which occasioned him to fall?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. He received a blow over his temple, and he made an offer at the prisoner; his hand went up. and he fell.</p>

            . I know nothing of laying the wager; I was called up between seven and eight o'clock that morning; he told me the men were going to fight; I saw them, when he did, tying their garters below their knees; when we came within the ring, the deceased asked Wheeler, if he would be his second; he answered, if there were no better man there, than he was, he would; as they were going to fight, a man said, gentlemen, shake hands, don't fight in malice; they shook hands; they had about three or four blows, and the deceased gave the prisoner two falls, which were such that they could not hurt any body; they were help'd up again and set too; the prisoner hit the deceased two or three hard blows about the temple with his left hand; I don't remember him doing any thing with his right hand but guard himself; the deceased almost knocked him down by a blow on the stomach, then he went to give a catch at the prisoner to throw him, but missed it and fell down as he went to make a blow at the prisoner; his head seemed to plow the ground; his second went to lift him up and could not; the other second said, Why don't you hand him up; he answered he could not; the other went to help him and said, he believed he was dead or dying; the other said, God forbid; I looked in his face and said, I believed he was dying ; I went for a Surgeon, but I could not find one up; I looked about for a barber to bleed him, and at last I got a person out of Hyde-Park Infirmary, but before I got there, he was as dead as a stone.</p>

               <p>Sharp. I don't remember he hit him any where beside the temples; I believe the deceased was never right in his senses after he received the first blow, and he strove to fight but could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he strike the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Sharp. He did give the prisoner one blow on the stomach, and I thought he would have fell, but he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Sharp. I have known him about two years; I have drank in his company several times, but not much acquainted ; I never heard a bad character of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who struck the first blow.</p>
               <p>Sharp. They put themselves in a posture of defence, and I think the prisoner received the first blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did you take to be the strongest of the two.</p>
               <p>Sharp. I took the deceased to be considerably the strongest man.</p>

               <p>Over night the deceased challenged to fight me in the morning; I was desired to stay and lie with some chairmen, fearing I should be too late, but I went home and lay with my wife, and was called out of my bed; I had no animosity against the prisoner, but only in defence of myself; when we fought, we both shook hands, and said, we had no animosity ; when they said he was dead, I said, Lord have mercy, I hope not. I was desired to quit the ring, and make off; I said I would not, so I surrendered myself.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first miss these things?</p>
               <p>Gillpbilling. I miss'd 'em the 21st of December; the first of my missing them was, my servant had borrowed a book of a friend to read, the prisoner was seen to have it in his hand; it was missing ; going to look for it, I missed my cloaths which used to hang upon pins, &amp;c. The prisoner was gone out at that time, I ordered our people, that when he came in to say nothing to him but to let him have a candle and go to bed, he came and went to bed, and there I took him, and gave him in charge to the constable ; he immediately confessed to the constable and me, where he had pawned one shirt for four shillings, and begged for mercy at my hands, and he said he had sold my cloaths out-right to people that cry'd old cloaths in the street; he went with me to hart-street by convent-garden, to the place where he said he had pawned the shirt; the pawn-broker produced the shirt. [Deposed to by the prosecutor]</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the shirt before you lost it?</p>
               <p>Gillpbilling. It was either in the buroe or somewhere in the dining room; there was an attempt made upon my buroe to open it.</p>
               <p>Samuel Green. The prosecutor came to me and told me he had been robbed, I went with him home and found the prisoner, we accused him with robbing the prosecutor of several coats and other things, he with little hesitation acknowledged he took the things, and sold some in the streets, and pawned a shirt, he went with us the same night to the place, and it was delivered to the prosecutor; the prisoner begged we would be as favourable to him as we could.</p>

            , December 7. I remembered his face when he came with the prosecutor, I know he had been at our shop before, but I cannot tell he was the person that brought the shirt, and I heard him say since he pawned it.</p>
               <p>David Mac Donald. I am servant to the prosecutor, the prisoner lodged about three weeks at our house; after the things were lost, and he taken into custody, I heard him confess the taking the coat and waistcoat, a pair of breeches, and a shirt, which he said he pawned near Covent-garden, and that the cloaths he had sold in the open streets for old cloaths.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>They made me confess things that I knew nothing of : there were several people lodged in the house besides me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Green. Were there any threats or promises made use of to induce him to confess?</p>
               <p>Green. There were not, the prosecutor told him he missed such and such wearing apparel, and that he had reason to suspect him, and that he had better without any farther dispute acknowledge it; the prisoner immediately said I hope you will be favourable to me, I did take such and such things, it was all in a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Have you any other lodgers in your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have several; I let some rooms out, which I have no occasion for, unfurnished, but they have no business in this room where the things were.</p>

               <p>Freeman. It is an old sow side; if you please to send it to be weighed, it weighs eight stone all but a pound. It was sold by one Mr. Larum, but it was not delivered; I had received the money for it, and after it was stole, I was obliged to return the money again.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last ?</p>

             ; the room was so cold I could not stay there above two nights, so I desired my box, with the goods mentioned in the indictment in it, might be left there ; I went to my box on the 23d of December, and found it broke open, and the things mentioned were missing, with other things which I did not put in the indictment. I told the landlord my box was broke open; he told me no body but the prisoner, he, and his wife, went into that room; the prisoner lay in that room. I went to Alderman Chitty for a warrant, and had the prisoner taken up the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160008"/> day and brought before him; he was committed and would own nothing ; I desired to know whether the shirt on his back was his or mine, it being mark'd R. O. No. 1. ( produced in court and deposed to.) Going along to the Compter, he confessed where the snuff-box and gold ring were; the snuffbox he had sold for 8 s. at the Golden Cup on Tower-Hill, and the ring to a Silversmith over the way, at the corner of the Minories for 12 s. I never got them again; the woman at the Golden Cup would not own she bought such a thing, nor the man in the Minories the ring. He sent me another shirt, which he said he had left at the washerwoman's, and the mettal watch chain was given at the same time.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I am not certain as to the day.</p>
               <p>Lepard continues. Mr. Owen mentioned the things he had lost; we carried him before the Alderman; there he desired the things, but Mr. Owen found one of his shirts on his back; the Alderman ordered him to the Compter; he owned the taking the snuff-box and ring, out of Mr. Owen's box at a public-house, going along, and also to the taking the other shirts.</p>

               <p>Owen. He was, we had had but two pots of beer at the time that he confessed the taking the things, and where he sold them; he put his hand to it; it is only a memorandum where the things were.</p>

               <p>Q. How many people were there in the coach?</p>
               <p>Fry. There were none but that gentlewoman and I, whose name is

            ; after she had spoke, I heard the man say, or I'll blow your brains out, by G - d. I put my hand in my pocket, and gave him all the money I had in it; I know it was nothing less than 20 shillings, and I am sure there was more; among the silver I told him there was a coronation medal, and said I had a greater regard for it than the other, and begg'd him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160009"/> return it : he did, asking if I had a mind to any thing else ; I said, no, the money was his, but I thanked him for the medal.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you fight of his face so as to know him again?</p>
               <p>Fry. No, I was not in an advantageous situation to see him, because the canvass was up at that time; he did not ask the gentlewoman for any thing at all, but as soon as he had got the money, he rode of in haste.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you think it was?</p>
               <p>Fry. We left Whitechapel directly at the hour of eight, at the Coach and Horses, by the dial there, and I believe we were gone about a mile and half before we were stopp'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe what sort of a man he was?</p>
               <p>Fry. He was a thin meager man, seemed to be about 23 or 24 years of age, his voice had a similitude to the voice of the prisoner.</p>

            . I was in the Stratford coach along with Mr. Fry; I sat on the right side of him; the canvass was three parts up; the coachman made many stops; I was angry at him; we set out between eight and nine, I think it was just upon the turn of eight, it was a good while before we were stopp'd; when the man came up he demanded our money; I said, what do you want? he was on horseback on my side; we let down the canvass immediately part of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it low enough to see his face?</p>
               <p>E. Day. It was so low that I could see his legs; when he asked us for our money, I said I had only some half-pence; he swore, don't make a noise, if you do I'll shoot you thro' the brains. Mr. Fry gave him his money, and told him amongst it there was a coronation medal, which could be of no more value to him than the silver, and desired he'd return it; he looked in his hat, and took out a piece, and asked him if that was it? he said it was, and thank'd him for it; then he wish'd us a good night, and rode off.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think he was with you?</p>
               <p>E. Day. I believe he was about four minutes by the side of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the moon shine?</p>
               <p>E. Day. It did, and I looked at his face all the while; he was a thin man, and I am almost sure it was the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him, can you speak positively whether that is the man ?</p>
               <p>E. Day. I think positively he is the man; I can positively say upon my cath, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he very near the coach?</p>
               <p>E. Day. He came as near the coach as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. What apparel had that man on?</p>
               <p>E. Day. He was shabbily dressed; I did not observe the colour of his cloaths; he had seemingly a great coat on; but I can't describe his cloaths, for I looked all the while in his face.</p>

            . I was driving the coach, Mr. Fry and that gentlewoman was in it; when we came to Mile-End, I took up a gentleman's servant who lives at Stratford on the box along with me; a young fellow on horseback passed me on this side Cut-throat-lane; going through that lane, I crossed over where the quarter met; his horse was foundered before; he turn'd over and came to me; I said to the servant, don't be afraid, if you'll stand by me, I'll jump upon him; he said he had a charge of money about him, and was in fear; when the man came up to my horses heads, he presented a pistol to me, and I stopp'd directly; he turned his pistol and knocked at the coach window, which was up; then my horse on the near side began to pull a little; he presented his pistol again, and said, Why don't you stop, or I'll blow your head of; I stopp'd, and then he presented his pistol to them in the coach, and demanded their money; I heard the gentleman say, you shall have all the money I have got; I saw his face for about four minutes when his hat was off, at which time he stroaked his hand over his forehead two or three times, and seemed vastly saint ; after he had got the money he said, coachman, go along, and the went away, as easy as you may walk a horse, towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Weller. It was between eight and nine o'clock when I set off from the Coach and Horses; it was then eight o'clock, and I really believe the prisoner is the man; I am positive he is, I have known him for three or four years before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you seen him before?</p>
               <p>Weller. I have seen him at the Bull-Head, and also in Petticoat-lane amongst the Horners.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen him last?</p>
               <p>Weller. I had not seen him for about a quarter of a year before that time he stopped the Coach.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times do you think you may have seen him before?</p>
               <p>Weller. I have seen him above twenty times before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160010"/>Q. Look carefully at him, and see whether you think him to be the man?</p>
               <p>Weller. Positively I swear he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Weller. He was dressed middling; not very shabby: he had on a blue Coat</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or dark night?</p>
               <p>Weller. It was quite a moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this servant you took up by you?</p>
               <p>Weller. It was Mr. Wall's servant: I went to him, he said he turned his head another Way, having a charge of money of his master's about him, that he could not swear to him, so I did not bring him up: the next day after the robbery, Mr. Darby and I took the prisoner in Stoney-Alley?</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be taken up?</p>
               <p>Weller. Because I knew him before: I met a young fellow, a black-shoe boy, who directed us where to find him: I went into the house where he was; there were two or three men, and one of them said, Cokey, I heard you was robbed last night, saying, did not you see me drive a cow through the turnpike? I turned about and saw the prisoner standing by: I went out and told the man who was with me, I was afraid of these men, but he being armed went in with me and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the coachman came in he had some gin and ale; he and the man went out together, and said there was no-body they wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. to Weller. Did you say so?</p>
               <p>Weller. No, my Lord, I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Patrick-Darby. I am servant to Mr. Fry; when my master came home, he told us he had been robbed, and the coachman said he knew the man; I went with him to Whitechapel; we were afraid to meddle with him that night; a person led us to the Gentleman and Porter alehouse in Stoney-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the coachman tell you the prisoner's name that robbed Mr. Fry?</p>
               <p>Darby. No, he did not till he came to White-Chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he tell you his name was ?</p>
               <p>Darby. He said it was Williams, and described him to me answerable to what he now appears; a this meager man; we went from the Gentleman and Porter to another house, there I checked the coachman for not apprehending him, he said he was afraid of having his brains beat out, upon which we went in again, he told me which was the man, and I took him directly, I had a hanger and some fire-arms, on account of some threatning letters the gentlemen at Bow had received.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I have evidences here to prove I was at another place at that time.</p>

            . I am tun-man to Alderman Gascoyne, I know the prisoner; one time he was a night man; he has work'd for a pump-maker about five weeks come Monday next, I can neither write nor read, so can't tell the day of the month; on that night I happened to go into the Gentleman and Porter ale-house in Stoney-lane, near Gravel-lane, Houndsditch, about six o'clock at night, I staid till about half an hour after seven; I was obliged to go to my club, at the Punch-bowl in Moor-fields, amongst the brokers; I went and told the society I could not stay, that I must go to my duty; I came back and did my duty, and went to the same alehouse, about a quarter after eleven, and called for a pint of purl, the prisoner was then in the same place, and the same dress, as when I left him; I desired him to go to sea, or into the country for work.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you give that advice?</p>
               <p>Moseena. Because I know he now lives with a woman, that does him no service, I had known him five or six years before.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd?</p>

               <p>Q. From what was it you made your observation to know what time of the night it was, as you say you cannot write nor read, nor did observe the day of the month?</p>

After he had got the things, he bid me a good night, and rode off. There was another man on the other side, but I never saw his face, and I could very well tell the man who robbed me if I could see him; the prisoner is not that man, for I don't know him at all. Two days after this, as I had described the men in the news-papers, two men came to me, Norton and Booth, and said they knew the men which I had described.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you describe them both, as you did not see the other's face.</p>
               <p>Hill. My servant had fight of the other; I went with the men to Justice Fielding's. I gave him the description upon oath of the man who took my things, and my servant described the man who held a pistol to him on the other side. The two men said, by my describing them, their names were one Jennings, the other Rose. The prisoner was some days after that taken up for another crime, and answered the description given by my servant of the man that came on the other side of the coach, and held a pistol to his head. The prisoner there attempted to prove himself at another place at the time, but without success.</p>

               <p>Q. How far off did you see them?</p>
               <p>Hurst. I saw them near two-hundred yards before they came up; as they came near the body of the chariot, they both presented a pistol to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160013"/> coachman, who stopped; then he drove on again ; they both turned their horses about, and rode up to him, and said, they'd blow his brains out, if he did not stop; he rode up, and put his pistol into the chariot door, and the first words I heard him say to my master, was, D - n it, Sir, this does not do.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side did he come up on?</p>
               <p>Hurst On the left side of the chariot, the other turned about and presented a pistol to me, and said, D - n you. Sir, if you offer to stir, I'll blow your brains out. The man who robb'd my master had on a blue cape coat, with part of the cape put up under his hat behind: I did not see his face, the other had on a long white great coat, buttoned down to the saddle, the cape buttoned as the other's was, with one button under his chin, and put up behind under his hat. After my master had given him his money, he said ; D - n it, that does not do, give me your watch. My master said, it will fetch but little, for it is in a steel cafe; the man said, give it me as it is: then they turned their horses about, and wished him a good night, and went off towards Hampstead?</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know him?</p>
               <p>Hurst. His voice, stature, and features, as much as I could discern, answer to the man who held his pistol to my head.</p>

               <p>Hurst. It was about five o'clock.</p>

             desired I would go along with him on the Thursday Morning before Christmas week, saying, there is a mercer's shop he could break open: we went to the house between twelve and one o'clock at night, and he cut a hole in the window-shutter with a knife, and punched a tap-borer against the glass and broke it, then he put in his hand and took out about fifty-two or fifty-three silk handkerchiefs, a quantity of cheque handkerchiefs, and some birds-eye ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this house?</p>
               <p>Mace. It is in Whitechapel, next door but one or two to the Bishop Blaze. We carried them home to a lodging house where we lodged in Church-lane, right against the Punch-Bowl: there are a great many people lodge these. In the morning, about seven, I went and knocked Madding up: he lives in the New-change, Rag-Fair: he opened the door and let me in, and I chucked the handkerchiefs down; he looked at them, and said, if I had a thousand, he'd buy them. We bargained, he was to have given me 6 l. for them: he often buys stolen goods: he said, if I would bring the King's Crown to him, he would buy it: he went out, and I never saw him till eight o'clock, then he brought me three pounds, and said, if I'd call in an hour's time, he'd give me three pounds more. I did, he gave me but two pounds ten shillings, so he cheated me of ten shillings. Wooldridge was with me at the time we had used to go picking pockets of handkerchiefs, and sell them to him all over snuff.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was you bred to?</p>
               <p>Mace. I am an apprentice to a weaver, but I left my master about half a year: Wooldridge did work at brickmaking.</p>

When he informed me, I suspected him, and stopped him: he then said, if you'll let me go, you shall have your saws again. I took out a warrant and searched his lodgings, and there I found all the saws mentioned in the indictment: he acknowledged that he broke into the house, before Justice Lediard; that he went up stairs and broke open the chest with a socket chissel; that he took mine out of the chest, and broke the door open up one pair of stairs with his axe, and so came at the other saws. He had worked for me about ten weeks, and I never suspected him before. [The saws produced in court.]</p>

On Tuesday the 10th of December I was employed by some people to execute this warrant, [holding one in his hand] which I had from Mr. Justice Foster, on the prisoner at the bar. When we had spent some time in Spital-Fields, we were informed, the prisoner had secreted himself, so that we could not take him: I parted with them, and we appointed another time, which was Sunday the 15th. I was informed he had been convicted upon an action, brought at Westminster, by some Weavers. On the day appointed, I and another Tipstaff met the people in Wheeler-street. almost opposite where the prisoner lived. We several times went into the stair-case, and found his door was shut. We returned to the public-house, the landlord's name is Virtue Hughes, he was Headboborough : there was a man with these people, who, they said, would assist me; his name was

I understanding the landlord would execute it, they said, they would take care to do it: I desired them to make no breach in the law whatsoever. I also said to the Headborough, take care of yourself, for, from the character these people give him, he is a very dangerous man: the watchman said, if I see him, I'll fasten him, I am strong enough for him.

            . I am a Weaver, and live in Betnnal-Green Parish : I remember Mr. Thomas, the Tipstaff, delivering that warrant to me, in the presence of the officer in his own house, on the 15th of December, there being no possibility of coming at the prisoner, about four or five in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160017"/> evening: about an hour after that, Mr. Hughes asked me for the warrant, I delivered it to him, he read it, and delivered it to me again: I put it in my pocket, then we agreed to make no attempt to take him that night. Between six and seven I went out into the street, in order to tell the deceased and two or three more, who were waiting to see him come down stairs, that we had no thoughts of taking the man that night. Mr. Cutting said to me, have you a mind to see Brezeau ? I said, yes, I could like to see him and his lodging; then said he, come along with me. We went up the stairs, which came down into the street; he ordered me to take hold on the bottom of his coat ; on the second landing place, we look'd through a little pane of glass on the right-hand side, about the breadth of the palm of my hand, I saw Brezeau sitting by the fire, and a little boy sitting by him, eating out of a porringer, with a spoon: then I was for coming down stairs again: I left Cutting on the landing-place, and when I had got six or seven stairs down, or thereabouts, it was so dark that I fell up and took hold of Cutting's shoe, and gave it a pinch to come down, at which time I heard Mrs. Brezeau say, Who is that? I think she repeated it a second time; I knew her voice well, having known her some years, immediately I heard a chair rattle: as soon as that noise was over, I saw the door thrown open, and saw Mrs. Brezeau and a candle upon the table by the fire-side, and the prisoner was standing in the center of the room, and the deceased went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the deceased when the door was flung open?</p>
               <p>Williams. He was standing upon the landing-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the warrant then?</p>
               <p>Williams. I had it then in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done upon Cutting's going into the room?</p>
               <p>Williams. I saw them close directly in the center of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door opened, do you think, by violence, or otherwise?</p>
               <p>Williams. There seemed to be no force, I believe it was thrown open by the woman within: they being two strong men, I imagined I saw something of a struggling ; I supposed the prisoner went to turn him out of the room; I called while I was upon the stairs for assistance; for when we went up, we had no design upon the man, therefore we were unprepared : one

            : Bennet had hold on the prisoner with his arm extended and a hanger in his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the constable to return the warrant again to you?</p>
               <p>Williams. I imagine it to be because he and I had agreed to make no attempt to take him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade was Cutting?</p>
               <p>Williams. He was a Weaver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased offer to come down when you took hold of his foot?</p>
               <p>Williams. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk to each other on the stairs ?</p>
               <p>Williams. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing with his back to the fire, or the door?</p>
               <p>Williams. He was standing with his face to the door, in the middle of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a large or small room?</p>
               <p>Williams. There was a bed and a loom in it; I imagine it not to be a small room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing when Cutting went into the room?</p>
               <p>Williams. I did not hear him say any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing upon seeing the door open?</p>
               <p>Williams. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he advance towards the prisoner, or the prisoner towards him?</p>
               <p>Williams. I cannot tell, it was in a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they close?</p>
               <p>Williams. I imagined it was the design in the struggling to try which should get the better.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with the deceased when you went to tell him your thoughts were laid aside for that night?</p>
               <p>Williams.

               <p>Williams. I imagined the warrant was of no effect in my possession, and accordingly. I run down stairs to deliver it to Hughes that he might come up and serve it.</p>

            . On the 15th of December I was at the bottom of the prisoner's stairs: I heard Mr. Williams, come running down, crying out assistance: I advanced up directly, I pass'd by him on the stairs: I heard the cry of murder very load, I apprehended it to be Mr. Cutting's voice: I knew it well: I went up, the door was fast, it: had a thin latch, I clap'd my hand upon it in order to open it, and said, open the door, they did not: I was by myself about a minute or two, there the man cry'd out murder all the while, he repeated it a good many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear above one voice ?</p>
               <p>Provost. I heard none but Cutting's voice: I am sure it was his voice, and the cry was murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any bufallng about?</p>
               <p>Provost. I did not, Mr. Hughes, and Mr. Gosset came up: they knocked at the door, and Mr. Hughes said, open the door here is an officer: we asked them several times: they did not, the man was then crying murder, we pushed against the door, and burst it open: the first: thing I observed was Cutting: he was lying on the bed, on his back, and the prisoner bent over him, and something betwixt them: I saw they both had their hands upon the thing: I clapt the prisoner on the right shoulder and said, you villain you are murdering the man: I had no sooner said so, but the sword was drawn out of the deceased's body, and extended upwards by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner's feet on the floor ?</p>
               <p>Provost. They were, Mr. Bennet clapp'd hold of the prisoner's wrist and rung the hanger out of his hand: the deceased got up and went down stairs, and said he was murdered and killed, &amp;c. the prisoner did not speak a word at that time: I saw the deceased again about eleven o'clock at night: he had two wounds, one was under his pap, and the other lower down on the side of his belly: and his finger were cut on one hand. I saw the hanger afterwards Woody; I asked the deceased before several people, who killed him? he was in his senses, and answered, Brezeau the Frenchman: I asked him with what, he said with a sword: I asked him how many times he stabb'd him: he said twice, he was asked the same over again, he answered as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any further account?</p>
               <p>Provost. No, he did not, this was about eleven at night.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go up with the deceased and Williams ?</p>
               <p>Provost. Because I heard Mr. Williams say, they did not think of taking the prisoner that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear murder call'd out before or after Mr. Williams call'd assistance?</p>
               <p>Provost. It was after that, I heard that try as soon as I passed Mr. Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been at the door, before Mr. Hughes came up ?</p>
               <p>Provost. He came up about a minute or two after I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did the door open ?</p>
               <p>Provost. It opened inwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the bed from the fire place?</p>
               <p>Provost. I believe it is about three yards distance: the fire is on the right hand side going in, and the bed stands facing the fire: there was a small table by the fire, and a loom in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any account who took hold of the hanger first?</p>
               <p>Provost. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they struggling? in what manner ?</p>
               <p>Provost. The prisoner was like bearing the instrument towards the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door locked or bolted ?</p>
               <p>Provost. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Virtue Hughes. I am headborough : I went to the prisoner's lodgings about seven o'Clock that night: one Mr. Liesaword came running to my house, and said, Come along, there is murder called out: I asked for Mr. Williams, I went over; and at the bottom of the stairs I met him: I asked for the warrant, he gave it me: Mr. Gosset and Mr. Bennet went up to the landing place: I heard a man call out Murder ! Murder! Murder! which surprised me very much: I clapp'd my thumb on the latch, and shov'd the door hard, but the door would not open: I ordered Mr. Gosset and Mr. Bennet to break it open they did: Bennet<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160019"/> crowded by me; I saw the deceased on his back on the bed, and the prisoner over him, his arm went backwards and forwards, I pulled out my staff as soon as I got in, and Mr. Bennet took hold on the prisoner, he turned about, and was going to chop me down; Bennet caught hold on his arm, and said, take care of the sword, and twisted it out of the prisoner's hand: the deceased went out, and dapped his hand on the side of his belly, saying, Oh, I am stabb'd, I am kill'd, I am a dead man! his fingers were bloody, at the same time while they were struggling the candle went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe where the deceased's hands were.</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more instruments besides the hanger ?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, not as I saw: I believe the deceased had never a stick: I don't remember I ever saw the deceased or prisoner before that day: we secured the prisoner, and brought him down to my house; I left people with him, and went into another room to the deceased, he was sitting in a two-arm chair, and a surgeon examining the wounds: I could not see them then as I did when the Corner was there, then I saw four wounds on the sore part of his body.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner about it after that?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Cross examin'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did y ou observe whether there was a lock on the door?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the bolt or staple were broke or bent?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner and the deceased struggling ?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I cannot say as to that; I saw the prisoner on the deceased holding him back, and his hand up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Cutting's hands on the instrument?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, I did not: Mr. Bennet ran directly by me, in such a hurry, that I did not observe the deceased's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he held the instrument up to prevent farther mischief, or to chop you down ?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I think to chop me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be positive as to that ?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I will not be positive, I cannot tell a man's mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike ?</p>
               <p>Hughes. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell but what the extending his arm was upon Mr. Bennet's holding his arm up?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I cannot tell but that might be the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in that room before?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, I never was.</p>

            . I went into the prisoner's room with the last evidence: I observed the prisoner lying on the deceased, and his hand moving backwards and forwards: I observed something to glitter in his hand; I stopped down and said, he has got a sword in his hand: I took hold of him, and drew up his hand: I called out immediately, and twisted the sword out of his hand, as he threw it up. (The hanger produced in court. )</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased move his hands?</p>
               <p>Bennet. I was not so nigh the bed as to see that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner hold on the hist?</p>
               <p>Bennet. He had, and the other's hands were cut all to pieces with it.</p>
               <p>Q. For what you know, the struggle might be to strive who should have the hanger ?</p>
               <p>Bennet. It might for ought I know: I heard the officer demand the King's peace several times before.</p>
               <p>Q. In what position were they when you entered the room?</p>
               <p>Bennet. The deceased was lying on his back on the bed, the other leaning over him on his knees, half bent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wounds afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Bennet. I did, they were all on his left side.</p>

               <p>Bennet. When I first went in, the candle was alight, and till after I got the sword: I laid hold of the prisoner's cloaths, by the nape of his neck, and pull'd him from the deceased, when the deceased got up and said, I am killed, I am stabbed, I am dead; he went down stairs, and I went to the door with him. While I was gone the prisoner flung down Provost and Gosset on the opposite side of the bed: Gosset called for assistance, and I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160020"/> back and laid hold on the prisoner, and said, you have done mischief enough. While I was with him, on the other side the bed, the candle was put out, I cannot say how, or by what.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you imagine the prisoner was going to make a blow at any body when he extended his sword upwards?</p>
               <p>Bennet. I did imagine that, and no otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his Wife?</p>
               <p>Bennet. She was in the room after I had taken him from Gosset: she came from the fire-side, and took the sword out of my hand.</p>

            . About seven o'Clock I was at the Headborough's door along with him: he, Bennet, and I, upon hearing the dismal cry of murder, went up the stairs to the prisoner's room as fast as we could: the officer said to me; do you break open the door; said I, you are the officer, do you: I clapped my two hands with violence to it, but it would not open; then I turned my back part, and forc'd it open, and tumbled into the room: I saw the deceased lying on his back, and the prisoner bent over him, as if he was spitting a pig: With my fall I turned round, and saw the sword: I said, as I recovered myself, he has got a sword in his hand: the prisoner drew the sword out of the deceased's body; I saw it go up, and it seemed to fall again: I said to Bennet, catch hold on his hand: he made a blow at me, the officer, and all of us together.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he make a blow ?</p>
               <p>Gosset. By turning his body about.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade are you?</p>
               <p>Gosset. I'm a Weaver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wounds afterwards?</p>
               <p>Gosset. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the deceased had had the instrument in his body, I want to know whether it must not have passed through him?</p>
               <p>Gosset. I say I saw him, like spitting of a pig, stooping, moving forwards, I don't say backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see no struggling?</p>
               <p>Gosset. No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you talk French?</p>
               <p>Gosset. Yes, as well as I can English.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you in French expostulate with the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Gosset. I asked him how he could be guilty of killing that man? I spoke but little French to him, only to get him to the officer's house; then he struggled, so that the candle was knocked out of the candlestick.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his answer?</p>
               <p>Gosset. He gave me but little answer; he said, the man was a rogue and a thief; and that he, held his cutteau, and the man jumped upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he took the man to be a thief?</p>
               <p>Gosset. He might say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you swear before the Corner, that he said he thought the man to be a thief ?</p>
               <p>Gosset. I don't know but I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you contribute to the carrying on this prosecution?</p>
               <p>Gosset. The widow carries it on?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you contribute towards it?</p>
               <p>Gosset. We have assisted her to buy her some cloaths to go to the burying.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you contributed towards the carrying on this prosecution?</p>
               <p>Gosset. I have given some money to her and her friends?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall to the floor at coming into the room?</p>
               <p>Gosset. I did not fall, I made a sort of a stumbling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike at the officer and you?</p>


               <p>Gosset. There was a sort of an offer; his hand came downwards, somewhat falling, had it not been prevented; it came almost by my face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner and the deceased before?</p>
               <p>Gosset. No, never.</p>

             after he had received these wounds, on Sunday the 15th of December, about a quarter after seven in the evening; he was sitting in an arm chair, in a bent posture; I observed one on the left side of his belly; that wound appeared very small; I passed my finger into it, and found it went between the Muscles and the Abdomen; but did not pass into the belly; he was very languid, as if dying, which I could not account for from that wound; so ordered him to be stripped and laid down; I gave him a little pain, and nobody being there to put him as I wanted him, I told the people, if they would get him to bed, as I lived near, I would return; so I went back: I was fetched again, in about an hour and half, and examined him on the bed, and found another wound under his left pap, I passed my finger into it, and found it went between his ribbs; I found a great quantity of extravasated blood, that seemed to proceed from the loins on each side the back-bone; I perceived there was a blood vessel wounded, and the Abdomen was full of blood; I dressed both the wounds; there was another small wound on one of his fingers on the left hand; I observed no other wound at all: after the man was dead, the people described more wounds on his body, but I found it was only blood dried on his body, which with my finger I scratched off.</p>
               <p>Q. How deep do you imagine the wound might be?</p>
               <p>Milkward. I believe it might be seven or eight inches deep; it went thro' part of the loins and into the Viscera cavity downwards: it had let out most of the blood of the body into the cavity of the Abdomen; that wound was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that wound go upwards or downwards?</p>
               <p>Milward. It went rather downwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard what the witnesses have deposed as to the position of the two men on the bed, do you think that wound could be given while in that position?</p>
               <p>Milward. No, Sir, I believe it could not; I apprehend the wound given at that time was the other which was in the lower part of the belly, which ascended into the stomach.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it might not be done in struggling for the hanger?</p>
               <p>Milward. I think it is impossible it should; that which went into the stomach might be given as he was lying.</p>
               <p>Q. Which wound do you imagine most mortal?</p>
               <p>Milward. That which went downwards, not but the other in its consequences might have been mortal had not the downward been given.</p>

I am an apprentice of the deceased's; I came down in the morning about eight o'clock; I don't know the day of the month, but it was not long before Christmas, in order to light a fire, all the doors were open; I went into the shop to find a candle, and could not get by; there was the prisoner's candle standing in a little room by the shop; there I found the deceased lying, with her head under the bench, with a gown, one stannel petticoat, and an apron on: I went up stairs to a lodger, a Butcher, who lies in the prisoner's room, and I said, Oh, Lord! my mistress is dead! he came down with me, and saw her, and said, so she is !<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160024"/> Then we called in people, and they came stocking in like a fair.</p>

               <p>E. Dickerson. I believe he went to bed about half an hour after nine; I went to bed about ten, at which time I left two butchers below as merry as could be: I found the prisoner's cloaths in the parlour where the candle was.</p>

            . The prisoner said to me in Newgate, the day after Christmas-day, that when he was committing the murder, he saw the light of Monk's lanthorn, as he was passing by, thro' the slits of the door. We asked him in what manner he began this barbarous murder? he said, he first tied her legs; after which she asked him several questions, as, what business had he there? do you want to lie with me? saying, if you do, you are welcome; that he said, I don't want to hurt a hair of your head, mistress; then he desired the money she had got, and the keys to get some cloaths belonging to a baker that had lodged in the house, and is gone to sea; that she denied him very strongly, and said he should have no such thing; that then he began with violence, with one hand over her nose and the other on her throat: that this was below stairs, between four and five in the morning.</p>

            , a publick-house; there was Mr. Purchase, who said he would go and take the prisoner, if any body would bear his charges: I gave him orders to pursue him, and had instructions to tell him his charges should be paid. As we were arguing about going to Gravesend, there came a waterman, named Veal, who had carried him up the water to Billingsgate; he shewed us a hat, which was known to be the prisoner's, saying, the prisoner had bought a new one at a shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lewis. I had given him that old hat some time before.</p>
               <p>Hasler continues. We agreed to make a galley: and row after him; we did, and we went by all the Gravesend boats, till we came to the first, which we boarded, and there found the prisoner ; we put him into our vessel, and took a silver table spoon, nine half crowns, one silver buckle, an old chain, a crooked shilling, a silver groat, a silver two pence or three-pence, a bag of halfpence, and ten shillings and one penny in king Charles's farthings, out of his pocket; also a silver watch. I took a gold rin g off his finger. He had on his back a coat, green waistcoat, and breeches; which cloaths belong to one Cocker, who is gone to sea, and were pawned to the deceased for three pounds. He had also a piece of Holland, which we took. All produced in court. He told me coming up in the boat, that he asked for the cloaths and she denied him; that he then put his thumb behind her wind-pipe, and his other hand on her nose and mouth, and in three minutes she gave over struggling, and was quite dead. I carried the prisoner and things before Justice Berry, who sealed up all the things; when we took the prisoner out of the boat, he said I am glad I am taken, for I am weary of my life, and am willing to die. He produced a piece of waxed thread eight times doubled; this was about the woman's neck. The prisoner is a Shoemaker by trade.</p>

I asked him how he came to do the murder; he answered it was too late, he did do it, and that he was willing to die for it.

I saw her legs tied, but did not take that string off; that was with wax'd thread also.

Before the justice, I being a stranger, one said one thing, another, another; I was in liquor, I did not know what I said; I have lived in good circumstances, and have suffered hardship, that I did not care what became of my life; I desire any of the gentlemen would speak what they know of my behaviour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brown to the question. He has been an idle fellow; the woman's husband was a shoe-maker, he had worked with him; he always spent his money as fast as he got it; I have another indictment against him, and witnesses to prove the cloaths to be the property of Cocker, and the watch the property of the widow.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen the things last?</p>
               <p>J. Farrel. They were there when the prisoner came into the house, and I lifted the box the Sunday following into another place; it then was heavy.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you miss the things?</p>
               <p>J. Farrel. I missed them on Saturday was seven-night after they came: when we went out that time I was speaking of, he left word, if his wife should come he would be in presently. I ran out, and left the candle in the room, to get somebody to take him, there being nobody in the house; before I came again he had opened the parlour door and took the key and was gone. On the Monday morning following I went with a bit of the same of one of the gowns, and found it at Mr. Beesley's a pawnbroker in St. Martin's-lane. I found also a yellow petticoat, and another gown, at Mr. Frear's in Budge-Row. I took the woman and carried her to Justice Fielding's; there she confessed where the rest of the things were; that some of them were at another pawnbroker's in Aldersgate street. [The Goods were produced in court, and deposed to] I had observed, when they were at my house, the woman would carry things out in her apron.</p>

            . I am constable; on New-year's-day I was knocked up out of my bed to come to the prosecutor's: when I came there, they had got the prisoner in one of the boxes in the taproom: I said, what, Will, are you come again? I had carried him to Bridewell before; I thought your time had not been expired; said he, I was turned out yesterday ; said I, you look to have a better hat on than you had on in Bridewell; Mr. Taylor looked at it, and said, it was his son's hat; then the prisoner said, he took it out of a band-box up stairs; then Mr. Taylor began to feel on his apron, and said, what have you got here, this is my table cloth, where did you get it? he said, he had it from out of the kitchen; then he took the napkin from round the prisoner's neck; then the prosecutor asked him, how he could come here again; he said, he and two more men agreed in Bridewell, when they got out, to come and rob the house, and gave an account how they got in, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Mary Stiles. My husband's name is Paul; I keep a cloaths shop. On the Monday before Christmas, about eight o'clock, the prisoner came in with a pretence to light her candle, and, in a stumbling manner, lighted it ; I was backwards ; she and her mother lodged in my garret; she came to light it a second time; after that I went towards my counter, and saw it stripped of the goods mentioned, which were lying there before; I went up to her apartment ; I found her all alone there; she endeavoured to get as way, when she heard there was an officer sent for, in searching her, a person saw something on the tyles, near her window; I went, and out of her window I poked somewhat down; it was taken up below, and proved to be one of the linnen gowns. ( Produced in court and deposed to) I have found nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other person in the shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160029"/> between the time you saw the things lost, and the missing them?</p>
               <p>M. Stiles. There were none but one girl who came in with the prisoner.</p>

            . I went to Tyburn that day, to see the prisoners die; the deceased was there with his cart and horses: there was a sort of a skirmish, and the deceased was striving to get his horses and cart from the prisoner, and two or three more, who had got them from him: the prisoner would not let him have them, and the man that drove the horses threatened to knock his brains out, if he did not go about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Munday. This was at Tyburn: they took his horses by the head, and drove them where they pleased: they drove them down to Bay's-Water, a place beyond Tyburn, about a quarter of a mile, where they staid and drank, and from thence back by Tyburn quite to Tower Hill, with two of the dead bodies in the cart, which they left on the Hill; I saw them use the horses very bad; the prisoner had a hanger under his coat; I saw him pull it out when the deceased came to him, and cut him over the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this done?</p>
               <p>Munday. It was after they returned from Bay's Water, about 'ten yards on this side Tyburn; he went bare headed after his cart, with the blood running down his ears; I saw him following his cart almost by Nibs's Pound, that is on this side the Turnpike ; he went to a surgeon to be dressed, and I saw him no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Shears follow his cart to Bay's Water?</p>
               <p>Munday. No, he did not, the mob kept him back.</p>
               <p>Q. Who put the bodies into that cart ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160030"/>Munday. The prisoner and two or three more did, against Shears's consent.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you when you saw the blow?</p>
               <p>Munday. I was standing about a hundred yards off under the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people between you and them?</p>
               <p>Munday. There were not many; and I was upon a bank, I had a full command of the mob, there was a scuffle with other people with sticks, before the hanger was drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Munday. I had seen him many times before.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see the prisoner in the Gate-house since?</p>
               <p>Munday. I did, I went there to see a young man that was there, the prisoner wanted me to come in, but I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him there, that he was not concerned in this murder, but it was two other people?</p>
               <p>Munday. No, I never told him so.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it he was not seized at that time ?</p>
               <p>Munday. There was such a mob, no body would trouble themselves with him; there were near a quarter of a hundred chairmen and milkmen, seemed to be all concerned in taking away the cart horses, with the bodies.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner along with the deceased's cart and horses that day, driving them as far as Tower-hill; but I did not see the first beginning of it, I was at the execution and saw the first body put into the cart; there were several concerned in it ; I did not follow the cart to Bay's-water ; I saw the prisoner with the rest coming back from thence ; I saw the cart come back thro' the Turnpike and the deceased came after it with blood running down half inch thick; I saw the prisoner with the rest of the mob, at Tower-hill; I followed them, they put the bodies down on Tower-hill, and the constables came and took hold of the prisoner, also another, named Kit. Williams, they were let to go away again, the prisoner was taken up, which was a fortnight ago, and had before justice Fielding, he denied that he was at Tyburn that day; but when Kitt Williams came there, the prisoner owned he was at Tyburn, but said he had nothing but a stick in his hand.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner, and some more, put two bodies up in the deceased's cart, against the consent of the deceased, who said, gentlemen I hope you will be so good, as not to throw these dead bodies up into my cart; for I am obliged to go home about some business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them go towards Bay's-water ?</p>
               <p>Hilton. I did not, but I saw them coming from thence; they stopped at the Bridge, there lay one dead body; there was one in his cart before, then the prisoner and others threw that up into the cart, and away they drove; swearing by their Maker very much, how they would serve him if he did not lend them his horses and cart, he called them gentlemen, and begged and prayed to have them; they used him very ill, and called him thief; the prisoner was riding on the top of the copses ; he had a hanger under his cloaths, he drew it out, he swore by G - d, and other bitter oaths, if the deceased did not get away, and let go his horses, he would jump off, and cut him down; then he jump'd off and struck him on the right side of the head, close to his ear; after which the cart went forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Hilton. I have seen him carrying milk about the streets several times; I followed the cart to see what they would do; they drove to Tower-hill; there I saw one constable take the prisoner and anotherman; there were about ten constables after them, for laying the dead bodies on Tower-hill.</p>

               <p>Q. Explain yourself better as to time.</p>
               <p>Dawling. I can't tell the time exact, it may be about three weeks or a month ago. I happened to be in the Marshalsea, and the time went swiftly over with me, having nothing to do; when I was out I was obliged to leave my place, people came for some notes, I can't tell the sum; so I followed the cart in the road called Acton road, from Tyburn; to the best of my knowledge there were two horses. There was a boy about 21 years of age, in a livery waistcoat on one of the horses, and a man on the cart, and a tall thin man followed it. He on the fore horse made a stop, he went on again, the tall thin man pursued closely, he brought him too, the man was obliged by the crowd to come out of the cart; either by a stick or a whip, I am sure it was no hanger, I saw several blows given.</p>
               <p>Q. Where in the road was this?</p>

               <p>Dawling. It was on the other side Tyburn</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a hanger?</p>
               <p>Dawling. I did, but the blows were not given with that; I heard them say, they had a dead body in the cart: before they got to Tyburn they got another dead body, that makes two. The cart went down the road, and this man that had been bruised came with the cart all bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man dressed that had the hanger?</p>
               <p>Dawling. He had on a blue coat, and a dasz wig; his name is Burk, I know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it made use of ?</p>

            . On the 16th of Dec. in the morning, two men came from Summer-skey, and told us the warehouse of Mess. Burio and Spooner was broke open; we took the city gauger with us, and had the rum all gaged over, there were none of the puncheons had lost more than two gallons, except two, which we could plainly see had been bored in the head, one of which had lost ten gallons, the other five; one of them just dropt a little.</p>

            . On the 16th of Dec. between three and four in the morning, Green called me, I was attending the tide, waiting on the Gravesend boats, he said if I would go with him he'd put two or three shillings in my pocket ; he unlock'd the gate of Summer's key, went in, and up a ladder, and up into the buildings, (he is watchman to the key) Humphrys had the candle and lanthorn, the cellar was about half way in the gateway. Green pulled some planks up from above, and went down into the cellar, Humphrys followed, and bid me, I did; Green wanted a gimblet, he went up and brought something like an anger, and bored a hole, and filled a two gallon cag, and gave it to Humphrys ; then we went to the three tuns in Darkin's-lane, the landlord's name is Hyne or Hines; we went in, and asked if he'd buy any rum, he said yes, bring it in, he gave us 10 s. for the two gallons; he emptied the cag, then Green said, ask him if he can lend us a cask, saying, he did not care how big the cask was; he brought us out a cask that I believe held five or six gallons, (produced in court) we three went with it back to the cellar, and filled the two gallon cag, and the six gallon cask out of the same two puncheons; then Green said, I'll throw the auger into the bottom of the hole were we got down, and the people will think the carpenters have done it, for the auger belongs to them. Then Green took the two gallons, and Humphrys the cask, and went into White-chapel to the sign of the Green Man and Bell, and called for purl ; I fell asleep there and knew nothing of it, till Green was taken ; I had no money for none of the rum.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there such a person found in a pit?</p>
               <p>Lewis. There was a pit, it is not above a quarter of a mile from the place of my habitation, in Isleworth parish : on viewing the body, which was carried to the Stock house, we observed there was some rufflings on the skin, on the back part of the head, and more particularly a bruise on the side of the temple, the skin was a little raised, but I think not enough to cause a fracture, as the Surgeons call it; this was very particular, the body was found floating, some of my brother jurymen saw it, I did not; it is a particular pleasure to me to find out truth ; I had given my opinion, and we were unanimous before the Coroner, that the man was murdered, from that circumstance of the body floating, which we looked upon must have been committed prior to his being thrown in the water, concluding that where the suction is lost, the water cannot enter the body, from its being clos'd, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the horse?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I did not observe there was a horse found.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the saddle and bridle found ?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, my Lord, there was no evidence but the body of a man before us.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that pond always full of water?</p>
               <p>Lewis. It is sometimes full, occasioned by the rains, sometimes it is not so.</p>

The Justice then would not take his examination, thinking he was drunk: I took him to the house, where they gave him some good victuals and small beer, and the next day brought him again to the Justice, where he made the same confession he had the day before, without variation. He said, he was at work at his father's shop on a Saturday night, that he went out and lit of these two women mentioned, that they went to the Green Man at Hounslow, that when they went out there, they had no money amongst them all, that they agreed to rob some people if they could, that they met this man much in liquor, and he laid hold on the horse's bridle with one hand, and helped to pull him off with the other, that

            . I keep a public house in Hounslow ; I saw the body about a quarter of an hour after it was taken out of the water, which lay close by the pond side; there was no water came out of his mouth: he had an ugly wound near his temple. The prisoner, Saunders, broke my windows, so I had him before the Justice; when he was there, he said, he would confess what he had been guilty of, saying, he was guilty of murder; then I was ordered to take him to my house, where he had nothing but small beer and good victuals: the Justice ordered me to fetch the woman at the bar; I went and took her at the Green Man. At five in the morning I went into Saunder's room, said I, how did you sleep? are you easy in your mind? do you remember what you said? he said, I remember what I said, I have slept very well and am easy, and what I said I'll confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you look upon him to be in his senses?</p>
               <p>Godard. I don't think he is mad, he is a very dangerous man, and very wicked.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lighton. How long have you known Saunders?</p>
               <p>Lighton. I have known him between three and four years?</p>

               <p>Q. to Godard. What was the occasion of his breaking your windows?</p>
               <p>Godard. He came to my house with her brother-in-law, and had two pots of beer, and he did not chuse to pay for above one, upon which they broke them, and when I desired him to pay for the damage done, he came and broke more; I never knew he was disordered in his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Lewis. What is your opinion of him as to his being out of his mind?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Although he lives in the neighbourhood, I don't remember to have seen him above<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160035"/> three times; he is debauch'd in his morals very much.</p>

The two boys brought the ass to me at Hyde-Park Corner, and I bought it of them about nine in the morning, about five or six weeks ago; they said they had had her about two years, and used to carry sand upon her; But that is none of the ass this man has sworn to; he has swore to a great white ass with a long swish tail.</p>

               <p>Henley. No, he never opened his lips; I did not look him in the face : I don't know that the prisoner is the man that took either of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to be rude with you?</p>

            , a Smuggler; I have seen him pay him four and five guineas at a time; the first Monday after the heads were put on Temple-bar, I saw him there, I said, Blackcap, what do you do here; said he, I am reduced very poor, and said, he wished he never had been a rider with Henley, or any of the gang, and had it not been for a butcher, who had took him, he must have wanted : I eat and drank with him; we had a quarter of a goose at a little cook's shop near the Butcher row.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the heads put up ?</p>
               <p>Swinden. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see this Dixon afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Swinden. I went to see Masterson in Newgate, and being curious to see the cells, I saw Dixon there, I said Blackcap, is it you? I am sorry for it; he said, they have swore against me falsely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the year 46 ?</p>
               <p>Swinden. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Swinden. I did, when he lived in Hanover-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him in 46 ?</p>
               <p>Swinden. I cannot tell where he lived in 46; I have known him about five years; he has bought my goods for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any servant he kept?</p>
               <p>Swinden. I knew one Major that he kept about a year ago, there was another man used to come down to our house, when he has wanted a joint.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his name?</p>
               <p>Swinden. I used to call him Jack; it was, I believe, two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that his nephew?</p>
               <p>Swinden. It was not, I knew his nephew well</p>
               <p>Q. What was his name?</p>
               <p>Swinden. I don't know; I don't believe the prisoner would be guilty of perjuring himself ; and I really believe Dixon lived with him, as I do that I am here, but Dixon did not tell me where he lived, fearing I should tell Henley.</p>

            . I am a Brandy and Wine Merchant, I live in Thames-street, near the Custom-house; I have known the prisoner about half a dozen years or more: I knew him in Hanover-yard, I have dealt with him for meat divers times since the year 1746; his people came to my house with the meat, sometimes I paid them, and sometimes I paid him, when he came that way; I have been at his shop, and have seen a man at work in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been at his shop in the whole?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I believe three or four times in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I know no harm of his character.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or do you not believe from the character you have heard of him, that he is likely to be guilty of perjury?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I really cannot think he would be guilty of perjury,</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any other dealings with him besides buying meat of him?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him to give evidence in a court of justice ?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I believe I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you sure?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I think I am sure.</p>
               <p>Council. One would imagine he never gave evidence for you by your manner of speaking; was it for or against you?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I cannot say whether it was for or against, he was evidence once where I was concern'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Can't you tell that ; what do you believe?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I believe it was for me; I don't exactly remember whither he was suppoena'd by me or my adversary.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this ago?</p>
               <p>Gibson. It is some years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q. For what sum was that suit ?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I cannot exactly remember the sum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the jury give any credit to that witness ?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I don't remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live when you dealt with him for meat?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I said where I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever deal with him before he was witness in your cause?</p>

               <p>Taylor. Not above three or four times.</p>

               <p>Taylor. I can't tell, I saw one at his house which acted in the capacity of a servant; upon my word I never heard a bad character of him.</p>

               <p>Baker. He never wrong'd me of any thing, I have heard he has been a common-bail ; people have been to my house to enquire after his character, whether he was a sufficient man to be bail for people.</p>
               <p>Q. What answers did you use to make to such questions?</p>
               <p>Baker. I always answered, I believed him not a sufficient man for such purposes. I heard him once offer to swear himself worth 500 l. which is not a year ago, at the Judge's chambers.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have believed him worth 500 l. had he swore it?</p>
