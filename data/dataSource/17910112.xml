               <p>Gaffney. I do not deny that; I deny I was on board the hulks; I was on board the ship from this court.</p>
               <p>At first I think you said you never was in that situation? - I said I never was on board the hulks, but on board the ship; I forget the name.</p>

               <p>You have had no conversation at all with the prisoner? - No; I saw him in gaol this morning, and just spoke to him; I was here last night, and did not see him; but the prisoner knew I was here, because my master sent word to the prisoner that I was come to speak what I knew.</p>
               <p>Not one of this company was you at all acquainted with? - Not one, to my knowledge; I suppose there might be twenty or thirty round; my master knows the prisoner by using his shop, but I did not know him; I only came from on board ship last Christmas holidays; before that I lived at Stratford, at one Mr. Balcher's; I had been seven months on board ship: I had not betted at all myself; the prosecutor was there about a quarter of an hour before he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120008"/>offered to lay: I went in this morning to see if I knew the prisoner, and finding I did, I came out again.</p>

               <p>Then what business was carried on since? - I cannot tell; it might be a lottery-office: he was a very honest man; he always behaved so in my sight, at my house.</p>

               <p>Guess a little. - About a yard.</p>

               <p>You did not say before the magistrate, any thing I have stated to you? - No, Sir, not in the least.</p>

I went a little farther up the turning, and fell down, and got up, and cried stop thief! several times; when I got to the top, there was nobody nigh me; and then the people came out of the public house, and I went back and told my mistress; I lost sight of the prisoner then; I saw him at the justice's two days after; I saw three men before the justice, and to the best of my knowledge one was the same man, but I was not sure; that was not either of the prisoners; the prisoners are the other two men that stood at the end of the court; I knew them before; I did not know the other man before; I had known the two prisoners a long while; Solomons lived next door but one to my mistress, about a twelvemonth ago; I had often seen Humphries with Solomons, but I did not know his name then; when I went back, neither of the prisoners were at the end of the court; that was about half an hour; it was dark; I have seen the two prisoners together three or four times, walking up and down Shoreditch: I have lived five months with Mrs. Greville; and before that I lived with my mother at Mrs. Greville's, when Solomons lodged next door but one; when I went home, I said I had been robbed by Solomons, and the other, whose name I did not know, and by another man that snatched the bundle.</p>

               <p>Court. Remember the situation in which you stand, and take care you say nothing but the truth, in every respect? - I know the two prisoners; but that was the first night I had had any conversation with them for two years; that was the 4th of January; one of them I knew very well; I met them together by chance, the corner of Hog-lane, facing Magpie-alley; it was about seven o'clock; they both asked me whether I would go out with them a thieving?</p>
               <p>Court. Was that the first thing that passed between you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not you surprised at such a question? - We had a few words; but I never was out with them before, nor any body else; but their persuading me, I consented; and as we were standing at the end of Bold-court, the corner of Hog lane, this girl came past about nine; we were there about seven; and Humphries said, there is a girl gone by with a bundle, let us go and snatch it from her; and we followed her till she got very nigh Plow-yard; then we crossed the way, and met her; and I came round her, and snatched the bundle from her, and we all ran away to the corner of Magpie-alley; and Humphries took the bundle from me, into his apron; and we all went into Wheeler-street, where we examined the bundle, and found it consisted of three shirts; and we offered them to a woman for sale at a house on the left-hand side, that Humphries knew; and the woman offered us four and six-pence for them, and we would not take it; then we all went into Bishopsgate-street; there I went in and pawned one of the shirts for half-a-crown; and they two stood at the door; and Humphries and all of us went into Back-lane, a place where they live; and Humphries and Solomons went into a house with the shirts; they went up a court, and I stood at the end; I do not know the name of it; and Cook and another gentleman came by and took me; and I said I was waiting for somebody; and Cook went and took Humphries into custody; and Solomons ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Solomons. When Mr. Cook took me at night, did not you say I was innocent? - At first I did, because you told me to say so; but I owned the whole afterwards; I said, at first, Solomons was not with us, because he told me he had robbed the same woman before; that was directly after we had robbed the girl, as we were walking along; and if he should be taken, therefore for me to say he was innocent; and I not knowing what to say, I said so.</p>
               <p>Did not his father give the officers four guineas to get him made an evidence? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the officers say, if you did not swear against me, you would be hanged yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the other prisoner know me before? - Yes; they both lived in one house; the two prisoners were ten yards behind me, when I took the bundle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Humphries to prosecutrix. Did you see me, or was I nigh you, when the bundle was taken from you? - No, I did not; I saw him at the end of the court, with the other two.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you know that boy in the green coat? - No, Sir, I never saw him before that night.</p>
               <p>Do you know him now? - I do not know his face; I never saw his face; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120014"/>know his back; he is the person that took the bundle from me, to the best of my knowledge; it was about his size and figure.</p>

               <p>I was coming down stairs to get something for my supper; and coming along, Humphries asked me if I knew of ever a pawnbroker's near? and I told him, and went with him to the pawnbroker's, where he asked five shillings for the shirts, and they offered him three shillings; I was going to pawn a handkerchief for six-pence; and coming out, I went up stairs, and was going to bed; and I came down stairs to fetch a pint of beer, and Mr. Riley and Mr. Cook took hold of me; and they asked me if I knew any thing about any shirts? and I told them I saw a lad ask five shillings for two shirts, and he was offered three shillings; and then they let me go; and I went home and went to bed; and then Mr. Pirnell took me in the morning; and Humphreys and Archer said they knew nothing of me, and I had not been with them.</p>

               <p>You never saw the girl that night? - No, my lord, I did not; I tell you nothing but the truth.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 3, in Bridges-street; a hatter: I was standing at the door, between ten and eleven, the 14th of December; I saw Miss Dipple following the prisoner about two yards from the door; I had not observed the prisoner before; I saw her stop the woman, and the woman gave her the muff; she was about two yards from me: Miss Dipple said, Mr. Gent, this woman has stole a muff; I heard her say to the prisoner, you have stolen a muff from my father; and I conveyed the woman back to Mr. Dipple's back parlour, with the muff; the young woman had not laid hold of her; when she came back, I asked her if it was not a sin, at her time of life, to be guilty of such a thing, and the prisoner seemed to be very sorry, I thought, but answered nothing; when I came into the back parlour, she said she was a widow woman, and lived in Gray's-inn-lane; this was before the father was called down; the muff was laid in the parlour; she was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the prisoner appear to make any resistance that made it particularly necessary for you to take her to the shop? - Yes, at the shop-door she did; she struggled a little at the street-door.</p>
               <p>Was Miss Dipple with you all the time? - Yes, and went into the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Did you see any woman in the street waiting for the prisoner? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>(The muff deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not see this muff in the shop that day; it might have been sold; but I know it particularly by the damaged place; it cost me 22 s.</p>

               <p>I went into the shop to sell some skins; they did not seem to like to buy them, and I was coming out; the girl pulled me back, and called me a thief; and the horror of being called a thief at these years struck me dumb, and they pulled me to the back parlour; I had done no harm; he said I was an old offender; I never wronged man or woman.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to her character.</p>

               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. COMMON SERJEANT.</p>
               <p>Mr. Penton. My Lord, after having prosecuted this unfortunate man, your Lordship may perhaps think it singular that I wish to recommend him to his Majesty's mercy; I am induced to do this from circumstances that I own weigh with me, and I have no doubt will weigh with your Lordship; the candour with which the prisoner has behaved ever since he was apprehended, and the manner in which he has stood forth to do all he could to restore that property he had taken, is something more than the general conduct of a criminal in his situation; in the first place, it is necessary for me to say, that when first he went to the office, he was induced to make the confession he did, and he was then told the consequences very properly by the magistrate; he then was asked, whether he would make the confession; he did so; and, in short, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120019"/>stood in a manner convicted, from the testimony of some of the pawnbrokers; but yet, from the backwardness of others, it would have been absolutely impossible for me to have regained a considerable part of my property, had it not been for the confession of the prisoner; and I look upon him, in some degree, to have brought before the public, criminals equally guilty with himself; and in so doing he has made full compensation: what he could do, he has done; and therefore, although he is unfortunate, I flatter myself it may be his first offence; at the same time I flatter myself that he has not been so great a criminal as he appears in this Court: It is for that reason, and for that reason only, that I am to move your Lordship, that what I have stated may be laid as favourably as possible before his Majesty.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Penton, you may depend upon it this case will be reported fairly and candidly by the learned Recorder (who is not here at present), and that your recommendation will make a part of that report; what effect it will have on his Majesty, it is not for me to say: I, for one, after what you have said, can have no objection to your recommendation.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, the jury wish to join with Mr. Penton as far as they can with propriety.</p>
               <p>Court. Pawnbrokers, I see there is a list of no less than seventeen of you here; I am very glad, for your sakes and characters, that you have stood forth, in the manner you have done, to produce the property; it was not necessary to go into all that quantity of things, but you know very well it is your duty to deliver them all up; and I trust (I say it publickly before the learned counsel, who conducted this prosecution, as he does every other, very ably) that those pawnbrokers who have endeavoured to screen a man from justice, will have justice done them in their turn; and be assured, whenever men of their description come into this Court, and act improperly, the Court will take proper notice of them; because they know they have an opportunity of screening many thieves, and they know also that they have an opportunity of being of great service to the publick; and when they do so, the publick will be obliged to them; when they do otherwise, the Court will hold a tight hand over them; and therefore you must deliver the goods you have to Mr. Penton's servants.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Call Mr. Priestman. - My name is Priestman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I do not ask you a question, as I want nothing from you. - I am not ashamed of my conduct; I have done nothing amiss.</p>

I said, those were two of them; Simms said, good God! are you in liquor? they said no, they were as sober as he; then he said it was worse in them to behave in that manner, because they must be little acquainted with the laws of their country; had I done any thing, or acted any indecency with them, they should have taken me before a justice; for by extorting one shilling in the manner they had done, it would most likely affect their lives; and he said to me, Sharpe, have you at any time taken, or received, any indecent liberties with those men; I declared, as I do now, before the face of God, and my sacred oath, that as I hope to receive no mercy at the hand of God, that I never knew whether he was man or woman; they acknowledged that I had not; they said I was innocent; but they said every body knew that soldiers pay was very small, and money they must have, some way or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120021"/>other; with that, I expressed how unhappy I should be to take the life of a fellow-creature, and would sooner suffer than do it; I told them they were young men, they might live to be an ornament to their King and country; and begged, for God's sake, they would leave off this practice; they both expressed, Smith particularly, he was pleased to say, I spoke to them like a gentleman; Simms spoke to them nearly in the same manner; with that, I told them, that I would not give them a guinea, but if they would give this discharge, I would give them half-a-guinea, and no more; they promised to give me a written discharge; I said, my giving them this money, I should be pestered with Platt, who had been with them two before; Smith declared to God, in the most solemn manner, as God might receive their souls, that I never should, for Platt was down on garrison somewhere in Scotland; with that, I got change for the guinea, and produced the half-guinea; Templeman wrote this, and read it to Smith, and asked him if he was agreeable to sign it; he said he was agreeable to what Templeman was, and they signed it.</p>

               <p>I gave them half-a-guinea, and laid it on the table; Templeman would not take it up, till Smith said he was agreeable to take it; whatever he agreed to, he was agreeable to; then Templeman took it up; nothing more passed at that time; we went away; I saw no more of them that night; Simms was in the room at the same time.</p>
               <p>Now attend to the question I am going to put to you: Upon what inducement did you part with that half-guinea? - Why, Sir, if other things had been brought forward, I could explain more; it was fear of my character, and losing my bread, which they had threatened to deprive me of, if I did not give it: I saw the prisoner again on the 20th of October, a month all but two days, passing and repassing before the Queen's-head, during the time Platt was demanding to have the same sum given to him equal to those two, and which I gave him in that house, in the presence of Simms: on the 4th of November Smith was taken into custody; I took Templeman, and he impeached Platt and Smith; I do not think Smith said any thing before the magistrate; I am quite certain he is the man that was with me at Session's house; there was no creature in that house but us during the whole time.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears to me, from your evidence, that the giving the half-guinea was a voluntary offer of your own. - They proposed two guineas, and came to one guinea; at last, I told them, whether they would give me this discharge or not, I would give them no more than half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Court. But after they had publickly acknowledged to Simms that you were perfectly innocent, and they agreed to sign this paper, it was a voluntary offer of your own to give them half-a-guinea? - It was to let me go about my business unmolested, without any charge of indecent behaviour or unnatural practice.</p>
               <p>Was that the condition upon which they agreed to sign this paper? - It was.</p>
               <p>Then they would not have signed the agreement, unless the half-guinea was paid?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120022"/>- They told me they would not; that was the condition they made.</p>
               <p>You would not have parted with this money, unless they had agreed in future not to charge you with unnatural practices? - I should not, for I had been distressed before for two months.</p>
               <p>What was your idea, supposing they had made this charge against you, and that you had been brought to trial for for it, did you apprehend it would affect your life? - I did not know; they swore it would; they told me, two days before, that two was enough, but there were three of them would swear away my life; I told them my life was indifferent to me; that was on Monday the 20th, two days before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I sign my name to that paper? - You made that mark, I was present at the time, as I stand here before God.</p>
               <p>Court. And he consented to the acceptance of the guinea? - He did.</p>

               <p>I keep a green-stall, in Covent-garden market; and, in consequence of an application from Sharpe, I went to Mr. Sessions', the Northumberland-arms; the prisoner and another soldier (Templeman) were there, in the back parlour; I went in before Sharpe, to ask them if they did not want Mr. Sharpe, the porter at the carpet-warehouse; they said, yes; Mr. Sharpe came into the room directly; I arose up, and said, Mr. Sharpe, are these the two men that have extorted money from you several times? and he said, in their hearing, yes; then I said, gentlemen, what has the man done, that you use him in this manner? they immediately said, he knows; I then asked Sharpe what he had done to these people, whether he was guilty of any thing at all to them; Sharpe then declared his innocence, and the prisoner and the other said he was innocent; then he said they came with a letter from the Duke of York, and put the paper into my hand, and wanted to take him to the orderly room; and they then said, they were to have two guineas to take him to the Duke of York, at the orderly room; I do not know who was to pay him; I then asked Sharpe if he was willing to go; he said, with all his heart; they then said, the Duke would be gone, it would be too late; and they then agreed to take what Sharpe would like to give them; he said he would give them half-a-guinea, and he did give them half-a-guinea; I talked to them both a good while; I asked them why they teized the man so, and that they were young men; I asked them if they understood the consequence of extorting money, and they said my representation of their conduct had had an effect on them, and they would not go that way any more; they agreed to take the half-guinea, and to give Mr. Sharpe a receipt; I told them, if ever they came that way again, nigh-hand me, I should take them into custody. The discharge was wrote by Templeman; and I saw it signed by Templeman; and this prisoner, who could not write, put his mark upon it; I did not hear it read over, to my knowledge; I was very angry with myself that Sharpe would not let me take hold of them; and Sharpe begged and desired I would not, because it would take their lives from them: I am certain to the prisoner Smith.</p>
               <p>Court. If I understand you right, the proposal of giving the half-guinea came from Mr. Sharpe, and was not imposed upon him by the prisoner and the other man? - They said they would take half-a-guinea, and should lose a guinea and half by not taking him to the Duke of York; they proposed a guinea a long while, and then came to half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>The half-guinea would not have been parted with by the prosecutor, unless they had given him that discharge? - No, it was on that foundation, that they should not molest him any more; they said no other soldiers could come nigh him, for they were all draughted to go abroad: Sharpe opposed my taking these men into custody, in order to bring them to justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Simms, did you see me put pen to paper that night? - Yes, Sir, I saw you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120023"/>take a pen in hand, and put your mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Is the room divided into boxes, or is it one entire room? - It is one entire room; there is a table; I sat by the fire-place, and had a pint of porter; it was a back parlour.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I understood you, it was a piece of timber, or something like it? - It was a piece of timber represented: I cannot swear it was: I think it was.</p>

               <p>I am a baker and constable of St. Andrews, Holborn. I went with a warrant, and told him my business, and asked him what he had done with that piece of timber that he lately brought home out of Mr. Leader's premises? he said, oh, here it is, in a very careless unconcerned manner: says I, fetch it out, and he brought it out of his room, at the first door in a narrow passage behind the Pindar of Wakefield's: he acknowledged it to be Mr. Leader's property: I neither threatened nor promised him: it was on the 17th of December, about half past eight the same evening: the man was very sober, and in bed: he is a watchman whom Mr. Leader kept to protect his premises: Mr. Lucas was with me: I could not be certain whether it was the first or second door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Recollect all that the man said when he produced it? - He made a very slight value of it: he said he did not conceive it to be of any value.</p>
               <p>Did not he say that it was part of a common sewer in the parish of Pancras; that he thought it of no value, and brought it home to burn? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>(The timber produced and deposed to by Lucas.)</p>
               <p>It was formerly a coach-perch, and is not fit for any thing but to burn: I also found several pieces of leather, which he said was Mr. Leader's property, and he brought home to mend his shoes; and one piece of coach-leather, which he said he brought home to mend his spatterdashes, and was of the value of two and six-pence: and here is a tool which I am certain is mine; it is a spokeshaft.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120025"/>Mr. Garrow. I object to that: it is improperly laid: it is wood and iron, and it is called a wooden instrument: I could cite the case of Senior, in which I had the honour of very feebly assisting your lordship, in which the casements in the Temple were stolen: they were iron and wood, and they were described as iron.</p>

               <p>I have the charge of my father's house, at Stone Stairs; he has lost his eye-sight. I know the prisoner; I first saw him a few days before Christmas; him and his landlord, and the waterman, and another shipmate, had a pot of beer, and went away, and once or twice after. On Friday, the 24th of December, he came in about eleven in the morning, and the landlord was with him I am certain; they made no stay; he asked for the waterman; he went out, and I think he did not stay above half a minute, and returned again alone; he said he wanted to speak to me; I went into the back room with him; then he said, would I take care of his money which he had for his wages? I told him, yes; he said he was afraid of losing it in bad company; he took off his shoe, and put seventeen guineas into my hand, which he took out of the shoe; but it was not in a purse; I promised him to take care of it; he desired I would give it to nobody but himself; I said I should not, without his order, and he went away; I put the money up stairs in a purse; I saw no more of him till Sunday morning, much about eleven; he came and said, I want to speak to you; and I went into the same room; and he said, you shewed my shipmate a watch which I will buy of you; I told him he knew the price of it; and I brought down the watch, and he said, give me the balance out of my money; he said, three guineas out of seventeen, there is how much? I said, you know there remains fourteen; and I asked him if he wanted his money? I said, you had better take what you have occasion for, and leave the rest in my hands; he said, no, his captain had laid him a wager that he had spent his money, therefore he would just take the money in his pocket to shew to his captain, and bring it back at night for me to take care of; I went up stairs and brought down the purse I had put it in, and he took it, and said, good morning; when he got half way out, he turned back and said, he had bought a watch of one of his shipmates for half a guinea, which he wished to have cleaned, would I get it done for him? I told him yes, and he gave me the watch; I looked at it, and told him he had bought it very cheap; I said, I supposed as he had bought the other of me, he would sell that; and if so, he had better have a new face put on her, and some little alterations which I pointed out, which would make the watch sell much better, and cost seven or eight shillings; he then said he would have the chain of the old watch put on to the new; but he said, it was no matter, he would take it as it was, and left the watch in my hands; I saw him no more till I saw him before the justice on the Monday. On the Sunday night, Elby came, and I gave him the watch; I told them of the money, which they seemed to know nothing about.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On Sunday, the 26th of December, about six o'clock, a young man came to me and said, he suspected a man was guilty of the murder of the man and woman some time back; and he described the prisoner; I had seen him before, and I apprehended him with Forrester and Groves, at the Spread-eagle, Gracechurch-street; the stage was pretty nigh getting off; I went into the tap, and seized the prisoner; he asked me whether I was going to Portsmouth? Forrester and Groves came in; I searched the prisoner in a back room, and found on him, in his inside waistcoat pocket (I saw only two waistcoats; he might have three) thirteen guineas and a half: I searched him farther, and in the pocket on the other side, I found ten shillings in silver, and three six-pences, and a crown-piece by itself, in his trowsers pocket, on the right hand side; I had heard of Lacey's robbery, and finding this crown-piece, I suspected the prisoner to be the man that did this; and this watch I found in his other trowsers pocket, concealed, with no appearance of a chain; he said he gave three guineas for it; and on the other side was this watch with the chain hanging out; we brought him to Mr. Lacey, to the Black Horse in Goodman's-fields; neither of those watches were Lacey's; I had no conversation with the prisoner, nor heard any promise or any thing between Groves and him: I went to Mrs. Blenkinsop's, and found the prosecutor's watch; and the prisoner went with me, and shewed me where the purse was, under some bricks; I took it up; the prisoner said he did not break open the chest, but the person who did, had four guineas for his trouble; I never heard the prisoner say any thing about the money left with Mrs. Blenkinsop: the prisoner bore a very good character on board of ship, both from the captain and mate; his ship had not been up a week, therefore he could not have been the man that did the murder.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You have known this woman a great many years? - Yes, I suppose 18 or 20 years.</p>

               <p>Never understood to be so? - No.</p>
               <p>This woman lived in lodgings of her own till she came to your family? - I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Have you so good a reason for believing it as having visited her at her lodging very often? - I never was there above once or twice.</p>
               <p>How long had she been a nurse to your wife? - About five or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Your wife is an ancient woman, is not she? - Not very young, nor very old; not so old, I suppose, as sixty.</p>
               <p>Upon what terms was this woman invited to come into your family? - I met her; says I, do you know any body that goes out a nursing? she said, yes; for, says I, my wife is very bad; I want a woman of a humane good disposition; I shall be obliged to you; she said, I know a very honest woman; she sent her down; the woman was thick of hearing, and she could not talk to her; she sent her away; in the course of that time she came.</p>
               <p>She did not come with any express invitation of yours? - No, she did not.</p>
               <p>You did not hear her say she was afraid of being arrested? - No, I did not; I thought her as honest a woman as ever God put life into; I thought no more of her than I should have of you, if you had been there.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give her any of the things? - No.</p>

On the 6th of January, Thursday evening, about seven in the evening, I was going to St. Paul's-church-yard, from my house; a few yards before I came to the corner of Norfolk-street, where there is a pastry-cook's shop, I perceived a croud there, being twelfth night; I thought it most prudent to avoid that croud, being on the footpath; on stepping from off the curb-stone, I found myself pushed by several men, that I could not get off; they pushed me about violently; and from some words they uttered, I apprehended I was in the hands of pick-pockets.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you that the pushing was done by design or accident? - I think by design, and thought so at the time, and endeavoured to extricate myself; there appeared to be seven or eight, some behind and some before; but they seemed, as it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120039"/>appeared to me, to be particularly engaged about my person; one man in particular pushed me on the left shoulder, on the pavement, from the way I was stepping; I could but notice him; that was the prisoner; they uttered bad words of swearing, such as where are you going, and damn you, what are you about? I saw him about before; I cannot say he said those words, but he was among them; he put his shoulder against mine; I had my left shoulder that way, with his left shoulder; I found myself quite impeded going along, and found myself in a very disagreeable situation; the croud these men made, was a distinct body from those about the pastry-cooks; I was drove more towards the pastry-cook's; and I was pressed up between two men, much nearer the pastry-cook's than I was at first; I made an effort to extricate myself, intending to use a good stout stick I had in my hand; I drew it up, and found I could not use it; it was held by somebody behind me; there was a pressure upon it which disabled me; at the same time that I attempted to raise my stick, I felt my watch drawn from out my pocket: I can only say I felt it drawn suddenly in a very few seconds; I made an effort with my left hand to save my watch; and I caught it at the moment it was jerked out of my pocket, and held it with one hand, while some man held the chain on the other.</p>
               <p>Was it in fact taken out of your pocket? - Yes; I had it naked in my hand, and some man had hold of the seal; I held it fast; I suppose I caught it at the very instant it came out of my pocket; I am sure I did not secure it till it was out of my pocket; it was separated from my fob, before I secured it again; I cannot say I saw it in the hand of any person; the watch in the scuffle was injured; I pressed into the pastry-cook's shop as a place of safety; and I was standing at the door of the pastry-cook's; I found myself still pushed by the prisoner and others that I had seen before; and I held up my stick to strike them: I thought it audacious; I saw the people by whom I was surrounded, go off towards the New Church in a body; and the person I particularly noticed, went last; then I pursued my business: I found I had lost a silk handkerchief and some silver: I do not think the particular man I spoke of, took out the watch, or took the silver and the handkerchief; and going along, I reflected on this transaction: I thought it a great evil, and made up my mind to go and get assistance and take them: I went to get assistance; and going through St. Martin's-court, near a pastry-cook's shop, going to Cranbourn-alley, I saw those very men whom I met in the Strand: I think they were all the men: but this particular man was there likewise: I stopped for a second or two: they were walking to and fro: I perceived that man particularly: they were dressed in blue coats, made me know them again: I then went as fast as I could to Cranbourn-alley, to my friends: I desired them to take a stick a piece, and follow me, for I said I have been stopped in the Strand, and robbed; and knowing where the prisoners are who did it, I am determined fully to do it: the name of one is Mr. Hill; the other is

            : they are not here: we went to St. Martin's-court: I told them I should point out a particular man, as I was sure of his person: I again saw those men: I pointed out one man: he was about two yards distance: that was the particular man I have described; and I said, that is one of the thieves: that man immediately ran off through the croud, towards St. Martin's-lane: I made the observation quite aloud, that he might hear me: he ran towards St. Martin's-lane: I verily believe he saw me: he looked round, and darted off: I pursued him, and the persons that were with me: I missed him half a minute: then saw him again in Crown-court, and returned into St. Martin's-court again: I saw nothing of him till I came to the broad part of St. Martin's-court: I saw this very man again talking to a great number: they stood very near each other, and appeared to be talking: I took hold of this man's collar, and desired him to come along with me, for he was one of those that stopped me in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120040"/>Strand: he made no answer, but struck me a blow on the face, and knocked me against a stationer's window: at the same time I was assaulted by a great number of sticks, ten or a dozen: they beat me pretty sharply about the arms and shoulders: at the same time I was engaged with that particular man I have described before: at the same time my friends rendered me all the assistance they could, and knocked one or two of these men down, and took one of their sticks: I struck Wallis on the head, and knocked him down: he got up, and essayed to strike me again, and I struck him again on the arm: he then fell on his hands and knees, and crept under a butcher's bulk, and begged I would not strike him again: the patroles came up, and I delivered him to them: he was taken to Sir Sampson's and examined, the next day, and committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was that one man in particular, that pushed you to the window of the shop? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>That was the same man you afterwards apprehended in St. Martin's-court? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had you made any particular observations of him before that time? - No; they commenced then.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you at that time, from his general behaviour, to belong to the others that were about you? - Yes; he had that appearance all the time.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether he was or was not one of them that uttered those words you spoke of? - I cannot; but he was the most active person in the transaction, which caught my attention the more.</p>
               <p>He was the man that pushed against your left shoulder, and pushed you up against the shop-window? - Yes; he was the man; I have not the slightest doubt about it; if I had, I would happily decline giving that evidence; when it first commenced, there was no more than the common lights of the common lamps, when I was first assaulted; when I was pushed up nearer to the shop of Mr. Golden, a linen-draper, and when my watch was taken out of my pocket, I had still better light from the pastry-cook's shop.</p>
               <p>Then the man most active in surrounding you, was the prisoner? - Yes, he was; he had a much lighter coloured coat on than any of the rest; a lightish coloured drab great coat.</p>
               <p>Had you any opportunity of observing his countenance by any of those lights? - I observed his countenance particularly; he had a round hat; his hair was black, and tied behind; that I particularly noticed.</p>
               <p>You are sure this was a distinct body of men, to those that were assembled about the pastry-cook's? - It appeared very clearly so to my mind.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that you meant to point out as the person that was loitering at the door of the pastry-cook's? - That person, to my firm belief, was the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner at the bar the person, whom seeing loitering at the pastry-cook's shop-door, you thought of striking with your stick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you time enough, while you was at the door of the pastry-cook's, to make such observations as to know whether he was the person that first shoved you on the pavement? - Yes; I had time enough for that, and light enough for that; there was a glare of light there; the prisoner is the man whom I alluded to as one of the thieves; and he is the man who on hearing that, turned round, looked at me, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Is he the very man, whom after you had pursued and lost for a time, you saw again in the same coat? - Yes, he is the very man.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the man whom you then took hold of by the collar, and desired him to come along, telling him he was one of those that stopped you in the Strand? - Yes, I made use of that expression.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the man that made a blow at your face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was the man that got under the butcher's block? - Yes; I believe he gave charge of me.</p>
               <p>Now, upon your oath, and considering the serious consequence of the prosecution to the prisoner, have you any doubt? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120041"/>Consistent with the duty I owe myself and and the public, if I could possibly doubt it, I would express that doubt in favour of the prisoner: the enamel of my watch, I believe, dropped off in consequence of that scuffle.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced; the whole of the enamel gone.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I take it, on the out-set, that you mean to convey to my lord and the jury, that you conscientiously believe, without the smallest degree of doubt, that whenever you speak of the man as the particular man, that you mean the prisoner? - I do.</p>

               <p>How many minutes might the transaction in the Strand have occupied? - I cannot think of ascertaining the quantity; a very few.</p>
               <p>Such as two or three? - More than that; it was a very short time.</p>
               <p>And you was as every man in your circumstances must have been, in great confusion? - I was.</p>
               <p>No person who was in your company in the Strand, is here to night? - No.</p>
               <p>No person who was in the pastry-cook's shop is here? - No.</p>
               <p>Your two friends who assisted you to secure the prisoner, are not here? - No.</p>
               <p>The only persons who are here, are the two patroles to whom you gave charge of the prisoner, and who gave a charge of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In St. Martin's-court you observed two or three blue coats? - Several, I did.</p>
               <p>My lord asked you a question, which in the course of the examination we had not an answer to; that is, about how long it was before you went to St. Martin's-court? - I rather decline computing the time.</p>
               <p>About how long? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it half an hour? - More than that; I suppose it might be three quarters of an hour before I returned to my own house from the pastry-cook's in the Strand.</p>
               <p>In the course of that distance you must have passed and repassed a good many pastry: cook's shops? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And of course on a Twelfth Night, you must have passed a good many crowds of persons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On those nights I am told, that wherever there is a particular shew, there are mischievous boys marked in tacking ladies gowns and coats to posts? - That is very well known.</p>
               <p>And there are other mischievous things done? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>But there is a great throng? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe that it is a very common thing, I believe it is almost a universal one, for the pastry-cooks to have a constable at the door-on such nights? - It is very common.</p>
               <p>When you retired to the threshold of this pastry-cook's shop, as a place of safety, you thought the conduct of the prisoner was very audacious? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you make any alarm to the people of the shop, or the constable, or any body else there? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>In your way, in going to your friend's in St. Martin's-court, you saw the same man again? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long might it be after you had passed through St. Martin's-court to Cranburn-alley, before you returned? - I ran as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>The man escaped, and got clear out of your sight for some minutes? - Yes; and the next place I saw him in, was in this same St. Martin's-court.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in Russel-street? - If you will give me a minute to recollect; I purchased the lease in the month of May, in 1785.</p>
               <p>You lived there at the time it was burnt down? - Yes, I did, and lost a great deal of property.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole belonging to Sir Sampson Wright's office. Passing through St. Martin's-court on the 6th of January, about eight o'clock, I saw Mr. Hill and the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120042"/>in a scuffle together; I took him into custody, and took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was he searched? - Yes; a pair of gloves and a linen pocket handkerchief was found upon him.</p>
               <p>DANIEL M'LAIN sworn.</p>
               <p>Deposed to the same effect as Miller.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Hill. Whether before the magistrate you did not represent that you had been into the pastry-cook's, and did there say how you had been used? - I did not, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Jury to Patrole. Whether or no Mr. Hill was charged by the prisoner at the same time? - No, my lord, I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>To the other Patrole. Did you hear the prisoner charge Hill, the prosecutor, with any thing? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. When the patrole came up, I desired him in as plain a manner as I could, do you take care of this man, for he has been concerned in robbing me; and the prisoner said something to this effect, as do you take care of him; I will not say the words exactly.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any specific charge made against you at that time? - No, only what I have said; but the patrole did not notice it, as the patrole said.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I live in Great Wild-street. I was returning home from Mr. Giblett's, tallow-chandler. Passing through St. Martin's-court, I was beset by Mr. Hill, whom I now recollect, who took me by the collar, and said, you rascal, you shall go with me; I was very much surprised at such an expression from a strange man, who I never saw; and he on the instant struck at me with a stick of uncommon size; I endeavoured to retreat; and I think as well as I can recollect, it was at that time I received the blow on my arm, which hurt it very much, in defence of my head; and I struck him, and disengaged myself; I got from him a few paces, and stood to reflect why he should serve me so; and I saw a number of sticks engaged in a quarrel; and fearing this man might attack me again, whom I did not know, I retreated from the place the other way, not being able to pass that way without being struck; he pursued me into the broad part of the court; and somebody struck me on the head with a stick of uncommon size, which knocked me down; as I lay on the ground, he said, you are one of the thieves which stole my watch; then I suspected he had an idea that I had stole it; I got up again, and saw three or four of them coming at me with large bludgeons; there was a butcher's bench which projected about two feet from the window; and to preserve myself, I got under the bench, otherwise they would have killed me, I believe; I told them then, if I had been guilty of any impropriety, to take me to the justice, and not use me so cruel; I advised them to take me to the justice, which they did; when we came to Bow-street, Mr. Hill told the clerk I was one of the people who had robbed him of his watch; I answered, if that is the case, you had better search me; he said, you know very well you have not got it, but if you had had your desire, you would have got it. Gentlemen of the jury, if I am guilty, I hope God will inspire you to find me so; but if I am innocent, I hope you will be inspired to find me so: Mr. Giblett would attend here; he was here yesterday; he staid here till nine o'clock; under the pressing necessity of the death of a relation, he could not come to day; but here is a gentleman here who can tell the time I left his house.</p>

               <p>I am a watch-maker.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the prisoner at the bar? - I do, very well.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of him in the course of last Twelfth Day? - No, Sir, I did not; I recollect particularly the 6th day of the month; I was thinking you said the 12th day of the month; on the 6th of January, I was in company with him at Mr. Giblett's, in Cambridge-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120043"/>What is Mr. Giblett? - He is a tallow-chandler; Cambridge-street is in Carnaby-market.</p>
               <p>At what time did you first see the prisoner there? - About five, to the best of my recollection; indeed I am sure of it; there was a clock in the room, and I particularly noticed it; Mr. Giblett was in company with me and the prisoner; we had business to transact together; the prisoner continued in Mr. Giblett's house till half past seven; I recollect particularly that, because Mr. Giblett noticed to me and the prisoner, it was near half past seven; that he was going out to supper; we parted at that time, or within a few minutes of the time; I said to Mr. Wallis, as Mr. Giblett is engaged, we will go; we parted at Mr. Giblett's house; the prisoner lived in Wild-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields; I know St. Martin's-court, St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>How long would it take a man to walk quietly and leisurely, to St. Martin's-court, from Cambridge-street?</p>
               <p>Jury. About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure, that from five in the afternoon, of the 6th of January, till half past seven, the prisoner was not out of Mr. Giblett's house? - I am sure of it; he was not absent at all during the whole of the time we were engaged on business.</p>
               <p>Never at all out of your sight? - He was not; I have known him above two years in general, a very good character; I never heard to the contrary myself.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure you have not mistaken the day? - I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was the prisoner taken into custody? - The next morning; he sent to me, and I particularly recollected that he had been in my company the preceding evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live? - In Stanhope-street, Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Where did you understand the prisoner was going when you parted at Mr. Giblett's door? - He did not notice to me, but I understood he was going home.</p>
               <p>Which way did he turn? - He turned to the right.</p>
               <p>Was that in the prisoner's way home? - I was going a contrary way; and I did conceive he was going the right way home; I was going to Charlotte-street, to supper, myself.</p>
               <p>What employment does the prisoner follow? - I have known him in the capacity of an attorney's clerk.</p>
               <p>What attorney? - I do not at present recollect; I know he has wrote for attornies.</p>
               <p>Where has he lived during the time you have known him? - I cannot pretend to say, the whole time.</p>
               <p>Then you have not been much acquainted with him? - Yes, I have, but not going to his apartments; I have seen him in different companies.</p>
               <p>How long has he lived in Wild-street? - To the best of my knowledge, three months; that is the only place I have been acquainted with of his residence.</p>
               <p>Then you saw no more of the prisoner that evening? - No.</p>
               <p>Now he has lived three months in Wild-street, with whom, and in what house? - To the best of my recollection, it was a corner house; I did call upon him once; in fact, I met him at his own door, the corner of Wild-street; this corner near Duke-street; I saw him passing, at his own door once.</p>
               <p>Was you never in his house or his lodgings? - I never was.</p>
               <p>Of what sort has been your acquaintance with him these two years past? - I have seen him in different companies, and by that originally I became acquainted with him, in general in very respectable houses, at the King's Arms in Holborn.</p>
               <p>On what occasions? - Merely to spend the evening.</p>
               <p>By appointment, or how? - Casually.</p>
               <p>Which King's Arms in Holborn? - The King's Arms in High Holborn.</p>
               <p>How often have you met him there casually? - Three or four times a week; I frequently use the house myself.</p>
               <p>Was he never at your house? - Yes; he has called of me, at No. 2, Stanhope-street; I lodge there; I have lodged there three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120044"/>months; I have known the prisoner from having connections in the lottery; he has had connections in the lottery, when not connected with an attorney.</p>
               <p>Was that the commencement of your acquaintance with him? - To the best of my recollection, it was.</p>
               <p>Explain to us the particular business upon which you was employed at Mr. Giblett's that evening? - It was a lottery transaction.</p>
               <p>Describe that transaction? - The prisoner being acquainted with the lottery, it was in point of purchasing shares in the next ensuing English lottery; I recommended Wallis, he having had a connection in the lottery, to Mr. Giblett, and being an acquaintance of his and mine; the whole of the business was not determined that night; but it was to purchase some shares by Wallis, for Mr. Giblett's benefit; I was there about five; Mr. Giblett was at home; I recollected the next day, being the 7th, when the prisoner sent to me; after he was taken into custody, we were asking several questions; but we were not on that all the time; I took particular notice of the time by the clock; and Mr. Giblett pulled out his watch at the time; and there was a clock in the room; it is a back parlour.</p>
               <p>What sort of a clock is it? - I cannot describe it particularly; it is a high clock, about five feet high.</p>
               <p>Which side of the room does it stand in? - It stands fronting the door.</p>
               <p>And during all that time, you swear the prisoner was never out of the room, from five to half past seven? - I am perfectly sure of that, not only from the clock, but the watch.</p>
               <p>Are you a master watch-maker? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you relate this to the magistrates at Bow-street? - I did not receive his note till after the examination; he was at the

               <p>I keep an eating-house in Cross-lane, Holborn. I have known the prisoner about five years, a most just and respectable character; a very unspotted character, he has borne ever since I knew him, during the whole five years.</p>
               <p>Court. What has been his employment? - A lawyer's clerk; I cannot tell to who; and he has been a clerk to a licenced lottery-office; and during the recess of the lottery, he has been clerk to the lawyers; he has lived in Great Wild-street the latter part, I think about eighteen months.</p>
               <p>With whom? - With his father; his father is a shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three more witnesses who gave him an exceeding good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Brogden. During this time, from five to half past seven, what had you to eat and drink? - We had some brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Who supplied you with that? - A servant of Mr. Giblett's.</p>

               <p>Had you any more than yourselves? - No, no other person that night.</p>
               <p>Who let you out when you went out of the shop? - We let ourselves out; the shop was not shut up; the door was on the latch.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hill. As I understood you, it could not be later than seven? - According to my apprehension, I think it was about seven; I generally drink tea about six; and I waited a little time, and I set out; I apprehend it must be near seven; I did not look at my watch, or any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>You say you heard the parlour window open, are you sure it was down; how was it fastened, was it bolted? - I cannot say whether it was bolted, I am sure it was down.</p>
               <p>How long had you seen it before? - At about a quarter before nine that night.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you shut it down then? - I did not then shut it down, I do not believe it was up all that day; but I am certain it was down then, for I shut the shutters myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it possible for any body to come in and open it; had your servant been in? - She had been in with two children, to put them to bed; I heard a noise of the sash lifting up, and I told her to go up stairs and shut the doors, which I will explain to you what I mean; I keep a milk-cellar, and for the conveniency of my kitchen, I have a door made out in the street; on going out at the street-door, she saw the prisoner jump out of the window, and she called out very loud, and I came up stairs and saw the parlour window open, and a number of my things, which I have here, laying across the window, and before the window; they were dropped from the drawers, where he had taken them, across the seat that he had got out of, it is not properly a seat, but across the bottom of the window; it hurt me so much, that it rather made me faint away; I did not see this person come out of the window, I saw him at the watch-house.</p>

            ; we live in the same house: on the 18th of December, about one in the morning, I was disturbed out of my sleep by knocking and ringing; I saw a parcel of people in the street from the window, and understood my shop was broke open.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - I found a pane of glass broke, one shutter down, two hanging, and five or six candlesticks gone off the window.</p>
               <p>How was it broke, by wrenching the shutters down of the shop? - One quite down, two more hanging.</p>
               <p>It must require a degree of force to do this? - It must be force.</p>
               <p>Have you a locking-bar that goes across? - Yes, there is a bar that goes across, and these shutters had no bearing upon that bar, so they slipt it down, and broke the glass, and stripped the shelf as far on each side as they could reach.</p>
               <p>Was there more than one pane broke? - No more than one.</p>
               <p>What was taken out? - About seven pair of candlesticks; I cannot exactly say; there may be five or six pair of brass candlesticks, and a Prince's-metal candlestick, which is brass and copper with the metal; I inquired if they had taken any body; they said Mr. Hill, the constable, had taken one.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the shutters that night? - I did not go outside, but I had seen that it was safe.</p>
               <p>Was a pane of glass broke? - No; the pane of glass was whole.</p>
               <p>What hour was it you saw it last? - About ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>The window was not broke at ten o'clock, and the shutters to all appearance were up clear and right? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the shutters could not fall by accident? - They could not.</p>
               <p>You did not observe whether there was any mark of a crow, or any thing that had wrenched it? - I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. I understand your partner's name is Macgauran, hath no one got any share in the business besides? - None.</p>
               <p>You live in the house? - There are two houses, one lease; the one I live in, and he lives in the other.</p>
               <p>Are your houses so circumstanced, that only one house has an opening into the shop? - Both have it; there is a party-wall between both houses, but there is an entrance from each house into the shop.</p>
               <p>Do you pay your rent separately? - No, we do not.</p>
               <p>Where was Mr. Macgauran at that time? - He sometimes sleeps at a lodging he has in the country; he has not good health.</p>
               <p>Who arranged the goods in the window that day? - I do not know that any were put in that day; but they are cleaned once a week, and when there is a pair sold, they are replaced.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120048"/>Will you take upon yourself to say, that there were candlesticks in the reach of this pane of glass? - There certainly were.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Macgauran's servants sleep in that part of the house? - Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>He sometimes sleeps in the country, and sometimes in town there? - Yes, he does.</p>

               <p>Did you observe whether the shutters were forced by a crow or chissel? - I did not examine the shutters after I had got him.</p>

               <p>You said you saw the shutter taken out, and put on the ground; you did not see this man do it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>There was some person gone by that excited your suspicion? - There was.</p>
               <p>You did not see the window broke? - I did not.</p>
               <p>This man was taking the opportunity of that circumstance, of the window being down, and the glass being broke? - He was, certainly.</p>
               <p>You did not find any instrument about him that would enable him to do this? - I did not.</p>

               <p>I am one of the conductors, on the part of the patrole, under the direction of Sir Sampson Wright: on the 19th of July last, at about half past seven at night, I saw the prisoner at the Swan with two Necks, Lad-lane, where he was in the capacity of a waiter; I was desired to go there in consequence of something which had passed, I called for sixpennyworth of brandy and water, and it was brought to me; I will not be positive whether this was the waiter brought it to me or not: I sat there some time after the brandy and water was brought to me: when I went into the room, I met two people coming out of the room; whether they were the people belonging to the house I cannot tell, but I sat there some time, and could see nobody, not any of the waiters: after some time, I saw this person come to a cupboard; whether he took any thing out or put any thing in I am not positive; I then asked him for change for half-a-guinea, and to take the sixpennyworth of brandy and water; he went and brought my change for half-a-guinea, taking the sixpennyworth out of it; in this change he gave me two bad sixpences, two shillings, and a half-crown piece: I sat there for some time after that, not having an opportunity of seeing him come back again: it is a dark coffee-room: I sat longer, and had threepennyworth of brandy and water more; I gave him sixpence, and he gave me threepence.</p>
               <p>Had you any altercation about this money with him? - I had.</p>
               <p>Where did he take it from? - I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120051"/>know. On the 22d I went again, merely because I would be satisfied of the plan; I got there nearly about half past six in the evening; when I went, I called for a glass of Holland's; I had it; another waiter brought it to me; I then called for some tea; and in the course of that time this waiter came; I had some other liquor after, and my reckoning came to one and eight-pence; it was near eight o'clock when I called for it; I gave this man half-a-guinea to change; I laid two on the table, and told him they were weight, but he would take which he chose; he said it was immaterial which, it was not much consequence; he took the change out of his waistcoat-pocket; he gave me my full change, and I gave him back 1 s. 10 d.; 1 s. 8 d. for the reckoning, and 2 d. for himself, and I came away; at that time he gave me three bad shillings, and four bad sixpences; I only informed Mr. Clarke of it; I did not apprehend him; Mr. Townsend apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You did not, on either of the occasions, object to any of the money? - Yes, I beg your pardon, I objected to a French half-crown, and he changed that.</p>
               <p>Was the second time as dark as the first? - No, it was not; it was an hour sooner.</p>
               <p>And later in the year? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This man was indicted in September sessions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he came to be tried in October sessions, but the bill of indictment was thrown out; and in December sessions you preferred a new bill against him; the first bill was for uttering to you and others, I believe; do you know how many under-waiters there are at this house? - I do not know; I saw two; one was a waiter; I do not know as to the other.</p>

               <p>How came you to take so many pair in of this man? - He had the appearance of a hair-dresser; and he said at first bringing of the shoes, that he dressed two gentlemen who were partners in a shoe-ware-house, and that they always paid him in goods, and that was how he came by them.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that you ought to put down the name of the owner? - He pledged them as his own property, and said he was a master hair-dresser, and that he lived in Slop-alley, in Holborn; I had confidence in what he said.</p>
               <p>Court. Great confidence indeed you gentlemen must have, to suffer a man to come with five and twenty pair of shoes, from September to January? - I did not know I had so many; and seeing I had so many, made me make farther enquiry.</p>

On Wednesday, the 12th of January last, I had some clothes drying in a garden at the bottom of a grass-plat; on going out of my own house, I observed one part of the clothes lying on the ground; I went a little farther, when I observed that the prisoner at the bar had that moment either cut or pulled the line down from the post, by which means the whole line of clothes was down; immediately as they were down, he began at the end of the line at which he stood, gathering up the clothes, walking along as he picked them up; upon seeing me, he ran to the corner of the garden; he ran about eight or ten paces with the clothes in his arm, and threw them down over some palisades; from thence he jumped over into the turnpike road; and I pursued him, and took him back into the garden where the clothes were, and asked him why he put them there? he denied being in the garden; I desired my servant to take care of the clothes; and I took him to the watch-house, and gave him to the care of the constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you lose sight of the man, before you took me? - It is impossible, from the situation of the place, but what I must; but I only lost sight of him while I opened the front gate; I am positively sure that is the man; there was no one else in sight whatever.</p>

               <p>Mr. Desormeaux. I am positive it is the same.</p>
               <p>Read.</p>
               <p>"Plese to send by the bearaer, 8 pound of that wharpe nunmarked. L. Desamoacks."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There is no direction upon it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Purser. You can read, madam, cannot you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And previous to the time you delivered this silk, did you read it over? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you make any sense of it? - It is plain enough for me to understand; unmarked, is without the threads round it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Can you read writing yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now do you think that is Mr. Desormeaux, or Mr. Desamoacks? - I did not know how Mr. Desormeaux spelt his name; if I had been so particular to examine every thing, I should not have given it him; but by this he got it.</p>
               <p>Then you did not think it came from Mr. Desormeaux? - Yes; he told me so, and I thought so.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120062"/>Would you take that to be Mr. Desormeaux's name? - Yes, I would, because I am ignorant as to the spelling of his name.</p>
               <p>Did you look attentively to the spelling of his name, before you gave it? - I did not particularly attend to the spelling of the name.</p>
               <p>Would you deliver it on such a note now? - Yes, I should deliver it on a note.</p>
               <p>Therefore you trusted to his representation of it? - Yes; the note convinced me that he was sent for the silk; it was a perfect satisfaction to me, till he got out of the house.</p>
               <p>In short, you did not pay much attention to the note till he went away? - I looked at the note, and saw it was as he said; I did not trust to what he said; I gave it on account of the note.</p>
               <p>Do you know young Mr. Desormeaux? - Yes, I do know him.</p>

My lord, there has been afterwards cases which have been of this sort: an order directed to the person holding the possession of goods, as coming from the owner of those goods, the person having a real property in those goods, but the order signed by the owner. My lord, I submit the prosecutor must go this length to bring this case within the construction of the act of parliament; he must go the length of putting a sufficient charge of that sort on the record; that that order does come from a person, purporting to be the owner of the goods, and to have the disposal of them; now this order, which is expressly shewn on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120064"/>the record, not to come from the real owner of the goods, does come from some person who stands within the situation of the owner; there they fail; first the indictment itself shews, that the property is in the father; next the indictment shews, that the person giving the order, is not the owner, but some other person, but a servant; to bring it within the construction of the act of parliament, they should have established this in evidence; supposing the indictment to be correct; that this servant was a servant sui juris; that he gave orders; that all persons acquiesced with his orders; and that his orders were in the usual course of business, and paid as much attention to as the master himself. I submit, my lord, that there is no evidence of the situation of the person himself, as an apprentice only, and under the command of the master; the father has not said, and no servant acting in the house has said, he was in the habit of giving orders, and that the tradesmen were in the habit of receiving orders.</p>

My lord, the next point which I think bears a great deal stronger against this case, than any one I have mentioned yet, is to the form of the indictment likewise: I take it the regular form of the indictment should have been, that the person did publish a certain order, purporting to be an order for the delivery of goods, signed so and so, against the statute: I take it, that the prosecutors, by their extreme caution to bring this particularly within the bearing of the law, have overshot their mark, and rendered this indictment insufficient; they have gone out of the regular form, and indicted him this way: that the owner of the goods was in possession of such and such goods; that this defendant, well knowing these facts, did present an order, purporting to be the order of the servant to the holder of the goods, to receive the goods; that the prisoner was then a servant; having so particularly put it; it has not gone on to state that that servant was the servant empowered by the master, to give and deliver such orders to persons to deliver those goods; thefore they have gone out of the regular form of the indictment, that he did publish such an order as described; who has done this as described? that it is done by a person being a servant; that is averring that the servant had an authority. Now if they had left it generally as an order for the delivery of goods, signed so and so, and then put it upon evidence, whether such an order was an order within the act of parliament; then it must have fallen, or not, within the construction of the act of parliament: they have said it was by a person having particular authority, and have not stated that he had a complete authority; if they had confined themselves to general terms, I could have had no objection, except that the evidence did not apply to the construction of the act of parliament; but in this case there is a defect in the indictment, of which I am entitled to avail myself, in point of form, so far as may be to the benefit of my client.</p>

My lord, on the part of the prosecution, I beg leave to observe on the objection, which beyond all question, if it had the best of all foundations for an objection, a foundation of fact, would have been one to which I am quite unprepared to give any answer, namely, that if this was so decidedly in the nature of Mitchell's case, that the person whose authority this was, had no authority over the goods; your lordship has relieved me of that, by observing that this person had an authority. There is a very remarkable expression in the decision of the judges, in some of those cases which my learned friend has seen, which he did not state; that the person giving the order, ought to possess some interest in the goods, or disposing power over them. It is enough; for bringing this out of Mitchell's case, and bringing it into Jones's case, that the person claims to have a disposing power, not for his own benefit, not sui juris, but a disposing power; then beyond all question, Mr.

               <p>Mr. Garrow. There is Lockitt's case, which was of the same sort:</p>
               <p>"Please to pay the bearer ten guineas." It was said, this does not assume to be an order for the disposition of it, and looks like a request to be favoured with something; it is not an order to dispose of it, or any authority to alter the possession of the thing. In Mitchell's case, it did not proceed on that which my learned friend has said, but it was only a ticket, authorising a pauper to receive a certain thing. There was a case of Jones, which was in October sessions, 1764, before the late Lord

This was the case of a work sent to be assayed; this was the ticket to deliver it: first, it was not addressed to any body, nor in the indictment was it said to be addressed to any body; but in this case, the question is, does this purport to be the order of Mr. Desormeaux? if it does, then the fact is made out to the satisfaction of the jury; is equally a forgery, and equally made good by these statutes.

               <p>My lord, if you consider the extreme mischief in all the banking houses, in all the manufacturing towns, who carry on the greatest part of their business by their foremen, and in goods to the amount of many millions of money in the year; they are transferred from hand to hand, by the foreman; still the party whose name is purported to be forged, had not a disposing dominion of the goods transferred; and we know how many of those things are transferred by tickets with initials; and we know how many by hieroglyphicks. My lord, on the subject of the name, you have only to be referred to a case, in which it has been determined, that if you forge another man's mark, with intent to defraud him, that is as much a forgery, as to forge his name. The indictment charges, this was intended as a forgery of Mr. Desormeaux's name. Then there is a very formidable objection to the form of this indictment; for it seems it has stated a little too much, and a little too little. My learned friend agrees, in the common form, that it would have done; but he says, inasmuch as I have added to the name of

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Therefore, my lord, it is the offence of forging that warrant and order of a servant of a particular name, purporting to be the servant of the owner of the goods; therefore I contend, my lord, that this is a forgery; it is certainly the exhibition of a false token; I say this appears to be a forging an order for the delivery of the goods for the proprietor; therefore I shall add this to it, that that servant was authorised by the proprietor, to give such orders for the delivery of the goods.</p>

               <p>RESPECTFULLY returns his most grateful Thanks to his Employers and Pupils, for the Preference they have thought proper to give to his Mode of teaching and writing SHORT-HAND, which he flatters himself is at once as concise and correct as any other System; he continues teaching in four Hours, by four Lessons, the whole necessary instructions in this much approved Art. He also takes Trials and Arguments with the utmost Care, which are copied so expeditiously as to be sent home the same Evening, if required.</p>
               <p>A new Edition of his TREATISE ON SHORT-HAND, AND CONTRACTIONS adapted to every System, with Copper-plates, is just reprinted, Price 5 s. with considerable Improvements; and Sold by

               <p>Letters (post paid) from Purchasers of either of his Books, directed to Mr. Hodgson, No, 14, White-lion-street, Islington, will receive immediate Answers; and all Orders from Gentlemen in the Profession of the Law, and others, immediately attended to.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen who send in haste to Islington, are requested to send a Porter, and not trust to the Stage or Penny-post.</p>
               <p>N. B. As many Gentlemen who have taught themselves Systems of Short-hand, not formed on this plan, and wishing to exchange them, have found the Attempt too embarrassing; Mr. Hodgson has recently succeeded in introducing the peculiar Brevities of his System into others, without altering the Alphabets, and has found the Practice (though novel) perfectly easy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson has a compleat Set of Sessions Papers, for the last ten Years, to dispose of at the usual Price; or any person wanting any particular Trial, may have a Copy at Six-pence per Folio.</p>
